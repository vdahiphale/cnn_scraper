In a ruling, the court said it will instead debate the law in September.Israel's parliament says the law, which strips the High Court of some of its power, has officially been published in the records and has now entered into force. Multiple groups have filed petitions to throw out the law. CNN's Hadas Gold joins us from Jerusalem. I mean, we're in the weeds here on this, but ultimately, it has at least temporarily avoided a constitutional crisis.",

      "sentences": "Well, it just delaying it until September. But mainly what this means is that this law, which stripped away the Supreme Court's ability to block government actions or decisions, if the Supreme Court says that they are unreasonable, strips that power from them and now this law is enforced.This means that if the government wants to take on any sort of action, if the Supreme Court has lost that ability to block that action by declaring it unreasonable. Now, several petitions had been immediately filed as soon as this law had passed. The Israeli Parliament on Monday asking -- some had asked for a temporarily freeze, but also for the Supreme Court to hear and debate, this law debate petitions on this law. That injunction obviously has not been granted. Now, we do know that actually the Supreme Court, several of the senior justices, including the president, they were actually in Germany on an official trip. They cut that trip short to immediately rush back to Israel in order to hear those petitions. Instead, this will be a full debate in September. This is after the court's recess, and it's still setting everything up for potential legal constitutional crisis. Now, Israel has no written constitution. It has a set of basic laws that sort of form up a quasi on a written constitution. And this law is actually amending one of those basic laws. Now, the Supreme Court has never nullified a basic law. It's discussed basic laws, but has never nullified them. And added to that is the fact that they would have to be hearing and ruling about their own party or about their own power, which will set up a very interesting battle. So essentially now, though, the law is enforced. Now, there are some critics of this law are fearing that one of the first actions that this government may take might actually be targeting the Attorney General of Israel. The Attorney General of Israel a little bit different than in other places like in the United States. It is an independent sort of legal role, not somebody who's necessarily on the side of the ruling party in government at all times. And this particular Attorney General has clashed with Benjamin Netanyahu's government. She's been a fierce critic of the judicial overhaul and she is overseeing Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial. Now I should note Benjamin Netanyahu has decried his corruption trial as a witch hunt and has denied all the charges against him. But the critics of this law do fear that now she will become a target, because before this law passed, it would have been much harder to fire her. The Supreme Court could have blocked that decision. Now they fear the door is open for her to be fired. Max?",

In Algeria, wildfires have claimed at least 34 lives. Local media report people in 11 provinces had to evacuate. However, officials there say the fires are now contained. Southern Italy and Sicily are facing fires as well. Four deaths there are blamed on the fires. Temperatures are expected to dip, but climb again by the weekend. And firefighters in Portugal have rushed to the resort of Cascais to battle a wildfire there. High winds are managing to make the task a lot more difficult. Let's get an update on the fatal fires in Italy with our Nada Bashir. Nada, thanks for joining us. I mean, it is spreading, isn't it? And without rain, there's always going to be a risk of fire because it doesn't really matter about the temperatures. It's that dryness of the land that's a real problem.",

You showed some video a moment ago leading up to this weather hit talking about Milan, and we actually had a reading there of 110 kilometers per hour.That's just shy of a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane. It wasn't a hurricane, but it was strong winds that brought down those trees and toppled the power lines. And also this is interesting as well in northern Italy. They had reports of hail in excess of 10 centimeters. There was one report that's still being cooperated of a 19 centimeter hailstone that fell from the sky. That rivals some of the largest hailstones ever recorded coming out of South Dakota. That is just incredible. Think of it, it's like a soccer ball literally falling from the sky. Here's some of the imagery of the hail coming out of northern Italy and that really piled up and accumulated very quickly in the streets there. The other big story, of course, the record temperatures. This is really confined to the southern sections of Europe, particularly across the Mediterranean, and that is where we are tracking wildfires. You see all these wildfire hotspots. Here's Sicily, here's Corfu, the island of Corfu off of Greece coast. And then here's Rhodes. We're monitoring these closely because these wildfires continue to approach populated areas. Copernicus, the European climate monitoring agency came up with this incredible image. Look at the wildfires burning on the island of Corfu in Greece. You can see them tumbling down the hillside towards the coastline there. This is amidst record breaking temperatures across the south. Athens at 37 degrees today. That is about 5 to 6 degrees Celsius above where we should be this time of year. Some relief, but as they mentioned in the report before me, you know what? You don't need the temperatures really to be the factor. It's really the dry, dry air mass that's in place that's igniting these wildfires or helping ignite the wildfires. So with that collision of air masses, cooler weather to the north, the heat to the south, we get the chance of severe weather once again. And for the day today, we're monitoring the potential for more tornadoes, more strong wind gusts, and large hail, Max, across the Balkans, extending all the way into southern Russia.",

The U.S. Secretary of State says that it shouldn't affect negotiations over two other Americans who are wrongfully detained in Russia, but one U.S. official acknowledged there are concerns the revelation could stand to complicate those efforts.

      "sentences": "Well, Max, the initial reaction from the administration has been to emphasize that Trevor Reed was acting of his own volition and not on behalf of the U.S. government. That's really important in their minds because they need to emphasize to the Russians, of course, that after getting Trevor Reed out in a prisoner swap back in April of 2022, they didn't just send him to the battlefield in Ukraine to fight against Russian forces, right?So they have emphasized that this is not a U.S. government operation, that he was fighting there as a private citizen and, of course, reiterating to U.S. citizens that they should not go to Ukraine at all, let alone to participate in the fighting there. Now, of course, this is a bit of an awkward situation for the administration because, as I said, he was released as part of a prisoner swap in April of 2022, where the U.S. actually released a convicted Russian drug smuggler back to the Russians to get Trevor Reed, who is a former Marine back home. But Reed, he was on our air as recently as May. He was tweeting in late June. So it appears that he traveled to Ukraine sometime over the last several weeks to a month, and he was injured there, we are told. He was then transported to a hospital in Kyiv and then he was evacuated by an NGO to a military hospital in Germany. And so, the administration here really seeking to drive home that they have not played a role in any part of this and emphasizing that, yes, there are concerns potentially about how this could impact ongoing negotiations with the Russians to get other Americans who have been detained there back home. But also saying that these two issues need to be treated completely separately because, again, they say they had absolutely nothing to do with Trevor Reed going to fight with the Ukrainian military there in Ukraine, Max.",

He's expected to arrive in just under two hours from now. And this is when he will plead guilty to those two tax demeanor charges for not paying taxes on more than $1.5 million in income for the years 2017 and 2018.He also resolved the gun charge that was a felony possession charge of having a gun well addicted to a controlled substance. And Biden has been very public about his issues with cocaine. So what we expect to play out today is that the judge will then hear from the prosecution exactly what these crimes are, that Hunter Biden's pleading guilty to. The gun charge is going to be resolved where it will be through what's known as the diversion program, and that Biden will not face any jail time for that if he abides to certain perimeters that are defined by the court. Now, the judge here will also ask Hunter Biden questions. That's when we may hear what he will have to say if he responds to the questions that the judge poses. It's unclear if he's going to make any broader statements in court, but this will be the opportunity for the judge to ask him about the crimes that he says he committed and will be pleading guilty to. Now, this judge is a Trump appointee, although she was confirmed unanimously in a bipartisan way by the U.S. Senate. You know, it's unclear how long this hearing will last. They usually don't take too long, but as you said, there were some hiccups overnight in this case, so we're waiting to see how that will also play out.
