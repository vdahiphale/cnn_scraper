I wouldn't necessarily discount that possibility the way the market has moved. That is the market. Those are the indices and the main events that we're watching for you: A united front against Russia. Western allies are announcing plans to send more than a hundred tanks to Ukraine. Microsoft has a gloomy outlook and that has deepened recession fears. And former Governors of Israel's Central Bank openly oppose Netanyahu's plans to weaken the power of the country's Supreme Court. We'll talk about that with one of them. We all live in New York. It is Wednesday, midweek, it is January the 25th. I'm Richard Quest and back in New York, I mean business. Good evening. The West will arm Ukraine and go from defense to offense, at least that's the result of decisions taken as Germany's ruling party says Allies will send around 80 Leopard 2 tanks to the frontlines, machinery specifically designed for an offensive campaign. These are the weapons that Kyiv wants to reclaim territory it has already lost. For months, Berlin had blocked the Leopard 2's fearing escalation with Russia. Today, Chancellor Olaf Scholz finally agreed it was time to free the Leopards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): Our goal is to quickly provide two armored battalions. There are many countries that are willing to supply and we will coordinate this, involve them so that this will be possible step by step. Germany, as I said, will provide Leopard 2 A6 tanks which will come from the stocks of the Bundeswehr. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And while US officials were very clear, for all the reasons you laid out, for all the reasons Nick laid out, they didn't believe the M-1 Abrams tank was a viable option here in terms of the battlefield conditions that they were facing. They understood that was how to reach the outcome. If you want to put it bluntly, one US official made clear to me earlier today, this is about the Leopards. Period. End of story. This was not about the year, maybe potentially a little bit shorter in terms of getting the M-1 Abrams tank there, and the only way they felt like they could get that done and it was made pretty explicit behind the scenes was to give a US commitment on those 31 Abrams tanks. That's where they landed. And the reality is right now, despite the long time horizon, what they care most about is how quickly they can get those Leopard tanks in.",

But that doesn't mean that there's nothing the Russians can do and we've already seen some reports of Russian financing as far-right Spanish group to try to assassinate some Spanish leaders. We've seen some cyberattacks against Polish logistics companies in the Defense and Military space. We did just recently see an explosion of a pipeline on the Latvia-Lithuania border. We don't have any explanation for that. I'm pointing to these as data points in terms of the war expanding potentially beyond Ukraine as the Russians have so little they can do on the ground in Ukraine. And keep in mind, Richard, that the Russians see this very much as a proxy war against NATO. The reason they are losing against Ukraine, the reason they're being humiliated is not just because the Ukrainians are courageous, though they are, but because NATO is providing such staggering amounts of training, intelligence, and military equipment, which continues to escalate pretty much every week.",

From her perspective, massive amounts of support for White European Ukrainians from the United States and from the West, and how much support would the US provide in all sorts of other conflicts that have deep humanitarian implications for innocents on the ground, but don't seem to be as strategically important for the for NATO, for example? And so what we're seeing is not just from South Africa. We saw President Lula recently elected in Brazil blaming the United States and NATO in part for the war in Ukraine. We've seen some of that even from Mexican President AMLO. We've certainly seen a very neutral position from the Indian Prime Minister, who is now buying 33 times more oil from Russia than they were before the war started. Why?

This is about the West, and we're deeply unhappy and dissatisfied with the way that's been framed. So NATO is together, NATO is stronger, meaningfully stronger than it was 11 months ago, much more military spending, expansion coming on the books, certainly with Sweden, probably -- certainly with Finland, probably with Sweden, and also forward deployments. The G7 is stronger, the United States with its European allies, and its Asian allies, the Japanese are doubling Defense spending. They have a major border with Russia, too.

And so that's been sort of interesting to watch. As you say, once you're under oath, things might change a little bit. Musk has made a number of arguments this week, mainly that his tweets don't necessarily affect Tesla's share price.

It's something that shareholders are going to be watching really closely. The company is expected to report a recovery in revenue after two sort of disappointing quarters, but I think the big question is, what is the company going to say about this current quarter, the first three months of this year? In the earlier part of the month, they reported sort of disappointing sales numbers for their cars in December, and I think there is a question of whether there is sort of softening demand for Tesla's that could hurt the company in the coming months.

Of course, the government has been elected in a legitimate way. They always said that they want to reform the judicial system. But the extent to which it is now being discussed has never been on the table. Let me just say, when people went to the voting, booth they voted for parties, they did not vote for specific items on the agenda. That's the way it's always going to be. But as we discuss now specifically, the judicial reform, the issue is not to do it through false and through the fact that one has a majority; rather it should be more inclusive. It's going to effect the life of everyone in the country. And therefore, if you want to go through this, do a referendum on that issue. But I don't think that's the need. You need to exchange views. It is a professional issue. We are not talking about a political agenda. We need to talk about it in a professional way. And I do believe that some of the proposals, while emanated from an economic analysis of their unintended consequences, that is all. We are saying we are in a world of risk management. Don't take this risk. Explore it to the end and create the consensus. This is all that we are saying.",
