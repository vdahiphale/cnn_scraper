They don't think he's a good guy, but they still think he's better on the economy. The fact that he is now a convicted felon in court doesn't necessarily change how would he perform on issues on who is going to make cost of living better. So I can imagine this not necessarily changing the race until sentencing. The question of do I want to vote for somebody who is actually looking at prison time is different than the question of, do I think Donald Trump is a good or bad person.

I think it's more likely that there will perhaps be a fine or probation, something along those lines, partly because, surely he understands this is someone who is 77-years-old. This is the first time he's been involved with the criminal justice system in this way. And also that this whole case relies on a very novel legal theory.
