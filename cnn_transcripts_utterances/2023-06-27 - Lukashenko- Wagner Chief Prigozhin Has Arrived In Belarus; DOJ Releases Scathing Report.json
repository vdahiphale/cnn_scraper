Well, we know that's not true because they did, Prigozhin's troops, got almost all the way to Moscow and turned around by themselves. And, on that aside, if you listened to Lukashenko, it had nothing to do with the Russian troops. So, what are we hearing Kremlin -- from Putin here as sort of a Kremlin lie if you will that the troops and the security services in Russia didn't really prevent Prigozhin. So, we know that effect. It's not true.And then the other lie from Putin in that big gathering there inside the Kremlin with the military. He says you all stuck together and did such a good job together. Well, if one piece of it is a lie, what about the other piece? The history of the security services in Russia is they don't really work well together. We know that Putin met with his security chiefs last night. And today, we hear from the national guard chief saying we're going to be getting tanks and bigger heavy weapons in the future. Kind of creates the impression that during Prigozhin's advance on Moscow, the National Guard was saying, what can we do? We've only got machine guns. We can't take these on. It doesn't sound like what Putin is telling the Russians is the verifiable truth. He went on to meet with some other Russian soldiers. And he was there saying basically, very simple terms. The Russian government's good. Yevgeny Prigozhin is actually greedy and bad. How did he frame that? He said, look. Some of the Wagner fighters died fighting on the front lines for Russia. They were good. They did a great job. We, by the way, the Russian government actually pumped a billion dollars into Wagner. We help pay for them. So, he was kind of making himself and the government look good. Prigozhin -- he said and he reminded everyone that promotion comes out of a company called the -- called a Commodore. And this company, he said, was -- a Concord, rather. This company, he said actually got a billion dollars worth of contracts from the government. Then he went on to say that perhaps some of the money that the government had given to Wagner had been misspent. He's laying the groundwork here for potential financial charges against Prigozhin. And that just after this morning when we heard the FSB had laid -- put aside laid down their charges against anyone involved, including Prigozhin that involved in the insurrection. So, you know, what we're hearing from Putin is he's going to go after Prigozhin on probably financial grounds.",

Lukashenko said that Prigozhin was only trying to sort of save, you know, his own commanders and his own troops. They've just come out of the frontline. They were -- they were sort of emotional, angry, half-mad is the language Lukashenka used.

We've got retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons here with us, and Georgetown University Adjunct professor and CNN contributor Jill Dougherty. She was a longtime CNN Moscow bureau chief, we must also mention that.I'm going to start with you, Major. Let me talk to you about President Lukashenko. He's revealed that he spent hours negotiating with Wagner mercenary Prigozhin to stand down and come to Belarus. Does Lukashenko seem to be sort of bragging here? Does his bravado in this make Putin look weak? Because Putin certainly did not manage to do this. MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET), U.S. ARMY: Yes, there's just so much confusion I think going on with this. What -- why does he even allow him to go to Belarus, to begin with, OK? That's the first thing. And then Putin comes out yesterday and gives Wagner troops three choices. You can go into the Russian military, you can go home, or you can go to Belarus. Oh, and by the way, your leader is in Belarus. I still have a hard time thinking of Putin is just going to give up on Wagner It's just too important to him geopolitically. So, he's got to try to figure out a way to resurrect or do something with them. Maybe 25,000 troops are also in that area. It's a lot of troops. You're just --",

So, in kind of an Orwellian way, he has to present it both to the Russian people and to those Wagner fighters that this is somehow normal.But let's take the Russian people. I mean, there's Putin. That stage behind him is one of the most historic buildings in the Kremlin. It just -- you know, is a symbol of power in the state. So, Putin is saying these people -- these soldiers rescued the state. And so, if you're an average citizen looking at that, you know, the message is, everything's back to normal. Putin is in charge. But I think with this very interesting development of Putin coming out at the last minute and saying that the government -- the Russian government, gave a billion dollars to Wagner and another billion to the company as we just heard that Wagner -- that Prigozhin owns, that reminds me of how Putin has dealt with people who are kind of pout part of the power structure. He doesn't want to necessarily kill them, and murder them. That might not look particularly good. But you can certainly go after them, actually, and stick them in prison forever. So, I think once again, this is not over. We're in the middle of something. And I think now, we have to look at what had -- what is going to happen to Prigozhin in that sense.",
