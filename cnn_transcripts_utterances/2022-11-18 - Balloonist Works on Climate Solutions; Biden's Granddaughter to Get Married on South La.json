And then after the ceremony, there will be a reception in the White House for family. And for the wedding party, very small. And then in the evening, guests will come back and have dessert and there will be dancing and a bigger reception. It's interesting, there hasn't been a grand-scale wedding of a presidential family member in quite some time. One of the biggest was the -- Lyndon Johnson's daughters got married in the late 1960s at the White House White House, Lucy Johnson and Linda Johnson in 1967 during the peak of Vietnam. Then Tricia Nixon, ahead of President Nixon's scandal in 1971 got married as well. Tricia Nixon got married in the Rose Garden. Linda Johnson got married in the East Room. Naomi Biden will be the first person getting married on the South Lawn. Definitely, it will be a big weekend for the White House. As you said, it's not the only celebration.

      "sentences": "That's right. So in the next 20 minutes or so, we're going to hear from the attorney general directly. But he is -- he has appointed a special counsel to oversee the investigation -- the twin investigations into the former president.One of them, of course, is the Justice Department's investigation of the retention of national security information. These are the classified documents that were found by the FBI during the search at the former president's residence in Palm Beach in Mar-a-Lago. The second part of this is parts of the January 6th investigation that touch on the former president. Of course, you know that one of the things the Justice Department has been looking into is the involvement of the former president and the people around him in the effort to obstruct the transfer of power after the -- after the 2020 election. He was involved in the fake electors scheme and in the entire effort to try to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory at the end of the 2020 election. Those are the two things that the special counsel, who has already been appointed by the attorney general, who is now going to oversee those two aspects of these two investigations. Now, we're going to hear a little bit more about who the attorney general has appointed when the attorney general comes out to speak, again, in about 30 minutes or so. And we're going to hear a lot more about exactly why this was done. But look, we previously reported, we broke the story here at CNN that this was something that was in discussion at the Justice Department. And part of the calculation was the idea that, you know, having someone not part of the political leadership here overseeing these investigations was important if the former president declares that he is a candidate for office once more. Given the fact that obviously he might be running against Merrick Garland, the attorney general's boss, Joe Biden, if he decides to run for reelection. So that's part of the issue, which was to try to insulate those two investigations and keep them out of the realm of politics. Of course, you guys know that, you know, you can try to do that, but then, of course, it has to do with Donald Trump and there's probably no way to divorce yourself entirely from the political atmosphere of this.",

      "sentences": "Well, as Jessica noted, one of the things about a special counsel here is that they ultimately report to the attorney general. While they do operate independently, they get an independent budget,all kinds of resources to carry out their work, they still have to consult with the attorney general before potentially bringing any charges. Now, the big question you guys have been talking about this -- there's no answer right now -- is who will take on this job. I mean, there's such a small circle of people who could take on this job and really help convince people that there's no political bias, that there's no politicization of this investigation. As we reported, as Evan mentioned, Jess mentioned as well, the goal of appointing a special counsel is to try to protect the Justice Department, which has been embroiled in partisan investigations, for instance, pretty much since 2015, and the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. They're trying to shield the Justice Department from political blow back. It's unclear if they can truly do that. Because, again, the final word lies with the attorney general. It will be very interesting to see who was selected for this job, who is willing to take it on, and what exactly their mandate is. We know that this individual will handle the investigation into possibly mishandling classified information down at Mar-a-Lago but also certain aspects of the January 6th investigation. What does that mean? Is that just any role that the former president had in that? Is it also his associates? John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark? That's going to be interesting to see how they carve this out and what parts they felt were so politically fraught that they had to be handed off to a special counsel.",

That's a very important question.Look, I think one of the concerns that I've heard internally is that what this means is that we're going to be waiting for this for a long time. I have been told, though, my sources that, you know, look, it doesn't necessarily mean that. It means -- because you have a lot of this investigative work that is already happening by the FBI, by the prosecutors here in the Justice Department. So, what they can do is they can easily move those people under the oversight of this new special prosecutor. Doesn't need to set things back as far as the calendar goes. But, you know, without a doubt, one of the problems, one of the issues, with special counsels is that they can go on and on and on. You don't need to take my word for it. Just look at John Durham. The attorney -- he was appointed with Bill Barr under the former administration, and he's still going. We don't know exactly when he's going to wrap up, probably very soon. But it's really up to him. That's going to be the question. How do you control this from not going on and on and on? It's a very important question that you ask.",

So, it's a little bit difficult to talk about genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease. We haven't really identified a lot of markers. There are several genes. But one of them in particular is this gene. And in fact, Chris Hemsworth was told that he has two copies of that gene. As you mentioned, that increases the risk of potentially of late-onset Alzheimer's potentially about eight to twelvefold. If you have one copy of the genes, it's about two to threefold. All of us have some form of these genes. It's really about four that's associated with increased risk. And that gene is associated with removal of plaques from the brain, so less removal potentially without form of the gene. So, you know, it's tough to learn this because what do you do with this information? And I think that's really the next question, is who should be tested and how do you go on from here knowing that you may be predisposed.",
