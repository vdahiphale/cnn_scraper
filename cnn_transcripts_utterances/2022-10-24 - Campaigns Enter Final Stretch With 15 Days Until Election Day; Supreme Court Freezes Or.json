An epic battle for control of Congress is heading into the final stretch tonight with only two weeks until Election Day and miles to go for the candidates out there on the campaign trail. Let's get right to one of the hottest battlegrounds, Pennsylvania, where the Senate race could be decisive for Democrats. CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny is there for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (VOICE OVER): On the eve of a critical debate, all eyes are on Pennsylvania In the fight for control of the Senate, as Democratic John FETTERMAN and Republican Mehmet Oz share a stage for the first time. A new CNN poll shows Fetterman with a narrow edge, 51 to 45 percent, just outside the survey's margin of error, as Oz works to boost his campaign two weeks before Election Day. The race to fill the seat of retiring Republican Senator Pat Toomey has played out as a bitter, long distance duel with a sharp focus on Fetterman's recovery from a near deadly stroke in May. LT.

The issue list is going to look familiar to you. Once again, economy and inflation, 47 percent of likely Wisconsin voters call that the top issue. Everything else flows from there. And when you look at the issues and how they animate the parties, it's even more dramatic than we saw in Pennsylvania. 76 percent of Republicans in Wisconsin, likely voter Republicans, say the economy and inflation is number one. That is what is animating the Johnson support right now.Here on the issue list, nearly four in ten Democrats in Wisconsin say abortion is their number one choice. It is the economy that is very much giving that Ron Johnson that 50 percent factor there. And then we asked that same question. What are you looking for as the driving factor in your Senate vote? 45 percent say issue positions. But here's something interesting. It's a flip in Pennsylvania. 35 percent say character. 20 percent are strategic voters. They say which party is going to control the Senate, is their big factor in their vote, but here, it's actually benefitting the Democrat.

I think it's the economy. I also think it's crime.There's a very creative ad right now on air from Republicans saying John Fetterman is much more radical than Josh Shapiro. And, essentially, Wolf, it's an invitation to say to Pennsylvania voters, go ahead and split your ticket. Shapiro wins for governor but give us Dr. Oz rather than voting for both of the Democratic candidates. There's a rich tradition in this state of doing exactly that. It's a state Al Gore won at a time when Rick Santorum was being elected to the U.S. Senate. Last year, 2020, Joe Biden wins the state. It was actually a great year for Republicans down ballot. So, I wouldn't be surprised if there's that kind of ticket splitting going on in Pennsylvania. We'll all see what happens tomorrow night. BLITZER:  It will be a big night, indeed.

But even beyond that, this is the only debate that I can really think of where people are already looking to 2024, to see if he can be muddied up be a little bit. So, he's running for re-election, but he has his eye looking ahead.But I think that's so interesting, Charlie Crist, he's been in that position before. He was a Republican governor of Florida, of course, a Democratic congressman. So, he has nothing to lose, really, and he is a pretty experienced debater. But the reality is that it likely won't change the trajectory of this race, but could it change the shape of the next race. But one thing in particular, this was a delay because of the hurricane by a couple of weeks. Governor DeSantis is going into this debate in a very strong position here. But the meanness factor, some of his policies have been viewed by some as mean. So, is that somebody that former Congressman Charlie Crist is going to raise? Can he sort of, you know, push him on any of these issues? But, again, this is one of the rare cases. It's not about the election in 15 days. It might be about one slightly farther down the road, Wolf. BLITZER:  Yes, we shall see, good point. Michael Smerconish, you just heard David Chalian report the results of our brand-new CNN poll, where voters in key states say the economy is the top issue on their minds. President Biden addressed the economy issue once again today. But are Democrats, do you believe, doing enough to reassure voters of their economic concerns?",

You know, it's almost when the stock market rises, whomever is in the White House gets the credit, whether they deserve it or not, and when it tanks, likewise, the reverse is true. For better or worse, I think there's an accountability for how the economy is going. People's perception is that it's going poorly because of a 40-year high in inflation. And I think that's very hard for Democrats to distinguish themselves or get away from.Final thought is this. What's unique about this campaign, this election in 15 days, both sides have good issues in their arsenal, and you've heard it repeatedly. For the Democrats, it's about abortion. To a lesser extent, it's January 6th. For the Republicans, about the economy, porous borders and it's about crime. The real issue is wherein lies the passion? I've seen all of David Chalian's numbers. I get it. I agree. But which is going to be most passionate to bring people out to vote? That team wins.",

Remember, the one thing that is sort of maybe putting a little bit of a pause on some of the more aggressive weapons that the west could be sending to the Ukrainians is a desire not to see this thing escalate out of control.

I think that has a lot to do with it.So I think the most important thing to think about right now is recognize those who are at greatest risk, at least in the pediatric age groups. And those are premature infants. Those who are in were previously in neonatal ICUs, that might have underlying respiratory illness was called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, those with underlying heart disease and those with neuromuscular disorder. They're at the greatest risks. But really any child could get severe RSV. So, here for -- for my perspective, Wolf, here's the most important thing as a parent to do. You want to establish a good working relationship with your pediatrician, whether or not your child is sick. You don't want to be in the middle of the night and realize that you're concerned about your child and have no way to reach your pediatrician because the problem is in too many parts of the country right now, pediatric emergency rooms are getting overwhelmed. So if you simply bring your child to the emergency room, it compounds the problem. So, the message is have a low threshold for having contact with your pediatrician and have that relationship ready to go.",
