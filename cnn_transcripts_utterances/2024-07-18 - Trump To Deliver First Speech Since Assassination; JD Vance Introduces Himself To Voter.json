My good friend and co- anchor, Brianna Keilar, is live for us in the nation's capital.And here at the convention, it is the final day. Tonight, former President Donald Trump will take the stage to formally accept the Republican nomination and deliver his first major speech since nearly being assassinated. Trump's original plans for what he described as a humdinger of a speech getting scrapped. Instead, Trump writing a new speech he says, to meet the moment. And in a new video, Trump is talking about that terrifying incident last weekend. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER US PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This has been our best campaign and then I got shot, how is that happening? That was an amazing -- horrible thing, amazing thing and in many ways, it changes your attitude, your viewpoint on life. And I think honestly, I think you appreciate God even more. I really do because it's something happened -- (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This was something that he wanted to write. We've been told by a number of people close to him that he had a different speech, but after Saturday's event wanted to make this about unity. But of course the big question remains, what does unity mean to former President Donald Trump? And I spoke to a number of people who have been briefed on the speech, who have talked to him about the speech. They say that he is going to lean into what happened on Saturday.He is going to talk about the fact that he feels like he is lucky to be alive, that there was divine intervention. But whether or not he stays on this message, again, we will wait and see Donald Trump is one who gets very invigorated by the crowd around him. We know that they are setting him up in a kind of show style performance. He has Hulk Hogan speaking, there's Dana White of the UFC, introducing Kid Rock, who then will put on a performance and have Donald Trump take the stage. So which version of Donald Trump that you get? Now, people who are close to him, they insist that he is a changed man, that he had this harrowing experience. This is the first time other than that short clip that you just saw that we're going to see him speaking in public and directly addressing what happened on television. So that's going to tell us a lot about where his mindset is, and where he believes the Republican Party and the country should go.",

He has not wanted to talk about abortion almost at all, other than taking credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade.Obviously, they do believe, and this is his senior advisors, that the pool party is welcome. They want anyone who is far right or Christian conservative to vote for Donald Trump. But what they do believe is at the end of the day, they can sell to Republicans that this is a binary choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

Had 'em laughing, crying, dancing, and two of the moms came up to me afterwards and said it was the best thing that had happened to them since they lost their son.He was a healer. He was consoler. He was a leader. And I wanted the world to hear that story. And then, they came on stage and told their stories. SANCHEZ: It is a powerful story. It's contrasted with things that we've heard from former servicemembers, high ranking servicemembers and their experience with former President Trump, and his approach to servicemembers. In fact, his former chief of staff, his longest serving chief of staff, John Kelly, went on the record with CNN to say the following. And I want to be precise with the reporting. He says, \"Donald Trump is a person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform or shut down are seriously wounded in combat, are spent years being tortured as POWs are all suckers, because there's nothing in it for them.\" He's using quotation marks there quoting former President Trump. He says, Trump did not want to be seen in the presence of military MPTs because it doesn't look good for me. Who rents that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are losers and wouldn't visit their graves in France. He says, Trump is a person who has no idea what America stands for, no idea what America is about. John Kelly, we should point out is a Gold Star father himself.",

Sources telling CNN that former Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told Biden that polls show he cannot win and may bring down other Democrats in the process.We want to get details on that conversation now with CNN correspondent Priscilla Alvarez. She's actually in roll with traveling with President Biden as he's isolating after he tested positive for COVID. Priscilla, walk us through what we're learning about how the President responded in these conversations. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. The President is facing growing pressure from those within his party, including top Democrats like house speaker or former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over his candidacy. What we're learning from this private conversation that happened recently was that the former House Speaker presented the President with polling that shows that he can't defeat former president Donald Trump, and that he could destroy the chances of Democrats running in House races. The President, according to sources, responded defensively pointing to his own polling. And at one point in that conversation, the former house speaker asking to get his senior adviser, Mike Donilon, on the phone to walk through the data. It is this type of private conversation that really captures the tension within the Democratic Party, as there have been so many questions circling this campaign over the viability of President Biden as a Democratic candidate. Now, I've reached out to the White House about this, they said -- and they maintain that the President is the nominee and that he can win. The former house speaker's office saying that she is in California since Friday and has not talked to the President since that time. But certainly a lot of Democratic lawmakers have been raising these questions about President Biden. In fact, also yesterday, Representative Adam Schiff calling for President Biden to drop out of the race. And privately, the President has also fielded and received these direct appeals. And the Biden campaign for their part maintains that there is no plan B. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUENTIN FULKS, PRINCIPAL DUPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER, BIDEN-HARRIS 2024: The vice president is a part of the Biden-Harris ticket. Our campaign is not working through any scenarios where President Biden is not the top of the ticket. He is and will be the Democratic nominee. I think when it comes to if he's open or being receptive to any of that. Look, the President has said it several times, he's staying in this race. I talked to the President every single day.
