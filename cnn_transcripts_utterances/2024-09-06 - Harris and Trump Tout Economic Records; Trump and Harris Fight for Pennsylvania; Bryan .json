There's just no doubt about it.Money is not going to win this campaign. It could lose it if you don't have it, obviously. So, this is going to allow them to keep fundraising and open offices and have a very large grassroots campaign. But at the end of the day here, money is not their biggest challenge. Convincing voters and undecided, you know, to come her way is. But look, I mean, what they've been doing - I was talking to a - fundraising official last evening as we were looking into these numbers. And what is extraordinary now, it's the grassroots money that's coming in. That was something that was really not coming in during the Biden era, I guess, of this campaign as much. The big money, it's generally always there. But what they believe is - is so important here is the grassroots money, that a third of all these donors, 1.3 million donors were making their first contribution since she became the nominee. That means that they can give money again and again. But again, money is not likely to win this election.",

They can't touch those mail-in ballots until that morning at 7:00 a.m. This is one of the reasons why in 2020 you'll remember Wolf Blitzer called the race the Saturday after the election. And I'm really concerned that if it's, in the end, as close as people envision, and if it comes down to Pennsylvania, that we could have a process where there's a window of ballot counting where a lot of disinformation, misinformation is spread, not only by domestic forces, political parties, one perhaps more than the other, but look at what the Russians and the Iranians are up to.

A lot of Swifties last night were joking that this is season two of Taylor Swift goes to Arrowhead. That's premiering on television. I can tell you though, the breakup contract, as you said, has completely been shut down. This all originated on Reddit. There was a photo that was posted there of an alleged contract. That post has since been deleted. Travis Kelce's PR team has come out. They've definitively said that this is fake, this is fraudulent and never originated in our office. And I think you can see, even just looking now, at watching the games, watching her hug his parents, watching her point to him and him point to her, it really is this rom-com (ph). I think most people that are watching this would tell you of proposal as much more emanate that a breakup.",

I've seen over the past year that they have showed up, they've supported each other. I was on the road internationally, watched him in Paris, watched him in Australia. Just seeing him dance long to all of her music, again, points or her, she points to him. She's never done this in the past where she dedicates songs and mash-ups. You can tell they're for him. On the 87th show, she just said, hey, it's my 87 show, which is his number. And all the wristbands lit up in bright red. The crowd went wild. There's just - there's never been anything to suggest that this is not real. It - it's just been wonderful to watch them, especially when it comes to football.And I know you had said September 28th was the alleged date. I anticipate she's going to be at the September 29th game against the Los Angeles Rams - or Chargers. So, we're going to have to see.",
