      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, the Vice President is largely spending her day behind closed doors. But she is participating in a spate of radio interviews across the battleground states as she tries to mobilize voters and reach those who may still be on the fence, outlining her vision in each of these interviews. But also planned for the vice president later today is a dinner, a ritual of hers, to have dinner with family and friends at her residence before then going to her election night party at Howard University, her alma mater, one that she talks fondly of, and one where she says this will be her full circle moment.Now, on the ground, Wolf, I am told that Harris advisors have directed their staff to continue to knock on doors, to consistently and frequently focus on mobilizing voters, making sure they're getting out to the polls. Because, of course, Wolf, today is a day that will test the strategy by the Harris campaign, one that we've seen play out over the last several weeks about reaching disaffected Republicans in those red rural counties, but also leaning in on reproductive rights. And just as we have heard from voters over the course of today about them, some of them voting because of reproductive rights and reproductive freedom, the Harris campaign is seeing much of the same. I will also tell you, Wolf, I've been talking to some of her former aides who have been with her on election nights in the past. And there's one race in particular that's come up quite a bit. That's her 2010 race for California attorney general. That, too, was a razor thin race that was called three weeks later where she, of course, won that race. And one former aide to the Vice President telling me that that was a time when they had to practice patience, but it's also a time that they're reflecting on quite a bit today because it may also be a scenario that this is going to be a lengthy process because the polls and the votes are closed. Now, all of that remains to be seen. But Harris advisors are poring over the data. And they are telling reporters and they are telling strategists privately that they are going to remain calm. They're remaining confident in what they're seeing in the data, again, hoping that they can eke out that victory against former President Donald Trump. But certainly, until those -- until the voting polls close, they are going to continue that ground game that they have talked about so extensively over the last year. Wolf?",

U.S. Attorneys are aligned with that.But we've also seen among the states, local law enforcement and election officials. You know, if you look at Georgia, they have a text system where poll workers can send alerts directly to authorities saying if something is going on. They have also issued thousands of lanyards with a panic button built-in, which will go directly to 911.

But the FBI statement says -- the FBI is aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states, many of which appear to originate from Russian email domains. None of the threats have been determined to be credible so far. This is the difficulty. These kinds of threats are literally meant to cause disruption, evacuation, disrupting the voting process.

It hurts my heart that we have -- that that's even necessary because remember the good old days, and you would just go vote and it was your civic duty, and it just felt good. And now, it's -- you've got to really think about what's my plan to vote? What am I -- you know, what are all the considerations? I think it's also important, though, this is part of why talking about and reminding people it's okay. It's okay. If there's a pause, just stay in line. If it takes a little longer for the voting to make sure every vote is counted, that's okay, too. It doesn't necessarily mean that there -- it doesn't mean chaos, doesn't mean skullduggery. I just so love that you all use that word. I had to say that again. But, you know, and I think we're all learning that.

We took a national poll. We did a lot of key state polling. Foreign interference and actually censorship of stories by media were the top two issues voters were concerned about when they were concerned about what could actually rig an election.

And we do see these isolated examples. And hopefully they'll stay isolated and will be quickly fixed. But it's great to see former President Trump talk about not having violence, encouraging people not to be violent. That's a good change. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he was up till 3:30 am in Grand Rapids, Michigan. And after he takes a nap, he'll roar back up. But, you know, that's a good message for him to convey.

And you've seen over the last years, particularly in a state like Georgia, black voters matter. Latosha Brown, some of the work they've been able to do in that state, calling in some of those black rural voters who might not have felt like they were part of the process. They are going to be key to this win if Kamala Harris is able to win Georgia. You know, and you also heard Clyburn there talking about maybe there's going to be sort of a shift around the edges among black men voting more for Donald Trump and them trying to go into the barbershops, go into beauty salons, and to churches to reach some of those folks as well. You know, we'll see what happens. We don't know, but those are two states Georgia, which is about 30% black, the electoral be about 30% black. And then in North Carolina, it's about 20% black. The good news, I think, for the Kamala Harris campaign is there is obviously history of activism there. There are a lot of young voters, HBCUs, which are like ripe areas for organizing and drawing voters to the polls. They can vote right on their campuses in many ways. And they have won Georgia before Biden. And then you've got Raphael Warnock, who's also turned that state around, as well as Ossoff. So there is hope there. And we'll see tonight who wins Georgia.",
