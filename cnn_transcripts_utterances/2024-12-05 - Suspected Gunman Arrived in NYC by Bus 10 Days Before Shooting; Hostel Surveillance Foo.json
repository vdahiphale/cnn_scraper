We saw detectives going into different shops and restaurants still looking for video to try and find out where the suspect is. It seems like they have a pretty good idea of when he got here, how he got here and some of his movements at that time, but at this point it just seems they don't really have any idea or at least they're not telling us of where he went, where he is.And it's a big mystery, you know, a city of this size with so many cameras everywhere, it's still very interesting that they still have no idea where he is, where he went.

He has to obtain this bike at some point. And we -- you know, the police don't know when or where that happened. So, he's been busy preparing, but we have to consider why is he at that hostel? He's staying in a room for four people with two roommates. So, he's the third person. Here's a guy who never lets down his mask or takes down his hood or both at the same time, which is why we only have that limited moment of that photograph. So, he's committed.

There's not that many places.If it's 15 minutes from the time of the shooting he exits on 77th Street. There's not a lot of time to hide something somewhere in the park. And also, where was he -- where was the bike? Where did he buy the bike? And also, where was the bike pre-positioned because he's, you reported last night he was seen on the upper West Side carrying a charger -- a battery in the morning. He gets on the subway.

But he also knows there's that cutout in the middle of the block, which gives him a clean escape route onto the next block, where that bike was waiting.They pick him up, you know, coming eastbound on that bicycle towards Sixth Avenue, and then on video into the park with that backpack, it appears because he comes into the park wearing it and he leaves the park on that bike, not wearing it that he just discarded the backpack. Now, they've got a mobile field force. They did a grid search through the park. They haven't found it, but remember, this is your New York, right? You throw a brand new backpack out in Central Park, somebody's going to pick it up and they're going to take it. Don't forget the Chelsea Bombing, those two guys walked by the bomb on the street.

I think that, you know, if he didn't have a message and he wasn't feeling proud of it, he wouldn't have left those shell casings as Andrew said.I think that he could have had a better chance of getting away with this if let's say he did it at the victim's home, which was, well known to be in the suburbs of Minneapolis. Instead, he chose to do it in New York City, where there was a much higher chance of being on surveillance footage, of having a humongous police force after him. There are so many reasons why I think that there were better places that he would have been able to more successfully get away with this, but I think the place that he chose to do it, the venue, the media coverage, all of that suggests that he's actually proud of this act.",

We want to talk about all of it with Peabody and Emmy Award winner Geraldo Rivera. Also back with us is John Miller. Geraldo, we talked last night. What stands out to you about the manhunt 24 hours since then? GERALDO RIVERA, PEABODY &amp; EMMY AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST: The staggering thing to me, Anderson -- hi to you and to John -- is that with that photograph, that grinny flirtatious photograph, no one has come forward to suggest that they know this guy. Not just the people who ran into him over the course of the 10 days in New York, let's say that 99 percent of the time he was masked. Still, there's enough with this photograph, the two of them taken together, him serious and him smiling, where if you knew this guy, you would have to know who this was. And I am shocked that we have not heard, or at least have not yet been told, that he has been spotted. And his name is Joe Doe (ph). And, you know, from Minneapolis or whatever it is. It is to me that -- because I believe that the photograph is clearly the most important evidence, more than the videos and all the rest of it. But, you know, how could he be such a mystery man? I think that it's pretty clear that he's trying to convey the message of insurance revenge. He's kind of like a cross between the Unabomber and Robin Hood. He, you know, he got screwed somehow or someone he loved was shafted by the insurance industry. I had no idea how vitriolic the feelings about the industry were until, you know, Twitter in the last 24 hours, Anderson. You know, he had it come in or they bleed you dry or they denied me coverage for this. They dropped me for the pre-existing this or that.
