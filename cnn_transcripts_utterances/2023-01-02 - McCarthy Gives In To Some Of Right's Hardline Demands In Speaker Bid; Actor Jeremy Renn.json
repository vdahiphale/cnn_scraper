They want this select committee that will probe alleged politicization of the Department of Justice and the FBI and targeting, you know, conservative parents at school boards.They have a vision of the Republican Party that they are trying to impose, and that's why in many ways as I said, it almost doesn't matter whether they beat McCarthy or not, because they have already demonstrated -- he has given so much ground to those demands, that even if he wins the Speakership, they have already set the course, I think very firmly for the caucus overall after an election. As I said, where that course has very strongly rejected in the swing states. So, in terms of legislation I think it makes it almost impossible for the Republican caucus to reach any kind of substantive agreements with President Biden except on the absolute must needs for continuing, you know, government such as raising the debt ceiling, and even that isn't guaranteed.",

He posts videos of himself often on Instagram with these heavy machines. He owns snowplows. He lives in the Lake Tahoe area and he's constantly showing himself, you know, plowing his driveway. He's known to plow local streets and people nearby. And so, you know, he's used to being on these.We don't know exactly what happened, but we do know from authorities it was a traumatic incident. He was air lifted to a local hospital, and he is in critical but stable condition. But it sounds like it's a pretty tough situation. I should be getting more details soon from his team. But look, like we do know that authorities were called to the scene, and they said that it was a pretty dire situation for him. And look, there's been unprecedented snowfall in the Nevada area, and like I said, he posts videos of himself on these snowplows. But we don't know -- a lot of rampant speculation on social media. Did the snowplow potentially run over him? You know, roll backwards onto him. Did he fall off? We don't know those details, but we should have those soon. But they do say he's receiving excellent care and that his family is with him right now.",

Jordan was passed away, and it wasn't true. So, now he's issued an apology. But he sort of the one to really even shine a light on this through his apology, but this is a TikTok trend gone very badly. Take a look at his apology.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SON OF ANGELA BASSETT, COURTNEY B. VANCE POSTED VIDEO CLAIMING ACTOR HAS DIED: I apologize to Michael B. Jordan's entire family, his extended family, and him directly as he is an idol of mine.

And December 10th, the FBI investigators who catch this case, do the database checks, the background, does he appear anywhere in any other reporting about terrorism. And when they've done all the background, they elect to go interview him himself.And they go see Trevor Bickford up in Wells, Maine, and he says, yes, you know, I would like to go be with the Taliban in Afghanistan, but only, you know, to help them protect other Muslims. Because, you know, sometimes they're too strict. I'd like to help the Uighurs in China. I might want to the Rohingya in Myanmar. So, he convinces them that he is not planning to attack anything or do anything here, but he would like to travel somewhere to help people. At that point, they go from a preliminary investigation to a full. Because here's a guy who says, I'm not afraid to die for my religion and I want to go to Afghanistan. So, he ticks to a full case. As they're going forward with that investigation, and they have him on a watch list that will keep him from getting on a plane, he gets on a train not to go overseas where that alarm would have gone off, but to go to New York claim, I'm just -- I'm going to travel domestically for peaceful purposes.

They studied more than 11,000 people over a period of decades and they took a look at their blood and from blood, you can tell how well hydrated someone is. And so, they looked at how much they drink and what kind of diseases they got. What they found is that the folks who were not so well hydrated, the folks on sort of a low end of the spectrum, they had a 21 percent increased risk of premature death, and up to 64 percent increased risk of heart failure, diabetes, dementia and a whole host of other diseases. So, in many ways, this is a great study to start the new year with because this is something you can easily change. Just drink more water.

But again, it has a lot to do with sort of where you live in all of that.If you're having trouble getting enough water and I think a lot of people do, a couple of sips, keep water by your bed so when you go to bed and when you wake up in the morning, it's right there. It's very easy. Also, if you feel hungry, drink water. I know that sounds weird, but a lot of times people are hungry when they're actually dehydrated so try the water before you try the food. But speaking of food, when you do eat food, we can get a lot of fluid from food. So, drink foods with high water content like melons and grapes and carrots. That actually makes a big difference.",
