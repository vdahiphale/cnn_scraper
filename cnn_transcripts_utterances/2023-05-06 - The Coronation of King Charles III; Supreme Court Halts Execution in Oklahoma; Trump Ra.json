On Friday, if you remember, Charles greeted well-wishers, a surprise visit for some not very far from where I am. Onlookers shouted, \"Three cheers for the king.\" The Prince and Princess of Wales also on hand to meet with the crowds. The last coronation was 70 years ago. For many Britons, it will be the first time they've ever seen it. Here's what it really means for so many of them, have a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I have to say, first of all, we've seen a couple of the headlines this morning and the papers here are calling this King Charles' Day of destination.We know they've waited over 70 years for this moment, and we'll see an ancient ritual take place behind us here at Westminster Abbey. The great west door, you might see over my shoulder, a rain cover being erected. Rain is expected a little bit later on today. Hopefully everyone will be in the abbey by that point because the doors open here at 7:30. We're expecting around 2,300 attendees. Just to talk you through very quickly through the ceremony itself, Isa, three things perhaps for our viewers to watch out for. The more important parts of the ceremony will be the anointing of King Charles, the most sacred part of this service, anointed with holy oil by the silver spoon, the coronation spoon, dating back to the 12th century. The crowning itself with the St. Edward's crown weighing some 2 kilograms on King Charles' head. One of the new aspects is the act of paying homage to King Charles. This has been a rather controversial aspect of the coronation thus far, because, in a break with tradition, the organizers of the event had decided to invite the public to take part in swearing allegiance to the king. Now typically this had been done by peers and lords beforehand. But they thought it would be a good idea to involve the public in this. Now we can tell you this morning that Church of England have amended this, perhaps reading the public mood to say that the general public can now say, \"God save King Charles\" if they prefer, rather than the pledge itself. We'll wait and see what people choose to do a little later this morning.",

CNN cannot independently confirm that as of now. The evacuations include some areas, where Russia has built heavy defensive lines in preparation for Ukraine's offensive. To the southwest, dozens of cars and buses left the city of Kherson on Friday before a 58-hour curfew went into effect.

The footage provides a rare glimpse of U.S. troops training Ukrainian forces. And the leader of the Wagner mercenaries is raising the stakes in his public feud with Russia's military brass.

Yevgeny Prigozhin claiming he was standing in front of bodies of Wagner troops killed in just one day. The video is extraordinary.

New developments in Georgia's criminal investigation into former president Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state. Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis has offered immunity deals to several Republicans, who served as pro-Trump fake electors, planning to block certification of Georgia's vote. At least eight of them have accepted. The rest all face legal exposure. The DA has said she will announce possible charges against Trump and his allies between July 11th and September 1st. Portions of the former president's video deposition are now public in E. Jean Carroll's civil lawsuit against him for battery and defamation. The deposition was played before the jury. And if Trump does not take the stand, they will be the only direct testimony the jury will hear from him in the case. Paula Reid with our report.

In total, there are 9,000 members of the armed forces who are being deployed today, 7,000 of those are ceremonial and a vast majority are arriving at Waterloo Station in the next hour. So that is thousands of soldiers all arriving at the same time. They will then make their way to that procession route. Many of them are involved in that. This is going to be the most spectacular display in terms of pomp and ceremony from the armed forces that I've certainly ever seen in my lifetime. I've covered jubilees, royal weddings but this is going to be something else, 1,000 members of the armed forces lining the entire route. There will be the 200-strong Sovereign Escort, the guards that will take the carriage from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. On the way back, there will be 4,000 members of the armed forces in procession. It will be so big, it will actually a mile long in and of itself. Isa, the logistical challenge of this procession shouldn't be underplayed. They've done lots of rehearsals. There's a very tricky corner we should all watch out for, from the mall to Whitehall and back again, which is very hard, I'm told, for carriages and horses. They have rehearsed in the dead of night.

Talk us through how we're going to see that and what we have been seeing the last few days. And does that showing a more modern Britain here? CARPENTER: Absolutely. So of course, King Charles is bringing together history, tradition, pageantry with a modern-day twist, at the end of the day. So faith, for example. Of course, we're living in a society these days, where people are of multiple faiths way more than 70 years ago, when it was the queen's coronation. And King Charles wants to let the country know, I'm here to serve people of all faiths. So we are going to see leaders from multiple different faiths -- Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, et cetera. Also, we are going to see female bishops involved in this coronation for the very first time. And I love this part. There's going to be a gospel choir ascension, apparently King Charles is a big fan of gospel music. When it comes to the congregation, I expect to see the most diverse congregation we've ever seen at a coronation. Young people have been invited; something like 450 COVID heroes have been invited who did some fantastic work around the pandemic. So that's going to be interesting. But it's very, very important for King Charles to reach out to young people, to reach out to people in general, to show that this is a modern-day monarchy, still relevant, and we do represent the people, all people.",
