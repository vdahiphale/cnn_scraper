We're standing by for new details on what he will ask of Congress and the American people.In the war zone, Egypt is expected to open a critical border crossing into Gaza within hours and allow the first aid trucks to roll in with life-saving supplies. Will it actually happen? Also breaking, Congressman Jim Jordan just wrapped up a tense meeting with fellow House Republicans refusing to support his bid to become the speaker of the House. It's been a day of new feuding and dysfunction as GOP lawmakers struggle to decide the next step in their standoff over choosing a new speaker and reopening the House. And Donald Trump's ex-lawyer, Sidney Powell, flips on the former president and pleads guilty in the Georgia election subversion case. Powell's deal with prosecutors putting Trump at even greater legal peril right now. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We're keeping a very, very close eye on the conflict in Gaza right now, and we're now just two hours away from President Biden's rare primetime Oval Office address to the nation. The president is set to lay out the stakes for Americans as war rages in the Middle East as well as in Ukraine. Our correspondents are standing by in Israel and on the frontlines at this very dangerous moment in the war against Hamas. Let's start with CNN's Kaitlan Collins. She's joining us from Tel Aviv right now. Kaitlan, what do we expect President Biden to say tonight?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, it's only the second time that you've ever seen President Biden sit behind that resolute desk in the Oval Office and address the nation in primetime, that is, since ever taking office. And I think it speaks to the gravity that he is bringing to this message tonight, not only talking about the importance of sending aid here to Israel but also more funding for the war in Ukraine to Taiwan, of course, a major concern that he's had that he believes Ukraine could have a massive effect on, and also fortifying the U.S. southern border, something that you've heard Republicans talk about repeatedly when they push back on sending more money to Ukraine.And so, in totality, the president is going to be asking Congress for a massive package, $100 billion. $10 billion of that, we are told, is going to be reserved for Israel. He says it's an unprecedented ask of the U.S. Congress. But expect overall this message about democracy and the importance of preserving that across the world to come through in the president's message tonight. And, of course, he is driven in part by his trip here to Israel. He's been working on the tweets to that speech, including on the flight home here after he spent several hours here in Tel Aviv. And while he was here, he did not get everything he wanted. Certainly, he didn't even make it to those meetings in Jordan because they were canceled, that he was expected to go to. During those meetings, the president was saying afterward that he had a call with the Egyptian leader, that he thought they made progress on actually getting somewhere on sending aid into Gaza, where it's so desperately needed, but he noted he didn't get what he wanted, which was getting civilians out of Gaza. So, still some big asks on the table for the president as he's trying to navigate not just the war in Ukraine, but also now this newfound war in Israel.",

They have now been sitting there for 12 days as they've been massing along that border.Some of those troops we've talked to, Wolf, have literally -- they come in and out 40 minutes every day to sleep in barracks. They're sleeping in mats in the open air. They are waiting at the defense -- Israeli defense minister. The exact quote, Wolf, is, you see Gaza now from a distance. You will soon see it from inside. Now, does that mean anything about the size? Is some of that more drawing a painting of what's going to happen as opposed to a specific indication of how big this will be? Obviously, unclear. But the reality of it is, Wolf, is you've got hundreds of thousands of troops waiting, not home, eating at makeshift barbecues all along this border that we have witnessed, and I think at the very least reflects that they know that these troops are on pins and needles and on the edge and waiting. And they need to go and give them some support and bolster them for whenever this is, and if it happens to involve a lot more waiting.",

I want to let you see what B'tselem, this group that tracks settler violence that believes that there is a full occupation by Israel that needs to end. They say that the settler violence against Palestinians has risen in both frequency and intensity with soldiers and police officers fully backing the assailants under the cover of war. Settlers are carrying out such assaults virtually unchecked. That is the group B'tselem, the Israeli human rights organization. I also want to mention there are about 700,000 settlers in the West Bank, but, conversely, they're terrified as well and they will tell you so. And they constantly say, look, we feel like we are just defending ourselves, defending our families. And so you have this awful back and forth between the two groups.

But afterwards, Wolf, every single holdout that we talk to said their minds are not changed, and they are standing firm in their opposition to Jim Jordan.In fact, during that meeting, we're told that they encourage Jim Jordan to drop out of the race, and that they delivered a pretty blunt message to him, which is that you're not going to be speaker, and this is the right thing for you to do, which is to drop out of the race. And then something else coming up during the meeting, Wolf, are these threats that some of these holdouts are now facing because of their vote against Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan, of course, has denounced those threats, and during the meeting, he denied that he has any involvement in what has been an outside conservative pressure campaign at targeting some of these holdouts. So, we'll see whether Jim Jordan is planning to carry ahead with this vote afterwards. Patrick McHenry, the acting speaker, said there are no decisions yet in terms of a floor vote and timing on that. Jim Jordan just said it was a good discussion. But we're told that if he goes ahead with another vote, he might bleed even more support.

Are they trying to take advantage of the tensions in the region that already exists? GEN. KENNETH F. MCKENZIE (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Wolf, it certainly looks like an escalation, opening another front against Israel, attacking from another direction.

They're hidden in, schools, mosques and in places in private homes. It would be a very difficult target for Israel.However, Lebanese Hezbollah will make its own calculations. I think if they lost a large-scale attack against Israel -- Israel would retaliate against them. And in 2000, six of bloody war for both sides, but Lebanese Hezbollah was hurt pretty badly from that.

Overhead, the IDF, Israeli air force, the IAF, I should say, Israeli air force, will also own the skies, and be able to have precision fires. Here's the thing the Israelis will be very attentive to the law of war. They will attempt to avoid mass human casualties. They won't be able to do that. But there will be -- there will be everything I can to avoid that. On the other hand, what Hamas wants and needs are mass casualty events, in order to operate any information say. They will use in effect, not only hostages that are there in Gaza as human shields, they will use the entire population of Gaza as human shields. It'll be a very difficult, tactical problem for the Israelis. I know they're poised down there in the border, ready to go in. I don't know when that occur, I do know this, the one thing the Israelis can't control is when it starts.

And, you know, the choices aren't great.Hamas has clearly looped us, the Israelis and the world for the last few years by looking moderate, while planning for this terrible attack that occurred in southern Israel. So, I don't know that they're the partner, there are other possibilities for partners. You would hope that other nations in the region would get involved. But all wars have to have a political end.

He's going to try and make a direct appeal to the public for why the U.S. should continue funding wars in Israel and Ukraine. He is going to seek to make the argument that in action would be more costly then continuing to greenlight funding.To that end, the White House is expected to ask Congress in the coming days for more than $100 billion in a supplemental funding request, $60 billion or so of that devoted to Ukraine, about $10 billion of that according to senior administration officials to Israel. Now, the president and his trip this week, gleamed from the prime minister, and his war cabinet in Israel, exactly what the countries needs on the ground are. And earlier today, he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about how that country is sustaining its own defenses, about 18 months after Russia's unprovoked invasion. But it's safe to say, Wolf, that the president is addressing a skeptical audience tonight. While there's overwhelming support for Israel's ability to defend itself, there is not a clear consensus about what the U.S.'s role should be. And public support for the war in Ukraine has waned, and has become a very bitter partisan debate, Wolf.",
