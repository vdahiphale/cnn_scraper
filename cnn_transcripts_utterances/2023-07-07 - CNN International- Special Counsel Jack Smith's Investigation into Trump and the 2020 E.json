Attorney Sydney Powell, Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and others floated some desperate ideas to keep Trump in power. They talked about having the military seize voting machines, declaring martial law, and appointing power as a special prosecutor to investigate alleged election fraud.

I'm told it was back-to-back, two days, about eight hours or so. He was asked about several topics, but he was also asked about this meeting.

Nauta was finally able to enter a plea in his case after finally hiring a South Florida-based attorney. His arraignment was postponed twice because he couldn't find a local attorney.Attorney Sasha Dadan was in court with Nauta along with his Washington, D.C.-based attorney. Dadan is a former public defender with experience, trying cases in South Florida. She has an office in Fort Pierce where Walt Nauta and Former President Donald Trump's trial will take place. Nauta pleaded not guilty to obstruction charges and to lying to investigators. He also asked for a jury trial. Prosecutors say is that Nauta moved boxes with classified documents from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago to another part of the property in an effort to keep a Trump lawyer from finding classified documents that were subpoenaed by a grand jury. According to a search warrant affidavit that was released on Wednesday, prosecutors said they have surveillance video from Mar-a- Lago showing someone moving boxes before the FBI search of the property. We believe that person to be Walt Nauta. Carlos suarez, CNN, Miami, Florida.

Nearly half of that was in the first 24 hours of launching his campaign May. It's a big number, but it pales into comparison to Donald Trump's war chest.

It leaves a long-term risk for anyone who comes across it, particularly, of course, civilians. So, that is a huge concern. It's been outlawed by more than 100 countries. So, deeply controversial. But this isn't the first time that these cluster munitions have been used on the battlefield in Ukraine. They've been used both by Ukrainian armed forces and the Russian troops on the front lines. And in fact, Ukraine has been using them, supplied by Turkey, in recent weeks. But of course, there isn't a formal announcement just yet by the U.S. government, it is still under consideration.
