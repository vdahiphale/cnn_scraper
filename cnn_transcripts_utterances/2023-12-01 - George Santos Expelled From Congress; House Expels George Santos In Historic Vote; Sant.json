We'll go live to Capitol Hill in moments.Plus, airstrikes combat and bloodshed as the Israel-Hamas truce collapses and fighting resumes. This as an explosive new report is out about what Israel knew about the Hamas terror plot. More than a year before the attack and why did they dismiss those warnings? I'm going to ask the reporters who broke the story. And remembering a trailblazer. Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female Supreme Court Justice died today at age 93. Tributes are pouring in, honoring her life and legacy both on and off the bench. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with that breaking news on Capitol Hill. George Santos just became the third lawmaker since the civil war to be kicked out of the House of Representatives by his peers. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. Manu, wow?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Historic, unprecedented and something that has caused deep divisions within the Republican ranks. Ultimately 105 Republicans voted for his ouster. They needed a 77 Republicans to vote for George Santos expulsion, so they clear that hurdle in the final vote 311 to 214, 290 ultimately, were needed for that two-thirds majority.But never before in American history, have we seen someone who has been expelled from the House without being convicted of a crime. The others who were expelled were members of the confederacy, which is why a lot of Republicans had pause or concern. The speaker of the House himself announcing his opposition behind closed doors this morning. He said that they use concerned about the precedent that would be set by an accusation made against a member not convicted of a crime, kicking him out of Congress. But importantly, Johnson and his leadership team did not whip the vote and that tell their members how to vote. Johnson told them, they should vote their conscience and they should vote their districts. This effort led by New York Republican freshmen in particular who believe that Santos was unfit for office and been pushing for months for ultimately for him to get there. And they now will contend with the fact that this narrow Republican majority has gone even narrower before, right Johnson could only lose four votes on any party line vote. Now he can only lose three Republican votes on any party line vote making this such a significant move. And also, Dana, this seat will now be subject to a special election in a district that Joe Biden carrying, something that Republicans could lose, could see their Republican majority narrowed even further in wasting no time. The House Democratic super PAC just announced plans to spend a big in that district to try to turn it blue ahead of the special election. So, the political ramifications so significant amid this historic and unprecedented vote that George Santos left the Capitol and left Congress, no longer a member of Congress. Now he has to worry about his trial date in the months ahead. Dana?",

I don't want to ascribe motives here, but to have their narrow majority not get narrower, like that that there was a thought there that that may be worth doing.At least the finding of all the leaders, perhaps the most interesting because she's from New York and is surrounded with all those frontline vulnerable Republicans in these tough districts that delivered the majority to the House Republicans in '22. And she also was saying no, no, Santos can stay when they've all been calling for him to go. It just seemed to be that they were together saying, hey, as the leaders here, we do think this becomes a larger problem. Maybe it's the president argument, but it's a larger political headache for them to have the narrower majority. At the end of the day, though guys, like, what are we talking about here? I mean, this guy -- I mean, Santos was for a year, just a black mark on the institution, a black mark for the House Republican conference, and obviously had just worn out his time for any goodwill with enough of his fellow Republicans.",

So, there was this group, the concerned citizens of the district.

It is unusual for the speaker of the House to actually cast a vote.The fact that he did and announced ahead of time that he would and then the other leaders in the Republican conference followed suit was very interesting. Let's listen to what Dave Joyce, a member of the Republican conference said going into this vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAVE JOYCE (R-OH): But he told us to vote our conscience. So that's what his conscience told him to do, I guess. But for me, it was a pretty simple case, having been there since the beginning. And one thing about, you know, 25 years of prosecutor before I got to this place. The good part about a numbers case or checks cases, I don't need anybody to explain it to me.

And that ethics report outline that he used campaign funds for trips -- for lavish trips, for Botox treatments, for you name it, clothes, I mean -- and he -- David Joyce also said, you know, this came down to theft that members who voted to oust him said that it was very clear based on the ethics report, based on what we've heard about the federal trial that Santos was stealing money from his campaign coffers. And Congressman Max Miller sent out that email earlier today saying that he was stolen from by Santos's campaign, and that that appeared to also push Republican votes back against Santos. But I mean -- I think that the point that you made David, maybe it was at the core of this, which was that ultimately, they didn't want their majority to get smaller.

There is a bargaining chip with prosecutors.I've covered malfeasant elected officials in the past and something that they've been able to negotiate for lesser time is typically, OK, I will resign from my public office, and I won't run again.

The party committees for fans of backroom deals, this is a good one. Party committees get together, and they decide who their nominees are going to be. So, it'll be interesting to see if indeed, people who have already declared their intention to run for the seat in November are selected and actually run in the special and get a jumpstart on their election because that's going to be coming up, you know, within the next 80 days or so.

That is where this special election is going to be held in -- would it for what is now a Republican seat.BARRON-LOPEZ: That's right. And it was previously held by a Democrat Tom Suozzi of New York. And I actually just got information from a source that says, he's going to be meeting tonight with some NASA and Queens Democrats, you know, talking to chairs and potentially readying for a run in the special election. So, Democrats would probably like it if he's someone who runs in this special election because of the fact that he has experienced in that district. He's a more moderate Democrat. They really do think that they lost that seat because the fact that he decided not to run. Last election cycle he went for the governorship and lost.

Punishing strikes especially focused on Khan Yunis in southern Gaza and Rafah, which is the area of the border crossing. According to Israel, they've hit more than 200 what they call terror targets across those areas.The challenge, of course, is that southern Gaza is exactly where Israel told Palestinians from northern Gaza to evacuate to earlier in this war. According to health authorities in Gaza, more than hundred Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli strikes, and that has put even more pressure on a health system that is already nearing the brink of collapse, with hospitals overflowing. The U.N. called the resumption of fighting catastrophic for Gaza. Meanwhile, we saw launches towards central Tel Aviv interceptions we saw off our balcony where I'm standing right now, at least 10 Iron Dome interceptors launched at the rockets that were fired here. That's the first time we've seen rockets launched this far in more than two weeks. So, both sides, as they promised, certainly resuming fighting here.

The goal here is to get back to the truce agreement, which had very specific guidelines or requirements for every 10 women and children Hamas released from Gaza. There would be another pause of 24 hours in fighting.The question is, does Hamas and do other organizations in Gaza have 10 women and children to meet that requirement? Israel claims they do for at least one or two more days of pause. Hamas says they don't and that they wanted to talk to Israel about the release of elderly men, as well as men and women of fighting age, so younger men and women. But they say Israel rejected all attempts at trying to have those discussions. A senior state department official said the negotiations are ongoing and expressed, I would say some level of optimism that they could get back to a truce perhaps even in the next day or two.

So, we'll see what happens. Oren, thank you so much for your excellent reporting there.And now we're going to go to a new bombshell report in The New York Times that Israeli officials knew Hamas attacks -- Hamas had an attack plan for October 7, more than a year before it happened. Here's part of what that story said. The approximately 40 -page document which Israeli authorities code-named Jericho Wall, outlined point by point, exactly the kind of devastating invasion that led to deaths of about 1,200 people. Joining me now is one of the reporters of this blockbuster story Ronen Bergman. Thank you so much for being here. Ronen, first I just want to start by reading a little bit more about the report that you did with your colleague, Adam Goldman. It says in part, Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision. The document called for a barrage of rockets at the outset of the attack, drones to knock out the security cameras and automated machine guns along the border, and gunman to pour into Israel on masse in paragliders, on motorcycles and on foot, all of which happened on October 7. That is so chilling. This was a report, as you said, 40-page report. How far up the chain did it get as far as you know, and why wasn't it -- why didn't anybody heed to this or think that it was actually possible in the highest levels of the Israeli government?",

This is also in your piece, underpinning all these failures with a single, fatally inaccurate belief that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare do so. That belief was so ingrained in the Israeli government, officials said, that they disregarded growing evidence to the contrary. Adam?",

And one of the themes was that Israeli intelligence saw this document, in fact, I think it was a military official who said, this document was a compass. And this is where they wanted to head but they had not arrived there yet.And you know that the Israeli government and the Israeli military -- while Ronen is right, they're deeply concerned about the document. They hadn't disregarded it. They put enormous amount of time and effort into trying to understand it and trying to understand Hamas's capabilities. You know, they came to this conclusion. And it's partly a failure of imagination that Hamas wasn't capable of carrying out such a sophisticated attack. You know, I have to tell you, you know, I've reported on 9/11 and al- Qaeda and bin Laden, and there are extraordinary parallels to what happened in the weeks leading up to 9/11. And how our government reacted to having that information. You know, like the Israelis, we had collected an enormous amount of intelligence about what al-Qaeda intended to do. But at the end of the day, we failed to imagine.",

The most important failure was one of imagination. We do not believe leaders understood the gravity of the threat.Top officials all told us that they understood the danger, we believe there was uncertainty among them as to whether this was just a new and especially venomous version of the ordinary terrorist threat in the United States had lived with for decades, or it was indeed radically new, posing a threat beyond any yet experienced. So, it's exactly as you just said. But Ronen, the question is -- not to say that people in America don't take security threats seriously. They absolutely, of course, do. But the existential threat that Israel faces is just different, given the geography and everything else that we've known since 1948 about Israel. So, the question is still, why was there this disconnect between the people working so hard on this report, and the prepared level of preparedness or lack thereof, inside the Netanyahu government. And I just want to remind our viewers of something that the prime minister put out there but then deleted. This was on October 28. So, this was a few weeks after the October 7 attack. At no point was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Hamas's intention to start a war. On the contrary, all the defense officials, including the heads of Intelligence Directorate and Shin Bet, assessed that Hamas was deterred. This was the assessment submitted time after time to the prime minister and the cabinet by all the entities in the defense and intelligence community right up until the war broke out. So, this is -- again, just a few weeks after the October 7 attack by Prime Minister Netanyahu's office. Ronen?",
