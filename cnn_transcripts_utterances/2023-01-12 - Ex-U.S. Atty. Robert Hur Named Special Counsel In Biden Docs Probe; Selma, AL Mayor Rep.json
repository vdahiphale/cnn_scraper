VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR (on camera): I'm Victor Blackwell. Moments ago, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to oversee the investigation of classified documents found on President Biden's property. And Garland said he made the decision after U.S. Attorney John Lausch's investigation last year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: On January 5, 2023, Mr. Lausch briefed me on the results of his initial investigation, and advised me that further investigation by a special counsel was warranted. Earlier today, I signed -- I signed an order appointing Robert Hur as special counsel for the matter I've just described. The document authorizes him to investigate whether any person or entity violated the law in connection with this matter. The special counsel will not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official of the department. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just days ago, the White House revealed the first case, the president's attorneys found classified documents in a DC office building that Biden had used for his work with the University from 2017 to 2019. Republicans are now calling for investigations. Of course, they equate Biden's document case with that of former President Trump. A separate Special Counsel is overseeing the criminal probe of more than 200 classified documents that were stored at Donald Trump's Florida estate. Let's bring in CNN Manu Raju. He's live for us on Capitol Hill. Phil Mattingly is at the White House. But we begin with Evan Perez. He's at the Justice Department. So, Evan, tell us about this new special counsel, what we know, and the timing of this announcement by the Attorney General.EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, yes, Alisyn and Victor, the new special counsel who's going to be investigating the Biden documents is Robert Hur. He is a former U.S. Attorney in Maryland and someone who served under the Trump administration. The attorney general making the -- making it clear that part of the reason here to do this was because of the regulations in the Justice Department, which require for the -- for an investigation like this to at least show that it was being handled independently. Of course, we know there is an ongoing investigation of the former President, Donald Trump, and his handling of classified documents. I'll run you through just a bit of the timeline. We got a lot of new information from the attorney general in that press announcement just in the last hour. This all began, according to him, on November 4 when the archives notified the Justice Department that they -- these documents had been -- had been turned over that it had been found a couple of days earlier by Joe Biden's legal team. And John Lausch, the U.S. Attorney in Chicago, who was a Trump -- who is a Trump appointee, was brought in just a few days later to do an initial review of these documents. According to the attorney general, on December 20, the Biden legal team notified the Justice Department that they had found another set of documents that appears to be documents that were found at the Wilmington home of the president. And then on January 5, is when Lausch concludes the initial part of his review and he recommends that a special counsel be appointed, which is what the attorney general has now done. It appears, by the way, Victor and Alisyn, that there was another document that was found and was turned over today, according to the attorney general. Again, this is an investigation that is now going to be looking at, you know, whether there any criminal laws were broken here, and what the special counsel is specifically being authorized to do. I'll just read you quickly what it says. It is going to -- he is going to be looking into the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and other records, and any other crimes that may have arisen as a result of the handling of these documents, Alisyn and Victor.",

So, Manu, what has the Republican reaction on Capitol Hill been to all this?MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, we haven't yet heard officially from the House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, or the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell about Merrick Garland's decision to name a special counsel. There had been calls from a number of rank-and-file members, including Senator Lindsey Graham, for instance, calling for a special counsel. So, undoubtedly, they will be supported by Republicans who had already planned to probe this issue. James Comer, who's the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, indicating today that he did plan -- does plan to have hearings on Joe Biden's handling of classified information. Comer has sent letters to the White House asking for a number of documents, including the documents that were obtained here, the remove -- the classified documents, have them turned over by later this month. We'll see how the White House decides whether or not to cooperate on that issue. Now, when McCarthy spoke to reporters earlier today, he was asked directly about this, and he took aim at the president and his handling of this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): He's an individual that sat on 60 minutes that was so concerned about President Trump's documents locked in behind and now we find it just as the vice president keeping it for years out in the open in different locations. I do not think any American believes that justice should not be equal to all. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's a new committee that was created just this week to investigate the Justice Department. It is expected to look into its efforts to look into Donald Trump -- the investigation into Donald Trump in his handling of this matter. The question is will that also includes a look into the investigation into Joe Biden? All of which is giving Republicans an opportunity to push ahead on this issue.Democrats themselves have said very little about this. Many of them drawing the clear distinction between Donald Trump apparently trying to obstruct the investigation going forward. Joe Biden apparently trying to cooperate with his investigation. They're showing some distinction there, but also not saying a whole lot including Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic Leader on the House side, only really saying that he has confidence in Joe Biden, but not saying much more other than that, guys. BLACKWELL: All right. Manu, Evan, Phil, stay with us. Let's expand the conversation now, bringing in CNN political commentator Alyssa Farah Griffin, former White House Communications Director under former President Trump, and CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor. Elie, let me start with you. Manu laid out some of the distinctions between the Trump documents or the Biden documents. What do you think about this call of a special prosecutor in this case?",

There is a half dozen or more, all of which sort of touch on different angles of this. In the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, for example, DOJ cites two different docs -- two different laws relating to mishandling or taking or destruction of sensitive government documents. So, we'll start with that.But how could there be a crime or could there not be a crime? The key things for any prosecutor are always going to be knowledge and intent. You have to show that any person you're going to charge with a crime, first of all, knew about the documents. If a person legitimately had no idea, there's no crime, you can't charge a crime. You also have to show that the person had some sort of criminal intent, some sort of attempt that was against the law. The obvious example in these hypothetical scenarios would be if somebody was disseminating this information, selling it, or giving it to others. Now, that doesn't appear to be the case either with Trump and Biden based on what we know now.

That will still be a focus going ahead. But now, with this news, it's giving them a new area to push ahead, and which is why we expect a lot of effort here going forward.The question will be when whether how the White House responds to all these requests for records. Does the White House cooperate with James Comer's request to provide this information by January 24, including communications between White House aides, the records themselves, a whole slew of documents, or do they fight the Republicans in the House? And does that lead to a subpoena fight, does that lead into a legal fight, things that we saw during the Trump administration? There is no real clear answer to that at this point, but that is undoubtedly how they plan to pursue it. But there are two guys Democrats who have questions including Mark Warner, who's the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He wants a briefing a damage assessment about what these documents were, the impact it had on national security. And he's not the only one. I'm talking to a number of Democrats. They want to know more information, which is why the Democrats have not been very vocal on this because they're just a lot of questions that they don't have answers to yet, guys.",

If Democrats pick one up, it makes that majority even slimmer. And that is just simply the political reality here. So, again, the word from GOP leadership today is let this play out.
