I don't think it changes anythingthat people think about the prime minister, whether they think that he is taking care of his own personal political interests ahead of the lives of the hostages. I don't think it changes that one bit. But I think there's a growing realization that, under this extreme international pressure, there was a lot of support for what President Biden said yesterday, implying that he didn't think Netanyahu was going far enough in the negotiations, not being flexible enough. I think there was a lot of support among the protesters for that position. And therefore, the position that prime minister Netanyahu has adopted last night is in completely the opposite direction. He has decided to be intransigent, stick to his -- stick to his beliefs about the Philadelphi corridor, stick to those beliefs that won't bring a deal with Hamas at the moment and, therefore, for protesters right now, it's a case of continuing. It's a case of continuing to try to get the message out. But let's face it and be realistic. Protesters in larger and smaller numbers, over many, many months now, more so at the weekends but also during the weeks like now, have been trying to do this same thing. And in a way, there's an impasse. You'll find a core of protesters out there, absolutely. You'll probably find more gathering at key traffic intersections in areas across the country, as they've been called to do today, as they were yesterday, as they were the day before. But it -- but I think there's a recognition that this is not going to change the prime minister's position. There was hope over the weekend that the horror of finding these six hostages dead would be enough to make him shift position. But what he said last night was very clear. What is the lesson that Hamas is going to learn if they murdered the hostages and we make concessions? That's absolutely clear. He's not backing down. I don't expect the protesters will, either, but it doesn't mean -- it doesn't mean they're gaining ground.",

That's one of the speakers from this mob you can see in the middle there. And then shortly thereafter in this clip, you can hear the mob chanting, \"Yankee go home.\" According to local authorities, this mob was from the Turkish Youth Union, a nationalist anti-American organization that has carried out attacks like this before, according to authorities. There was an incident in Istanbul in November 2021 and this has gone back for years. There was another incident we reported on back in 2014, where U.S. service members were grabbed; very often that same slogan chanted, \"Yankee go home,\" and then a bag placed over the head of the U.S. service members. That has meaning to this anti-American group. It's actually a reference to a 2003 incident shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, where U.S. soldiers or service members took Turkish soldiers into custody and placed a bag over their head. So that's what this nationalist group is referencing by doing the same to U.S. service members. According to the Navy, there were other Marines in the area. They came to the help of the two U.S. Marines, got them out of there, got them checked out at a local hospital. According to the Navy, they are OK. And then got them back to the USS Wasp.

But in this particular poster, what the city says is going on here is that somebody broke into this bus stop right here, this bus shelter, and they put up this post. This isn't a digital ad. You can see right here it's covered up. I'll get to this in a moment. But you have Vice President Kamala Harris in an Eagles helmets and, as you noted, right here on the bottom, it says Official Candidate of the Philadelphia Eagles. That's what this bus sign says. Now I should note for our international audiences, the Philadelphia Eagles are probably the most popular sports team in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Some people may disagree but I think that's a pretty fair thing to say. So to try to associate a presidential candidate with this team is very, very smart to some extent. But again, the Eagles do not endorse candidates and they are clearly saying that they did not authorize this. They sent a statement out on Twitter, \"We are aware counterfeit political ads are being circulated and are working with our advertising partner to have them removed.\" Meanwhile, some Philadelphia citizen came in, posted that tweet all over this poster late last night in order to make sure, if anyone mistakenly saw the poster, they would know. Meanwhile, Becky, we also spoke with the -- or heard from, I should say, the company that manages these ad spaces. They said, quote, \"We note that the Eagles and Intersection\" -- that's name of the company -- \"had nothing to do with the creation or posting of this unauthorized copy. An Intersection staff will be removing the ads soon as possible.\" Becky, I want you to take a listen, though, to how some voters that our affiliates here spoke with viewed these posters popping up around the city.

This type of, let's call it, guerrilla marketing or ad takeover is not uncommon in these big urban cities. It just happens to be that this particular one -- you're delving into politics and you're delving into sports.
