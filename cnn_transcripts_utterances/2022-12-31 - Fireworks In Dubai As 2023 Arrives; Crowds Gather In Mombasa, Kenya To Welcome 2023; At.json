And we can do that through so many things, through our businesses, through philanthropy and obviously foundations, is a way to have a structured approach to the impact that we want to achieve. This year, Black Impact Foundation was the latest foundation that I founded. And we have achieved some amazing things, bringing the people together, but always looking at a bigger picture, which is to have that positive impact on the overall society.I think that the black community needs to take their seat on the table in general, take things also by the hand, be critical also to the things that we should improve, that we can improve, which is really to increase the communication among ourselves, to have that trust rebuilt that was broken during the years. But it's beautiful to see that is really happening, actually. We did a second summit a few weeks ago here in Dubai, where people from all over the globe and not only black people, because it's not a black only party. Everybody that feels that, you know, the black community deserves to have that own power and own say in the world for a better world, it's welcome to come on board. And this is just one of the things, and the other thing is obviously a focus is women. Women need to play a bigger role in society. We know that the equality is so important. I've always been a really big supporter of the movement of equality, and equality goes for everybody. I don't want to give it a label, right, because that is very tiring, actually. I have three daughters myself. It's a world where that creativity, that different mindset, that extra women have, is needed for a better world as well. And this is just of the things that I would like to continue to do besides continue to enjoy my sports, continue to enjoy football, and continue to have impact overall in anything I'm doing.",

He started to open the doors for equality.You know, the black players after him had a whole different perspective. The world looked at Brazil in a whole different way. When he traveled around the world, he literally would stop the country. That was this impact. So I believe that we should remember him, yes, for the three World Cup that he won, to be the best player, you know, that have ever played the game because he was so much, you know, in front of his -- ahead of his time, but especially because his amazing humanity.

We call it Mombasa Raha in Swahili. Raha means pleasure, because when we want to wind that down, when we want to let our hair down, we come here to the coast. And that is why they have this traditional New Year celebration here on the waterfront.We're expecting a big fireworks display from back there. This got has surged in the time since I was here. There was only a couple of hundred people when we got here a couple of hours ago. Now it's in the thousands and growing with a whole lot of kids, a lot of families, still food vendors. Early in the day, Mombasa County hosted a food festival at Cultural Extravaganza. We saw lots of Swahili food on display here. Pilaus and biryani and samosa, which, if that sounds familiar for people from South Asia, is because there's a lot of cultural influence along the Indian Ocean coast on the Swahili East African coast, but also a lot more indigenous foods as well. And now is the big moment in the night almost there. And when we get to ring in the New Year, many people here in Kenya will be hoping that it will be a much better year. The cost of living has been a big problem over this year. In fact, the biggest concern, according to one new opinion poll released today by a major polling from here in the country, Infratrack, it said that 50 percent of Kenyans consider 2022 to be a really bad year. But they're optimistic that 2023 is going to be a big bumper year for them. And I guess that's why they want to be here, to see it, to get rid of 2022, say good rid to it and look forward to good tidings for 2023. And so far, I think the crowd is really charged. They've had performances back there, cultural dances. They've had a few speeches from some political leaders, but mostly just a good time keeping in tune with the name of the city as the capital of pleasure in East Africa, Becky.",
