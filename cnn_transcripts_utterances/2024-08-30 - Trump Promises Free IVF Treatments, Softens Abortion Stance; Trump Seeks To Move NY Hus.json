The idea of a mandate, is it now acceptable policy on healthcare for Republicans?JOE WALSH, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (R-IL): Well, the -- Phil, the party has changed. So the Republican Party is much more open to mandates now than they were when I was in Congress. This is a Republican Party, Phil, the new MAGA Trump party that openly boasts about using government to go after their political enemies and to enact policies that they want to enact. That would have been anathema to me, eight, nine, 10, years ago. But Phil your question, what does it mean? It means Trump wants to get -- Trump wants to win. Look, Trump's not pro-life. Trump's not pro- choice. Trump's pro-Trump. He knows this is a bad issue for him. Abortion is a bad issue for Republicans. The base would -- would outlaw IVF.

I think Americans are skeptical when conservatives say we're pro-life, and yet we don't adopt policies that would fit in the category of being pro-life. And if you are all about starting families, protecting families, defending the idea of families, then you would support policies that would enable Americans to go through IVF or any other treatment that they would so choose.To be a conservative means, first and foremost, you want to conserve very critical and foundational aspects of culture, of society. Well, that is rooted in the idea of family. It begins with the idea of family. So I get Joe's point about this -- this notion of mandates, but that doesn't supersede the very foundation of what conservatism seeks to preserve, and that is the individual's ability to start and -- and protect and preserve family units. [11:10:16] And so yes, maybe it's a shift from where conservatives were eight years ago. But I think it is a positive shift that is consistent with the notion of being pro-life.
