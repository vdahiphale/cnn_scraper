You know, Trump essentially told his allies who were not voting for Johnson, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas, to stop the nonsense and get in line. And I think one of the big, you know, benefits for Donald Trump heading into this new Congress is that he can say, basically, I have the mandate.

Physicians for Human Rights Israel have filed a petition with the country's top court, demanding his whereabouts after receiving conflicting information from the Israeli military. An Arab Israeli lawmaker wrote to Israel's defense minister, asking the same question. Former detainees tell CNN he is being held in Sde Teiman detention center, notorious for human rights violations. The IDF tells CNN Dr. Abu Safiya was, quote, \"apprehended for suspected involvement in terrorist activities,\" accusing him of being part of Hamas. It provided no evidence to back up these claims. Dr. Abu Safiya sent increasingly dire updates over recent months as Israel targeted the area around, then within his hospital, claiming it was a Hamas terrorist stronghold, a claim the hospital director called nonsense. He repeatedly called for aid, refusing to leave at a deep personal cost. He lost his son in an Israeli airstrike. U.N. experts say they are gravely concerned about his fate.

She's been to Gaza twice in the current conflict in her work with the British charity group Medical Aid for Palestinians. She joins me now live this hour from Manchester in England.Thank you very much for joining me, Dr. Jeelani. And I want to get to your experiences in Gaza in a second. But first of all, I think you were -- last time you were there was October. Describe for me how difficult it is to get in there. Because when we hear doctors are getting into Gaza, we always think medical care will improve. But in many cases, it's difficult to even bring some of the instruments they need. DR. ANA JEELANI, PEDIATRIC ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON, MEDICAL AID FOR PALESTINIANS:  Yes. So I've been to Gaza twice. The first time we went through Rafah and the second time we went through Allenby and the Kerem Shalom crossing. And the second time, particularly in October, when there are more restrictions and we were told not to take any medical equipment, we could only take personal medication, our bags were checked. And it's incredibly difficult. We're going in without any of our tools, even simple things like bandages and medications, paracetamol. We could not take anything in. And that was stipulated by COGAT, who coordinate our movements inside Gaza.",

You do -- you don't stop bleeding.And when you don't stop bleeding, your muscles don't get oxygen. And then you die. And it's a well-known thing in the medical world. So you know, all these injuries that are coming in, that are still constant bombardments that are happening and constant shelling attacks by quadcopters and sniper shots that we see in the hospitals. All of these children and men and women that are sustaining these injuries are not going to survive. And part of that is because they are cold. It's not just the patients. A lot of the people who work in hospitals, the healthcare workers, they've been displaced. They're in those tents. I remember a colleague of mine saying he couldn't come to work that day because his tent had completely washed away and he'd lost all of his belongings. So it's not only the patients but it's the people who are trying, you know, regardless of the circumstance, to provide healthcare that are being affected. And the cold just compounds all of this. And we've seen reports of, you know, babies dying of hypothermia. It's cold. I was there in March the first time. And, you know, the nights were cold.

I mean, the rumor mill has really been swirling around Butler's future with the team for the last month or so.And now it seems that this is not going to be resolved in an amicable way. After reportedly asking the team for a trade, Butler doubled down on that request publicly. On Thursday, he told reporters after a loss that he wants to get his joy back from playing basketball and that he really cannot envision that happening while still on Miami's roster. So Miami is now suspending Butler seven games. The team citing actions detrimental to the team over the course of the season and in particular the last few weeks. This all comes as the Heat are in the middle of a playoff race right now, currently the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. So much more to come on this story as those two continue to battle. In the meantime, the list of accolades for LeBron James keeps growing, despite leading what feels like pretty much every statistical category in the league right now. There had been one milestone that had eluded the global superstar. Michael Jordan played in almost 500 fewer games than LeBron but he still held the scoring record for the most career 30-point games. Now LeBron James owns that one, too. After a 30-point effort in the Lakers' 119-102 win over Atlanta on Friday night, he now has 563 30-point games to date and counting for King James. Just incredible longevity that he has had in his career. Elsewhere, the final week of the NFL's regular season kicks off later on Saturday with two games. You've got a divisional doubleheader, both with huge playoff implications. A Ravens win over the Browns in the early game earns them the AFC North title and the three seed. A loss would open the door for the Steelers to win it in the late game. However, the team is playing Joe Burrow and the Bengals, so that is a tough task. After starting the season 1-4, they are now riding a four- game win streak and at 8-8, they also need wins and losses by the Broncos and Dolphins if they want to keep their long shot playoff hopes alive.

It's certainly the most stomach churning. I'll try to get through this as best I can. That is University of Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck getting an entire jug of mayo poured on him after his team won their postseason bowl game. The game is sponsored by the Duke's mayo company, which explains the mayonnaise bath. But it does not explain why Fleck is so excited. College football is quirky in this way. I'm trying not to look at it, to be honest, because it's not something that I'm particularly interested in seeing. But a little bit of fun in the college game and a lot to look forward to on the NFL side.",
