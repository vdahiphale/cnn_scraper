I mean, he mentioned Texas three times in a very short period of time describing where he lives. I mean, this is a tough campaign to watch. Herschel Walker was a fantastic football player from the University of Georgia, won the Heisman Trophy. He had a fairly good career in the NFL too. Whether or not he is qualified to be a senator and whether or not he is steeped in any sort of policy issues, I think that'll be up to the voters to decide. But I think so far he hasn't been a very credible messenger. I think a lot of Republicans down there. You saw that in some of the split ticket voting, they voted for the top of the ticket, Brian Kemp, and either didn't vote at all or voted for Warnock. And Warnock is trying to sort of explore those fissures by pointing to Walker's own garbled speech and messaging on any number of topics.",

Those are high numbers that's broken the records as of today. But to your point, the lieutenant governor of Georgia who is not a Donald Trump fan and not a Herschel Walker fan, let's be quite clear about that says this though about the campaign.Herschel Walker was granted a mulligan in the form of runoff, an extra four weeks to convince the 200,000 Georgians who pulled the lever for Governor Kemp and Senator Warnock to change their minds. It certainly doesn't feel like he's made enough progress on that mission. And he's running out of time. And he's not the only Republican in Georgia to essentially be saying, you know, we got the bad -- we got a bad candidate here. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: And that's why Republicans when it was clear that this was going to a runoff, Republican sources told me that it is essential that Brian Kemp gets heavily involved in this race to convince those Republicans who didn't vote for -- that voted for him didn't vote for Walker, to vote for Walker a second time. So we'll see, the race is in a week, less than a week. KING: It's not just the candidate, I think the candidate has been disappointing to Republicans who support him. But if you are running this campaign 101, if you have somebody who has lived in two states or lived in several states, you have to clean all this, you clean all this up months ago. You don't have a guy on the campaign trail yesterday saying I've lived in Georgia all my life when you know, because the K-file team reaches out to them to comment. Instead, there's audio of him saying I live in Texas. I live in Texas, I live in Texas.",

And to your point, John, this is not the first time that somebody has run for the Senate after having lived in a different state. There's a long history of that and both parties, but they do it with some delicacy and even precision. They explain why they're there. They perhaps do a listening tour of the said state. And they set it up in a way that Herschel Walker just never did.And I think it's emblematic of the challenges with his candidacy at large. It was never done with any sort of obvious and sort of meticulous rationale. It was sort of done on the fly. Why? I think a lot of Republicans solved the Trump example and took all the wrong lessons from it. OK, that you can just make it up as you go and sort of steamroll your way through media accountability. It doesn't matter anymore. None of that counts. And guess what, gravity does still apply.",
