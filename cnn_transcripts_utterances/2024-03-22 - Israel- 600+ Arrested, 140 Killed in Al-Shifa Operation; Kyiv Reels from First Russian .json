Now, just ahead of the phase of campaigning when the Delhi chief minister, Kejriwal, would be on the ground, asking people for what's ahead of the general elections, the Enforcement Directorate, which is the federal financial crime agency, which interestingly, comes under the Modi government here in India, arrested Kejriwal on Thursday evening. There was high drama playing out inside and outside his residence. There were several E.D. officials that we're seeing there on the ground. And a couple of hours later, they took the chief minister of Delhi with them. And that's when the party, the Aam Aadami Party -- he's the leader of the Aam Aadami Party 00 came out and issued statements over and over again, saying that Arvind Kejriwal has been arrested. A bit on the case. In terms of the Enforcement Directory, they've come out and said that several politicians from Arvind Kejriwal's party, including him, have -- are now facing charges of corruption and taking kickbacks from an alcohol licensing policy. Now, these claims have been denied by Arvind Kejriwal and the others from his cabinet who have already been arrested. A lot of the leaders from his cabinet, in fact, have been in jail for over a year without bail. Now, talking about the elections, why is Arvind Kejriwal a prominent opposition leader? And what does this mean for the Indian elections? Well, Kejriwal's party is a relatively new party, Michael, but it's also a small party. It actually grew from an anticorruption campaign. And today, he's the Delhi chief minister two times over. Not only does Delhi --is Delhi governed by Arvind Kejriwal, but they've also got the neighboring state of Punjab that they govern. And this is something that critics say that the Modi government and the Bharatiya Janata Party that Modi's the leader of is not OK with. They see Arvind Kejriwal as a thorn in their side. Now Kejriwal has made it very clear that he wants to make this party a national party in the coming years. And perhaps that's one reason, according to critics, that they're not happy with the arrest off the chief minister of Delhi at a time like this, just weeks ahead of the elections. Raul Gandhi, a prominent opposition leader, has come out and made a very strong statement after the arrest. He has said, quote, \"A scared dictator wants to create a dead democracy.\" We are going to hear from the court in a while from now, like you stated. There are protests expected in the coming hours.

It also says 3.5 billion people lack access to sanitation that is safely managed. And with the climate crisis, nearly 1.5 billion people have been affected by drought between 2002 and 2021.

For more, I'm joined by UNESCO's editor in chief of the World Water Development Report,\" Richard Connor. Thanks so much for making the time. In fact, I'll start off with a quote from the report's summary, if I can. And it says, quote, \"Roughly half the world's population currently experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year. One quarter of the world's population face extremely high levels of water stress using over 80 percent of their annual renewable freshwater supply.\" I mean, they're stunning statistics. What are the real-world impacts of those realities?",

Not to mention, of course, the entire food supply real world employment prosperity overall, but employment in particular.In developing countries, 80 percent of jobs are water dependent. They're mostly in agriculture, but also the people that work in the markets or even -- even the banks in rural areas that support -- that support the farmers.",

Wet places are generally, generally getting wetter.But even the wetter places doesn't mean they're going to have more water available, because it'll come in more extreme precipitation events. And there's no -- not necessarily a way to store that water for further dry periods. So overall, climate change will increase, or at least the intensity of most of the water availability crises worldwide.",

You've had water conflicts. There is mass migration. You know, there -- so there's all kinds of other crises, but water is closely related to them. And in fact, water for the most part, is a necessary -- a necessary part of the solutions. Unfortunately, if you compare, for instance, water and energy, energy is very much seen as an economic issue. And so it does get a lot of, -- a lot of attention from decision-makers, politicians, et cetera. Whereas water is much more seen as a social or environmental issue. Yet water under -- really, as I said at the beginning, it really underpins prosperity. So by, maybe by recognizing the economic import -- importance of water as a driver of growth in the economy, hopefully that will get a little bit more attention from decision-makers.",
