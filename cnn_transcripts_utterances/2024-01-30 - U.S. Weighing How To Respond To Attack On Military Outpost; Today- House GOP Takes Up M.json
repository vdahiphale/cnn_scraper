Just before 5President Biden has promised a response to the drone attack that killed three U.S. service members and injured more than 30 others at a U.S. military outpost in Jordan. The administration has concluded the drone was launched by a military backed by Iran. The U.S. knows that Tehran supplies these proxy groups with money, weapons, training, and supplies. But a host of questions remain unanswered and at the top of that list, what exactly was Iran's role in this attack and critically, what should the U.S. do about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

David, good morning to you. Thank you very much for being with us this morning.The White House obviously in a tight spot here. You have a new piece out in the Times outlining what some of their options are and the various risks associated with them. Can you walk us through how you think about what's on the table here? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, WHITE HOUSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  Sure, Kasie, and good morning. The problem with the choices that the president has is that they range from the unsatisfactory at one end to the very risky at the other. So the unsatisfactory version is basically to do just more of what he's been doing so far, which has been hitting the proxy groups that are using, as you said, Iranian arms or intelligence, or money, but aren't necessarily taking their instructions and their targeting from Tehran. They can do that. The problem is they've been doing that for weeks in Syria, in Iraq, and, of course, in Yemen, and so far it has not been a deterrent. At the other end of the extreme, of course, is to strike the Iranians in Iran, which is what many of his Republican critics have been calling for him to do, saying it would be a sign of weakness if they didn't do it. It's interesting to note that even President Trump, when he was in office, stopped short of doing that when he had many different opportunities along the way because that could open up the possibility of conflict with Iran itself. And so you're likely to see something in between. Maybe strikes on Islamic Revolutionary Guard members and units outside of Iran.",

Kirby was at the podium yesterday insisting he's not thinking about that as he makes these decisions -- but it does loom over everything. And the former president, Donald Trump, is out there saying well, if I was in office this wouldn't happen.What -- how do you think about the difference between these two men, President Biden and former President Trump, as they run against each other?

There were American troops killed by Iranian-backed militias during the time of his presidency and he showed up at a number of services for them and so forth and had to make similar decisions along the way. And as I said, usually, at the last minute, erred on the side of caution.In the -- in this case, John Kirby is right. President Biden shouldn't be making an election-related decision here. He's got to calibrate this in the way that he thinks will have the largest chance of both de-escalating and sending a message to the Iranians. He's got lots of options, including signaling to Iran through the Europeans and through other interlocutors that he's going to do \"X\" and if they don't respond then this will be over, but they should get the message. I'm not sure any of this is going to work because each of these proxy groups operates with their own set of individual interests and they're not under the direct thumb of Tehran. And that's the problem with having proxy groups fighting wars, which is sometimes they do really stupid things.",

The articles, first released on Sunday, accuse Mayorkas of, quote, \"Refusing to comply with the law\" and \"Breach of public trust\" in his handling of the southern border. In response, Democrats released a 29-page report yesterday defending him. They titled it, quote, \"Republican Abuse of Power: The Sham Impeachment.\" Let's bring in senior congressional reporter for Punchbowl News, Andrew Desiderio. Andrew, good morning. It's wonderful to have you here. We're kind of seeing this split screen on Capitol Hill on the border. You've got House Republicans who are, of course, trying to impeach the Homeland Security secretary, on the one hand. But on the other hand, Senate Republicans are trying to work on a bipartisan border deal with Mayorkas. I mean, this really seems to underscore how they are not on the same page, no?",

Mayorkas and other Biden administration officials on a bipartisan border security package that includes some of the policy changes that House Republicans have been pushing for in the first place.And they're also saying pretty openly, actually, that they don't think that pursuing an impeachment of Sec. Mayorkas is a worthy battle. Number one, because, of course, the Democrat-led Senate is going to quickly acquit him. And secondly is that changing the secretary doesn't necessarily change the policies that you're trying to fix at the border, right? There's just going to be someone new in there who is going to enforce the same policies that you as a Republican member don't like. And so, what they're saying is the best way to actually change the policies is to work with them and to pass new legislation. And right now, Senate Republicans feel like they have Democrats in a very strong -- in a very strong place in terms of the leverage they have over them. Because Democrats really want this foreign aid package to go through for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, and Republicans have said you're not going to get that unless you agree to these border policy changes. But, of course, what's happened over the last couple of weeks is not only have House Republicans started to pursue this impeachment effort against Sec. Mayorkas but you've seen former President Trump come out against this emerging Senate agreement -- and the thinking being that this is not good for him politically because it gives Biden a chance to point to something as a victory of sorts with regard to the border, which has been an issue that has plagued him, really, his whole presidency.",

So, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland finally ruled yesterday that 17-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was guilty of an anti-doping violation, so she was handed a four-year ban after testing positive for a heart medication that could boost endurance. Valieva had said she ingested that drug accidentally. Now, the ban is backdated to December of 2021, which is when the sample was collected. The results of the test came to light after the figure skating team event in Beijing where Valieva and the Russian team finished in first place ahead of Team USA. So no medals were handed out amid the controversy but the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee confirmed to CNN that the American team will now finally be awarded the gold medal. No word yet on when or where that medal ceremony will be held. All right.

Fourth quarter, LeBron going for the rebound and Brooks' arm just kind of hits LeBron in the face there. The refs would take another look at it and give Brooks a flagrant foul.
