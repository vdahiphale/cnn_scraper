We are also today learning that the gunman in the Michigan state tragedy once had a weapons charge against him in 2019. He had been charged with carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. That is a felony, would have prevented him from ever owning legally another gun. But that case never went to trial, instead, the suspected gunman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor possession of a loaded firearm and that lesser charge allowed him to legally own a gun. Let's bring in Stephen Gutowski. He's the founder of \"The Reload\", a news publication on firearms policy and politics, also a CNN contributor. Thanks for being here, Steven. I really appreciate it as always. So, how common is this where reduced charges could have stopped a future gunman from possessing a weapon, that act of reducing the charges?",

She's associate dean of public health at Brown University and a professor of emergency medicine. Dr. Ranney, thanks for joining us. So, Fetterman obviously suffered that stroke last May and continues to deal with lingering auditory processing issues. Is it common for people dealing with these very serious medical issues that are continuing to also experience depression at least partly as a result? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, ASSOCIATE DEAN OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BROWN UNIVERSITY: Absolutely. It's very normal for people who go through an acute medical illness or an acute trauma to have trouble with coping afterwards. Sometimes people can have symptoms that are similar to post-traumatic stress. Sometimes they can get anxiety or depressive symptoms. People who have a prior history of depression are at highest risk of a relapse of depression after a major medical challenge like a stroke. And we know that Senator Fetterman pushed himself so hard in those weeks after the stroke when in an ideal world, he would have been recovering. It is unfortunately not surprising that he is experiencing recurring symptoms now. I'm proud of him for recognizing them and getting treatment, which not everyone knows to do.",

The fact that he was, does that suggest to you that it's more severe in this case? RANNEYget a higher level of care than the average American. The truth is most Americans don't get treated for depression or other mental illness in general. More than half of Americans aren't able to access treatment, sometimes because of financial reasons, but as so many of us have experienced over the pandemic, sometimes just because there's no one to provide care. So his hospitalization might mean that he's more serious. If I were caring for someone in the emergency department, I would hospitalize them if they were suicidal or if their depression were so severe that they were unable to care for themselves. On the other hand, again, a senator or a representative, there might be a slightly lower bar for hospitalization and it might just allow quicker treatment.",
