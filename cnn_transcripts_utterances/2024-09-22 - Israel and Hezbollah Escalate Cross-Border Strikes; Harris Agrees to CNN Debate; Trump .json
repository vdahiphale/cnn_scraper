Israel says it's been conducting new strikes against the Iran-backed group in Lebanon today. That's after Hezbollah launched more than 100 projectiles into Israel overnight, according to the IDF, like this one.Well, that was the moment an explosion rattled a town in northern Israel earlier. Israel says some of Hezbollah's projectiles were shot down, but there was at least one direct hit, and falling debris caused fires and injured at least four people. The IDF has announced new restrictions on public activities in northern Israel and parts of the occupied Golan Heights. And an Israeli official says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is delaying his trip to the U.N. General Assembly until Friday for now. For more, we're joined by Ben Wedeman from Beirut. So, Ben, the escalation seems to be only worsening. What's the latest there?",

It said this was in response to repeated strikes that have led to the deaths of many Lebanese civilians.What we're seeing is that they are reaching further into Israel than any Hezbollah rockets have reached since the 2006 war, certainly since October of last year. Now, according to statements from Hezbollah, the targets of their strikes included the Ramat David Airbase, as well as the Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which is in the northern Israeli city of Haifa. Now, what we're seeing from the Israeli side is that there have been direct hits in areas perhaps as deep as 50 kilometers within Israel. No word on fatalities, however. There does seem to be some physical damage to cars and homes and whatnot. This definitely does represent a major escalation, yet another step in this escalatory process that began last Tuesday with those Pager and then Walkie-Talkie attacks, and then Friday's Israeli strike on Beirut, which the death toll to that has now reached 45, 16 of which were members of Hezbollah. The rest, we assume, were civilians, including women and children. Kim?",

He could say things that sound even crazier.And people who are watching the debate also commented that there were questions about his mental fitness, where he seemed very sharp and on top of things compared to the debate he had with Biden. Once he had to debate Harris, he really seemed out of his depth. So it may make things worse for him if he were to debate again. But of course, there's a lot of pressure on Vance. And Vance has had a very troubled start to joining Donald Trump's ticket. He's been accused of all different kinds of things. Everything he says seems to really irk people more than draw people in.

So he's going to want to distance himself from this because it could affect the outcome.The way I think it will affect the outcome is it might just depress Republican voter turnout to that state. It won't affect the Senate election because there's no Senate race. It probably won't affect the House races because they're so heavily gerrymandered. But it will affect those state-level races. And Trump only won the state by just over a point four years ago. So it was tight then. It's incredibly tight now. And Harris' team has capitalized on this, putting together ads about how close Trump and Robinson's views really are. And what that's going to do, as I mentioned, is probably going to depress Republican turnout. And that's critical in a state that is so hotly contested. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Biden is heard saying, quote, \"We believe Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China diplomatic relationships. And he's also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China's interests. Now, the White House has declined to comment any further about this specific moment. But if you take a look at the joint statement released on Saturday, Kim, you can tell that China's grownly assertiveness in the South China Sea is a cause for concern for all four countries and their leaders. In their joint statement, they also condemn North Korea's ballistic missile launches, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But again, no other country is featured as prominently as China. Now, looking back at past Quad summits, Kim, you can tell that a common and reoccurring theme is how these four countries can improve their maritime security alliance in the face of an increasingly aggressive China. But what's new and different about this specific summit is how these four countries for the very first time ever announced a joint Coast Guard exercise. Here's what Biden had to say about that exercise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: We're announcing a series of initiatives to deliver real positive impact for the Indo-Pacific.

The Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will be leading office later this week. We'll get a new Prime Minister.
