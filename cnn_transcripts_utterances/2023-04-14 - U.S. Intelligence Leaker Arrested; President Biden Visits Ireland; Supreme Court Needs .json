Why scientists are turning towards Jupiter in the hunt. And we begin with the damaging leaks of highly classified Pentagon documents that have the U.S. and its allies rattled. Twenty-one-year- old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira is expected to make his first appearance in court in the hours ahead. The FBI arrested Teixeira Thursday in connection with that case. The Air Force says he was a Cyber Transport Systems Journeyman, among those responsible for the military's global communications network. U.S. officials believe Teixeira was the leader of an online chat group known as Thug Shaker Central where he posted documents about the war in Ukraine and U.S. spying operations. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a review of who has access to intelligence and the Pentagon spokesperson called the leaks a deliberate criminal act. CNN's Oren Lieberman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMAN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A 21-year- old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard is in custody, arrested in connection to the massive leak of classified documents online. The FBI swooping in on Dighton, Massachusetts, a tactical team moving in to arrest Jack Teixeira after surveilling him for a couple of days, a U.S. official said. The plan was to arrest Teixeira when he left the house away from the stash of weapons, they worried he might have. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Today, the Justice Department arrested Jack Douglas Teixeira in connection with an investigation into alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information. LIEBERMAN (voice-over):  The arrest comes after a fast-moving search by the U.S. government only one week after President Joe Biden and other senior U.S. leaders were briefed about the leak that exposed the trove of top-secret documents. The documents were accessible to thousands of people, military and civilian. But the digital trail of information led investigators to a small group for closer scrutiny, allowing the FBI to home in on a suspect. The Pentagon having to explain how such young members of the military have access to such national secrets.",

He really tried to avoid getting drawn in directly to the disputes that these two sides have.Remember, it's over this right this -- those Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland, but it was interesting. As soon as he crossed over the border into the Republic of Ireland, and then he spoke yesterday at the parliament, he said he thought that the United Kingdom actually needed to do more to help bring this power sharing agreement back into fruition so, that those institutions that are part of the Good Friday Agreement can be fully fulfilled. And so, it remains to be seen. You've heard some pushback from the unionist leaders in Northern Ireland. They aren't necessarily convinced that the president is a neutral arbiter and all of this.

Doctors will now be instructed to only prescribed if mifepristone up to seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the 10 weeks now. However, doctors typically do have discretion to ignore those instructions and it will get harder to access the pill. Women will have to see a doctor in person and pick it up instead of talking to a doctor online and receiving it by mail.

The spacecraft is 85 square meters solar panels that we need also to protect against the radiation environment. The other challenges that we want to make precise measurement of electric and magnetic field around Jupiter and the icy moons. It's very important for our science objective to study the liquid water in particular, and for that we need to have a very clean spacecraft from the electromagnetic point of view. We don't want to measure the disturbances from the spacecraft. We want to measure the electric field and magnetic field from the environment around the icy moons. And for that we need to build a very clean spacecraft, and we managed. That's one of the most challenges of the mission.",

And the first step is to find places that we call habitable so -- that have all the ingredients necessary for life.And one of the many ingredient is the liquid water. So, we need to find places in the solar system where we have liquid water. And it looks like the icy moons of Jupiter but also around other giant planet may be the best place to find liquid water. This is why we go there. So, that will be the first step to characterize those liquid water where all the oceans? How deep they are underneath the surface? How much water do we have? What is the composition? That will be the first step to understand this environment. And then if we are -- if we find that these environments are interesting for life, the next mission will be to -- maybe to search for life.",

We have two orbiting session, one around Jupiter, and one around the Ganymede moon that believe the first time that will orbit the moon of another planet.We have certified fly-bys of the icy moons doing that mission, so Callisto, Europa and Ganymede. So, in terms of navigation, it will be quite complex and there will be always a lot of opportunities to do science. Sometimes, like Jupiter, sometimes like the moon, sometimes in the system, I.O. (ph) the dust. So, we need to carefully plan all those observations and to plan four - five years of observation, we need four, five years at least of work with the scientists to make sure that we have the best operation sequence, because we have to take care of the priority of the mission. The power (ph) available on board -- we don't have a lot of power -- only the power of a microwave oven to power all the instrument and the spacecraft. We are far from the earth, so we have a limited amount of data that we can get back on earth. So, we need to take that all into account to do the best science planning and it will take four or five years.",
