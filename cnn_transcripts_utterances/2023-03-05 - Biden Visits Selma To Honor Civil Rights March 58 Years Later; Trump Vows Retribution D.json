A painful but galvanizing moment in the civil rights movement. It was 58 years ago that white deputies and state troopers violently turned on peaceful demonstrators. They were beginning a 54-mile march to Montgomery, the state capital, to call for equal voting rights for African-Americans. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us now from Selma.

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, President Biden's purpose here in Selma, Alabama, today is really two-fold. The White House has said that he wants to commemorate the day, the events of Bloody Sunday 58 years ago so that they will not be erased from America's memory.The president will be speaking in just a short while with a backdrop of the Edmund Pettis Bridge right behind him, that bridge where civil rights and voting rights activists crossed 58 years ago and were severely beaten by many white officers. One of those activists at the time was the late Congressman John Lewis. Now the president in his remarks today is also expected to once again try to put the spotlight on the need for voting rights legislation. In the 2020 campaign, that was one of the really central tenets, one of main promises that President Biden made to voters, that he would try to enact new voting rights protections for Americans across the country. But so far the legislative action up on Capitol Hill has simply been stalled. They were unable to pass two pieces of legislation in the Democratic- controlled House and Senate. That was the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, then another For the People Voting Rights Bill as well. And now they're facing an even more uphill climb as Republicans have control of the House. And while the president has advocated and tried to stress the need for voting rights legislation, there have been many activists who have been frustrated with the inability to actually get anything across the finish line up on Capitol Hill. So here in Selma, Alabama, the president is expected to renew his call for more voting rights legislation. I will also note that the president is visiting a community that was devastated by tornadoes back in January. The president could potentially speak to that as well. That's another issue that's been facing so many people here in Selma, Alabama.",

It was mentioned that we should be working for the people of Africa. For years I was chairman of the African Affairs Subcommittee in the United States Senate, and we've invested -- my wife just got back from Zambia and Namibia. She's there all the time. We just made sure we have billions of dollars committed to build Africa. Angola is going to have the largest solar facility in all of Africa.

On this bridge, blood was given to help redeem the soul of America.\" Last time he was here, I was with him, John Lewis. They were his words. Mayor Perkins, Congresswoman Terri Sewell, members of Congress, all of you who are here, Charles Mauldin and all the foot soldiers of Selma, distinguished guests, you are among the final words of our dear friend John Lewis, delivered as he stood on the bridge over troubled waters three years ago. [16:10:15] I had the privilege to stand here with him. Words that give meaning to the past and purpose to the future. I've been on this bridge before as vice president, as a candidate for president. I was even here before as a senator. Because history matters. And now I'm here as your president. The truth matters, notwithstanding what the other team is trying to hide. They're trying to hide the truth. No matter how hard some people try, we can't just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. We should learn everything. The good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation. And everyone should know the truth of Selma. Six hundred believers put faith in action to march across that bridge named after the Grand Dragon of the KKK. They were on their way to the state capitol in Montgomery to claim their fundamental right to vote, laid in the bedrock of our Constitution but stolen by hate, harbored in too many hearts. With unflinching courage, foot soldiers for March for Justice marched through the valley of the shadow of death, and they feared no evil. The forces of hate conspired to demise, but they endured. They forced the country to confront the hard truths and to act to keep the promise of America alive. I was a student up north in the Civil Rights Movement. I remember feeling how guilty I was. I wasn't here. How could we all be up there and you going through what you went through, looking at those -- I can still picture, I you can still picture the troopers with their batons and wands and whips. A promise that declares we're all created and deserve to be treated equally. Two weeks later, they marched to Montgomery with Dr. King, an even bigger coalition of people from different races and faiths. Five months later, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law five months later. (APPLAUSE)",

That grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.We weren't poor, but we weren't wealthy.

I don't remember anything trickling down on my dad's kitchen table with the trickle-down economic problems. Because when we do that, we build from the middle out and the bottom up, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does very well, and the wealthy still do well. We all do well. But we know there's work to do, especially as you recover from this devastating tornado and the storms that hit in January.

Just up to 4500 civilians remain, it's been estimated officials say only 5 to 10 residents are leaving each day. And joining me now, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to talk about this. Mr. Secretary, always great to have you on. It does seem to be a critical time for Ukrainian forces around Bakhmut after so many months of fighting to take control of that area. How much of a political prize is this for Russia if they can seize this part of Ukraine?",

I'm not sure it's that important, a strategic military target because it's been destroyed by the Russians and turned into ashes. And so I understand the game of trying to gain any territory you can. But I think this is more of a preliminary step for both sides in terms of kind of getting ready for the next chapter in this war, which is going to involve some serious offensives on both sides. Not just Russia, but I think Ukraine will conduct an offensive. And I think it's going to be a critical moment that will tell us a lot about the future of this war.",

In a draft budget report released this morning, China unveiled its annual military budget for this year, which shows an increase of just over 7% to roughly $224 billion.China keeps ramping things up on the military front.

And we have to pay attention to the amount of money they're putting into defense, into space, what they're doing in terms of militarizing the South China Sea, their threats to Taiwan. So it is of concern.And our intelligence officials, our military officials have to constantly analyze what steps China is taking in order to be prepared to counter whatever they do. Look, the only way to deal with China is from strength. So it's very important that the United States make very clear where the lines are in terms of Taiwan, in terms of the South China Sea, in terms of just their defense buildup and where it's should go. Ultimately, you would hope that we could reestablish some kind of dialogue with China, but we're not there yet. And I suspect we're probably going to go through a very tense period in our relationship before hopefully we're able to talk to one another.",

We're going to keep an eye on this. We're going to bring you images from that as it happens. This is a very important moment for President Biden. It shows so much in terms of love for the civil rights movement in this country when a president does this.

In the meantime, it appears a big hurdle has been cleared in the push to hold former President Trump liable for injured police and members of Congress on January 6. The Justice Department says those civil cases should move forward and it's now up to a federal appeals court to rule on the matter. CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Michael Fanone joins us now. He's also the author of Hold the Line and a former D.C. Metro police officer who was attacked at the Capitol on January 6. Mike, great to see you. We don't know how the appeals court is going to come down on this, but what does this mean in terms of a step for officers like yourself who were badly injured on January 6?
