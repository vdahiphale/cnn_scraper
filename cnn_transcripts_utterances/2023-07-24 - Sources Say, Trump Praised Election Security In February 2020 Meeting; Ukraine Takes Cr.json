This is a meeting in February 2020, and Trump was convening a meeting in the Oval Office with some of his top security officials, and the subject is really the security of the upcoming election. And all of the great work that parts of the administration had done to try to secure those election, which they believe was absolutely prepared to be one of the most secure election in history.And the former president at the time, he was still president, he suggested that all of the good work really needed to be out there. He suggested that the FBI, that the Homeland Security Department actually have a press conference to talk about all the work they had done to secure the election. Of course, only a few weeks later, the former president started talking about how he had fears about mail-in ballots, had fears about fraud in the election. Of course, we saw, Wolf, once the former president did not like the election results later that year, he turned completely and started disregarding the work of all of his experts, his administration's own experts, and started listening to people who were non-experts, people who were telling him that the election was the result of fraud, obviously from Venezuela, from Italian satellites and Chinese hacking. All of this, of course, is something that jack smith and his team are looking into. We know that they have asked questions about this meeting to at least one witness, who described really the mindset of the former president. He was listening to his experts at a certain point during that year and then later on disregarded those very experts. Again, we don't know whether this will play a role in any potential charges that the former president might be facing, but certainly it's something that Jack Smith and his team have been digging in on.",

And you combine that with testimony that we know is coming from certain White House aides and staffers who said either Donald Trump, at times, acknowledged that he lost the election, at other times was advised by reliable sources that there was no fraud.

Several of his top campaign advisers are at Bedminster. They were meeting all day long, having conversations about what you would in a normal presidential campaign, budgeting, scheduling. We know that he's hosting the Ohio lawmakers or Ohio lawmakers who are supporters of his at his Bedminster club tonight and then going to a fundraiser in Louisiana tomorrow.

A lot of courts found that, and I think prosecutors have to be ready for that defense. And those documents, I think, prosecutors believe, will help them argue that the, quote/unquote, evidence that Donald Trump was given a fraud was really nothing and unsubstantiated.

I mean, it's possible to indict him for a conspiracy with an unindicted co- conspirator, but that would be really tactically, a very challenging thing to do, and I think people would not accept it.So, someone from his inner circle is going to end up playing that role, most likely as an indicted co-conspirator.

So, I think for his campaign, there may be questions about tactical changes, but unless he is overhauling an entirely different message, I don't think that he's going to be able to get traction with the mainstream voters that he needs to ultimately win a general election. And here's the other thing I would say. Even if his campaign is able to do that, even if he's able to become the nominee, he's going to be dealing with an aggrieved Donald Trump who is going to be angry, who's going to be -- I mean, can we imagine a world where Donald Trump says Ron DeSantis rightfully won the nomination?

Now, protesters reacted angrily in the streets here in Jerusalem and across Tel Aviv. They're actually still out on the streets of Tel Aviv. They've been blocking highways. They've been forcibly removed by police, in some instances with force, and also using things like water cannons as well. We've seen mounted police used as well. We have seen at least 19 arrests. We're also hearing from police that at least a dozen of their officers have been injured. Further reactions have been immediate. Legal challenges actually being filed in the Supreme Court to try and get an injunction on this legislation to stop it from being enacted. That will lead to some very interesting legal challenges, where the Supreme Court will likely hear legal challenges on its own ability to rule against the government. And there also has been a general strike announced by the Israeli Medical Association. Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing the nation in a primetime address, saying that they were carrying out the will of the people.
