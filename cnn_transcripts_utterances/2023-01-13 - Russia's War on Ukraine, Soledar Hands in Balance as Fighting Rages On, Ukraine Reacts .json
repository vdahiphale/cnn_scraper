He had introduced these ideas, like you know massive spending hike in defense. And doing more counterattack capabilities. He had talked about that publicly. But he didn't get much traction because of this pacifist constitution. Because the Japanese public truly believes in defending themselves but not going beyond what the constitution allows.Prime Minister Kishida is really building on those efforts now quite frankly, benefiting from the security environment around the world right now and with Russia and China. So, in Japan, the public opinion has really shifted and the people-- everyday, people are seeing that Ukrainians are dying, that Russians are being aggressive and their feeling the threat of what could happen in their neighborhood. [03:30:00] So, public opinion on becoming more aggressive in their defense has actually shifted and the Japanese public wants more muscular military now to defend themselves. So, Prime Minister Kishida is really building off that public support for wanting to be more aggressive. But where he faces some pushback now is how to actually pay for defense spending increase and possibly raise taxes.",

And in turn, that normally cools much of the planet. But as you can see, aside from that one area across the eastern equatorial pacific, we are seeing warmer than normal temperatures across much of the globe. In fact, we had some pretty significant rain events. We know that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture in turn will produce rainier storms. We had 1,000 year rainfall events this summer all across the U.S., several of those. We also had significant heat waves across, not only the U.S., but Europe as well as Asia. We're getting ever so close to that 1.5 degree Celsius number and we also had extreme flooding in Pakistan. You can see this from August 28, the before and after.
