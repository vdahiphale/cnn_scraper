Obviously, the brutality, on the ground, in Ukraine, the targeting of civilians, in the lead-up to a very difficult winter, has created real problems on its own.

But there have been divergences in terms of whether or not to speak to President Putin, whether or not to seek negotiations, even if the Ukrainians weren't at that point yet. When you listen to the two leaders speak, I'm told, it very much reflected what happened behind-the-scenes, in the meeting, one French official saying that President Biden and President Macron agreeing that more battlefield gains, by the Ukrainians, are critical to put them in the negotiating position, or a better negotiating position, in the future. And President Macron making very clear, explicitly, not hedging at all that there should be no negotiations. There will be no negotiations without the Ukrainians saying it is time for that to move forward, no sustainable peace, otherwise. And also, President Biden, opening the door, to speak directly, to President Putin, making clear, not right now, it's not the right time. There are many caveats tied to that. But that has been a difference between he, and President Macron. Macron has continued a line of communication, with President Putin, unsuccessful, up to this point.

Instead, on Thursday, offering scenes, of very different crowds, somber people, lining the streets of Shanghai, honoring former Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin. He died, Wednesday, at the age of 96. Jiang is being given the country's highest honors. His open casket met at the airport, in Beijing, by current Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. Jiang was President of China, from 1993 to 2003, famous for his trademark spectacles, and for periodically bursting into song. (VIDEO - FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, JIANG ZEMIN, SINGING) WATSON (voice-over): His death has triggered a wave of nostalgia, on the heavily-censored Chinese internet. \"Who would have thought that movies, books and even World Cup live streams... have all been censored,\" one person wrote in a post that appears to have since been deleted by censors. \"I miss the old man that just passed away; I miss the old times that were open, lively, embracing and renaissance-like.\"",

Hu Jintao last shared a stage, with Xi, at October's tightly-scripted Communist Party Congress. He was ushered out of the hall, seemingly against his will. A strange, apparently, unscripted moment, for a government, that prioritizes control, above all else. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But the changes now are really piecemeal. You've got some cities that are loosening some of their lockdowns. Meanwhile, we're counting, as of Thursday, lockdowns in at least 30 different cities, across the country. Winter is coming. Even if it loosens up, in China, more, you've still got tens of millions of Chinese senior citizens that haven't had a third vaccine jab that are vulnerable. If they start getting very sick, in large numbers, the question is going to be, will the Chinese government risk the wrath of its own population, to go back to these lockdowns, again?

And that's something that hasn't happened in decades.And while there are some concerns about air quality, and a major road that could be impacted, in the days ahead, authorities say there's no threat to the people, and the community, which means we can all use a moment, like this, to just stop and take in the Wonder, to forget however briefly about the man-made eruptions that fill the headlines, and simply marvel, at nature.

It moved to the Southeast Rift Zone, which is an area, where lava has been known to be extruded, in the past. And then now, it's moved to the Northeast Rift Zone.
