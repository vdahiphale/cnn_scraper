We are tracking this epic weather system as it unleashes record cold, heavy snow, freezing rain and flooding across the country and creates holiday travel chaos.The other major story that we're following, the January 6th committee's final report laying the blame for the insurrection squarely on former President Donald Trump. We are breaking down all the top lines from the massive report and whether it paves the way for Trump to be indicted. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Brianna Keilar and you are in THE SITUATION ROOM. We are following these blizzard conditions, life-threatening record low temperatures and treacherous travel all just two days before Christmas as a massive winter storm is slamming much of the eastern U.S. We are covering all of the extreme and dangerous weather with our correspondents in key locations across the country. Let's begin with CNN's Polo Sandoval, he is in Buffalo. And, Polo, New York's governor is calling this storm an epic statewide hazard. We can see that from where you are. Tell us what you're seeing.",

This is what you basically get as we look over Buffalo, one of just the very few vehicles that have actually been on the highway here, at least on the street.What we have seen here are these wicked winds that have really begun to kick up early this morning. And, Brianna, let me tell you, they have been relentless. It has made visibility just entirely impossible, especially for folks that are driving not being able to see even beyond the hood of their vehicle. In fact, the National Weather Service here in Buffalo recording a wind gust of 79 miles an hour earlier today, surpassing that of one of the historic blizzards back in 1977. So, it's certainly not an exaggeration what you hear from authorities saying that this is an extraordinary snowstorm, even for the likes of Western New York here. And these are conditions, Brianna, that are far from over. We are going to see them throughout the evening into tonight, and then tomorrow. These wicked winds are going to continue to linger, and that's what's going to make Christmas Eve travel, still very difficult because of the flash freezing conditions that we're going to be seeing in the next couple of hours, especially on roads and highways. We heard from the head of the county government here basically saying that, unfortunately, he is still seeing people violating what is a driving -- a travel ban that's been in place for Erie County, New York, many of those drivers even becoming stranded on some of the roads and highways. So, some emergency crews have had to basically go out of their way to rescue some of these folks from stranded vehicles. In fact, here where we're sheltered in downtown Buffalo, we have seen some folks who simply pulled over and come in to ride the storm out at a local hotel here. So, it's really -- again, these kinds of extraordinary conditions are going to continue. When it comes to power outages, there are hundreds of thousands of power outages that have already been confirmed here in Buffalo. Authorities here in the city, Brianna, say if that's the case, it's best to simply stay home. It's much safer in a cold home wearing multiple layers than venturing out and getting stuck in this.",

On top of treacherous driving conditions in much of the country, you just heard Polo talking about those, more than 5,000 U.S. flights have been canceled today. Let's go to CNN's Omar Jimenez.

So, they need to brace for that because, well, simply, we're not used to this, right? Atlanta to Birmingham to Jackson, temperatures don't drop below freezing that frequently, and they don't normally stay below freezing for this long.Look at my graphics. I'll just give you an indication of how quickly these temperatures dropped in Atlanta. A whopping 35 degrees in eight hours as that Arctic cold front slammed into the southeast. That was overnight. You can see the temperatures going forward. We're going to stay below freezing. We are on the verge of the coldest Christmas Eve ever. That record here in Atlanta has stood for over five decades. Now, with the wind that's come through, it has knocked down trees, power lines and currently we're just at a little over 1 million customers without electricity from coast to coast. And you can see some of these temperatures out there, we're talking below zero wind chills. That's what it feels like on your exposed skin as you step outside. That's the placement of the Arctic cold front. It is barrels through the northeast, even though the snow was relatively quick in New York, it has come to an end across the northeast, places like Boston into Portland, you'll have that quick transition from rain to snow. And then where we saw that very dramatic live shot with, Polo, just a few minutes ago. He is in ground zero for the heaviest snowfall from the storm as we get that long fetch of wind right off of Lake Erie, puts Buffalo and Watertown just down from Lake Ontario, right, in the bull's eye, the sweet spot for the heaviest snow. They'll be measuring snow in feet across that particular region. So, an incredible storm, to say the least, and record breaking territory for so many people, Brianna.",

In this case, the spokes are each of these separate, independent efforts to overturn the election. So, it's the pressure campaign on Mike Pence is one of them, the fake elector scheme is one of them, the pressure on state officials is a separate one. What they all have in common, all the spokes and the wheels, they're connected to the hub. And in this case, the hub of this conspiracy is Donald Trump. He is the person that knows about all these efforts, that participates in all these efforts, that communicates with all these people, and he's the person that this effort is done for and at the wheel of.

Those all probably violate state laws as well.And I've written on that in the Just Security blog, we did a piece on that. And those states could open investigations and DOJ could join in with them, do parallel investigations. So, that's a very important piece of this.

The committee is urging here that, hey, we should follow the words of the Constitution and find some way to bar him from ever obtaining federal office again, but it's unclear how exactly they would go about that, and maybe leaving it up to the voters as to what they'd do about this. But really no mechanism in place for enforcing that provision of the Constitution, although, it seemed like the committee was sort of pushing Congress to try to make a mechanism to enforce that.

You can almost imagine those conversations taking place, Trump muting the speakerphone on his desk.But for prosecutors, it has great legal significance, because it goes to that concept of science (ph) or knowledge. So, if he's ever charged with the four crimes that have been referred or anything else, undoubtedly, one of his defenses might be, well, I truly believed that these schemes were legal and lawful strategies and that I was trying to recover an election that had been stolen from me. These little moments pierce that veil. They show you that even he didn't believe it, like even he knew what Sidney Powell was saying was crazy or when you have conversations between he and John Eastman.

I would have been salivating as a prosecutor to have this kind of evidence about intent. So, it's really going to be up to what kind of will there is in the Justice Department as they move forward with this. Sure, there are challenges. Sure, there's a lot of pressure. There is no real lack of evidence. To all the people who argue, well, different standard beyond a reasonable doubt, that's not a magical formula or an arithmetic formula. It's a question of prosecutorial discretion, looking at it from the outside, it looks like there's plenty there to make it. So, it's up to them, in my opinion.",

It is dangerously cold in D.C. right now. As the traffic starts to build, the volume starts to build on 395 north and southbound here in Washington.Now, this area caught a good break in one regard and a very bad break in another regard regarding the weather. The good break was that after the relentless rainfall starting Thursday morning and into today, officials thought that as soon as that rain stopped that the temperatures would plummet very fast, they did. But what happens after that, they thought that that would create just a sheet of ice with the water freezing on the roads. What happened right after the rain stopped was that the sun came out and the winds kicked up, and so that dried off the roads. So, what you do not have in the D.C. area is icy conditions on the roads, but the bad break they caught, Brianna, was the high winds, and we can illustrate that. Earlier today a passenger plane approaching Reagan National Airport from the south, the pilot was about to touch down. He or she decided it was just too windy. We did report wind gusts of 45 and 46 miles an hour late morning, early afternoon. That pilot decided to abort that landing and just pull up and go around again, trying to get a little bit more information on that and maybe how many other flights might have been affected that way. But the high winds here are very, very dangerous. I just got off the phone with a Maryland transportation official who told me in at least six different places in suburban Maryland near D.C., the wind causing downed trees blocking roads, major roads in both directions. So, that is a problem tonight as well. We can also tell you that flooding is going to be an issue north of here. New York, New Jersey, New England, they're starting to see some major flooding because of the snow and the rain coming down, dangerous conditions for travel there. And what one Virginia transportation official told me a short time ago was for anybody out there planning on drive long distance, whether you're going from, say, Washington, D.C., up to New York or Philly, or any place like that, check the forecast in each section of your route. Don't just check it kind of where you are immediately, check ahead, if you're driving from, say, D.C. to Philadelphia. The conditions are very different in Philadelphia from here. Here it's dangerously cold and windy. In Philadelphia they have had snow, precipitation, and those kinds of things.

In some cases, it's people who testified twice before the committee. What is your reaction to all of this evidence coming out, what you think that Americans should take away from this and from the report of the committee? REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D-CA):  This is a roadmap for the American people of the corrupt nature of Donald Trump's actions post-election 2020. And it is volumes of documentation that underscore the fact he knew he had lost. He was told so by his campaign chairman, by his campaign manager, by his pollster, and yet, he continued to pursue this rigged argument. The only thing that was rigged was the fact that he was trying to rig the results after they came in. Over a thousand witnesses, 800 pages, 18 months, I mean, you cannot walk away from this and not recognize that this is a historical document that will be with us for the rest of our lives and into other generations as how close we came to a corrupt president trying to undo an election and become a despot.",
