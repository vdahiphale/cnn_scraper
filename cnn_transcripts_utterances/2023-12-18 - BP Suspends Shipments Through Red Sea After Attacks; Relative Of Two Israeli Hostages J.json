Just this morning, we saw the USS Carney, which is a Navy destroyer, respond to a distress call from yet another vessel operating in the southern Red Sea, which was hit by multiple projectiles from Yemen, which U.S. officials say has been launched by these Houthi rebels. Over the weekend, the Carney also responded to attacks by 14 drones targeting a vessel there. And so these attacks really, according to U.S. officials there, being enabled by Iran. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser -- last week he said, quote, \"While the Houthis are pulling the trigger, they are being handed the gun by Iran.\" So, BP -- just the fourth major company to pause operations here. Obviously, it's going to have a major impact on international commerce. And the company said in a statement, quote, it \"...has decided to temporarily pause its transits.\" But it's going to \"...keep this precautionary pause under ongoing review, subject to circumstances as they evolve in the region.\" So we'll see if Sec. of Defense Austin manages to get anywhere with that multinational task force they've been discussing, guys.",

They want to have a political viability in some future in which they know Trump will have a constituency. And so they've been silent which, effectively, enables. You know, the quotes we heard at the top here -- we can't just forget that it's not Donald Trump loving dictators, which he does. The fact that Orban and Hungarian allies have been sort of a flow-through at campaign events. The praise of Putin was set up there as an applause line by the former president and he read that quote from Putin in the teleprompter. The language about immigrants poisoning the blood of America, that is now a standard part of his stump speech. So it's not a dog whistle. It's not a mistake. It is a design, and that's different and that's dangerous. And for any Republican, it is the opposite of anything resembling the Republicans in the Reagan era, which was about freedom at home and abroad. It was about free trade. It was about standing up to authoritarians and dictators. That's gone. It has been replaced with shocking rapidity with someone who is doing the exact opposite.

But for right now, in poll after poll or in the kind of objective measures we see, it hasn't borne out to be true.

They assumed good policy would be good politics. That if they passed the legislation people would come around. That hasn't necessarily happened yet, even as he's been particularly effective.

But all other indications for it are actually off-label, so only the spray is to be used for mental health purposes.Scientists and researchers are using it for other reasons. The other thing that's really important to note is that it does have hallucinogenic properties. It has psychedelic properties. It can create out-of-body experiences. It can cause euphoria. And that's the reason that it's often taken recreationally. Now, fortunately, it's very rare that people have an overdose on Ketamine. But with extremely high levels of it in your blood it can cause respiratory depression. It can cause overstimulation of the cardiovascular system, meaning very high blood pressure, very high heart rate that can cause unconsciousness.
