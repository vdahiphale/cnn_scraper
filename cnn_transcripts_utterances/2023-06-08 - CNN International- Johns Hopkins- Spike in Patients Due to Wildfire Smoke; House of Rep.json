There are risks obviously of things like respiratory disease, asthma or COPD. There is also an increased risk for heart disease as a result of exposure to wildfire smoke. And there is a specific risk for pregnant people for a slightly increased risk of preterm birth. So, there is really a recommendation to try to protect yourself.You know, doctors tell us that it's not just people with conditions or in these specific groups who could potentially be vulnerable, even healthy folks could be at risk developing asthma or COPD, depending on how much smoke they inhale and for how long. So, really the recommendation is that everybody should try to take precautions. The American Lung Association saying, quote, if you can see or smell smoke, know that you are being exposed. And they are really recommending folks should try to stay indoors as much as possible. If you have to go outside, experts recommend that you could wear a high- quality mask like an N-95 or KN-95. Those are things we're very familiar with from COVID of course. And in the home experts really recommend good high quality air filters using HEPA filters. But they say even if those are not available, shutting the window, running the air conditioning can be very helpful. And of course, don't forget about animals as well. A lot of the warnings can apply to our pets in addition. So we have to look out for them as well. Back over to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The House is in a state of paralysis amid a standoff between hardline conservatives and the Republican leadership. All because of an issue stemming from the debt ceiling deal that Speaker McCarthy cut with President Biden to suspend the national debt limit until January 2025. That is a big reason why these conservatives have decided to essentially stall all legislation in the House of Representatives. That was not the only issue. There's also separate disputes as well.One of which dealing with a belief among some these conservatives' holdouts that the number two Republican Steve Scalise did not schedule a vote on a bill that would loosen gun regulations. They wanted that bill on the floor. They said there was a disagreement about how that issue was handled. Some others have raised some other issues. Now why this is significant is that the House is narrowly divided. There are more than four voting against a procedural effort to bring a bill to the floor -- known as a rule. That is enough to scuttle it. Because Democrats typically vote against those rules. And if more than four decided they were going to vote against it, that could stop all legislation. That's exactly what happened Tuesday afternoon on a bill that essentially prohibit the federal ban of gas stoves. The Republicans decided that they were going to protest all of these issues. So, 12 Republicans voted against that rule yesterday. That was enough to stall action. And over the past day, the Speaker of the House and the leader and these holdouts have been meeting trying to figure out a way forward. Now McCarthy indicated he believes that it is a good idea to air these grievances. Even as he's indicated he was not happy to be in this position.",

Where exactly was this concrete evidence that he had been hacked, that his voice mails had been intercepted, that he had been trailed by private investigators. And this was something that Andrew Green, who is representing Mirror Group Newspapers, has repeated it as he went through 33 newspaper articles published between by MGM's titles between the early '90s and late 2000s. This was something that Prince Harry was repeatedly pressed on.And as you mentioned there, he appeared to be quite choked up towards the end of it. As he was asked by his own lawyer how it felt to have been accused of speculating, having to sit through hours and hours of cross-examination. And now course, he does maintain unlawful practices were used. This is something that Mirror Group Newspapers continue to contest and deny. We saw a number of articles being brought up, a number of examples including one which details a conversation between Prince Harry and his father, now King Charles III. Those details he said appear to be suspicious. The finer details he said could only have been obtained through unlawful information gathering. As well as the details around the ups and downs of his relationship with former longtime girlfriend Chelsy Davy. At one point he alleged that a tracking device had been found in a car that she used. Now of course the court will be hearing all this evidence. At this stage Prince Harry's time to give evidence in court is over. That has concluded. But they are now hearing from a journalist who worked for \"The Mirror,\" Jane Kerr. She is in court. She was by giving a attempt yesterday and she was facing questions today. She has been asked about whether she was aware of any unlawful practices. And she maintains as has the Mirror Group's defense team that she wasn't aware of any illegal tactics being used. That if private investigators had been hired by MGN were engaged in illegal activities, that was something she wasn't aware of or involved in.",
