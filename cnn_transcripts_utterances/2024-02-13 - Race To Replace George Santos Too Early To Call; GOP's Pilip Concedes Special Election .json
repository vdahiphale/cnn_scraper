Bill Clinton won this area pretty decisively. So, not exactly the greatest analogy that way, because the maps do change. But as we look in here, let's just come back in and see if the numbers have gone up at all. But we are stuck right here still, 61 to 39 in the race right now. But a very important point, most of the vote is from the Queens part of the district, very little of the vote from the much more Republican suburban area.

And right now, we have another key racer alert for you. Let's look at the big board here with 14 percent of the estimated vote in. Former Congressman Tom Suozzi, the Democrat, has 61 percent of the vote to the Republican's 39 percent. Suozzi has 15,592 votes. He's 5,615 votes ahead of Republican Mazi Pilip, who has 9,977 votes. It is early yet. We expect a lot more vote counting to happen tonight. I want to check back with our correspondents who are covering the candidates. First, we go to Miguel Marquez. He's at Suozzi's campaign headquarters in Woodbury, New York. And, Miguel, what is the Suozzi camp's take on the numbers so far?",

They're starting to see some of those numbers and they like the way that they are breaking for them. And that in the next few minutes that Jacobs and Tom Suozzi will come out and they will address this crowd. They have said all along that they did not expect to do that unless they were certain of a result.So, we expect to hear something from the Suozzi campaign very, very soon, from Suozzi himself very, very soon. And, look, he has run a very tight, very sort of centrist, very aggressive campaign and millions and millions of dollars been spent across the board here.

That's how many he has. That is 16,311 votes ahead of the Republican, Mazi Pilip, who has 38,843. That's with 51 percent of the vote in, Suozzi with 58.7 percent and Pilip with 41.3 percent.

That's okay, we'll get it back with the Election Day vote. Okay, you can, but you're exactly right.So, you can get it back, but that means you have to beat that. That means on the election, if that's the early vote on the Election Day vote, you got to beat 58 percent or more. That's a big number, right? That's a big number. So, yes, the early vote does tend to be disproportionately Democratic, but in the end, it's still math. And those votes all count and you've opened up that lead. So, now we need to see as you go from there. We believe -- this is up, we say 82 percent of the estimated vote. We believe we're pretty close to done for the night in Queens too. So we don't expect the Queens part of the district, we don't expect more votes to come in. We think we're close. So, this is the game now. As the votes come in in Nassau County, we think we're around 45 percent. These came in pretty quickly, as we saw with John Berman on the scene there, the flash drives, the discs, the backup materials showing up there. So, watch as this continues. Come out to the full district. There's your math, 59, 41. If you're Suozzi, you're happy, but you want to see -- you want to know from your people on the scene, Jake, and some of these key precincts that, okay, now we're seeing Election Day votes.",

Obviously, I talked to two voters today who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, turned around and voted for the Democrats in this race, voted for Tom Suozzi because they said his message on bipartisanship and the fact that House Republicans have really struggled to pass legislation over the last couple of weeks impacted the way they were looking at this race. And if you're a Democrat running in these swing districts, running in a suburban district, that's the kind of message, that's the kind of playbook that you want to emulate in November. So, obviously, both parties are going to be looking for lessons learned.

Like, for instance, if indeed that happens, there are still three vacancies. If everyone shows up for a vote, Johnson is only going to be able to lose two Republicans on any given issue if he needs all the Republicans to vote for it instead of three. That's a big, that's a big deal. There's no margin of error. So, that's one. But in terms of the -- for the -- looking towards the fall, the thing about this district is this is New York -- these New York districts are what delivered the majority to the Republicans in the House of Representatives. And it is precisely the kind of district that Democrats need to win back if they are to win control of the House of Representatives in November. And so, yes, there are specific circumstances here. I think the immigration issue is probably more acute here in the New York media market than it is in some of these other districts, the snow, no doubt about it. But the broad picture, the broad picture is if the Democrats can flip the seat back, they have a model to try and start recreating in some of these districts for the (INAUDIBLE).",

This is a district that should have been, one, where Republicans could have leveraged immigration, for example. If they don't pull out a win here, I do think it calls into question how potent that is going to be for voters when they are faced not just with the issue by pollsters, but with a choice in the ballot box.",

CNN projects that the Democrat, Tom Suozzi, the former member of the House, will win the special election in New York's Third Congressional District. The Democrats are picking up the House seat previously held by ousted Republican George Santos. Suozzi defeating his Republican opponent, Mazi Pilip, and now sets a return to the House where he previously served.This is a big and critical victory for Democrats that shrinks the Republicans' already slim majority in the House. With Suozzi's win, Democrats will have 213 House seats compared to 219 for Republicans with three seats, as of right now, remaining vacant. So, it's a huge victory for Democrats. And let us go now and check in with our friend, Miguel Marquez, who is at campaign headquarters where Suozzi is. I believe he's in Glen Cove, New York. And, Miguel, the T.V. hasn't caught up with where we are, but I see they're watching CNN. They got to be feeling good there.",

So that is the news. Look at that sea of cell phones taking all this in. We expect Tom Suozzi now to -- he and Jay Jacobs, the head of the Democratic Party here in New York State -- to take the stage in about 15 minutes. It's about 10:30. And he will declare victory in this race. He ran such a focus and intense race. It was a very, very short election, less than two months. And he just used his name. Not just him, but his father, his uncle, the Suozzi name is known throughout Long Island. He's a long time sort of centrist Democrat. He hasn't always gotten along with the party itself. [22:25:00] And that worked in his favor. He ran essentially on Republican issues, on immigration, on the border, on crime and on taxes, and really drove that message home. The other thing that really worked for him was that sort of ghost of George Santos, though. Despite the fact that many voters didn't want to talk about George Santos, what drove them to the polls in the final days is that they were doing early voting, was that anger, that residual anger over George Santos. And we've seen this with candidates or with members of Congress that leave under bad circumstances and then their party gets punished in the next election.

I asked him, would you campaign with Joe Biden? He said Joe Biden would not be helpful in this district.

So, we're going to hire the people who's going to fix that. And I think Swazi pulled a good one. He said, I know the immigration's a problem and I'm going to be your guy to fix it. And that probably helped them when all was said and done.",

That doesn't help when voters are trying to decide who actually -- what is the model for leadership that I want to support in Washington? That is going to be a problem, not -- I think it was a problem in this race. It's probably going to be a problem and a lot of other races going down the line. This was their -- supposed to be their opportunity to show voters how they would lead. And, so far, frankly, it's been kind of a disaster from day one when they could not elect a speaker.",

The problem is in power, they look like the disorder and the dysfunction. What they're doing in D.C., every day looks disordered and dysfunctional. And so, I think Democrats are going to start pointing that out. And because they genned up the issue of immigration, Republicans took it. Nobody was talking about immigration this time last year, it was all abortion. Republicans successfully took that issue from the margin to the center, dropped the ball, and then lost an election on it. That's where that Republican party is.

I get that you think this is a problem. I think it's a problem. But look at how the Republicans didn't handle it.So, instead of just sort of saying like, well, it's in your head.
