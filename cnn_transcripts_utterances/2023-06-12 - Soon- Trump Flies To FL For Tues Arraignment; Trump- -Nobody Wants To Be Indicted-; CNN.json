Plus, worry that words can and will hurt people. The former president and his allies put law enforcement on edge with calls for retribution. Congressman Jamie Raskin joins me ahead.And Trump's 2024 Republican rivals are choosing between two paths, attacking law and order or risking voter anger by saying the president, the former president was wrong. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and Inside Politics. Right now, heading for history. You're looking at live pictures of former President Donald Trump, any moment he takes off for Florida from Newark airport. We all just watched his motorcade make the 30- mile drive from his golf resort. And tomorrow, he goes in front of a federal judge in Miami, and there, Trump will earn the title, something he certainly hasn't wanted, the first former president to face a federal arraignment. Let's go straight to CNN's Kristen Holmes. So, Kristen, help us capture the moment and what you're hearing from your sources in Trump world?",

      "sentences": "Look, they are taking this very seriously. Here's what we know so far. We just saw Trump go by several minutes ago. He drove by here. They arrived at the Newark airport. When they land in Miami, they will be going up to his Doral club. I am told there they're going to meet with lawyers, talk about their legal strategy going into this.Remember, they lost two lawyers on this case, two lawyers resigned. They are looking for a strong, Florida based attorney who can deal with the Department of Justice, someone who has experience with that. We know that they are making calls, trying to gauge interest in what attorneys or if attorneys would be interested in representing the former president. It is unclear now if they've already put out any offers or who exactly that they are talking to. Now, we are also told, my colleague Paula Reid that some of these firms are actually reaching out to Trump world offering up their services. So, this is going to be all part of the conversation today. And the other thing to note here is that Trump aide Walt Nauta is expected to travel down to Florida from his club in Bedminster to Florida ahead of the arraignment. As we know, Trump's aide was indicted alongside the former president, this is significant, because there were questions as to whether or not Nauta would separate himself from the former president, whether or not this was about cooperation in any way, but clearly, the two are sticking together.",

Thank you so much, so much to talk about.Let's just start with what's in your notebooks. I know, Jeff, you spend a lot of time last week in Iowa. You spent a lot of time every year in Iowa.

Yes, Republicans are rallying behind him. But there is still an opening, the same opening that existed last week. Now there's more reason for that opening.If there were any Republicans who had pause about, can he be elected, this is raising some concern, but he said, look, we're going to have to sit back and watch it all. And the indictment has not been read by most Republican voters. This happens to be a lawyer or republican lawyer who met with him. So, he said, look, I have read the indictment. He said, it's pretty damning. His words echoed what Bill Barr the former attorney general said, this is not a witch hunt. These are serious matters here. So, I think the voters, the, you know, the elite voters I guess perhaps, the lawyers and others are studying this, but we just have to give this some time.",

But I think that the Republican Party is grappling with some structural issues here is namely that the Republican Party as exists here was formed and structured by Trump himself. He popularized, lock her up, made Hillary Clinton's email issue, one of the foundational rallying cries of the Republican Party.And so, it's for that reason, you know, what I hear from a lot of Republicans is that, if only for that one reason, many of them can't see a world in which they say, that Trump should be charged for a document classified, document related issue, when Hillary Clinton was not. The logic of it, if you've read the indictment, if you look at the evidence does not make any sense. But that is part of the, you know, that's part of the DNA of the Republican Party right now. And many of these candidates, that's why you're seeing so many of them, even the ones who are criticizing Trump, like Chris Christie, they can't do it without saying, well, Hillary Clinton should have been charged, but it's always the but that gets in the way.",

I mean, really, what this indictment shows is Trump's efforts to try to allegedly cover up these documents that are trying to be retrieved by the federal government. Its efforts to try to hide them, the misstatements that he allegedly made all about it.That is not what this, it's not about, simply mishandling classified documents, which is what the Biden situation was, which with Pence situation was, which with Hillary Clinton situation was. After, you know, we learned the Pence cooperated that case has been closed, providing the documents back to them. Biden apparently has cooperated. We don't know exactly what's going to happen that investigation, but these are much different cases. But the argument, the political argument, facts be damned, they're going to make that case to try to suggest that one of the same. The big question too, for a lot of Republicans is, how quickly does this happen? Does this drag to the election year? Or does it is a punt until 2025?",

I went through my whole life. now I get indicted every two months. It's been political.\" OK, that political thing is kind of typical. But the rest of it, I thought it was very, very telling.",

And once again, this is going to be him walking into a courtroom and into a venue where he does not control.So, for the next several months, we're going to see this play out on two tracks. One, inside the courtroom where we can't see, which is very serious. And on the campaign trail, which we can see, and he'll try to control. But the question underlying all this is, is he going to be the strongest Republican candidate to win back the White House? And that's what Republican voters are going to assess at the end of all this. So, they're offering him a speedy trial. He wants anything, but a speedy trial clearly.",

People are just going to take a cursory look at this and not really understand it. But I do think that those numbers especially 80 percent. I mean that's a huge difference. And it really does speak to honestly, the reality is the opposite of what they are saying. These charges are actually pretty simple to understand.This is a country where people understand what classified documents made for good or for bad. They know that they're supposed to be protected, that they're supposed to be kept secret that has national security implications. Those are actually not hard concepts to understand. What makes it worse for Trump is that there is a tape out there of him using his own words, talking about the situation in an incredibly damning fashion. I don't think that you can assume that people are just going to gloss over this, even if they have not read the indictment. Clearly some of this is penetrating to regular people.

And so, one of the things that they've spent the weekend, doing people in his circle, some of his remaining lawyers have been reaching out to Florida attorneys to try to find some people who could be on his team to help represent him here in Miami. People who are familiar with the Miami Federal District.One of the things I was told by someone this weekend is, that they do have some people actually reaching out to try to offer their services. Some others, however, are turning him down. So, it's a bit of a mix of some that we were still trying to wondering who is going to be there next to him tomorrow. When we do know, also is this, you know, the choice of bringing this case by the Justice Department to bring this case here in Miami is something that took shape over the last few months. You know Dana that the grand jury in Washington has been kind of the venue where they've been gathering most of the evidence. And so, it took our people -- people by surprise a little bit that they chose to bring it here. One of the issues that that surfaced for prosecutors was the issue of venue, which was that the fact that Mar-a-Lago, which is where the former president took these documents, that's in this district. Made it more difficult to bring a case in Washington, which, you know, let's be honest, would have been probably a jury more friendly towards the prosecution, and he'll probably get a friendlier Trump jury here in Southern District of Florida.

They are seeing intelligence that thousands of people are planning, at least right now to come here. And the big question is, what kind of security measures are in place to protect the building, to protect those of us who are here. But Dana, I just want to give you a quick look. Most of the area right now is being protected by this kind of tape here. The police today put this up. Like I said to you earlier, we're not seeing those metal barriers, and generally people are able to walk through this area up to the doors today and it's almost like business as usual here. Now this courthouse here is where the former president will appear. The courtroom right now is on the 13th floor. He will be processed in this building. He will be then taken up to the 13th floor where there's a very large courtroom. But there is a lot of concern over security, over what the police department, the local police department, the Miami city police department, the Miami Dade county police department, how are they preparing for all this? Because right now, we're not seen any of those preparations. At two o'clock, we expect to hear from local officials on some of those plans. And hopefully, we'll see some increased security measures.

This is an espionage, and yet now we see it on the right. It has nothing to do with espionage in the formal James Bond sense, other than the statute is called the Espionage Act. This is as is made clear in 793(e), which is the charge he has been obsessed with. It has to do with unlawful retention of national defense information and failing to return it.
