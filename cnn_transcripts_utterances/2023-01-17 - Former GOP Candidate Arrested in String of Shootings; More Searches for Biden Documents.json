      "sentences": "Thank you so much for being here, everybody. I'm Kate Bolduan.Let's start in New Mexico with a wild story that is raising questions of whether political violence is becoming a norm. Police have arrested a man for being the mastermind behind a series of shootings at the homes of state and local Democratic officials. Solomon Pena, he is accused of conspiring with and paying four men to carry out the shootings. He had run -- he had run in an election, lost as a Republican candidate, for the New Mexico state house. Thankfully no one was injured in those shootings. But officials believe that Pena, who they describe as an election denier, may have been fueled by anger over his recent election loss. And Josh Campbell is joining us right now. Josh, there was no one injured but there was a real threat at these homes. What are you learning about this investigation?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. This is horrific. This House GOP candidate that claimed election fraud was arrested yesterday. And police say that Solomon Pena paid and conspired with four other men to shoot at the homes of four Democratic elected officials.CNN has attempted to reach Pena for comment. These occurred between December 4th and January 3rd and the latest shooting, police say, it was Pena who pulled the trigger. No was physically injured but they did cause damage to the four homes. Now we've been reviewing the police arrest warrant affidavit. And it is clear that the identification came about thanks to a trove of evidence that included analysis of bullet shell casings from the crime scenes. Police say the one type of firearm was a modified fully automatic weapon as well as  video surveillance and most importantly, police say they convinced one person with knowledge of the conspiracy to cooperate. That obviously key in any investigation. And in chilling detail, that cooperating witness told police that group members conducting the shootings originally fired above the windows so as not to actually strike anyone. But according to the arrest warrant affidavit, a cooperating witness stated that Solomon wanted them to aim lower in the houses and shoot around 8:00 pm because occupants would more likely not be laying down. The arresting officer writing that he understood that taking these measures would increase the chance of obtaining the desired effect of the shootings. Now police say that they're still investigating whether these four alleged accomplices actual knew who they were shooting at or whether they were paid to just open fire. But these horrific incidents have resulted in widespread condemnation from officials. And this is very serious, hearing so much from law enforcement about how they fear that this heated political rhetoric could lead to violence. This appears to be a case of just that.",

If you just look at it from the elements, take the politics out of it.You have multiple shots fired on multiple dates at multiple locations into houses in the early hours of the morning or late at night. But they're alerted to the January 3rd one by a shot spotter. That is an acoustic system that tells police even while people are sleeping, that might not hear it or report it, that shots are fired and that draws them to the location and they recover shell casings on the ground. There is a bullet impact mark in the ceiling of the little girl's room while she's sleeping. And she said stuff fell from the ceiling. They recovered that bullet. When they run that through the Albuquerque police lab -- and I think Chief Medina's (ph) team really get a lot of credit for putting the pieces together -- it matches to a pistol they had test fired after seizing it in a car stop that occurred 40 minutes after the shooting somewhere else. In the car, they find two guns and 800 fentanyl pills. So they think they have just your average drug dealer. It turns out that the plot involved hiring people involved in the drug world to steal cars, use the cars in the shootings and then escape the shootings. But between the shot spotter technology and the video they recovered and the ballistic matches through ATF and their own lab work, you really saw this come together where it became clear, this is a multi- person conspiracy and who was at the head of it. BOLDUAN:  And then once again, bring it out to the broader, which is you've got -- I remember FBI director Chris Wray has called election violence and politically motivated violence as almost a 365-day phenomenon. Then you see the details of this. You want to call this situation dangerous and bizarre and unusual. But do we consider it unusual? It is extreme but it is not -- it is not unusual.",

And you have a mix of accelerationists, who want to topple the U.S. government and take down the power grid and all that on the crazier end.

And President Biden himself has grown frustrated that he feels like this story has overshadowed what had by all measures been a very positive streak for this administration. And meanwhile, White House aides, many who'd been in the dark about the story until last week when the story broke, they are basically in a wait-and-see mode. \"It is what it is\" kind of attitude at the White House we're told as they also wait to see if there are more classified documents that surface. And what has been interesting is that even some of the closest allies to the president and this White House have raised openly questions about why the White House hasn't been more forthcoming and sooner. And particularly have been puzzled by the White House counsel's office decision to initially put out that statement and not even mention the existence of another set of documents and only mentioning that first batch. And clearly the decision to sort of adhere to that rule of \"don't say anything publicly that could jeopardize the investigation,\" that has come from the president's personal lawyer Bob Bauer. And really we have seen the president himself adhere to that rule. The few times that we saw him address the issue, he has stuck closely to the script from his lawyers.",

So Jeff, in every White House that faces an investigation, even somewhere along the lines of this, not necessarily related to classified material but an investigation that is becoming a bigger and bigger deal.

And you're right, there are always two strategies in this playbook approach of how things like this are dealt with.The legal strategy is to say nothing at all and to cooperate with investigators and to sort of let it play out in its own time. The political strategy is unsustainable. So you saw last week, as MJ was just saying, it is remarkable. All this has happened in the course of a week. And throughout this it was clear that the political approach was simply not meeting the needs of disclosure and promises of being transparent. So over the weekend, they finally tried to sort of get up to speed on this and put out everything that they know. But the question is, is everything out there or not? This drip, drip, drip of finding new documents and sending lawyers to look for potential others, this has complicated and overshadowed everything that this White House thought it would be doing in the opening months and weeks of this year. So at the same time, the White House is trying to move forward. The president meeting with the Dutch prime minister this afternoon and going to California later this week. But the reality here, it is a very, very different West Wing. And also because Republicans are in charge of House committees. So all of this happening at the same time could not be worse for the White House. BOLDUAN:  Doug Jones had a take on this. He helped lead Ketanji Brown Jackson through her Supreme Court confirmation process. But he said that the White House has been hobbled by unforced errors. And even though Team Biden have handled this correctly, the next time he talks to Biden's team, Jones told CNN that he's going to say, quote, \"Gosh, come on y'all. You got to do a better job when shit like that happens. That's exactly what I would say.\" Do you think they have gotten the message at this point?",

That is likely not going to happen. But he often puts off decisions. He often thinks about things longer. So I'm not sure if that February timeline, how real that was. But as of now, his advisers and allies are saying, look, this will not impact his 2024 plans. But we'll see. We'll see how this goes. We don't know how much of a toll this will take on him.

In fact, for many years, until 2015, China had this policy where families could only have one child.But then the government noticed that the population was starting to decline. So it lifted that policy. In 2021, they said you could have three children. Still the population was starting to slump. Why is that happening? Why did that happen? Well, as we've seen, our lives change. Couples are waiting longer to have children. They're waiting longer to get married. That could impact fertility. Some families are not even having children at all. So the government is dealing with this decline of 850,000 people prior than the year before. And it is trying to increase its population. So to do so, the government is basically offering incentives to people. It is offering more generous maternity leave, offering tax breaks with the hope of giving a boost. So how does this relate to the economy? There is no question; COVID had a big reason for China's economic slump last year. But you also need a strong, able-bodied work force. When you think about China, it's a manufacturing hub. So many American companies depend on Chinese workers to manufacture its goods. And if that population is not sustained, it is going to be a very big challenge. In fact, Kate, looking ahead, the United Nations predicted that India will have a larger population in 2023. So without people, you can't be productive. And that is where China finds itself right now.",
