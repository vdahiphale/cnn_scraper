      "sentences": "And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today, of course, in the Middle East, where America's top diplomat delivered an in-person message to the Israeli people who are grieving and wounded. He said the United States will never back down from its support of Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is now on his way to meet with other U.S. allies in the region. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, Qatar, and Jordan after standing side by side with Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu today. Secretary Blinken also met with families of Americans killed or taken hostage by Hamas, a group the U.S. has labeled terrorists. The White House says at least 27 Americans have been killed and at least 14 others remain missing. In its efforts to eliminate Hamas which brutally attacked Israel last Saturday, the Israel defense forces are currently pounding Gaza with airstrikes today. Since Hamas embeds itself within the Palestinian population, this is tragically resulting in hundreds of innocent Palestinian casualties. More than 1,400 have been killed so far, civilian and Hamas, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel has also cut off electricity, food, water, and fuel supplies to Gaza. Israel officials say none of those supplies will be restored until all hostages being held by Hamas are returned home. Today, independent Democratic senator -- I'm sorry, Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders said that such would be an international law violation. Today, we are also getting a horrific new look at the atrocities Hamas committed on Saturday. We want to warn you some of the images you are about to see are graphic and incredibly disturbing. One of the images we're going to show you is so upsetting, I'm even going to give you a few moments warning so you can prepare yourself to look away. It will be the photo of a corpse of a baby, a baby murdered by Hamas. It's not clear where and when this innocent young human was killed, but it was Saturday. And it's one of the many children the terrorists killed in their rampage on Saturday such as in kibbutz, one of the first places they reached after reaching in Israel. Video shows them breaching a gate and entering on motor bikes. Just after 7:00 a.m. on Saturday, a bloodbath followed. The kibbutz was mostly destroyed, more than 100 people slaughtered, most of them innocent civilians. The victims include 8-year-old Emily. She was having a sleepover with a friend. Her father waited two days before learning the awful news. His reaction before learning she was dead tells you a lot of the depravities of which Hamas is capable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS HAND, 8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER KILLED BY HAMAS:  They just said, we found Emily. She's dead. And I went, yes! I went yes, and smiled because that is the best news of the possibilities that I knew. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That means tragically, hundreds of civilian casualties both Israeli and Palestinian as a result of what happened Saturday. The Israeli military buildup continues for an expected ground incursion into Gaza.

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, this was the kibbutz area, one of the scenes of some of the grossest atrocities that took place on Saturday. And I think it's sort of interesting in a symbolic level that the Israeli military has now taken it over and repurposed it. It is now a staging ground for an artillery brigade.When we arrived there yesterday, we could see many soldiers, tanks. We heard outgoing artillery. It's clearly a staging ground as I said but also for support, communications. I would note that the posture of the soldiers was relatively at ease. One didn't have the sense walking around that some kind of a ground offensive was imminent in the sort of coming hours. But clearly, the building up the forces along the Gaza envelope is fueling the expectation of imminent ground offensive. And I think we're seeing that as well-being borne out in terms of the incessant bombardment, which you and Erin had just referenced on Gaza. Today, the U.N. coming out saying that 2,500 housing units have been destroyed, 23,000 have sustained moderate to minor damage, and the rate of displacement has increased by more than 30 percent in the space of just 24 hours. They're talking about having hours left only in terms of fuel supplies. So the humanitarian situation in Gaza is rapidly approaching an alarming level, and the question then becomes how long can Israel wait before making its move? But can it make a move before it has secured some kind of a humanitarian corridor? We heard Secretary of State Antony Blinken talking about this again today, the importance of providing people who want to flee the violence, ordinary civilians, with a way out. So far that has not been agreed upon. And as a result we continue to see a growing intensity in terms of the desperation of the situation there, and a growing anxiety on this side of the border as well as to when there may be some further movement, Jake.",

Senator Ernst, you met with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Tuesday. Israel was clearly not prepared for that, day and for several days after, Israelis are furious. Do you sense that Israel, and the military, are ready for what comes next, for this next major attack, for getting their hostages back, for everything following? SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA):  Well, thank you Jake. And, here we stand as a bicameral, bipartisan delegation, that visited Israel, in those short days after the Hamas attacks. And, the weight in the room, when we met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, was very heavy. But, I do believe that they are prepared for the upcoming weeks, months, whatever it takes, for them to work out the deals with hostages, as well as make sure that they are destroying Hamas.

Peace certainly seems elusive now. REP. JIMMY PANETTA (D-CA):  Yeah, it was funny. We started this trip going into the Middle East to talk about peace. Unfortunately, we left the region, talking about war. And, it kind of makes you think, is that the long story of the Middle East? And we are trying to do everything we can to change that narrative. And that's why we wanted to go there, to have those discussions. And I can tell you, prior to this happening, being on the ground in Saudi Arabia, it was very, very positive, our discussions with leadership there. However, once this invasion, this bloodthirsty attack happened. Obviously, the discussions changed. But I can tell you, what I found positive to me, once when we got to Israel, and had the conversations about the events, they talked about what I think is very important in this position, and that's relationships. And, they talked about the personal calls that they had been receiving, from Arab leaders, in the region, about the event.
