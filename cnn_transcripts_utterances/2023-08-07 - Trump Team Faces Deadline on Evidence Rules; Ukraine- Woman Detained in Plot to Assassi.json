But here, what's happened is the special counsel has said, in light of things Donald Trump has said, including some of the social media posts Jessica just talked about, there need to be restrictions on what he can do and say publicly about this evidence. And ordinarily, if you have a situation like this, which is fairly rare, you get together, defense and prosecution, and you work it out. The judge has urged them to do that. They're not going to do that, I'll predict. And so Donald Trump's team is going to put in a brief today by 5 p.m., saying we should not be restricted in any way. We have free speech rights. You do have a right to criticize your prosecutor. You have a right to prosecute the judge, but there's a line that can be crossed when you get into tampering.

JOHN AVLON, CNN ANCHOR/SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think you're starting to see the aperture open for Republican candidates to feel free to speak frankly about Donald Trump and his attempts to overturn the election. Mike Pence had been muted previously. He's not anymore. He understands that his best chance of getting a nomination on the debate stage is by speaking candidly and forcefully about Trump's request for him to overturn the election.

We have -- judges will instruct jurors, you know, to put aside your political beliefs, decide on the facts. Regarding this judge, I think we have to set the record straight here. She's an Obama nominee. That does not make her inherently biased against Donald Trump, any more than the fact that Judge Cannon, on the other case in Florida, is biased in his favor because she's a Trump nominee. She was approved, Judge Chutkan, 95 to zero in the USA. She's a former public defender. She understands the rights of a criminal defendant in federal court. And yes, Victor, you're right.

She has said -- she's not named, and it's not clear if she's Russian or just a Russian informant. She's said to be a military store worker, someone who worked, essentially, in an outdoor shop in Charkiv (ph). That's a peninsula right down towards Crimea on the Southern coast. So a key reminder here, I think, from the Ukrainian security services that there is constantly a threat against Volodymyr Zelenskyy's life. We know he takes inordinate precautions in trying to keep himself in Kyiv. But at the same time, too, does go to a lot of frontline destinations over the past months to corral troops in those places. And the Ukrainian security services, too, very active in the media over the past week or so, claiming responsibility for the attacks on the cargo ship carrying oil; the assault amphibious ship on the port of Novorossiysk; and indeed, too, the bridge to Crimea, as well. Overnight, though, Victor, we'd been hearing of yet more strikes inside of Ukraine. One dead in Kherson from shelling. But also too, suggestion from Russian officials that Ukrainian drones have tried to get towards Moscow, as well.
