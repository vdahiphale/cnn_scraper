And now the focus has turned toward opening this alternate channel that they're trying to create in the river at some point soon for commercially essential vessels, with the hope being that it's the first step toward reopening the port of Baltimore.As you mentioned, thousands of jobs are at stake right now with work basically shut down on the port, potentially millions of dollars in impact to the local economy. But at this point, it's unclear what the timeline is to actually get that alternate vessel -- that alternate channel open and what vessels are going to be able to use it, whether or not it will be able to handle larger ships at some point soon. I can tell you, I just spoke with the Joint Information Center that told me at this point, in the short term, the only vessels that are going to be using that channel are the ones directly involved in this salvage operation actually getting the bridge out of the water.",

I mean, you just heard what Gabe Cohen was reporting there a few moments ago. This is just a critically important part of the Baltimore economy. Are you satisfied with the pace of the efforts to reopen this channel and get things going? SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  Well, Jim, I am. And first, let me just say about the six that we lost in this terrible tragedy. We are working very hard to support their families and their kids. I am satisfied. The Army Corps of Engineers was on the job immediately, as has the Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy. They're working 24/7 as you just heard. They're trying to open a portion of the sort of, passageway on the Patapsco River under the bridge. This will be for vessels that don't draw as much water. So, about 11 feet. As work goes on at the same time to clear the main channel, that's 50 feet. And that's the channel we have to clear to get more container ships back into the port of Baltimore. As you say, it is a credible -- critical economic hub. I'm going to be going very shortly to meet with some of the longshoremen, who, on a regular -- you know, on a regular day would be unloading and offloading cargo from these ships. So, we -- we've got to get this up and running. And I thank the president for dispatching the Army Corps of Engineers immediately. And they're on the job.",

What I can say is I've been down there virtually every day, and they are working 24/7. So, even as they try to clear this one passageway under the bridge to make room for barges, they're at the same time doing all the engineering analysis to open the deeper channel.As for the bridge, you know, we are determined to rebuild the Key Bridge. And again, the federal government has stepped up. Maryland has been included in the emergency relief. A program -- which is a federal program for these kinds of emergencies and we'll pick up -- the federal government will pick up 90 percent of the costs through that program. And then Senator Cardin and myself and Congressman Mfume will be introducing legislation to make up that difference so that we meet the president's, you know, request and assistance that the federal government step in during this national emergency.

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, yes, this is very concerning. This is a massive data breach. It's impacted many, many Americans. We're talking about 7.6 million current customers of AT&amp;T, and almost 10 times that many previous customers, 65.4 million former customers of AT&amp;T have been caught up in this.So, I know everyone's wondering, you know, have I been impacted? Well, AT&amp;T says they have already reached out to and reset the passcodes of current customers who have been impacted. So, if you don't get an - email or a letter from AT&amp;T in the coming days, you're likely in the clear. And the company says they're going to reach out to former customers as well. Now, beyond the scope of this, what's concerning is what was actually taken, stolen. AT&amp;T says it varies from case to case, but this includes full names, dates of birth, phone numbers, e-mail and mailing addresses, account numbers, passcodes, and most alarmingly, social security numbers. Now, one cyber security research -- researcher told me that this is more than enough information for criminals to do everything from phishing campaigns to potentially even impersonating customers or even trying to steal their identity here. One interesting element here is the timing. It was nearly three years ago that a well-known hacker claimed to have customer information on 70 million people from AT&amp;T. And at the time, AT&amp;T denied that its systems had been penetrated. Now, the company says that they realize that about two weeks ago, customer information was leaked on the dark web, but AT&amp;T says they're investigating. They don't know yet if this was taken directly from the company or from a vendor. Jim, there's a number of things that customers can do if they fear that they have been impacted, including changing their passcodes. They can freeze their credit accounts. They can also sign up for fraud alerts, Jim. So, this is a major, major leak here.",

The Boilermakers have lived up to their billing, and now you've got the Wolfpack that have become the darlings of the tournament.I mean, the teams that we expected to be there are there, and then we get a Cinderella of sorts in NC State. An 11 seed led by a pair of super seniors in DJ Burns and DJ Horne just pulling off another upset, this time against Duke. Burns just seemed to bully his way to a team high 29 points. Horne added 20 against the Blue Devils in the 76-64 comeback win. And what's fascinating is that the Wolfpack needed to win five games in five days to win the ACC tournament just to get invited to be here. And now they have somehow managed to rattle off nine in a row, heading to the Final Four for the first time in 41 years. You've got Purdue heading to the Final Four for the first time in 40 years. Matt Painter so deserving of this. Tennessee, All American Dalton Knecht was just brilliant in this game for the Vols. He had 37. But it was the Boilermakers' big man, Zach Edey, proving why he is the frontrunner to win his second straight National Player of the Year award. He put up a career high 40. He did it at the free throw line. And then with the game on the line, he had this huge block to seal the six- point win. And I loved watching him after the game too, Jim, because he's seven four.
