The pacific island of Vanuatu is one step closer to getting the world's highest court to weigh in on the climate crisis for the first time ever. Backed by the United Nations, it's asking the International Court of Justice to clearly lay out how countries must address the warming planet. Around the world, the devastation, so far, is just a tiny glimpse of what could be coming, as Mississippi digs itself out from severe tornadoes, and Pakistanis are still homeless from last summer's floods. Action is needed now, and no one is feeling the panic more acutely than Vanuatu, Barbados, and other tiny island nations that fear being swallowed up by the sea. Prime minister Mia Mottley has become a climate active rock star. Clearly communicating what's at stake for Barbados and for the bigger countries that think they're immune. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Why there's so much poverty in this incredibly rich country? And so, this book is my response to that question. But I think there's always been something about the American poverty debate that didn't sit well with me. And I remember reading a line by the novelist Tommy Orange where he writes, these kids are jumping out of the windows of burning buildings, falling to their deaths. And we think that the problem is that they're jumping. And when I read that I was like, man that sounds like the poverty debate. And we have been focused so much on the poor themselves.

And part of the reason is because we have not fully addressed the unrelenting exploitation of the poor and the labor market and the housing market and in the financial market. Let me just give you one quick statistic. Every day, $61 million are pulled out of the pockets of poor families in terms of overdraft fees, check cashing fees, payday loan fees. Every single day. You know, when James Baldwin wrote how expensive it is to be poor, he couldn't even have imagined those kinds of numbers.

So, you take this program called TANF for cash welfare. For every dollar budgeted for TANF, only 22 cents ends up with a family in terms of direct aid. Why? Well, because states get a lot of leeway about how they spend their money, and they're really creative about how to do it. You know, states have used that money to spend on Christian summer camps or abstinence only classes, marriage initiatives, things like that. Many of these things don't have anything to do with reducing poverty. Other states just simply sit on the money. You know, Tennessee, last time I check, was sitting on over $700 million in unspent welfare funds. Hawaii was sitting on enough to give every poor kid in its state $10,000. So, that's one thing that's going on. And the second thing that's going on that's important is that a lot of poor families don't take advantage of programs that they need and deserve. We hear a lot about welfare dependency but if you look at the data, the bigger problem is welfare avoidance. The fact that families are leaving billions and billions of dollars on the table every year. You know, one in five elderly Americans, for example, who could qualify and received food stamps, they don't take advantage of that.",

That's also part of the welfare state. You know, both tax break and a government check cost the government money, and both of those put income in someone's pocket. And so, if you add up all the benefits that the government is doling out, social insurance, tax breaks, means tested programs to the poorest families, you learn that every year in America the top 20 percent of us receive about $36,000 from the government. And the bottom 20 percent receive only $25,000 from the government. That's almost a 40 percent difference. We're doing a lot more to guard fortunes than we are to expand opportunity.",

You know, we've built these communities where, basically, the only folks that can live in the communities are affluent homeowners, the majority of whom are white in this country. And so, thinking about an end of poverty is also thinking about how to tear down those walls and embrace kind of open, more inclusive communities. And so, race plays a huge role there. It also plays a huge role until like how people see and understand the poor. There's a lot of really discouraging studies that show that folks are more likely to vote yes on an anti-poverty program if they think the benefit isn't going to African American families, that's really discouraging.

We recognize the court's important role and contributions to the rule of law, and the U.S. commends the court's ruling related to Bank Markazi, which was the bulk of Iran's case.

The Russian security agency, FSB says, that American Evan Gershkovich, who you're looking at here, was detained in the Ural's region. And it's accusing him of trying to collect information for the U.S. Now, video from local media and Moscow appears to show Gershkovich being taken out of a police van, you'll see him here before returning to the vehicle. His arrest comes days after the U.S. announced charges against Sergey Cherkasov, who's accused of working for Russian intelligence and entering the U.S. under a fake identity.
