And when you heard Vice President Harris there, telling Trump to say it to her face, on the debate stage, issuing this challenge to him, when typically it's been reverse. Is that what the Harris campaign strategy is going to look like, for the next 98 days? STACEY ABRAMS, (D) FORMER GEORGIA HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Vice President Harris understands that this is an election about choices. And she's going to make very clear what the choices are. A president, who is flailing, who cannot figure out how he's going to attack, and so he's throwing everything he can. Or a prosecutor who's going to show America what's possible, if we continue the last four years, and make them the best four years imaginable. She is going to invest in our community.
