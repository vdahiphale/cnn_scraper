We've read through that.We've also read through the documents attached to that internal investigation. And in that internal investigation, the city of Tampa finds that she violated the Tampa Police Department's policies, also says that she compromised her and the city of Tampa's professionalism and ethics by using her position of authority. I want to read to you a direct statement from the mayor in which she says it is unacceptable for any public employee and the city's top law enforcement leader to ask for special treatment because of their position. Public trust in Tampa's police department is paramount to our success as a city and as a community. You know, the letter of resignation as well as even the sort of synopsis of the interview that the police department internal investigation had with Mary O'Connor, both revealed that she says that she was very apologetic, it was never her intent to sort of abuse any position of power. But, clearly, that was not enough for the city because she has now resigned and they are now mounting a national search for a new police chief.",

But state media is pushing back on statements from Iran's attorney general claiming the government is also abolishing the so- called morality police. Those claims come after months of protests following the death of a young woman in police custody. The morality police, as they're known, detained Mahsa Amini, allegedly, just for not wearing his hijab properly. She did not survive police custody.",

It is vague. You have different M.P.s, pro-reform, less reform, conservative M.P.S sort of speaking to both sides of what may happen during this hijab -- so-called hijab review. We understand that the outcome of the review might become public within a couple of weeks. But, you know, we all now and watch Iranian politics pretty closely at times, and often it involves a degree of smoke and mirrors. So right now, you have to say, we do not have a clear picture of what is going on, but there seems to be some discussion. But it will likely fall very short of what the reformers want in Iran because three months ago, they were demanding the removal of the hijab, now, they're demanding the removal of the whole leadership of Iran.

First of all, we always have to inject some skepticism with Iranian leadership, right, and that, as you say, a lot of smoke and mirrors, but today's moderates were often yesterday's hardliners, it's just that the hardliners become more hard-line over time.What has been the reaction from the leaders and the supporters of these protests that have begun nationally, and as you say, Nic, have expanded beyond the issue of the hijab? ROBERTSON:  I think they're being very cautious. They know reality on the ground. They know that the government can say one thing one day and then change it next day. So, I don't think anyone is -- anyone on the street wanting to protest is fooled by the notion that there is a review and this is going to settle their grievances and that women will have a choice about wearing the hijab. There was a conservative lawmaker today, a woman, who said that if the hijab was removed, that would be seen by Iran's enemies as a victory, so this was really towards the Islamic republic itself. Remove the hijab and you take down the Islamic republic. So, I think the protesters are very aware of some of the immovable religious objects in the way -- in the path of their desires.",

The first certainly around their superstar, Neymar, who has been in that race against time to recover from this ankle injury that he suffered in the opening game. Coach Tite had said it was going to depend on the training session that he took part in on Sunday night. And I can tell you that the Neymar himself posted on social media afterwards telling a little bit of James Brown saying, I feel good, I knew that I would.It is quite hard to say that without bursting into song but I will resist. But that is certainly a huge boost for the team on the day that Pele's daughter, it emerges, has done an interview with networks in Brazil trying to allay some of the health concerns over the three- time World Cup winner. The stories over the weekend, I'm sure you saw, had suggested that the 82-year-old had been moved to end of life or palliative care in hospital in Brazil. His daughter has refuted that, saying he is just recovering from a lung infection as a result of catching COVID, which when you're going through a long-term cancer battle, obviously, has implications. She said he's not in ICU and he's feeling strong, so much, much dose of double welcome boost for the team ahead of this match against South Korea, as they try to book their place in the quarterfinal. You mentioned, though, Japan against Croatia, both Japan and South Korea looking to make it the first all-Asian quarterfinal at this tournament. Japan have already beaten Spain, they've already beaten Germany and now they are one up, just 45 minutes away from a first ever place in the World Cup quarterfinal.",
