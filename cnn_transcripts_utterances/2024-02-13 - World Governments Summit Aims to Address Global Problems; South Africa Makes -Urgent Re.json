Not least, global development conflict is at the heart of the discussion, with two wars in Israel and Ukraine. and refocusing much needed funds here at WGS, as it's known locally. It's an opportunity to reassess the issues around some of the other challenges we are facing, some of those even being existential. But we start tonight in Cairo, where right now the director of the CIA is meeting with the head of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. Onside, Qatar's prime minister and Egyptian official. They are they're discussing the potential to get a hostage deal and a truce deal. Earlier, a Hamas official told CNN that if today's talks have developments, it could send its own delegation to Cairo after these talks. Meantime, South Africa is making an urgent request to the International Court of Justice as Israel eyes up Gaza's southern city of Rafah for its next ground offensive; 1.3 million Palestinians are now hemmed into that area. U.S. President Joe Biden says, Israel should not proceed without a credible plan to protect civilians. Nada Bashir is live for us in Cairo tonight. David McKenzie is in Johannesburg with the latest on the urgent request south Africa has made to the International Court of Justice. And that is where we'll start, David, with you, if we can. What more do we know about this request? As we understand, there is this backdrop to the potential for an enormous assault on Rafah at this point. Could be brinkmanship by Israel as these negotiations on hostages and a truce are ongoing but we don't know that at this point. What do we know?",

I think there is no question that there is a perception that a limit has been crossed in the minds of some. It will have been weeks ago in the minds of somebody's, maybe tomorrow. The harsh fact, the harsh truth is that thousands have died. This conflict has not been resolved. And therefore, the urgency of at least saving those who are currently living under extraordinary conditions, including our own staff, who we are not able to support, who are living in extraordinary conditions also as refugees and internally displaced people within Gaza. And yet our UNRWA colleagues still trying to deliver, under these circumstances, lifesaving aid. That's why my colleague, Philippe Lazzarini, has also appealed that cutting off funding right now to UNRWA may be a tempting response to the allegations. And again, yesterday in Brussels at the press conference, it was underlying. These are so for allegations, horrendous as they may seem, until this review and the investigations provide further evidence or Israel provides further evidence.

The funding package passed with bipartisan support, although many Republicans opposed further aid for Ukraine. Now this sets up a showdown with the House, where its speaker, Mike Johnson, has already said that the Senate failed to meet the moment because of a lack of border security issues or measures. Ukraine claims it has evidence that Russia fired an advanced hypersonic missile. Now if that's true, it's the first time that Moscow has used this technology, which experts say is nearly impossible to shoot down. In a Telegram post, scientific experts in Ukraine claim that debris recovered after a February the 7th attack in Kyiv point to the use of a Zircon hypersonic cruise missile by Russia's military. U.S. based experts say this missile and its hypersonic speed would be the fastest in the world, making it nearly impossible to defend against. Europe also ramping up its support for Ukraine as Kyiv's military supplies run low and U.S. aid wavers. Russia's military power far outweighs Ukraine's and Kyiv needs the West's help more than ever to overcome Moscow. CNN's Fred Pleitgen shows us how Europe and Germany, in particular, plans to boost its weapons production capabilities. Have a look at this.

This video provided by the 21st Mechanized Brigade, showing, they say, how effective Western weapons are on the battlefield. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Every infantry is scared of a tank. Tanks go out and work and they fire frightfully. They fire straight into their faces and they don't even have time to think about what to do. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The Ukrainians say they need a lot more Western arms and ammo but Republicans have blocked U.S. military aid in Congress and their likely nominee for president, Donald Trump, even suggested he might encourage Russia to attack NATO members who didn't meet military spending guidelines. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (R):  I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Those comments literally have Europeans up in arms, now ramping up weapons production for Ukraine and for themselves.

Let me just explain what we have in to CNN. Hamas considers the next 24 hours of the ongoing hostage and ceasefire talks underway as critical, as sources tell CNN that, despite some progress in recent days, the negotiations there remain difficult. To quote Hamas, \"the picture will become clearer within the next 24 hours.\" A source from Hamas tells CNN, adding, \"there is clear and strong determination among the mediators to reach ceasefire understandings and begin an exchange process to release prisoners from both sides and bring in food supplies, medical and oil supplies.\" What we do know at this point is that the CIA director Bill Burns, along with the head of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence authority, and a delegation from Israel meeting in Egypt with officials there and the Qatari prime minister, of course. Qatar and Egypt have been involved in mediating what are these indirect talks between Israel and Hamas supported by the Americans. And the efforts really stepping up here as Joe Biden voices real concern about not just the hostages but what is going on with the -- in Rafah, with the threat of a full-on Israeli onslaught. There Israel suggesting that is the only way that they are going to get their hostages out. That's a very maximalist approach from the Israeli government. That hasn't started as of yet. Some will say that there may be some brinkmanship going on here as far as Israel is concerned. But the Americans certainly have said, without a plan, don't go into Rafah. Joe Biden has also said, he is hoping that these talks ongoing in Cairo at present might elicit a -- some six week truce alongside the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, which at least will provide some short-term relief for civilians. In Gaza particularly, those now hemmed in at the border with Rafah. So more on that, of course, as we get it. And the conflict in Gaza, of course, has been in the -- certainly cast a shadow over some of what is going on here at the World Governments Summit. And it has been an issue which has been discussed. Policymakers and global leaders meeting here to come up with -- solely to discuss some of the world's most pressing issues, including that of Gaza, and on others to come up with innovative solutions to what are some of the world's biggest challenges in this region. High-level gatherings often circle back to Israel's war on Hamas. Guest of honor, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used his platform here in a keynote speech to propose a solution.
