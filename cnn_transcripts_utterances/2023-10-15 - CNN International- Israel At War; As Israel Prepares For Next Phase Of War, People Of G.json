And we begin this hour with the latest on the war between Israel and Hamas.Diplomatic efforts now underway to try to contain the humanitarian crisis, intensified by the hour in Gaza. Aid workers say the situation there has descended into what they described as complete chaos. Tens of thousands fleeing after Israel told residents to leave Northern Gaza where more than a million people live as it gears up for its next stage with war with Hamas. And Palestinian officials say, the death toll has surpassed 2,600, that includes 700 children. We do want to warn you, the next video you're about to see might be disturbing. Hand out videos like this showing small children on ventilators in a hospital in Northern Gaza as the U.N. is calling for urgent humanitarian access into the Strip. Meanwhile, America's top diplomat has been meeting regional leaders, including those from Egypt. He once again called on Israel to protect civilians in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: As I said in Tel Aviv, as President Biden has said, the way that Israel does these matters, needs to do it in a way that affirms the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity. Taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's part of that interview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I think it would be a big mistake. Look, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas, don't represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake to -- for Israel to occupy Gaza again. But to go in and taking out the extremist, the Hezbollah is up north, but Hamas down south is a necessary requirement.

There's bombing around it because they want people to evacuate the hospital.

There has been, I think, the same number of bombs or more dropped on Gaza in a week or so as during the entire 50 days of the 2014 Gaza-Israel conflict. What is your assessment of the effectiveness of those strikes in a military sense of, you know, what's been achieved, including who you've taken out of the Hamas leadership? LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Yes, that is a process at work. We are actively targeting the leadership. We are degrading their military capabilities. We are trying to suppress rockets fire towards Israeli cities and civilians. And we are actively stopping or limiting their ability to launch attacks against Israel, mostly on the ground and from the perimeter close to the border. We have been able to strike and kill a few Hamas key officials, many more are on the list. From Yahya Sinwar, the butcher of Khan Yunis, and all the way down to the lowest levels of military commanders. They're all on the list and we are hard at work finding them in their hiding places. Using the best intelligence tools that we have at our disposal, including with the ISA, the Israeli security agency. And at this stage I can say that we're in the early stages. We're operating against an enemy that is cowardly and hides behind civilians. But we are making good progress and we are very determined to continue and to make sure that we dismantle Hamas.",

I think even people that were out chanting on the streets and supporting, deep down inside, they understand that what Hamas did was so basically, fundamentally perverted and they understand that they unleashed violence and significant suffering on themselves.So, at the end, what I hope and what our aspiration is that we will dismantle Hamas. And then in the future -- I can't put a timeframe on that, but in the future, the situation in Gaza will be better.

Israel Defense Forces say, at least 1,400 people were killed during the Hamas rampage on October 7th, and the IDF now says, Hamas is holding 155 people hostage.Around the world, people are taking to the streets to show their support for both the Israelis and Palestinians. Jewish communities in the U.S. have held rallies in solidarity with Israel and several western nations have stepped up security at synagogues and Jewish schools. At this gathering in Sydney, Australia, there were calls for peace and justice and condemnation of Israel's military action against Gaza. In other countries like France, pro-Palestinian demonstrations have actually been banned. Let's go to Melissa Bell in Paris. And just tell us about the level of protests around the world, Melissa.",

But substantial numbers out on the streets there of the Dutch capital. There were protests as well in Morocco, in Rabat. People took to the streets to show, again, their solidarity with Palestinians and their opposition to what Israel has been doing and is expected to continue doing with that expected incursion over the next few days in the Gaza Strip. And in London, it was -- and across other cities in the United Kingdom, it was Saturday, tens of thousands took to the street, again, in solidarity of the Palestinian people as people have all over the world now for more than a week.

Melissa Bell there in Paris for us.Now, a reminder of how the war started between Israel and Hamas and how it's upended so many lives. One moment, a young woman pictured here was enjoying the Nova Music Festival with friends and then Hamas rockets rained down. She said she managed to survive by hiding. Days later, the 21-year-old is back were her IDF unit. CNN's Dana Bash spoke with Chen, whose full name we are withholding for security. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \"CHEN\", FESTIVAL SURVIVOR/ IDF SOLDIER: I've been into Nova Festival with my friend. And we went there to celebrate life and happiness, and all we wanted to do is to dance. And during dancing, on -- about 6:30 in the morning, they shot down the music and we looked up in the sky and we saw rain of rockets. Like, literally, a rain of rockets. And no one knew what to do. So, everyone starts screaming and yelling and crying. And me and my friend, decided we need to go to our car. So, we went to our car and 3,000 people trying to go out from a parking lot, it's not something easy. It's not something nice. And while we're in our car waiting to go out, I saw everyone left their cars and started running. And I didn't know what happened, so I opened my car window and I heard someone screaming, they are here, the terrorists are here. And then I realized that this is big. Terrorists in Israel. OK. So, I left my car, me and my friends started running to the field, and I start hearing the gunshots. They come forward to us. And I lost my friend during the running and I start running by myself. So, I found a bush and I lay on the ground in the bush, and I put my hands on my head, with my face down, and the gunshots still continuing. People crying for help. And after that, about one hour or two later of hiding, I heard people not to screaming, but they were allowed to go back to their cars. Guys, go back to your cars. So, because I was on my own, I decided to raise my head a little bit up to see what's going on, and I decided I needed to go back to my car. So, I started running and I saw my friend from home during the running and I called him to come with me. And we get inside the car and we start driving because the road was blocked from both sides. And we saw the cops, they were terrified. The cops were terrified also.",
