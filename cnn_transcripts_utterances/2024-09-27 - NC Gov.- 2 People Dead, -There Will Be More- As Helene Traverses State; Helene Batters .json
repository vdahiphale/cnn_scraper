And right now, Helene is battering the southeast as it pushes deeper into the region, from Atlanta to Asheville, from southern cities, they are experiencing devastating flooding. And even though the storm has weakened to a tropical storm since making landfall, officials say that it still poses a deadly threat to take it very seriously.So far, six states have declared a state of emergency. Millions of people across the region are without power, and at least seven storm related deaths have been reported. At any minute now, we're going to hear from Governor Roy Cooper about the storm's impact in North Carolina. But first I want to bring in Isabel Rosales in Asheville, North Carolina. Isabel, we're getting these reports of catastrophic flooding there. What are you seeing?",

Look at this. This is a metal propane tank of some sort. There was another one back there. Look at this, garbage bags back here, some sort of a metal container. It is just incredible what these floodwaters are dragging through the city of Asheville. And back there toward the gas station. You can see it's reaching the pumps. Pam?",

As we said yesterday, North Carolinians should remain informed. Have a plan in place to protect your family and should take this storm seriously.The State Emergency Response Team remains fully activated today, and our operational priority continues to be on supporting our impacted local jurisdictions across the state. We continue to have our public sector, private sector, nonprofits and volunteer agencies here at the EOC and working in community -- communities across the state. Since yesterday, we have seen life threatening flash flooding, landslides and downed trees, primarily across the foothills and mountains of North Carolina. Areas of our state, particularly in the West, have seen immense rainfall totals already. As we go into this afternoon, we will continue to see rainfall across the state, with weather conditions improving over the course of the afternoon and evening. There remains a severe weather threat to Central and Eastern North Carolina, where tornadoes and heavy downpours are expected. For those that are in flood prone areas, please make sure you are informed that you have a plan of action to quickly evacuate if necessary, and that you are receiving information from reliable sources such as local emergency management offices and the National Weather Service. With such significant rainfall, water levels and flooding in the North Carolina mountains can rapidly change and can create a substantial threat to life. Many counties in Western North Carolina have ordered evacuations to save lives. It is imperative that all residents in evacuation zones please leave and move to a safer location. Please avoid traveling if at all possible, particularly in the mountains and foothills. If you must travel, please visit drivenc.gov, to check roadway status. This website is updated regularly by the Department of Transportation. As of this morning, as the governor said, there are over 290 roadways that are closed in our state from impacts of both --",

We heard the Governor give a very clear warning that even though the storm is expected to move out over the next 24 hours, that the damage will continue with -- with record flooding. He said it was one of the worst storms in modern history for parts of North Carolina.So far, he said at least two dead, but he believes that number will rise as Helene traverses the state. I want to go back to Isabel Rosales, because Isabel, you were right there, and you can really see the impact of Helene. Behind you, right before the -- the press conference, we saw a propane tank just floating by in the waters. How high is the water there?",

More than two dozen people had to be rescued. I want to bring in CNN's Nick Valencia and Ryan Young. Ryan, let's go to you first. I mean, what -- what's going on where you are?

This is one of the communities where a rescue did need to happen overnight. You see that car right there at one point, the water was above that back wiper.And even as I stand out here now, the water is starting to recede, but there are plenty of people who are stuck on the second floor waiting for this water to sort of go down and make its way out so they can start walking. So as I push my way through here, you have to understand, there were more than 25 rescues overnight. More than 10 inches of rain have dropped in the last 24 hours in Atlanta. This has made it very difficult, especially for rescue crews. Atlanta Fire Department, doing a great job to get out there to save people. There's even a woman right here with her daughter who is trying to make the decision about taking her pet out. There's more than a dozen cars that have been destroyed because of all this rainfall and because of this flooding, those conversations that will go on and on.

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, good morning. So we are inside of a restaurant here in Gulfport that was basically destroyed by the strong surge and the intense kind of the -- the winds that we saw last night yesterday. So this is what it looks like right now. You can see exactly where everything inside this restaurant was just pushed up against each other because of the about six to eight feet of storm surge that pushed in here.If you can go to your left here, I can show you just how close this restaurant is to the bay here, that part there yesterday began inching in closer to this area around 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and by about 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock at night, the water was probably about as high as that mark right there, where you see that kind of exposed wall right there. We spoke to the owner of this place just a few minutes ago, and she was telling us that they had just finished some repairs from last year's hurricane. I've been here for three years now, covering three different hurricanes, and we've always come to Pinellas County here. In fact, we've always kind of seen this restaurant, because every single time a storm either threatens the area comes really close to it, or even in years past, where it's actually had a more of a direct impact, this place has always been damaged. And so we spoke to the owner, she told us, look, I've got about 20 employees. I'm going to try and reopen again. But here I am another year where I'm dealing with another hurricane, this one well offshore, did not have a direct impact in -- in Pinellas County, and yet, this is what it looks like. She's not entirely sure just when they'll be able to reopen, but she's determined, Pam, to get this place back in order, because she says, I've been here for nearly 15 years, and this is my livelihood. She has her family and her friends are here, and she plans on rebuilding here. And that's kind of the sentiment we've heard from folks up and down this part of Gulfport. They know these hurricanes. They've weathered them before. I think their biggest surprise is the fact that this last storm was so large, and even though it was so far west that we saw the kind of storm surge that we saw yesterday, Pam. We were in this very location for a good part of yesterday. And then late in the afternoon it was unsafe for us to stay here. The water from the bay just kept just surging in, and we had to seek higher ground. Pamela?",
