But he was a volunteer in the solicitor's office and he maintained a very strong association with law enforcement that family had cultivated over these generations. And he was treated with -- as it came out in the trial, he was treated with a lot of deference and respect by law enforcement. And it appears that, you know, for decades, his family had been getting away with various crimes sum or misdemeanors of one kind or another.
