President Biden just addressed the shooting briefly here in Washington saying, quote, \"I will speak with the people of Jacksonville.\" He didn't have more to say than that, but we'll get more as it comes in.

First of all, our condolences we send to those families and to the community of Jacksonville. The question is, what are we going to do about it? It was reported that this young man was able to buy a gun with no checks apparently, legitimately buy guns that are used to kill people. The president has been talking about getting rid of assault weapons. There's not enough of a desire at this time. There are many of us who do want to see that. Somehow we've got to come together as a nation and say not just enough is enough. We have to go even further. We do need some kind of a different kind of plan.

The first one is had my father lived we would be thrust in a different trajectory, so I don't think we would be necessarily addressing this kind of issue. I think he would have worked to create a culture of non-violence many years ago. We have accepted this culture of violence and it's destroying us and it creates decay. If he was to come today and look at things, he'd be deeply disturbed because he would know America is much better than the behavior we are exhibiting.And as has been said by Arndrea, by Jonathan, we have to create some different laws. consciousness. We have to arouse the consciousness because when people engage, changes occur. So tomorrow morning I'm going to be thinking about 60 years ago there was great hope for at least at the time the march was taking place, at the time of the speeches were being delivered, and then just a few days later there's always -- Dad used to say there's always a pushback, there's an inevitable pushback whenever there is a perception of progress. So evil is always lurking. We have an ability, though, as human kind to overcome evil, and that's what we've got to work on. We need to look to the future. We understand the past, but we're looking to the future. There are many other things. You know, history has been written out especially black history. Books are being banned about the holocaust and so many other things about the history of people. You know, our daughter has fewer rights today than she did when she was born. She's 15 years old. In 2008 she had more rights than she does in 2023. That is unacceptable, but it only changes when we come together. We can't give up. We can't give out. We can't give in.",

Owens' mother, a black woman who was slaughtered for doing what any mother would do defending her kids. You know, we really need to look at what's going on in this country. We need to look at what's happening in the state of Florida. You're talking about not teaching history. You know, teaching history is about collective -- it's not about collective guilt, it's about collective responsibility. You're talking about not teaching history in a state where roles would happen. Where there were a lot of -- so you can't -- you know, so we have to really now we have to stand up and stand for the kind of nation that we want to live in, the kind of nation that we want our children to live in. We're at a point in time where laws are being passed, oppression is being legislated, and laws are being passed so rapidly that are restricting freedoms that we haven't seen this truly in this manner since the end of reconstruction and the beginning of the passage of black codes. So what we are saying and what we all are standing for is that laws should lift us all up and not limit us. And that's our work, that's what we all, I think now and particularly after yesterday that we are going to quadruple, as Martin said, our efforts and what we are asking is that any American that is standing for democracy, that stands for the ideals of freedom, of peace, and justice and equity to join us and be a part of building the beloved community of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King.",
