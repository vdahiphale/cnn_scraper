President Biden confirming the operation overnight, more than 100 special operations personnel were involved in the extraction.The decision to evacuate came after a week of heavy fighting between rival military factions that left more than 400 dead and thousands injured. We've got full coverage with Kylie Atwood at the State Department, Kevin Liptak at the White House. Kylie, let's begin with you. This was a big operation. I mean, what was happening behind the scenes at the State Department and what provoked this decision?",

      "sentences": "Major operation. And what you have to understand with embassies like this that are in areas where conflict can arise, is that the State Department has plans for these evacuations. But then they have to go back and look at these plans in a very detailed way. And that's what State Department officials, along with their Pentagon colleagues, were doing over the course of the last few days.But we know that they told Congress earlier in the week that the conditions on the ground in Sudan were just too dicey to carry out an evacuation of the U.S. diplomats who were there. But they did follow through, and they did it on Saturday night. Now, that was a plan. This execution was followed through after President Biden and the Secretary of State approved this plan. And here are a few things about how this went down. It was carried out by about 100 Special Forces. They were on the ground in Sudan for less than an hour. A very fast operation, in and out, obviously because of the ongoing security threats in that country. And when you talk about how many people there were, there are about 100 folks who were part of this operation. There were -- that included U.S. diplomats and their family members who were there, and a few other diplomats from other countries. And they got on these flights. This was an operation that started in Djibouti. These U.S. airplanes, that were Pentagon airplanes went into the country, picked up these American citizens, and took them out to Ethiopia. Now, of course, one thing that we continue to watch is U.S. citizens who are still in Sudan, because the State Department, a senior State Department official, said that they're -- they do not foresee a U.S. government coordinated evacuation for those U.S. citizens at this time. Essentially, what that means is they don't plan on U.S. military aircraft going into the country and getting U.S. citizens who are still there. But what we do know is that the State Department is in touch with hundreds of Americans as of late last week who are in the country, and they are providing them with some assistance in terms of laying out plans, pathways to potentially get out of the country over land routes. So they have connected them with some other governments that are leading caravans out of the country, sending that information to U.S. citizens in the country today.",

The Emirates were trying reportedly to make a road move perhaps towards Port Sudan, which is being used as a significant evacuation point, particularly by the Saudis. But that's an 800 miles or 800 kilometer, I should say, drive at least. And there's very short supplies of water, of fuel and of food. And, of course, foreigners are very, very restricted in the amount of movement they can make even around the capital Khartoum. Of course, others are scattered elsewhere in the country. This is extremely volatile situation, made all the more dangerous by the fact that one of the warring factions here is the SAF, the Sudan Armed Forces. And they are using aircraft. So they are using aircraft to bomb their opponents amidst all of these international efforts, also involving aircraft to try to get people out.",

And, in fact, over the last several days, the President had ordered up several steps as this became sort of an inevitability.The President ordered military resources to Djibouti and he also ordered up the consolidation of the diplomatic personnel who remained in Khartoum to the diplomatic compound there, to the embassy. It's on the outskirts of the city that was so that they could all be evacuated together. And so once that evacuation was successful, the president did announce it in a statement. He said, \"I am grateful for the unmatched skill of our service members who successfully brought these diplomats to safety. And I thank Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia, which were critical to the success of our operation.\" The President went on to say, \"We are temporarily suspending operations at the U.S. Embassy in Sudan, but our commitment to the Sudanese people and the future they want for themselves is unending.\" Now, the President also said that he was receiving regular updates on these efforts to assist American citizens who may remain behind in Khartoum. Of course, there won't be that large scale military evacuation, but the President does want to keep updated on what steps are being taken to potentially get those citizens out going forward.

So whether it's land in concert with other countries, we know France and others are assisting, or it's some path, a long path to get to water and potentially Navy or other countries. Navy support are your only two options. Right now, the communications is clearly stay put. Do not make yourself vulnerable to violence that is breaking out relatively quickly if you cannot get out safely. But those communications are ongoing right now.

The FDA went too far when it approved mifepristone and says the court should be looking at restrictions to block the medication from being sent by mail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Sending the abortion drug through the mail is a big change in how is provided. In 2000, when it was first approved, you had to have four visits to the doctor. In 2021, the Biden administration said you don't have to even consult a physician anymore and send it through the mail. Is that safe? Is that -- has the FDA gone too far?

[14:15:09] And so, we're not surprised by these attacks. I mean, this is coming from someone who wants a national ban and said so, and said it out loud. So mifepristone is safe. It's been safe for 23 years. It's safer than Thailand, then Viagra, then a colonoscopy, then having your wisdom teeth taken out. It hasn't been challenged in a timely way. The standing of the individuals who are challenging it is dubious at best. The FDA is expert in this space and should be given deference by the court.

So that's better news than we've seen in a while. It makes me optimistic that perhaps there are better days ahead for our country when it comes to access to safe and legal reproductive health care. And, you know, but, you know, we saw the Dobbs case that was painful and harmful. It hurt people across our nation.

It's led to increased thefts, increased injuries, deaths across the nation.And they were fully capable of including that engine immobilizer in their vehicles. They were doing -- every other manufacturer was including engine immobilizers. Kia and Hyundai were including those engine immobilizers in the very same vehicles that they were manufacturing and selling in Canada and in Europe, but not doing so in the U.S. Why? Because they were cutting corners. They were trying to save costs and pass those costs on to local law enforcement, which, of course, are paid by the taxpayers. They were choosing profits over public safety. So Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 114 is not in compliance here by Kia or by Hyundai. They need to comply with it.

The laws signed by Republican Governor Tate Reeves, expand state police jurisdiction in Jackson and establish a new court system in a district created by the state. CNN's Isabel Rosales is joining me now with more on this. So, the NAACP is alleging that these new laws racially discriminatory and will bring back a sort of separate but unequal policing policy system.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, at the heart of this controversy is racial justice and really representation. The legislators who introduced these bills now laws they represent districts outside of Jackson. The state legislature is primarily white and Republican.The city of Jackson is primarily Democratic and over 80 percent black. Now the supporters of this these new laws they point to the crime rate in Jackson that has seen the homicide rate more than double in the past 10 years, peaking in 2021, 12 times the national average, making Jackson one of the deadliest cities in the U.S. Let's dig a little deeper into these new laws because they're important. It will allow the state of Mississippi to expand reach of state control law enforcement to the entire city of Jackson. This is a force that has primarily protected the capital and the surrounding area and has not engaged in city law enforcement. This force does not answer to local officials. It answers to state appointed leadership. There's also major changes coming to the judicial system, which would establish a new court within the boundaries of this new capitol complex improvement district. So this is going to be a judge appointed by the Republican state chief justice. Prosecuting attorneys will be appointed by the Republican state attorney general. The NCAAP filed a lawsuit, electronically filed lawsuit back in a -- back on Friday after the governor signed this into law. Here's what they said: Lawmakers and Jackson residents have opposed both bills throughout the legislative session, citing outside attempts to increase policing without adequate training to silence dissent from Jackson residents and stripped residents of their voting powers to elect judges and district attorneys who serve their interests. Now listen to the Governor Tate Reeves, what he said on Wednesday before signing these bills into law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TATE REEVES (R), MISSISSIPPI:  I want what's best for Jackson, but for us to continue to see young kids getting killed in the streets, for us to continue to see property crimes that are happening here that are causing businesses to leave, we've got to make sure that we have law and order, and I don't think there's any doubt that if you talk to businesses, and we talked to the residents of Jackson, capitol police shows up when there's a crime being committed and they're called.

I mean, you know, I don't even know all the circumstances about his diagnosis, or you know, his situation, you know, prior to him being found behind that airport, but how does it -- how can something like this happened when it seems like someone who has reached an apex right in their career in their sport, and then somehow seemed to be struggling alone before someone locates him and is able to kind of take them under the wing and help him, continue to help him.",

The former GM of the Tampa Bay team that drafted him went to the Dodgers, and he's the one that actually have initial contact with Mr. Toles. And so the care for this person began very, very early.
