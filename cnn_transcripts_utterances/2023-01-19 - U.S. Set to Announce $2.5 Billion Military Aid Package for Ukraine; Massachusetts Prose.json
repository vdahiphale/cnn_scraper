I'm Christine Romans this Thursday morning.We begin here, in just days, the U.S. is expected to finalize a huge package of military aid for Ukraine. Valued at about $2.5 billion, it will be one of the largest military packages announced since the war began, nearly a year ago. Sources tell CNN it is expected to include, for the very first time Striker combat vehicles, along with more Bradley fighting vehicles and more mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, on top of the nearly 500 MRAPs already committed. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us live from London. Clare, it's also notably what's not in this package, right? Long range missiles and especially tanks. The Ukrainians have been pleading for these from the U.S.",

The Pentagon and the State Department making it clear that this is more a sort of practical and logistical concern behind not including those things. A lot of training and maintenance are involved, and there were questions around their compatibility with what else Ukraine had in play on the battlefield that it's getting for other European allies.They are not -- they are not in principle opposed to tanks, we understand from the senior defense minister that the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who we just saw, in Germany, is set to presses German counterpart to allow for the re-export of German tanks to Ukraine, something that Germany is under increasing pressure to do. In terms of long range missiles, I think that there are greater concerns about how Russia would perceive this given that they would be able to reach Russian territory. In fact, in the past hour, we have heard from the Kremlin, who said that any discussions on supplying Ukraine with weapons, that could hit Russian territory it's extremely dangerous and could take the conflict to a new level. President Zelenskyy speaking again in Davos, this morning. He said, Christine, that he was not planning to use those missiles and Russian territories to simply strike targets in Russian occupied territory in Ukraine. And, he also made it clear that he will not be diminishing his goals in the face of this continued aggression from Russia, that he still intends to try to take back Crimea. That, of course, is a very serious topic for Russia, a very sensitive topic, and something that they have warned about in the past that could lead to a significant escalation. So he is not backing down for his rhetoric, all the while continuing to press his Western allies for more weapons.",
