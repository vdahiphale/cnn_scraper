      "sentences": "The race is close, but if we want to break it down into some numbers here, look, this to me is the simplestway to sort of show it mathematically. Kamala Harris likely must carry three of these four states to win. These are the states that are most likely going to determine who the next president of the United States is. You look in North Carolina, look at this. Donald Trump with less than a point lead. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, that great blue wall in the great lake states. Harris ahead by less than a point, less than a point, less than a point. When you`re showing the four most important states and the margin in all four of them, is one of the candidates up by less than a point? I`m not quite sure there`s any other way to put it than this race is really, really close. So let`s just say that the polls were exactly 100% correct. And so the results match the polls and Harris wins Pennsylvania up here in blue. What does that mean? Well, it means Kamala Harris gets 276 electoral votes. Of course, you need 270 to win, hence the road to 270. So she just gets over that mark. But it`s so simple, so simple to give the election to Donald Trump. So I mentioned Pennsylvania. What happens if the results match the polls exactly, but Trump wins Pennsylvania, we turn Pennsylvania light red or pink, then we get Donald Trump at 281 electoral votes. When just one state, flipping one state could turn a loser into a winner and vice versa. I`m not quite sure that there`s any way else to put it than what I said at the very top. This race is close. So you know, we`re talking about all this and oftentimes I say this race is historically close. And, you know, we look at the popular vote polls. So I decided to do it a slightly different way, which is, OK, what I`m going to do is at the end of each election cycle, I said, OK, how did the polls look and what was the projected count in the Electoral College? Well, at this particular point, if the polls are exactly right, Kamala Harris would get 276 electoral votes. That is the lowest level for a leader at the end of a campaign in terms of the projected electoral map going back since at least 1972. In 2000, Al Gore was projected to get 281 electoral votes. Of course, the polls missed in Florida. It flipped. George W. Bush won that campaign. In 2004, look at that. George W. Bush was projected to get 296 electoral votes. The polls were actually pretty gosh darn close. The only state they missed was Wisconsin actually. That state flipped into John Kerry`s column. But the bottom line is this, at this particular point, this is the closest race heading into an election on record, at least over the last 52 years or so. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Over the side of the crater, as far as my eye can see, is lava cooling with heat rising off it, spewing down towards the sea. And the smell in the air is thick with sulfur. It smells like eggs. Experts say the volcanic activity in this area of Iceland is entering a new era of unrest, an era that could last hundreds of years. And this future underscores the complicated history that Icelanders have with volcanoes, a relationship that takes but also gives. Standing here, you get such a sense of the power of this volcano, and it`s exactly this power that they`re trying to harness in the north of the country. And if they can do it, and it`s a big if, they say the potential could be limitless. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Folks in Iceland aren`t just dreaming about it. They`re living it. The country is hitting the snooze button on one whole day of the workweek by making it four days instead of five. They`re setting out to prove that they can get all of their work that`s expected to be done in a week completed in less time. Let`s head to Iceland now, where they`re turning that Friyay feeling into Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Imagine working a shorter week for the same pay. Well, for more than 50% of the workforce in Iceland, this has been areality in recent years. It came about thanks to two successful trials in the country dating back to 2015. Two and a half thousand workers were allowed to reduce their hours from 40 hours to 35, 36 a week, and the results were good. Researchers found that productivity stayed the same or improved in most workplaces, and workers` well-being increased dramatically. Now, so much of the country`s workforce has followed suit, so it`s been interesting to look at the Icelandic economy to see if it`s had any sort of effect. Well, given it`s growing at a faster pace than much of Europe, and the unemployment rate is low, it certainly doesn`t appear to be a drag. But before you all decide that you`re going to take your Mondays off from now on, you might want to ask your employer first, and what works in a very small country with an outsized service and tourism sector may not work everywhere.
