The IDF aerial video does not show any clear details and whether people in the video were carrying guns or shooting at civilians.And we're not showing it because we can't independently verify the video's content, location or time. We do have video from Gaza's city Al Shifa Hospital showing the wounded. A warning that this video does include some disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KINKADE (voice-over): The hospital says it received more than 60 injured people about an hour after that incident. One witness says the victims were waiting for aid to arrive when they were bombarded with shells. Gaza's health ministry says at least 20 people were killed. More than 150 wounded. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem with more on the aid situation in Gaza and the ceasefire talks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, just days ago, it seemed like those negotiations between Israel and Hamas were at an impasse. But now those talks appear to be back on track or at least moving forward.Hamas has submitted its latest counterproposal demanding the release of some 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, 100 of whom are currently serving life sentences in Israeli prisons. That would be in exchange for some 40 Israeli hostages, women, children, the elderly and sick hostages in a first phase of this agreement. That ratio though, is still much higher than what Israel put on the table and what so far they've been willing to accept. In fact, an Israeli government official calling this latest proposal from Hamas still absurd and extreme. And a U.S. official indicating that it will be very hard to get Israel to agree to this latest proposal. But there is still some cautious optimism in the air, perhaps even a sense of momentum. The Israeli government did review this latest proposal on Friday in a meeting of the war cabinet. And next week, the Israeli government intends to send a negotiating team to Doha, Qatar, to seek to advance at these latest negotiations. And there's no question that a ceasefire in Gaza at this moment, humanitarian aid agencies, the United Nations, many countries in the world, saying that it is essential at this point because of how dire that humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has now become. About 0.5 million people in Gaza now on the brink of famine. Cases of malnutrition rapidly rising, particularly in northern Gaza. And that's where on Friday we saw this latest humanitarian aid convoy, this time arriving by sea, and an aid ship being carried out by the World Central Kitchen, arriving in northern Gaza. It's set to provide some 0.5 million meals. Questions now about how exactly they will distribute that aid and how they will do so safely. As we've seen, crowds of desperate Palestinians have surrounded these convoys in the past, creating some very dangerous situations. And so this remains a question. We also know, of course, that land convoys getting that aid in by land is the most effective way. And so still a lot of pressure on Israel to open up more land routes into northern Gaza. -- Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And Russia's central election committee, which is essentially the body which controls the elections and stipulates what can happen and what can't.It sets the rules ultimately, have said that Ukrainians in the occupied Russian-occupied territory that is Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, which were all illegally annexed, are able to vote in these elections. It's the central election committee, counts them up to be some 4.5 million people. And although the Russian state has been on a regime of trying to coerce Ukrainians in these territories to take Russian passports, they have changed the rules slightly to allow Ukrainians who still have Ukrainian passports to be able to vote in these elections. It's a way of increasing that voter turnout. And actually in the regions themselves, voting opened ahead of the regular polling in the Russian Federation, so to speak, mainland, mainland Russia. And we will see, we will see, we will have to see what the outcome will be. But we were relying very heavily on state media for what happens there because there are no individual election observers. And even the Ukrainian government has called what is going to go on in the occupied, what they see as their land, essentially, as being a bit of a sham. But interestingly, Lynda, on the day of the Sunday evening into Monday, when we will find out who will win this election, it's also the 10th anniversary of the illegal annexation of Crimea.

Gunshots. Do you hear that? There it is. Already hearing gunshots just a few seconds into stepping out of the car after arriving here at Port-au-Prince. Our pilot said they had been shot at at previous trips and yet they still intend to continue to make these missions as often as they can, not just to bring people in, who like us want to cover this and bring this story to the world, but more importantly, to bring those who are desperate to get out. It's been a lot of diplomats in particular that have left. But others are on the list. In fact, some of the pilots that we've spoken with say they have lists that are hundreds of people desperate to get out. Of course that is a luxury. The Haitians don't have that opportunity, nor can they even consider it.
