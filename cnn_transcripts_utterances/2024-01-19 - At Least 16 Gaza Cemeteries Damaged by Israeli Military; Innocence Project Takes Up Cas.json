UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): They dug up the graves, these are the graves. DIAMOND (voice-over): At the Khan Younis Cemetery where the military dug up bodies this week, the damage is extensive and all too familiar. Tombs destroyed, shrouded bodies sticking out of the soil, the dead roused from their final rest. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on-camera): And the Israeli military pointed to Hamas using some of these cemeteries for their military purposes to explain some of the destruction that we documented here, but we're not just talking about targeted attacks on cemeteries. Instead, what we have seen here through satellite imagery, through some of the videos we've collected on the ground, is large-scale bulldozing of certain cemeteries. Sometimes vehicles just driving right over these graves and taking little care effectively to preserve the dignity of the dead. This speaks to something far more systematic than what the Israeli military acknowledged.",

A Republican-led House panel has asked Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to testify about his recent hospital stay. The White House, Congress and the public did not find out that he was in the hospital until several days after he was admitted, and it took even longer for Secretary Austin to disclose that he was being treated for prostate cancer.

Just take us through what happened here and how they got all those kids out so quickly. CHIEF JOHN DONNELLY, WASHINGTON, D.C. FIRE AND EMS: So the fire department was dispatched for an outside gas leak. That's pretty normal call for us. The units arrived on the scene. They stopped short because you don't want to drive in front of a gas leak. And when they got there they realized there was a big problem. They called the gas company and they started evacuating the buildings around them. But when they got to the daycare, the daycare staff was already putting coats and blankets on the kids 2 1/2 months to 4 years old. So they encouraged them to hurry up. They got them out of the building. And then a few minutes later that is when the first explosion happened.",
