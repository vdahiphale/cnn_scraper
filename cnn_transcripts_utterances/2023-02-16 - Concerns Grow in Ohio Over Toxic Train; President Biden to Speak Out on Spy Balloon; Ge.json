We are just getting this recall report in that's coming from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I want to walk you through what models we're talking about. So we're talking about the Tesla Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles spanning several years, 2016 all the way up until 2023. And, as you mentioned, all of these vehicles we're talking about are equipped with that self-driving beta software. And now Tesla is going to be giving a free software update. But, in the meantime, they're recalling these vehicles. The federal government is saying that the system, the issue with the system, that software issue, is that the system may allow the vehicle -- according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it could allow the vehicle to act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or potentially proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution. And the vehicle may respond insufficiently to a change in posted speed limits. Again, this information is really just coming in. And we do know again that Tesla is going to be providing that free software update, but 363,000 vehicles, Kasie, it gives you a sense of the scale of this recall and just how many Americans this could be impacting. And, certainly, this is a story that's been talked about for a while. Tesla's self-driving technology has been under the microscope. We saw ads during the Super Bowl that were criticizing that technology. So this is something we have been watching, Kasie. But, again, all this information just coming in, in the last couple of minutes, this recall, 363,000 Tesla vehicles that are being looked at because of that self-driving technology, that software.",

Key pieces of the special grand jury report were just released. And here is the explosive takeaway -- quote -- \"A majority of the grand jury believes that perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses. The grand jury recommends that the district attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling.\" Now, there were no names mentioned, but we know that 75 people testified, including Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani, Senator Lindsey Graham, Michael Flynn, and John Eastman.

They weren't sure what was actually going to be in these snippets. And once it was released, they spent time really going through it. Now, we did get a statement from the campaign on this report. This is what they said: \"The long-awaited, important sections of the Georgia report, which do not even mention President Trump's name, have nothing to do with the president because President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong,\" continues to say: \"The president participated in two perfect phone calls regarding election integrity in Georgia, which he is entitled to do. In fact, as president, it was President Trump's constitutional duty to ensure election safety, security, and integrity.\" So, a couple of things to note here. One, as you mentioned earlier, there were no names in this. So it's not just former President Trump's name that's not in here. There were, again, zero names. But, also, there's conflict here. He talks about election integrity. And we now know that this grand jury unanimously voted that there was no election interference that would have merited then overturning the 2020 election in the state of Georgia. Now, in the statement, one other piece of this, which is something of a new defense that I heard recently from former President Trump and again in this statement, and he goes on to say that there were lawyers on both of these calls, and that nobody raised any objection to the fact that he was asking for these votes to be found. It is just an interesting twist here, something that goes along the lines of Trump saying that it's freedom of speech for him to be able to say this on a phone call. We will see, again, how the rest of Trump's orbit is reacting to this news.",

And that kind of then sets them up to say, listen, we talked to 75 witnesses, we reviewed a lot of other evidence, and it sounds like they're going to recommend charges against more than one person, not just for perjury, but we can assume for other things as well. So we're all going to wait for that. But the perjury thing is interesting, in part because, when you think about the people who testified, the Trump allies who testified in front of the grand jury, to charge perjury, you can't just say an opinion that turns out to be wrong. Like, a statement that \"I think there was fraud in the 2020 election\" is not going to be chargeable. You have to have an actual factual statement. So, that's why it's kind of interesting to see who they will actually charge. It will have to be someone who alleges some sort of thing that is provably false as a factual matter.",

I think, last year, there were many analysts and strategists in the Republican Party who thought that it would be a kind of a rally-around-the-flag effect, that if Trump got indicted by either Georgia or the federal government, that his supporters would be -- would kind of double down that this is proof that the deep state is conspiring against him and out to silence you by silencing him. But I think the election may have changed that dynamic significantly. And what we have seen since November is a growing number of basically Republican elites, donors, strategists, elected officials who believe that, whatever they think about Trump personally, he cannot win again. And I think, in that -- through that prism, Kasie, indictments might become more evidence of that kind of conclusion. And I do think that there may be parts of the party that do, in fact, rally around him. But I think it's pretty guaranteed that, if he gets indicted by one or more entities, that it will only deepen the belief among Republican leaders that he is too damaged to win again.",

And Georgia has become a more and more important swing state. Trump lost it in 2020. Republicans have lost the Senate there. Let's say Trump is the nominee, because he would have to obviously get -- get to a general election before this would really matter.

They cratered in them again in 2022. The one exception to that pattern was Brian Kemp in Georgia. And it was largely because I think he was defined to those suburban voters as independent of Trump because of his standing up on the 2020 election. I think the message of that is pretty clear that, in all of these places that ultimately decided the election in 2020, it's going to be an uphill fight for Trump to reclaim the voters who said no to him in '18, no to him in '20, and no to him again in '22. I think it is a clear warning sign, I think, for Republicans about his ability to win those places. Now, that's not absolute. The economy could be bad enough and so forth. But I think the fact that Kemp did better than their nominees in those other states is a really important signal for just how toxic Trump's imprimatur was in these places that are likely to decide the next presidential result.",

But I think this subpoena shows that he is not currently cooperating. Otherwise, they wouldn't need to subpoena him. It looks like they want him as a witness. If they were planning to charge him with evidence that they were collecting from other witnesses and other information, then they wouldn't call into the grand jury. DOJ rarely brings targets to the grand jury. So it seems to me that he's not cooperating, but they're looking to bring him into the grand jury. They will likely have to immunize him because he will probably take the Fifth. But they want his testimony more than they want to charge him.

But he did undergo a battery of tests at Walter Reed National Medical Center this morning. He spent several hours there getting these various tests done. We know that he -- it does not appear that he was put under anesthesia at any point. We know that, previously, if there is some kind of colonoscopy, for example, that the vice president is temporarily empowered. That does not appear to have happened this time. But, of course, this comes as President Biden is preparing for his potential reelection campaign and questions about his age are sure to be a central focus.
