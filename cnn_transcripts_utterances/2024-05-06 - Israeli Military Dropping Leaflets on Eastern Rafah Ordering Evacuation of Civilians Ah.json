      "sentences": "Well, John, this morning, the Israeli military dropped thousands of leaflets on eastern Rafah, ordering an area were about 100,000 people are currently living to begin evacuating north to what the Israeli military is describing as an expanded humanitarian area where they say they've set up additional tents and brought in additional access to food, water, and field hospitals for the population that is leaving.But this morning, people began to flee Rafah as a result of those evacuation orders. And certainly, there is enormous fear and anxiety among the population, not only those in that very evacuation zone in eastern Rafah, but in that at city more widely, a city where more than a million Palestinians are currently living. And make no mistake, while the Israeli military is describing this as a, quote, \"limited scale operation,\" this is certainly setting the stage for a major Israeli ground offensive into Rafah. We had expected that these evacuations, this ground offensive would not happen all at once but rather in stages. We don't know how far away we are from Israeli troops actually beginning to move into Rafah. But certainly, the evacuation effort has now begun. But the question is now, well move that humanitarian zone, as it's being described, be sufficient for the population that is moving, not only the 100,000, but also this morning humanitarian aid officials raising questions about the possibility that widespread panic could be spreading in Rafah. And you will see people from other areas not in the immediate evacuation zone also beginning to flee, and that that humanitarian zone could quickly be flooded. This is all, of course, happening because over the weekend there was a lot of hope and optimism around these ceasefire negotiations, but those negotiations have now stalled. Two Israeli officials telling me that the negotiations are not dead altogether. But certainly, there is a lot of concern that a deal cannot be achieved. I'm told that the main sticking point here is Hamas's demand that the war be ended altogether as part of this ceasefire agreement. That is something that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to agree to as part of these latest talks. John?",

And I think you could interpret Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech yesterday where he went to the Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem and said if Israel needs to, it will do this alone, as an indication that he was probably rejecting the president's advice.So the president now faces the harsh reality of his own words. He said a few weeks ago before the Iranian missile attacks changed the tone and tenor or what was going on in Israel, that if Prime Minister Netanyahu did not begin to go along with American advice and did not pursue humanitarian assurances, and so forth, that he would begin to change the nature of the relationship with Israel. He did not say what that meant. Everybody assumes that meant some kind of limitation on the offensive weapons that the administration and Congress have been providing Israel. But no one has been that explicit. And that will be the pressure that will turn back on the president, particularly after the campus protests.",

Israel by-and-large, did agree to the terms.

That's the inference such that Trump has knowledge that his fixer did not go rogue, unlike defense claims, this is just the argument, but was doing it at the behest and the direction of Trump. That is because there was mass concern. Why? Who was Hope Hicks? She is the press secretary for the campaign later, White House communications director. She would know what the campaign is all about. What they're doing, what their activities are, what Mr. Trump is directing people to do. Access Hollywood tape comes out. Boom. It is a bombshell. What are we going to do to quell this fire? We cannot have another story come out that would diminish our campaign. Silence that story. Trump tells Cohen, get this done. Payment is made, has his knowledge, case over. That's what the prosecution wants the jury to take from that testimony.  BERMAN:  Yes, we have someone very close to Trump saying that Trump thought it was better than this come out after the election, which is key to the prosecution to prove the election interference part of their case.",

And so an answer to your question, were seeing the buildup. The build up with Pecker. What does catch and kill mean? You take these stories, you bury them. Moving on to Davidson, the attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, his interactions with Cohen. The payment is made, right? So this is building up. When you look at a movie, John, or you read a book, you expect logical steps to ultimately get to that conclusion. I suspect that were going to have some, a little dry testimony, as it relates to your question. What do I mean? I mean bank records, right, with respect to checks. I mean ledgers from the Trump Organization. I mean invoices, non-sexy stuff has to go in there. But the prosecutors, in telling a story need the other, right, this sensational stuff which will get us there and then we get to the Michael Cohens, the Stormy Daniels, the Karen McDougals, that I think will happen.",

What we know right now is that Democrats are willing to help table this motion to vacate. That means essentially they will help kill it. That means that Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort here is in some parts symbolic, but she and her colleagues who are supportive of this, there are two others, Paul Gosar and Thomas Massie, they say that this is about getting Republicans on the record, making clear who is supportive of Johnson and who isn't, and sending a signal to Speaker Johnson that if he were to win the majority again, he wouldn't have the votes to become the speaker, in their words, making him a lame duck speaker. Now yesterday, Jeffries addressed this in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" saying that Democrats are willing to help kill this because they don't want to thrust the Congress once again into chaos.
