And he described the situation -- he used to be with a secret service and he -- his name was Boris -- his name is Chris Sanchez, rather. And he said I've never seen experienced anything like this. What we were dealing with was very chaotic. There were about a dozen vehicles, cars, scooters, and bicycles, the public were in jeopardy at several points. It could have been fatal.

What do you make of all of this?RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Let's split it into two aspects. So, let's deal with Harry first. This goes to the very heart of all his complaints that nobody listens, nobody does anything. And in a sense, the statement that Jason Carroll just read out from the -- from the couple is a very large, I told you so. He's put it in blunt terms that this -- and, of course, when you think about what he said to Oprah Winfrey, history was repeating itself. My mother was chased to her death. You want to talk about history repeating itself, they're not going to stop until she dies. So, that's the Harry part. And we can now see that the -- and certainly today's statements by the New York Police does give legitimacy. This is no longer Harry whining as you say, winging about what goes on. Now, the other bit. What you're going to do about it? Well, you've got the First Amendment. These paparazzi are merely exercising their First Amendment rights of journalism. How -- are you going to prosecute them for dangerous driving? They've probably got cameras that can tell you who they were. Unless you do something, you may just not, you know, why bother?

The U.S. has already committed now to hold -- hosting a state visit for the Australian prime minister here at the White House as sort of a way to compensate for this last-minute cancellation. But look, make no mistake, in that region, where the U.S. has been trying to reassert its leadership amid these concerns of an increasingly aggressive China, this is being viewed by some as somewhat of a snub and raising questions once again about the U.S.'s long term commitment to leadership in that region.Now, White House officials insist that the U.S. is still very much committed to the -- to leadership in the Indo-Pacific to pushing back on China. That's a big part, of course of that QUAD summit that the president was supposed to attend. And they also note that President Biden will nonetheless meet with those leaders of the QUAD, India, Japan, Australia, and the United States while he is in Japan for this G7 summit. But they also say that canceling this meeting shows that the U.S. is serious about making sure that the U.S. doesn't default on its debt. And that, of course, we know the implications of that could be tremendous in terms of not only the U.S. economic impacts but also in terms of the U.S.'s standing in the world. And that's certainly something that's still going to hang over the president's visit to Japan and this G7 meeting as he is heading into this with the threat of default really looming over him. But ultimately, the decision to cancel the second part of that trip is a recognition that President Biden needs to be in the room with the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, next week if they are indeed to finalize a deal to cut spending and to ultimately avert those catastrophic consequences of default. And so, President Biden, he is set to return on Sunday from that trip to Japan. And then very quickly, we expect him to get back in the room with those congressional negotiators following days of conversations between a White House staff and McCarthy's deputies as well, Brianna.",
