The target letter is the clear signal yet that Trump is likely to face charges. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

In some cases, people would receive target letters and not be indicted. But look, this is a pretty clear signal of the direction this is heading. And it really does crystallize that prosecutors in this case are focused on the behavior of former President Donald Trump not just focused on the behavior of those around him. And we know, we've been reporting for weeks that there are signals that this investigation is winding down. That prosecutors have spoken to dozens of witnesses, including people like Mark Meadows, who is a very important witness. Donald Trump's former White House Chief of Staff in this investigation.

So, this raises a big question of if prosecutors are going to move ahead with this indictment, which venue, are they going to seek to move it in?Is it going to come in Washington, D.C.? Is it going to come in Florida? And again, you said, the question is when? We know from the activity around prosecutors that it looks like this case has been winding down.

Perhaps a witness has recanted or said something different that has caused the department to step back. But as a general matter, the department has done its job. It's to start -- it's made the decision that we're about ready to go forward. Yes, it would -- it would be unusual. I'm most interested as a former attorney general about, you know, the discussions that have occurred between Jack Smith and the leadership of the Department of Justice and the mechanics of how this is going to roll out if in fact, there is an indictment.Very curious about how that's going to work. I think what you're likely to see -- I think, as this process moves along, the deputy attorney general has had conversations from time to time with the special counsel to make sure that the special counsel is following the rules and procedures of the Department of Justice. The day-to-day supervision is not being conducted as you might normally have by the leadership over this investigation. But nonetheless, the Special Counsel is required to follow the processes and procedures of the department and which as an example of that, you've got the target letter. That is what the Department of Justice does. And then, of course, the Deputy Attorney General's likely to have conversations with the Attorney General about where the -- where the investigation is, how comfortable they are with respect to the process. But the actual determination of whether to move forward, it lies in the hands of Jack Smith. And they're going to defer that judgment. And Jack Smith at the appropriate time will tell the deputy attorney general, you know, I'm ready to go. The deputy attorney general will then have a conversation with the attorney general. The attorney general may want to have a direct conversation with Jack Smith just to hear him out talk about the case. And then probably at the appropriate time, maybe an hour or so before the end -- before the department issues its announcement. There'll be a conversation probably between the bag and the White House counsel about what's about to happen. I don't think the White House will get much notice in advance of that. But generally, that's the way that it would have operated on -- in the Bush administration.",

It is so bad right here in New York City, that it is currently the most polluted major city in the entire world. The haze is so blinding.There was another ground stop at LaGuardia airport this morning and the FAA says flights will be delayed on average about an hour. Take a look at Washington, D.C. right now which is 200 miles by the way, south of New York City. The bulk of this smoke is shifting south to the nation's capital. Also, the cities like Baltimore.

The Air Quality Index right now at this hour puts us at about the same level of poor air quality that New York is experiencing. I'll step out of the shot here. Our photo journalist Steve Williams will turn his camera down toward the U.S. Capitol.You can see just how hazy it is. Now the difference between now and an hour ago when I joined you is that the sun is more prominent in the sky right now, of course. And the sun is out. There are no clouds covering the sky. Normally, it would be a beautiful day out here. But look at it. It is incredibly hazy, incredibly smoky down Pennsylvania Avenue. This view that you're seeing here normally, you can see the Capitol very, very clearly, even when it's raining. But look at it. You can barely make it out against this kind of white- yellowish sky in the backdrop and if Steve puts his camera down at street level, you can actually see what pedestrians, commuters and others are up against as they try to make their way around the city. The visibility is not great. We see a lot of people out here wearing N-95 masks from the COVID days because it is kind of tough to walk along the way. They are advising people do not do anything strenuous outdoors. It is a code red air quality alert. We can give you some other updates too as to what's going on in this area. We just got word that the Fairfax County School System has canceled all outdoor activities today. That means recess for the kids not happening outside. You got to do it inside. Sports activities canceled. Marching band practice canceled. Even mowing operations are canceled for Fairfax County Schools. The Washington Nationals Baseball Team here did not cancel their game last night against the Arizona Diamondbacks. We know that Major League Baseball games in New York and Philadelphia were canceled last night. The nationals have a 1:05 p.m. start slated against the Diamondbacks today. I frankly be surprised if that game went ahead of schedule, given the air quality behind us. What officials are saying is stay inside, you can use your air conditioners, make sure that your air intake valves are all closed to keep that smoky air from getting inside. Don't do anything strenuous. People with lung conditions, pregnant women, older people got to stay inside today. Don't even bother venturing out. It's just too dangerous. And this kind of smoke and haze is extending all the way into the Carolinas at this point, Poppy.

They were nowhere near what it was in San Francisco and Seattle last year in those epic wildfires out there. And unfortunately, this is something that the East Coast may have to get used to now. Because, you know, we thought maybe that fires were a Western phenomenon, you'd like to think that that's someone else's problem. But on a connected planet, this is proof now. New science shows that 60 percent of this smoke pollution, people are breathing in the United States is coming from a different state that's far away from them.And so, you really can't escape it now. It's just the beginning of fire season. Up north you can see this morning, it's cleared out a little bit a lot better than yesterday, I woke up the air quality index was about 191 this morning. Yesterday had hit 484, this is a scale of zero to 500. Now, this is also a big reminder, this incident, Phil, of the glories of the Clean Air Act. Because in Asia, the big cities in Asia, especially India, what we've been seeing here is just an average day. In China they had an air apocalypse back in 2013 with air quality index was over 700 and people were literally trapped inside their houses. And then, China decided to clean up and now they've had a record clean air. Meanwhile, India, which still burns a lot of coal has unchecked motor regulations, they burn their fields for agricultural purposes. Their life expectancy in India is nine years shorter as a result of their air. New Science is looking at wildfire smoke as a compared to other emissions. In some cases, it can be 10 times more hazardous it's PM 2.5 particles right now. So, we're going to have to learn the way we had to learn how to deal with COVID and those sorts of things.
