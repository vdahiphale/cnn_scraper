That event part of a White House communications strategy designed to draw contrast with the new House Republican majority and to begin to lay some building blocks for a 2024 reelection campaign.The new special counsel investigation, though, is an unwelcome and unpredictable dynamic. At this important political moment, say little or say nothing is the White House strategy with hope the investigation of how classified materials ended up at the President's home and a private office he used wraps up quickly. But yesterday, the President decided to say something. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm, you know, confident in the outcome, but that's it. It shouldn't be any more than that.

And so, you know, the lawyers would say please don't say that. The White House is banking on the idea that the American people will be OK, you know, we'll see where this goes. Here's what bothers the White House. Just look at the headline on this, how Biden's Wilmington residence went from a family home to subject of investigation. Biden insists the classified documents were in a locked garage, the full scope of who may have had access to them is a central question, not only for the Special Counsel, but for House Republicans. Those investigations run in tandem. Most Special Counsels tell Congress of any party, wait, let me go first.",

You first look at, does the current situation push for new leadership? The second question is, am I that person that could be that new leader? That, yes, we need to go in a new direction.

Who's going to step out first and get into hand to hand combat with Donald Trump?

There's a whole group there. What was interesting in this Haley interview is Mike Pompeo, who's also actively moving around the country, just hasn't declared yet. He's building a team and doing his thing. In a new book he has out, he writes about hearing that perhaps Nikki Haley was trying to get Donald Trump to dump Mike Pence and to make her the vice-presidential nominee in 2020.

And that's his attempt to try to say, Nikki Haley is not loyal to Trump, but it still is also time to move on from the former president. That's what all of them are trying to do right now, which is potentially challenge him, but also win over that entire base that he's really been able to keep a lock on. I mean, we saw in the midterms Republican candidates move more towards Donald Trump, especially in swing statewide races, then they moved away from him or tried to offer some other vision for the Republican Party, and they ended up not winning, but in a primary, they're successful.",

I mean, even though it was a big primary in 2020, a lot of people have still been wondering who exactly is going to come after President Biden, especially even if he runs again.
