But as you'd imagine, the airlines now have to play catch up because there's been a huge domino effect from the FAA ground stop earlier this morning. In fact, we are still seeing airlines delaying and canceled flight. The number keeps ticking up. I've been keeping track on flightaware.com. And in just the last two hours, the deglaze, the number of delays across the country in and out of U.S. airports went from 7000 to nearly 8000, and the number of cancellations now stands at 1200. So, look, it's causing a huge headache for so many passengers missing connections, missing flights home. One guy told me he missed a funeral that was supposed to be held today because of a delay when he was trying to get to New York. I don't have to remind you it was just two to three weeks ago that we saw a snowstorm basically send -- create a massive wave of chaos at airports and with airlines. We also saw that Southwest Airlines' meltdown. What we're seeing today, not as bad, but again, major problems after the FAA had a system outage. Here are some passengers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because if it's not foul play, it's not a cyber-attack, what was the glitch that brought everything to a standstill?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: I'm willing to bet this glitch has something to do with the fact that the FAA has been slow to modernize. We're talking about a system that was built in the 1950s and has been patched together with baling wire and duct tape ever since. The FAA has modernized fitfully and in starts over the years, in many cases for lack of funding. And so, what we have is a system that is held together by virtue of the amazing performance of the air traffic control personnel, against all odds. And it's important in aviation that there is redundancy. That's what gives us safety. And it's worth pointing out in this case that this is not necessarily a safety-of-flight issue. The remedy for no NOTAMS, no notice to air missions, is you stay on the ground, which is what happened, the flights in the air landed safely and that was that. Having said that, NOTAMS are a part of the greater picture of redundancy of safety. And they too should have redundancy. So, the FAA needs to look at this and look holistically at that technology that is still emerging into the satellite world after all these years.",

I mean, this seems like it would be item number one on Congress's to-do list.O'BRIEN: You would think. But I would -- I would submit to you that the United States collectively doesn't do infrastructure very well. This is no different than crumbling bridges or potholes on the interstate or you pick your public works project that is in disrepair. We don't invest the way we should to keep our systems up to snuff. We had systems postwar, which were the envy of the world. And we're kind of riding on vapors in many cases. And in this case, the FAA is a system which could use some more attention to enter the space age as it were. It's still the 1950s age, we're still waiting for radars to spin around in places that look for airplanes when we have satellite technology that can do it instantaneously. So, it's moving in that direction, but not quickly enough. And this NOTAM problem is part of that whole big picture.
