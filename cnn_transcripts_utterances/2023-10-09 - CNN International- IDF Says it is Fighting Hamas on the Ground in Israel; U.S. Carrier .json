An Israeli military official says Israeli troops are still fighting against Hamas on the ground inside Israel. More than 700 people are dead in Israel after Hamas launched unprecedented surprise strikes on Saturday, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare outright war on Hamas.Israel's own attacks on Gaza have killed more than 400 people, with the IDF claiming to have, quote, severely degraded the capabilities of Hamas in a series of air strikes.",

CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): I am in Israel. About this time yesterday I was jogging behind me in the old city when I got a urgent call from my chief of staff telling me to get back to the hotel as quickly as I could that Israel was under attack. There are thousands of rockets being launched. When I got back to the hotel, I joined others. In the bomb shelter or the stairwells of the hotel. Frightened faces there were children and elderly families, many Americans. There was a sense a fear and worry and a knowledge to many of us, that there are horrific things going on around the country at that time. Hundreds of people have been killed. Thousands of people have been wounded in a level of attacks at a scale that is staggering and really has not been seen in this country for over 50 years. We who believe in peace and freedom and human rights for Palestinians, for Israelis, for all humankind must reject those who use terror as their weapon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, there is certainly widespread concern across the region that this could indeed spill over. What we have seen from regional leaders and allies, is a unified condemnation of the violence that we've seen. On Saturday we saw from Jordan, from Saudi Arabia, from Egypt, the UAE, all condemning the violence that we have seen echoing the responses that we've seen, of course across Europe and the U.S.Now, we've heard from the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has said that Turkey stands ready to do whatever it takes to stop this violence escalating. They are offering to play a part in mediating some sort of peaceful resolution to this conflict. And we know that according to President Erdogan, he has been in touch with allies trying to intensify diplomatic efforts on that front. And that has certainly been echoed by others in the region. We know that Egypt, a crucial player in this conflict for decades now, has been in touch with allies trying to find a way to deescalate these tensions, the foreign minister there, Sameh Shoukry, saying he is speaking with international partners who he believes have influence in this conflict. To try and bring about some sort of resolution. But of course there has also been expressions of solidarity from regional players with the Palestinian people. And of course, while this was a completely unprecedented attack on Saturday with devastating consequences, the Saudi Foreign Ministry has issued a statement saying this was somewhat inevitable. That they have been warning their Israel -- warning Israel that they -- that this could be an eventuality with possible consequences and risks involved in prolonging the occupation of certain Palestinian territories. As well as depriving the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights -- in the words of the Saudi Foreign Ministry. And of course, that is interesting given the fact that Saudi has been exploring potential normalization with Israel.",

Delta Airlines cancel flights to and from Israel through the weekend.So to talk about this, CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us. Clare, so we've had several airlines canceling flights, security concerns. \"The Times\" of Israel saying that Israelis around the world are scrambling to get back home.

For example, United and Air Canada say they will just review it as a situation unfolds. Others have a time horizon on it. In terms of the flights that are still operating, British Airways is still operating. They say they're constantly reviewing the security situation.Several others, Emirates, one of them Virgin, El Al, which is of course the major Israeli carrier, continues, they say with their scheduled flights. But they're operating only out of one terminal and they're letting passengers cancel for a voucher. It is -- it's unnerving. I mean, we've seen the scenes on the tarmac filmed by our own Nic Robertson, people taking cover. This is less than 50 miles from the Gaza Strip, this airport. But I think, look, we have potentially reservists coming home. Israel has called up reservists. The report that those people are scrambling to get home, others perhaps doing the same. And then there have been some emergency flights operated by some airlines. Korean Air is going to operate one tomorrow. United did over the weekend to get their workers and citizens of other countries out. So that's why you see some continuation of air traffic, of course, heavily disrupted.",

Nothing to do with this particular situation to do with concerns about global demand and the fact that they had risen by some 30 percent in the three months to the end of September. So it's a hugely volatile market going into this. Some of this is knee jerk, anything in this region despite the fact that Israel itself is not an oil producing country, it sparks concern usually. Usually tends to spark price rises.And of course, beyond the initial knee jerk, there are concerns that this could spill over. There are questions around how it could affect supply from Iran, which is of course a major backer of Hamas. The question over the normalization of Israel/Saudi relations, which has now been thrown into doubt by this conflict. Of course, that might lessen the likelihood that Saudi Arabia could be willing to increase production to stabilize prices. So there are a lot of layers under this. I think what's going on with oil really shows sort of the potential tentacles of this conflict.",
