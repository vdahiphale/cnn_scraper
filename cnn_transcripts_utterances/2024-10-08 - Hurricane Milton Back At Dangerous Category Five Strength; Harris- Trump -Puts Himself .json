Hurricane Hunter aircraft are in the eye and they can confirm those numbers, 440 miles Southwest of Tampa, moving at ten.You can't do the division there and get 44 hours because the storm is expected to pick up speed. Pick up speed, turn to the north and then eventually turned to the east. And that's the forecast at this point in time, right through the middle of the Treasure Coast. Anywhere here on the other side of Florida as well. So, anywhere from Tampa all the way down to Naples, you are really in this cone. The cone is the key here, because a lot of this, wherever this makes landfall, the southern part is where that 10 to 15-foot storm surge is going to take out barrier islands, take out homes, and hopefully you're not there.",

Because we can't tell you that there's going to be a wobble out here by about 30 miles to the south earlier today. And now, it's kind of wobbled backup to the north. It's those wobbles that are so concerning. Where does it actually go? Well, the center now is likely Sarasota. If you're Sarasota South, That's where that big surge is going to be. Tampa Bay maybe a little bit of less surge, but still you're going to get the wind of 125 to 130. So, to answer your question, yes, the forecast is still for the wind speed to come down, but the surge will not come down.

It had a Category Five surge and that's what we're seeing here.This is the area that were seeing. In Tampa you are not out of the surge. One little turn to the left and you're completely back in it. So 10 to 15 from fort Myers. Even Naples, you could get a 10-foot surge, that will wash over some of your barrier islands. And then, we talk about where is it going to hit? Well, the answer is everywhere because look, 110 miles per hour all the way from North of Tampa, all the way down to Fort Myers. And then hurricane force all the way completely offshore through Daytona, through Cape Canaveral. So many people, Orlando without power.

Usually a big tourist destination, but many of the beach front hotels are shut down because of Hurricane Helene hitting about two weeks ago and there was trash strewn everywhere.This is one of the giant piles that we've seen in Pinellas County. This thing is about 20 to 25 feet high, a couple of hundred feet long, and it is full of just random stuff. There's a bag of golf clubs, there's a ton of pieces of wood just like this. Imagine this thing coming toward you at 120 miles an hour. On top of that, you've got space heaters, you've got all kinds of scrap metal. The other issue with this barrier island, like so many others, on the other side of the ocean, there's a bay. So, you're talking about a 10 to 15-foot storm surge coming in here with a flip of rain more or less estimated to be on top of that. Where is this stuff going to go? So, in speaking to neighbors that live in the community that have debris lined up outside of their homes. And by the way, we've been seeing this block to block to block across Treasure Island, that's one of their chief concerns. I spoke to a couple of different residents today. One of them, a gentleman named Matt who lives in a condo. He lives on the first floor of a condo and he rode out Helene here. He said the water got up to his chest and he panicked and he got out. He was fortunate to get out. This time he wasn't taking any chances. He saw all this stuff and thought that this would essentially turn into projectiles headed his way. There was another lady who lived in the building next to his. She had some mobility issues. She was contemplating trying to ride out the storm. Fortunately, earlier this afternoon, I saw her family coming and asked them and she decided that it was the right decision to leave.

We've had ten years of Donald Trump on the scene and in those ten years, we've had somebody who has been putting himself and his politics ahead of what the country has been up to.
