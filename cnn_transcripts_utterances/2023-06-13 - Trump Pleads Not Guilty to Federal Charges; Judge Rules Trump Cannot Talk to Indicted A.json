I mean, we're through the Rubicon here. What are we doing is the question I would pose to my party. This is a rock solid indictment. I am a non-attorney. This reads clear as day, the actions that he took, the photos are there. The evidence is there.

If the complaint is that this is weaponization, because you're denying a kind of due process to the President of the United States that he's not having his day in court, he's not able to have a fair opportunity to be heard, well, that is part of what the basis for the core allegations of obstruction are. It's the notion of you have - you've precluded a federal grand jury from being able to investigate a case. If what you would like is due process and what you would like as a kind of investigation, then you cannot do what you do to obstruct that actual thing from happening.

Periodically, he had his arms folded, once in a while would speak to one of his attorneys, Todd Blanche. And Todd Blanche is one of the lawyer - is the lawyer who stood before the judge when he was asked to enter the plea. He said, \"We most certainly enter a plea of not guilty, Your Honor.\" And that was essentially near the beginning of the hearing.These hearings are typically very perfunctory. They're very short and we got to the point very, very quickly that former President entered the room probably about 30, 40 minutes before the judge. We couldn't see exactly when he entered the room because the televisions in the room we're in were not turned on immediately. But the - we saw the lawyers take their seats and the former President sort of twiddling his thumbs while he waited for the proceedings to take its place. He never looked around the room, had a very sort of glum look on his face, again, just periodically talking to his lawyers, who was - who are next to him. Todd Blanche was seated to his right, Chris Kise was seated to his left and then next to them was Walt Nauta and his attorney Stan Woodward. They were seated there. The proceedings began with the former president. As I was running out, there were about to turn to the co-defendant, of course, Walt Nauta. And on the side of the prosecution, we could see Jack Smith seated in the front row in the audience. Three other prosecutors were sitting there for the Justice Department, including Jay Bratt, who has been leading this investigation from the beginning. Julie Edelstein and David Harbach, both of them were - addressed the judge and introduced themselves. The judge was very polite to them. Sometimes in this court here in Miami, you have - some of these judges have a history of not being friendly to people who are from out of town, especially federal prosecutors coming out of Washington, D.C. This judge, this magistrate welcomed them and said thank you for coming. And he opened the proceeding by thanking the U.S. Marshals and all the law enforcement that has kept this entire scene very protected and very safe so far, Jake?",

One of the first things that happened was the judge told them that the practice inside this district is for defendants to waive the reading of all these charges.Of course, 31 charges, it would take a long time to read all the details of that and so they asked the president's - former president's legal team to say whether they would waive and they immediately said they would. And so that's - to me, it happened extremely quickly that they got to the plea. And again, Todd's Blanche is the one that entered that plea. And Jake, yes, we did expect that he would be - that both of them would be released on their own recognizance. We didn't expect that the government would ask for any stipulations on that in part because he is running for president. He is somebody who is - has a campaign. I assume he's got campaign events that are coming up very, very soon. And so the idea of restricting his travel, of course, would be a huge impediment to that and would affect that ability. I think one of the things the Justice Department is very keen to do is to not interfere with the political process. They want to try to make sure that everyone understands that the man can continue his campaign, he can continue doing what he's doing and that this matter is something being done separately. And I think that's what the message there was. Now, one of the things, Jake, we - because I left the room - we don't know whether this might come up in future arguments between the Justice Department and the president's - the former president's lawyers is the question of his communication with people who are potential witnesses. Of course, witness tampering is already part of this case, so I know that that is one of the issues that is likely to be brought up by federal prosecutors as we go forward, Jake.",

So there are going to be no travel restrictions on either men. Now, that's significant because, of course, former President Trump is traveling the country campaigning to return it to the White House. Also, they will not have to put up any cash bond. So they will be released based on a personal bond. And the judge also took a moment to thank law enforcement. There has been some criticism of the security around the court here, but this is a big undertaking. As you know, to bring the former president into the federal courthouse, as you noted, we just saw security presence behind us. So that's pretty much all I have to do in this hearing.

It's not - and as long as it's short of a plan for violence, it is first amendment protected activity. Of course, Jack Smith is not a witness, so he wouldn't fall into that caution by the judge.",

We saw some comments from Don Bacon, who was a Republican from Nebraska, he represents a swing district, Omaha. And he says, he told Manu Raju, \"I just think it's obvious what the president did was wrong and we got to be honest, I just think the emperor has no clothes and we need to have a - we need to have Republicans stand up and say that because come around after the primary and I guarantee the other party is going to be saying this.\"We should point out - I believe, Don Bacon is a veteran and so the veterans amongst the crowd of Capitol Hill officials seem to have a better grasp on how serious the national security document issue is. We heard Nikki Haley after her initial defense of Trump thinking about - and second blush. The fact that the documents could put her husband who was about to deploy with the South Carolina National Guard to Africa could put his life at risk and that is something that we hear from veterans all the time.",

But it - he still has 40 percent of the base. That's enough to be the nominee of the party. That's potentially a road to the White House and they are not abandoning him.

But now it's a question of what's the next step from a political perspective.And you're still seeing Nikki Haley, who was in one place last week in a statement to CNN, more or less attacking DOJ, and then later on criticizing Trump for his conduct, also saying today that she would pardon Trump, if he were convicted and she were President of the United States. Politically, many Republicans, even when they are willing to criticize this conduct are not willing to say it is time to sever the cord between the Republican Party and this person who is now facing two indictments. And I'm not really seeing any evidence that that's really going to happen, especially because this is - this case is going to take a while to unfold. We might be just kind of sitting in silence with not a whole lot happening in public for many, many months. And the entire - much of the Republican primary is going to be carried out in that time. There's not going to be a ruling that's going to get Republicans out of this predicament.",
