That update comes as satellite images just into CNN are showing the impact of the Israeli airstrikes in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. The left side is before the bombardment on Tuesday. The right is after. You can see the crater left by the first round of strikes. This photo was taken before a second round of strikes on Wednesday, meaning the destruction is likely much worse now.Joining us now is retired Army General Steve Anderson. General, I appreciate your time because there hasn't been a ton of concrete information about what's actually happening on the ground in terms of the operation from the IDF. But we do have geolocated videos that give people a sense of where troops have gone in. Pulling up the map right here, and you see, if you want to centralize Gaza City as clearly being kind of the point where they want their forces to converge, you can pull out in to see different places where videos have been geolocated. Here at a hotel you see an Israeli flag being raised by troops. If you move out a little bit over to the east, you see a tank moving through rubble. And then coming back down towards the south, you see what we showed you earlier in the week, a video of a tank seeming to open fire on a vehicle. When you look at kind of these three points of entry, General, what do you see here? BRIG. GENERAL STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED): Well, I think, Phil, that they are to be commended for their methodical approach. They're doing it exactly like they need to. What they need to do is surround the city and strangle hold the city. And they've got, I think, about 30,000 soldiers inside of Gaza right now. Perhaps the elements of three divisions attacking, as you show, from the north, two points of attack in the north, and then along the coastline, perhaps six kilometers or so of penetration. But, most importantly, they're moving in the middle towards the Alzara (ph) area to essentially cut Gaza in half. It's only about eight kilometers from Israel all the way to the mediterranean. So, it's not difficult to do. But when they do that, that will allow them to surround the city and control everything that's moving in and out of Gaza. They can leverage that blockade, food, fuel, water, et cetera, and continue to conduct target attacks on arms cashes, and tunnels and headquarters, locations, et cetera. And very importantly, Phil, they've got to get as many civilians out of Gaza City as they possibly can. And they need, of course, time to develop a political solution. They need to replace Hamas. Hamas has highjacked the Palestinian state. They need a develop a two-state solution before they start doing the tough fighting inside of Gaza City.",

When you talk about civilians being a necessity, getting them out, humanitarian aid, if you were trying to essentially have an almost pincher movement to encircle the city and strangle it to some degree, how is it possible to do both of those things, get civilians out, have humanitarian aid come in, if you are trying to encircle where they believe militants have gone back and into tunnels?",

And theCitizens for Fiscal Responsibility saying, this is utterly self- defeating stunt. It would actually cost more money than it would raise. It wouldn't offset that cost because if you take money away from IRS enforcement, quick, let's do the math here, you get less revenue down the line. It would cost twice as much as simply paying for it up front. And these are, you know, fiscally conservative organization.
