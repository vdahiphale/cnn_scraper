      "sentences": "The year's G-7 summit is coming to a close and you can see here Pope Francis posing for a group photo with world leaders.He made history earlier today, becoming the first pontiff to address the gathering of the world's leading democracies where he warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence. For G-7 leaders, today was also about a unified call presenting a united front to counter the growing global influence of China. Let's discuss with Josh Rogin. He is a columnist for \"The Washington Post.\" Josh, great to see you as always. One senior Biden administration official said that they expected to see unprecedented unity from the G-7 in response to what they described as Chinas harmful practices. What do you think? JOSH ROGIN, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, Boris, unprecedented unity doesn't mean full unity. It just means a little bit more unity than we had before. And the fact is that the United States and Europe are both facing essentially the same huge problem, which is that the Chinese government is using unfair trade practices and predatory investment to take over the industries of the future and to flood other countries with goods that are meant to destroy their own domestic industry. And it's a big problem in there really is no unity on how to defeat it. But at least now we have sort of a roadmap and that involves some tariffs, some economic protections. But to be honest, the U.S. and Europe are still pretty far apart on how far to go. So I think there's a common assessment of the problem, but not really a common plan for the solution. SANCHEZ: There was an interesting moment yesterday, Josh, when President Biden and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine spoke to the press. And President Zelenskyy was asked specifically about Chinas role in helping Russia in its war in Ukraine. And he sort of hedged and he essentially said that he believes that a respectable leader would keep his word, referencing President Xi, when Xi told him that he would not be supplying Russia with weapons. Immediately after that, Biden came out in said, yes, he's not sending weapons, but he's sending everything that they need to make weapons. What did you think of that moment and, more broadly, China's role with regards to Ukraine?",

Among those conditions were Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and also giving up all the territories in the east and south that Russia has clawed from them.Those, of course, are nonstarters for the West. But I'm wondering what you think about the timing of this announcement.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, the first thing to know about any Putin proposal is that Putin always lies, OK? When he's talking, he's lying. And so this offer cannot be taken at face value.But even if you were to take it on face value, as you just said, it's a crap deal. Surrender everything and then we'll negotiate. Take all your -- give up a bunch of your territory and then we'll talk. It's obviously a non-starter. It seems pretty evident that what Putin is doing is trying to divide the West during the G-7 by giving those Europeans who want an excuse to argue for a ceasefire on Russia's terms. It won't work. But for certain elements of the right in Europe and in the United States, frankly, it'll be enough for them to say, oh, look, Putin's the peacemaker and Zelenskyy is the problem, even though the opposite is the case.",

When I travel around the world, everyone is worried that if Trump gets reelected that he'll pull all the Ukrainian aid.You can't solve that problem altogether. Because the U.S. funding is essential. But at least, if you move some of this stuff to NATO, and assuming Trump doesn't scuttle NATO, which is not a 100-percent assumption that you can rely, that might institutionalize it more. That's why Biden and Zelenskyy signed that 10-year agreement, even though who knows what happens in two years, much less 10 years. They're trying to make this into something that's immune from the divisions and distractions and tumult in U.S. politics. And that's basically impossible, but doing it a little bit is better than doing it not at all.",

It was, in fact, one of the deadliest school shootings in American history when a gunman killed 20 children and six adults. Let's bring in CNN's Hadas Gold.

And Jones himself seems to be acknowledging that this could mean the beginning of the end of his company. And he has been pushing this now for several days, several weeks on InfoWars, partly as a ruse to get more people to listen and to get more people to buy the supplements, of course, that he hawks. Take a listen to what he said just today outside of court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX JONES, OWNER &amp; HOST, INFOWARS: Is this the end?
