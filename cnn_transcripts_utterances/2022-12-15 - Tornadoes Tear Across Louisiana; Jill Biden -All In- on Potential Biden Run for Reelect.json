This comes as a new CNN poll shows that 59 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they'd actually like to see someone other than Biden at the top of the ticket. But a majority of those voters say they'd vote for him in the general election if he won their party's primary. CNN's Kate Bennett has this reporting. She joins us now.

She's the most influential person, of course, in the president's life after 45 years of marriage. But she's also the person who can best assess him: what he wants, how he's doing, his schedule, what his legacy will be. And at this point, she's really gone to more of a firm all-in camp than she was previously, even in the summer, where she sort of remained on the fence and had a lot of thinking to do about it. It's coming off of a busy social season for the first lady. It's the kind of hosting stuff that is not necessarily her top-of-mind thing but she likes to do as first lady. It's been busy.

If she doesn't want him to run again, she makes it known. That famous story about her about 2004, as Joe Biden and his aides, including Ron Klain at the time, were meeting inside their home in Wilmington, and Jill didn't want him to run. She was wearing a bikini out by the pool, and she wrote the word \"no\" in all caps on her stomach, and she walked through the house. Just making it clear that her voice needs to be heard.

      "sentences": "So Elon Musk is pro-free speech, except when it is speech that he doesn't like.Twitter apparently suspending an account that tracked the location of his private jet, despite Musk himself saying last month that he would leave the account up as part of his commitment to free speech. Jack Sweeney runs that Elon jet account, and we're going to talk to him in just a minute here. Jack is a college student who used to use publicly-available information to build a bot that posted every time Musk's Gulfstream took off and landed at an airport. Well, his account had long been a thorn in Musk's side, with more than a half million followers. And only this week, Twitter just happened to reveal new restrictions around sharing details about someone's location. Musk is defending the policy, saying that it is a physical safety violation. The ban comes after Musk re-established previous Twitter rule breakers, including neo-Nazis. Twitter's also stopped enforcing policies banning COVID misinformation. Now remember this, that Musk had been on the free speech train since purchasing the site. Just look. He is framing this, his fight for free speech, as a \"battle for the future of civilization,\" his words. But Musk has a history of not welcoming certain speech across his businesses. Former SpaceX employees told \"The New York Times\" that the company fired workers after they publicly criticized Musk's behavior on social media. A Tesla employee claims that he was fired after posting YouTube reviews of Tesla's autopilot functions. And in a book by \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Tim Higgins, he details reports that Musk created an environment at Tesla where workers who disagreed with him were ousted. When Tesla has laid off employees, it's asked them to sign agreements with non-disparagement clauses. Musk had banned a fan blog from company events after they published a story claiming that Tesla was charging owners for hardware they'd already paid for. He has blocked journalists like our very own CNN colleague, Alex Marquardt. And on an earnings call in 2018, after Tesla reported a record loss, Musk didn't want to hear any questions from analysts.
