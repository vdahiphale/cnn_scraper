That's why today, before God and my family, I'm announcing I'm running for President of the United States. We can bring this country back. We can defend our nation and secure our border.

We knew he was going to get in. This sounds like traditional Republican politics there. JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes, even with the traditional hat tip to President Reagan. And it really remains to be seen if this is what Republican voters are looking for, particularly from someone who worked directly for former President Trump. And that is going to be one of Mike Pence's most difficult things to overcome is to separate himself from the former president. He's been doing -- trying to do so for the last couple of months as we've watched him gear up for this run. And obviously, he's not alone. There are several former Trump administration officials running. But for Mike Pence to differentiate himself I think that is going to be what we watch for as we go forward.",

He didn't finish -- he bet very heavily on New Hampshire in 2016 and that did not work out for him. Whether or not he just plays spoiler to Trump he said during that town hall that he's not just there to be a political assassin. Whether he can actually appeal to GOP voters outside of the northeast -- that remains to be seen. He's also someone who was involved in the Trump administration very early on.
