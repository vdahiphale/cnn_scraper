Only 20 percent of Americans are on Twitter. A fraction of that is Republican primary voters. They're talking about speech, arguing about platform itself. They weren't talking about kitchen table issues. And I'd also remind DeSantis and his team, the average Republican primary voter is on the older side. They're largely 50 plus, and that is not a audience in Twitter spaces talking about tech policy and Elon Musk's latest grievances. So overall, I think they need to recalibrate.

In a short one paragraph letter posted to social media, they espouse some of the concerns that the former president has repeatedly expressed in terms of all investigations that he has faced, saying that no president has ever faced anything like this and inferring that the process has been unfair. But there is no specific allegations against special counsel Jack Smith in terms of what he has done that has been improper.Now it's unclear if the Attorney General or the Justice Department will grant the meeting request. It is not unusual for defense attorneys to meet with prosecutors if defense attorneys have been informed their client could potentially be charged with a crime. But sources tell CNN that the former president's attorneys have not received any such notification that the investigation has wrapped up or that any indictments are imminent. This is just their general request for a meeting. At this point, it's completely unclear if it will be granted. Though recently the Justice Department did grant a similar request from attorneys for President Biden's son, Hunter Biden. They were allowed to go in, meet with prosecutors and present their case for why they don't believe their client should be charged. Now in that case they've met with Trump appointed U.S. attorney overseeing that probe, as well as career officials. Here the Trump lawyers, they want to meet with the Attorney General which would truly be extraordinary. But since their investigation is being handled by a special counsel who is really only overseen by the Attorney General, it's unclear who, if anyone, they'll have a chance to meet with. At this point the Justice Department has no comment and it's unclear if they have actually received this letter from the Trump team. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
