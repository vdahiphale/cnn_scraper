She's also the author of \"Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America.\" This says everything. MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES, AUTHOR, \"CONFIDENCE MAN: THE MAKING OF DONALD TRUMP AND THE BREAKING OF AMERICA\":  There is nobody who knows better than Rupert Murdoch that the way to upset Donald Trump is not to say his name. And so, it isn't just that he is not the full front page and that he's the banner on the bottom, it's that he's identified as \"Florida Man.\" And they're not trumpeting him. There is a move away from Trump. I don't want to overstate this. He is still the frontrunner. He is still the establishment. He is still a former president. But there are a number of people in the Republican Party who are going to start making clear that they think he is really bad for the party in ways that I think they couldn't quite articulate the same way in, say, 2016 because he didn't have a record, January 6 hadn't happened, and we haven't seen all the election denialism of the last 20 months. And so, I think all of that becomes a compelling factor.",

This is not somebody who seemed like he's raring to go again. This is not somebody -- now, some of that might have been, Kaitlan, because they knew that networks would not take him live if he was yelling, if he was talking about the 2020 election over and over again.

His whole plan was to kind of bring crypto to the masses to try to explain it to people and to kind of represent himself as the non- scammy end of the industry. And to really kind of bring this kind of experimental technology into the mainstream. He testified in Congress. He was a growing force in Democratic circles -- a huge donor to Joe Biden and to other politicians over the years. And also someone who was kind of trying to style himself as a major philanthropist. And so, his fall ripples kind of far outside the crypto world. LEMON:  Just one more thing I want to ask you. I was speaking with people who are in the finance industry, right, and know about these things, and they still don't understand what's crypto themselves. And they work in the industry. And so --",
