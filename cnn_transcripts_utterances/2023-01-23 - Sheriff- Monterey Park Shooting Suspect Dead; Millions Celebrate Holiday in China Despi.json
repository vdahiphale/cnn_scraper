There is a sense of euphoria, of the chance to see parents, to see loved ones for this biggest holiday of the year, for the first time, potentially, in years. So the numbers are substantial, where you mentioned 26 million people on the move on Saturday, the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday, most of them on the roads, but also millions of people traveling by train. More than 4 million. And then, hundreds of thousands, 756,000 traveling by air. And there are estimates that throughout the 40-year ]SIC] -- 40-day, rather, spring festival, the ministry of transport in China is predicting that there could be some two billion passengers who will have been on the move.
