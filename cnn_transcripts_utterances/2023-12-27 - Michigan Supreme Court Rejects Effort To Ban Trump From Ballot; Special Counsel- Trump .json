They upheld the decision to reject this on procedural grounds, basically finding that there was no role here for the courts. This was an unsigned opinion and really just a few sentences long. One of the justices did publish her thought that -- I will read the quote. It is a very important key distinction from Justice Elizabeth Welch: \"I would affirm the court of appeals' ruling on the issue, which still allows the appellants to renew their legal efforts as to the Michigan general election later in 2024 should Trump become the Republican nominee for president.\" Making it clear that this applies to the primary, but not the general.
