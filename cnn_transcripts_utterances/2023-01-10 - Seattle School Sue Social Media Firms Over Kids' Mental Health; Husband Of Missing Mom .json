      "sentences": "The Seattle public school system is suing several social media companies alleging their platforms are responsible for a youth mental health crisis. It says it's affecting its ability to fulfill its educational mission.CNN's Donie O'Sullivan joins us now. So, Donie, metro family, as we know, have tried to sue social media companies but this is unusual. An entire school system suing. So, what they say that was causing a big problem. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and what we've seen from, of course, a lot of those previous lawsuits is that this is such a relatively new phenomena, right. You know, we've heard from experts and psychologist who said we don't really know what this is all going to do, being on social media all day is going to do to kids' brains because it's going to take some time to fully understand that. But what we have heard from this school district and I want to read out part of the lawsuit, it said. Defendants in this case at the social media companies have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth. Their misconduct has been a substantial factor in causing a huge mental health crisis and it goes on to talk about higher rates of anxiety, depression and self-harm. And look, this might not necessarily be a successful lawsuit. But what it will do is put this, you know, crises really into the national conversation and, you know, if it does go all the way, that the school board we might learn a lot about the discovery process in court about really what is it these companies know. How much work or consideration have they put into designing these platforms to not impact mental health of young people.",

Twitter here, at reinstating the accounts of some well-known election deniers. Who's back on?O'SULLIVAN: Yes, so almost two years to the day since the January 6th attack on the Capitol, we saw a whole ton of accounts getting shut down. Major election deniers, some of which we won't even name here. But, you know, this over the past 24, 48 hours we've seen two very prominent people who played roles in fanning the flames of conspiracy theories in the lead-up to January 6th, all that stuff, the steal nonsense, two-year anniversary, Elon Musk has put them back on the platform with no real explanation. But also, we have heard from at least one of these people, praising what's been happening in Brazil, over the weekend, so an interesting time to re-platform these people. Of course, Elon Musk says he is a free speech absolutist despite banning some journalists from the platform.",

And if you look at the recent results of the CDC's 2021 report, they look at this and you can actually see at every moment where you have sad and hopelessness on I national basis with these kids you will see that when Instagram was released and then when Snapchat was released and then when TikTok was released, you see a spike at every moment.Again, we can't directly as your reporter said say that's a causative factor. But we can look at and say that what we do know is not only do we have two decades of research that show the more time that our kids are on social media, the more anxious they become, the more depressed they become, the more suicidal, the more disordered eating and we can actually take that science and say we can connect it under that purview and hold them accountable for developing these products in that way.",

They say, in 2021 parents of teens in Washington state where the plaintiff is located, estimated 47 percent spend between one and three hours on social media platforms. 20 percent spend between three and five hours and 10 percent spend more than five hours a day on social media platforms. So again, as you say, it's -- it feels connected. It feels like there's an association, I don't know if in a court of law, they'll be able to show that that's a direct qualitative. But what do you think it is about social media that degrades teenagers' mental health so much.",

So, they live in that space all of the time.But when you take a psychological concept like the Ericksonian Development Phases that kids go through and you're looking at the fact that they're actually needing feedback that gives them some sort of response into the world. It is no longer just our families or our local communities, they're going against 4.8 billion people online and so much of that information that they're getting back is quite negative. And so, I think that if you look at the amount of time they're staying online and you look at the number of students that are failing in classes and decreased test scores, I do think that, you know, the Seattle public schools, I give them -- I take my hat off to them. Because I think that somebody needs to hold them accountable and somebody needs to be able to say we need help. Because all of the Congressional testimony, all of the times we've brought all of these big tech giants and CEOs into the halls of Congress, we still have not been able to get them to regulate this or help us in this fight against what is happening online with our kids.",
