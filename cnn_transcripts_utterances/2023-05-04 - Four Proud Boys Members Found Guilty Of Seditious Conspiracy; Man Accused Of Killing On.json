Four members of the far-right group known as the Proud Boys were found guilty of seditious conspiracy. Enrique Tarrio, Zachary Rehl, Joseph Biggs, and Ethan Nordean were on trial for their role in trying to prevent a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election. The guilty verdict sparked the third time that prosecutors have secured convictions for seditious conspiracy following the insurrection.CNN's Katelyn Polantz, she's live outside the courthouse. And, Katelyn, from the beginning, legal experts and lawyers have said this is not an easy charge to get a conviction on. And yet here they have again. Explained exactly what the jury decided here. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER (on camera): It's not an easy charge and it's not one that the Justice Department uses often or uses lightly. But they have levied this charge against members of these right-wing groups taking part on January 6. And now juries are agreeing that the Justice Department has enough evidence to prove the case that these men, leaders of the Proud Boys came to an agreement and wanted to somehow block, hurt, hinder, or even overthrow the U.S. government using force. So, those are the two key things that were proved today that the jury agreed with and that resulted in finding these four men, these four leaders of the Proud Boys, including Enrique Tarrio, who was not in Washington, DC on January 6, guilty of seditious conspiracy. Jim, it's both that force -- the use of force is a key part of that charge that they are found guilty on. And the fact that there is some sort of agreement, some sort of planning, and some sort of communication to take steps forward not just on the ground on January 6 but before, during, and then as the prosecutors pointed out that there was a celebration after. In one text message that was used in this case as evidence, Enrique Terrio sent a message to other Proud Boys on January 6, writing, make no mistake, we did this. And the jury has agreed with the prosecutors and the Justice Department so far.",

It was publicly online after the election in November of 2020. He wrote, if Biden steals this election, the Proud Boys will be political prisoners. We won't go quietly, I promise. So, that's how they were building the case around Tarrio. They were able to show that there were Proud Boys on the ground on January 6, leading the rioters into the Capitol, finding a way in, breaking a window. And Tarrio was part of that group that was interested in that -- in this leading up to the day, Jim.",
