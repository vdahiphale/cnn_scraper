It is Friday, September the 13th, 9 a.m. here in London, 1 a.m. in Tucson, Arizona, where Donald Trump said earlier at a rally he will not take part in a second debate against Kamala Harris.Both candidates are back in battleground states in the hours ahead. Harris heads to Wilkes-Barre, that's Pennsylvania, whilst Trump is expected to go to Las Vegas in Nevada. All of this comes amid polling that shows two important snapshots of how voters feel. Who they think won the recent debate and where the candidates stand head-to-head nationwide. Two polls, one by CNN, the other by Reuters/Ipsos, shows a majority of registered voters who watched the debate think Harris had the better night. Reuters says its numbers do not add up to 100 percent, as nearly a quarter replied neither had won nor or didn't answer, actually. Now, polling also shows that Harris is widening her lead slightly over Trump nationwide, 47 percent to 42 percent. CNN's Harry Enten gives a little context to those numbers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But the bottom line is not that much movement, which I guess is not so surprising in a 50-50 country. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

His name ID, people, their belief in him, where he stands. People have a really firm understanding of that. And with that comes his age.

And so I really think that people are now seeing a different Donald Trump. Donald Trump is in decline and age only goes one way. You don't get sharper with age, unfortunately.
