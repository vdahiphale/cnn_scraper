They're not working.New details on search warrants for Luigi Mangione's backpack and burner phone. What we learned overnight about the case against the suspected CEO killer. And new lawsuits filed against Sean Combs. Three John Doe's males accusing Combs of drugging and sexually assaulting them. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner and Kate Bolduan. It's Friday. We made it, barely. This is CNN News Central. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Right now, there are no real explanations as to what they are or where they are from or who is launching them or what the whole point is. But regardless, the wave of drone sightings over New Jersey has local lawmakers and people who live in New Jersey growing even more concerned and frustrated. This has been going on for weeks now. The White House weighed in yesterday, downplaying concerns, saying there's no national security or public safety threat. But still, this morning, frustrated lawmakers have gone from really asking questions to now demanding answers. And here is what New Jersey Congressman Josh Gottheimer told us last hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): Here's what I know. They've been able to brief me that they're confident of what they're not. So now I think it's really important to tell the public what they are, right? And I think, listen, the public has a right to know because people are concerned. They have a responsibility to allay people's concerns, to tell the public what they know and don't know, and to make sure that people are safe and protected and that we're doing everything to protect our national security and our public security and safety.

And they are certainly calling on the federal government to brief them, to investigate and try to find out if these are in any way potentially connected to what have been cited just south of Rockland County. But I think your interview, Kate, is crucial here.It is quite telling when you hear from the New Jersey representative basically telling you what he has seen, what federal authorities have presented him with, and after being briefed, that leaving him with no doubts that this presents any sort of public security threat. It's also interesting what he's not saying, right? Is he stopped short of saying whether or not he was briefed on the fact that this may be potential approved activity? He didn't really answer that question. But of course, in the next breath, calls on the federal government to brief the public, basically to tell people what they believe, what they have concluded that these drones are. Now, we've also heard from New Jersey local officials who admit that it's quite possible that many of these sightings are just simply airplanes, but they're still concerned that a large number of them are not. And I think that that really is what we continue to hear from these New Jersey communities and the local representatives as well. And now, according to information I obtained just in the last hour, in neighboring New York State as well.",

And we were talking about it in real time with DHS and about the equipment that they sent us to identify all that.So I don't know why the federal government on one side is also trying to diminish a lot of this.

In all three, the accusers allege that Combs drugged and raped them and that these sexual assaults took place between 2019 and 2022.One of the men is a former employee of Combs who says that Combs attacked him in a hotel. Combs' defense team released a statement in the face of this saying that these lawsuits were full of lies. These latest accusations, though, bring the total number of sexual assault claims against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs to more than 30. Joining me right now is CNN Legal Analyst and Criminal Defense Attorney Joey Jackson. So these new allegations are similar to the dozens of others that we have already seen that have been filed.

That's one way of looking at it. Item number two, in looking at it, is saying that, hey, maybe these are copycats who are really creating fiction. And that is the narrative of Diddy, right? His people are saying these are pure lies. And so when you get other lawsuits, which evidence a pattern of spiking drinks, of approaching, of drugging, of raping, and you've seen that. Well, you have something to base it against. Now, an attorney has an obligation to vet, evaluate, review these before doing it. You have a due diligence obligation. So it's going to be a question of fact in the event, Kate, that they are factually accurate, right? They'll be investigated. And then the issue will be how, if at all, could they be used in the criminal prosecution? Ways away from that, and again, different attorney here. There's a New York based attorney, not Buzbee.
