So, we have seen bus after bus with about a dozen people in each bus come off, and expressions of just people simply shell-shocked, exhaustion, expressions of people who are utterly disconsolate about, can you imagine, just narrowly escaping this inferno, and then sheer exhaustion of trying to get out of Maui's main airport. Perhaps you have lost everything or have nowhere to go. And then you make your way to a cot in a cool room in an area that's run by the Red Cross. So, what we're able to tell you is that a couple of yards away from us, there are now about two dozen people who are sleeping in the Convention Center overnight. The Convention Center is prepared to handle about 2,000 people. But, John, when we're here and we're just speaking with first responders and people who are part of the Red Cross community, they say that this gigantic Convention Center is prepared to handle hurricanes, tropical storms, perhaps tsunami events. That is all within the realm of possibility. But wildfires with three intense infernos burning at the same time 80 miles away from here, and this being a safe haven from that, that is not in the playbook, first responders tell us, of what they are trained to manage and deal with.

And so they were immediately able to embed with the state emergency operations center, hear the updates, hear the tragic impacts that these communities are having, and start moving resources. And so we started moving resources early yesterday to support the communications outages, sending our personnel that are going to be able to go out and help the individuals that have been impacted. We have also opened up our logistics center that's there on Oahu and provided meals, 5,000 meals for up to five days -- for 5,000 people for up to five days right now. And we can send more as needed.

I think what we now see and the challenges that we're going to face is that it's limited in our ability to where we can put people, because it is isolated as an island.

Walt Nauta, his aide, was here in person, entered a not guilty plea to these additional charges. But then it takes us to Carlos De Oliveira, who we expected would enter a plea officially today. He was in Miami court last week. His arraignment was pushed it today, so he could get a Florida lawyer, which is required for him to enter a plea. There was a Florida lawyer here on his behalf named Donnie (ph) Morrell, but that lawyer said that he's waiting for confirmation before entering his appearance as counsel. So, De Oliveira's D.C. attorney, John Irving, who was with him in Miami, said that they believe they have ironed out the details, but they need another day or so. This all relates to these charges in the superseding indictment, John. Those would include false statements, conspiracy to obstruct justice and concealing documents. And, of course, John now, with De Oliveira's arraignment pushed to next week on Tuesday, August 15, it is just another delay. We know that Nauta's arraignment had been delayed. First, he needed a Florida-based lawyer to enter a plea. Then he had allegedly missed his weight. So he missed that arraignment. And now we have Carlos De Oliveira's arraignment being pushed yet another week. This trial is set for May of next year. And there's a big hearing on the case before Judge Aileen Cannon on August 25.

You have got several lawyers who came down and gave some testimony that might not have been accurate in from the Georgia legislature. So, once you (AUDIO GAP) adding some other people close to Trump's inner circle, then it's not a surprise to see that many folks.
