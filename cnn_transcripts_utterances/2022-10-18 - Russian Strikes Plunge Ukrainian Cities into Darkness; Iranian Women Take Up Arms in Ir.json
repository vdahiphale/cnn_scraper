The government is conserving citizens to conserve electricity and water and to brace for outages after Russia hit power stations overnight across the country, including in Kyiv. More than 1,000 towns are said to be without electricity and president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russia has now destroyed 30 percent of Ukraine's power stations in just a week's time. At least three cities, including the capital, are experiencing blackouts after Tuesday's attacks. And the mayor says three people were killed and all of them worked in an infrastructure facility. Let's get right to CNN's Nic Robertson and he is live in Kyiv for us. You and I were talking in the last hour and it's incredible to see the extent of damage in just a week's time. Also the swift response from the government to try to get these operations and facilities back up and running.",

The government told people living in the east of the country several months ago that they would not be able to keep them heated through the winter. They are close to the front line. But in the cities, in Kyiv and Lviv and Dnipro, in Zaporizhzhya and Kharkiv all of these big cities, where there are still a lot of people living, the government is committed to making sure that they are affected as little as possible by the war. And that means having electricity, having water to wash in and, within a few weeks, as the temperatures drop, having heating. And President Putin in Russia knows this. This is very clearly why he is trying to target the energy systems here, to try to break the morale of the Ukrainian people, which is not happening; to try to stretch the government services here and stretch their finances by making them continually repair and get the electrical systems up and running. So it is potentially a weak point but it is not going to affect the battlefront and it's not going to change the morale of the Ukrainians. If anything, the opposite, because it's making them more determined to fight and beat Russia. The fight is being brought into their homes now. And so it's very real for people here in a way that it perhaps was not a few weeks ago, if they did not have relatives immediately at the front line, let's say.",

They are demanding sanctioning against Iran for supplying this weaponry to Russia because it is creating a host of different problems for them. It's bad for the psyche of the Ukrainian people, the sort of very distinctive whirring and whining noise that these drones, make. They've nicknamed mopeds here in Ukraine. But you can imagine the terrifying impact that has for people on the ground to see these kamikaze drones flying toward them, to know that it is almost impossible for air defense systems to spot them in the sky. So you are really talking about people on the ground, using line of sight, using a MANPAD if they have access to, that or whatever kind of rifle that they might have with them and trying to shoot them out of the sky. That is one component but the other thing that the Ukrainians are asking for again and again is more sophisticated air defense systems and more of them. This is a vast country, John. And so it is one thing to get when air defense system in place that might protect effectively one city or one part of the country but in order to set up a wider spread  infrastructure that would really afford Ukrainians the proper protection from this threat, it makes it very challenging for them. The more that they believe that they make these successful counteroffensives on the ground and take back territory from the control of Russian forces, the more they fear that Russia is going to respond with these blistering attacks on civilian targets, creating very many challenges for them in terms of the infrastructure and supplying people with what they need to survive.

We are ready to die. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  When Kurdish Iranian Mahsa Amini died in police custody, her name became a symbol of the oppression of women across Iran. But Mahsa is not her true name. Her Kurdish name is Zhina, a name Iranian authorities barred her family, like many other ethnic minority groups, from using. The regime only legally registers Persian names. Yet, in her last recorded moments, Zhina resorted to begging her captors in her Kurdish mother tongue, entreaties which were ignored, reinforcing the fears of Iran's Kurdish minority. Hundreds of Iranian Kurdish families have crossed the border to Iraq seeking refuge from the most recent regime crackdown. But even here, they're not safe. This family fears the long arm of the Iranian regime after what they saw inside Iran. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I left after I saw one of my friends killed. During the demonstration, in sir clears (ph), near of the mosque, right in front of the mosque. They say they are Islamic. But how can they claim to be an Islamic republic when I saw them murdering my friend outside a mosque? ELBAGIR (voice-over):  He and his family have every reason to be afraid. Iran's reach to oppress the protests within its borders are stretching far beyond. Over the last few, weeks Iranian missiles have fallen into the Kurdish region of Iraq almost every day. The onslaught is relentless. This map shows where Iranian strikes have hit, killing at least 18 and injuring at least 63 to date. This video filmed by a local television channel shows the moment just after an Iranian drone and several missiles struck one of the Kurdish Iranian opposition party bases, killing eight soldiers and injuring more. On a day on which 70 missiles, Kurdish authorities say, rained down in the space of just four hours. This base, only two years ago, was on the front line in the fight against ISIS after PAK received U.S. training. It isn't far from U.S. Central Command -- CENTCOM -- forces. Just one day after the attack on the PAK base, CENTCOM shot down another Iranian drone. It appeared, they say, as a threat to CENTCOM forces stationed in the area. And as the U.S. anti-ISIS presence in Iraq is set to continue, so is the threat Iran poses. These female fighters have vowed to fight until there is a regime change in Iran. They say they share Zhina's pain. Called by a name forced on her by a repressive regime, all of them have a Kurdish name just like her not spoken outside their homes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The young family that we spoke to had a 2-year old. Imagine carrying a 2-year old in the dark with you, desperate to know that you were finally safe. But there is some form of refuge here, despite Iran's ability to enforce its terror, even here in northern Iraq. But it is a refuge that comes with guilt. Many of them speak about the stories that they hear from their families back home. And they speak of recognizing many of the dead in these videos that are coming out from inside of Iran. They are desperate to know why the international community is not helping. Why, they say, that the focus is not on them, given that Iran is not just internationalizing its internal troubles but it's also internationalizing its pain. It's seeking to hurt even those who have managed to flee from inside its borders, both its own citizenry and in the region and U.S. troops. And unfortunately, there's not really much that we can say for them in return when they ask us about no-fly zones or whether the U.S. can enforce some kind of a human rights sterilized zone.

But when your name is on a, list when you are of a certain age when you fear that you are already under the scrutiny of authorities it is more than your life is worth to take that risk  and come across the official border because that is where the buildup of the troops is. And \"Rezan,\" the 19-year old, the young lady in the piece, she relayed to us just a heartbreaking conversation with her mother, when her mother told her that authorities had threatened to take hostage \"Rezan's\" siblings if \"Rezan\" was not forcibly brought back by her family.

Only 6 percent of teachers are on strike today. We've walked the length of that line Julia. It stretches remarkably far. But nothing we've really seen since the Yellow Vests petered out in 2019.

This, as you can imagine, is just rife with national security issues. In terms of the lucrative money that they've been offered to go, we are hearing reports in the ballpark of around a quarter of 1 million pounds to try to incentivize former and current British serving fighter pilots and members of the military to go over to China and help their armed forces. We also understand that it's not just Britain that's being approached; there's also other Western countries. Now we understand that third parties are often the intermediaries here and there is one which has been linked to South Africa, not the government but a business that is based in South Africa, to try and bring the fighter pilots and the former military serviceman over to China to facilitate this.

They're going to make it legal that you have to declare if you are serving any foreign government and in what capacity you are doing that to check whether or not the ministry of defense would actually be comfortable with what that individual is doing. The wider context of this is China's drive to modernize its military. A U.S. Defense assessment said last year that China wanted to fully modernize its People's Liberation Army by 2035 and to have a world-class military by 2049. So they want to develop a better understanding of NATO level fighter jets, like the Typhoon and Tornado, as well as helicopters like Merlin and Wildcat.
