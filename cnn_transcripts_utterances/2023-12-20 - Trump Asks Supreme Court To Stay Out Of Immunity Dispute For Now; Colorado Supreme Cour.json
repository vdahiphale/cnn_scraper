Those are the markets, and these are the main events for you. The US Supreme Court will play a deciding role in the 2024 US presidential election. The key cases have one thing in common. Former President Donald Trump is at the very center. Negotiations have restarted concerning the release of more hostages in Gaza. And US senators want to stop a Japanese company from taking over US Steel. Live from London. It is Wednesday, December 20th. I'm Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest. And I, too, mean business. Good evening, everyone. Tonight, the US Supreme Court at the center of two key decisions that could shape the 2024 election. In the last hour or so, we learned that Donald Trump wants the court to decline a review of his claims of presidential immunity. That claim is part of his defense in the Justice Department's 2020 election subversion case, if you remember. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign says it will challenge a ruling in Colorado that would take his name off the state's primary ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court, if you remember, ruled that Donald Trump is ineligible to run for office because he engaged in an insurrection. It was a 4:3 decision. The Trump team says it expects the US Supreme Court to strike down the ruling and put an end to a series of lawsuits it calls \"un-American.\" The Colorado decision is on hold until January to allow for an appeal. What Trump's Republican rivals are speaking out against the Colorado Supreme Court decision. Have a listen to what some of them are saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Donald Trump made the novel argument --we actually don't know the answer -- that he cannot be prosecuted because his conduct that he's indicted for was within the scope of his job as president. Now, the district court, which is the trial level court, rejected that. They said, no, you're not immune, we don't have kings in this country. And the prosecutor then said, okay, now, we want to speed this up. We want to skip over the middle level Court of Appeals and Supreme Court, which is our top layer, we want you to take the case directly. That's something that's done not never, but fairly rarely if there's a real need for time sensitivity. Just now, Donald Trump put in a brief saying, no, I don't want you, Supreme Court, to take the case immediately. We should go through that middle Court of Appeals, which is what would normally happen, because Trump argues there needs to be full briefing in consideration. There's no need here to rush. And so now it's up to the Supreme Court. It's really discretionary called by the Supreme Court. Do they see this as important enough and time- sensitive enough that they need to skip that middleman and take the case directly? And really important to keep in mind, the current trial date in this case is March 4th of 2024. If the Supreme Court takes the case directly, it may disrupt that trial date. It may push back a bit. But if they do not, if they say you have to go through the middle Court of Appeals first, then we might take it, that is certainly going to disrupt the March 4th trial date perhaps by several months.",

So the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says that anybodywho has engaged in or given aid or comfort to insurrection cannot hold future office. You're disqualified. The problem, though, Isa, is we've never figured out how the 14th Amendment works. Who gets to decide? Like you said, does there have to be a criminal conviction? Is this some sort of separate proceeding? Is it the kind of thing that Congress can decide? Does the court get a say? Does the judge? Is it a jury jerry? What standard of proof, et cetera. We just don't know. Now, there has been a series of several dozen attacks on Donald Trump launched by plaintiffs, by litigants, in various states around the country arguing he engaged in insurrection, therefore, he should be kicked off the ballot. All of those so far that have been ruled on, about 18 or so, have either failed or been withdrawn until yesterday, when the Colorado Supreme Court said, well, we had this little hearing below, and that's good enough, so we believe he engaged in insurrection. We believe he should be kicked off the ballot. This one seems almost certainly headed for the Supreme Court. And as you can probably tell from my tone, I think the US Supreme Court is probably going to reverse that, undo what the Colorado Supreme Court has done, and let Donald Trump be on the ballot in Colorado.",

And all of this is the first time that we have seen really substantive proposals being put on the table in weeks now since that weeklong truce between Israel and Hamas fell apart about nearly three weeks ago. Hamas, for its part, as indicated that it is not willing to negotiate until the fighting actually stops. That's, of course, an untenable position for the Israeli government. But today, Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political leader, traveling to Cairo to engage in some of these talks with the Egyptians who have been key mediators in this effort. So there is a flurry of activity, clearly, over the last several days, trying to get these parties back to the negotiating table. The question now is whether or not they can come up with a deal that would provide much needed relief for Gazans both in terms of aid that would also get in, but also, of course, a pause in the bombing that they have been sustaining for weeks now.",

Our Jomana Karadsheh has the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For weeks, this is what we've seen of the war on Gaza -- Israel's brutal military might pounding neighborhoods into dust. In central Gaza, in Sderot, whole blocks reduced to rubble, seemingly deserted, unlivable. But there's also this, the near surreal scenes this week in Sderot, the hustle and bustle of a street market. It's the story of every war, where life doesn't stop. It goes on for those trying to survive. But Gaza is like no other place. It's where more than two million are crammed into this tiny strip of land that now looks like it's been bombed back into ages past, where those who've lost everything have nowhere left but the streets. That's where Mutnis (ph) is building a clay oven, hoping people will pay him a shekel or two to use it. He says, maybe then he'll have enough to buy his children cheese or tomatoes. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) KARADSHEH (voice over): \"Our lives are a million years behind. We live in sewage,\" Mutnis (ph) says. \"Every time it rains, the sewage overflows. It's cold. There's no food, no water, no warm clothes.\" Most here have escaped the bombs only to be trapped in this misery. Disease and starvation, the UN's warned, may soon kill more than those bombs. Half the population, it says, are now starving. People going entire days without eating. Uhm Ahmed (ph) says she collects a bit of flour from here and there to make bread for her children. (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.) KARADSHEH (voice over): \"We're all thrown into the streets,\" she says. \"They said go to the south. We came to the south to die slowly.\" Human Rights Watch says Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. It's a war crime Israel denies and calls it a lie. It accuses Hamas of stealing aid. In the wake of October 7th, Israel's defense minister announced the siege of Gaza, quote, \"No electricity, no fuel, everything closed until all hostages were returned.\" Some aid and water delivery resumed, but nowhere near enough. Much of the blockade remains in place -- what rights groups call collective punishment. Sometimes, the lucky ones find more than lentils and bread for the hungry mouths they have to feed. This mother uses a pair of jeans for her fire to boil some chicken wings and bones. (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.) KARADSHEH (voice over): \"I'm using clothes and cardboard to make fire and cook,\" she says. \"The situation is disastrous, but I need to find a way for my children. We're on the street because we have nowhere to shelter.\" Fleeing the bombs, scrounging for food, now the people of Gaza desperately wait for the moment they can try once again to live.

That's taking into account everything, from the oil used on the chainsaws and the pesticides, all the way through the transport, how the trees are disposed. That being said, at the end of the day, I think consumers should choose whichever tree is better for them, whether it's an artificial tree or a real tree. The beautiful thing is having that tree in your home for the holidays.",

So Balsam Hill, the company I started, focuses on mimicking nature and bringing farm grown trees into your home as artificial treesthat look exactly like they would if you went out and cut them down on a Christmas tree farm. So we focus on all the different popular species around the U.S., in Europe. And we mimic those and that gives people the option to have an artificial tree with the convenience that looks just like a real tree. We don't have the scents; we do have other options to provide the scent but we make them look as real as possible. And that lets people keep them up for longer.",

Then if you cut a tree down, it might be cheaper, just depends. You can either go out in the national forest with a $5 permit and cut down a tree. On the artificial side, you see trees starting at $100. Even $50. Those are pretty lousy trees, to be honest. We at Balsam Hill sell our trees more in the $400 up over $1,000 range. That's an investment. It works out over time -- we expect consumers to keep our trees for 10 or more years. So it works out to be a pretty portable option. You just need to make that upfront investment. And course, our trees also come with the lights on them as well, often over 1,000 lights, which adds up. So it ends up being a great investment if you're willing to make it.",

And you'll be more comfortable if you bring your own eye mask, travel pillow and blanket. Even though most aircraft have USB charging sockets, bring a portable charger if you want to use your electronic devices. Very good tips indeed.
