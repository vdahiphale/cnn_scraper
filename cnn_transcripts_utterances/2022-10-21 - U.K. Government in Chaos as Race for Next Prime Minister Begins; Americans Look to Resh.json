Because the last time British MPs voted or the Conservative Party voted for their new leader nobody reached the threshold of 100 -- early in the first round of voting. It wasn't until the second round where Rishi Sunak reach that threshold and then not until several rounds later that Liz Truss and then later Penny Mordaunt joined with 100 MPs.And so, over the weekend, it is very likely that we will see some horse trading behind the scenes. We will see a lot of people gauging whether they can even declare their support in the first place. And perhaps, the contenders won't actually declare themself in the race until they actually know for certainly can reach that threshold of 100 MPs of support. All of this seems pretty shocking considering just how short a time Liz Truss was in office, and in the particular British tradition and showing newspapers on TV, I will do the same. And this one seems to say, \"Gone In Just 44 days.\" Anna Stewart was talking about the lettuce, the life of the lettuce. This is another one comparing Liz Truss's time in office to the life of a head of lettuce. Again, a lot of talk about Boris Johnson potentially getting in the race. \" He Couldn't Could He ... Will Bounce Back to Number 10.\" \"Bojo: I'll be Back!\" But of course, there's plenty of people in this country and especially in the Labour Party who would like to see a general election now and that includes the Labour mayor of London who said this yesterday.

Now they are having to account for every single pound, every single pence every month in order to make their budgets work. And a lot of people there told me that, look, they seem just disillusioned with the political system more broadly there, that not just the Conservatives but even the Labour Party does not necessarily live in reality. Because very likely the MPs in office are not having to do the kind of monthly budgeting that they are having to do.

This is the Platte River in Nebraska and you can see these overpasses which would normally be moving across the flowing water, of course the dry river beds. Unfortunately, it is set to continue that shading of brown across the Midwest in the Plains showing the drought persisting through at least January.

Typical of a La Nina -- yes, we've said La Nina -- this has to do with the cooling waters across the Pacific. This is the third season in a row, the third winter in a row. They're calling it a triple dip La Nina and it unfortunately coincides with dryer conditions across those areas hits hard by the recent expanding drought. Now there's some good news. There is some temporary relief, but not enough to put a dent in the drought. So, we have some rain, but it won't be enough to quell the ongoing drought conditions there. All right, changing subjects, quickly talking about the meteor shower. If you're in the northern hemisphere, it is dark outside. If you're in the United States, you happen to tune in right now, you need to step outside because you have an opportunity to see 10 to 20 meteors per hour if you look about 30 degrees above the horizon in a southerly direction, just outside of the Orion constellation.
