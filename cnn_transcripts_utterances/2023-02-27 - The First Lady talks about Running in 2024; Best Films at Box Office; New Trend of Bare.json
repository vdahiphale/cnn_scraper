I'll tell you what I'm hearing from sources in Biden world. And thatis the following. Just like you just heard from the first lady, he's been very focused on all of the international trips and policy that he's needed to focus on as the year anniversary of Ukraine approached. And just on the raw politics of it, they (INAUDIBLE) is not likely to have a significant primary challenger. There's no rush to jump in. They look at the calendar and the history, the most recent history of a two-term president, and that is his former boss, Barack Obama, that he didn't announce until around now. The thing that is missing, as far as we know, though, is the kind of behind-the-scenes movement that generally happens, or the sort of checking out of the White House and checking into a political world from people who are close to him.

And the feeling is, among some of them, how can I sign a pledge promising to support him as the nominee if he is the nominee if I don't think he should be president.And it's going to be a very tough thing for some of these candidates who are going to have to decide, from their perspective, if they are going to put country first or party first. And that is kind of the calculus that is going on. Not among all of the Republican candidates who are not Donald Trump, but among some of them. Never mind the question that I've put in the clip that you played about Trump himself, whether he will actually stick to any kind of pledge. They signed pledges in 2016.

She goes, I would support both of them if they were the nominee, but I don't know if they would support each other.
