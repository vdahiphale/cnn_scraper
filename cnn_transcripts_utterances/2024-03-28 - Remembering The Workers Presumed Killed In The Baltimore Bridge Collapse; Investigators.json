There's the bridge and the support by two piers.So, if the one the piers collapsed, everything else goes. That's exactly what happened. Now, Baltimore, this bridge is pretty old. It's built in 1976. And it doesn't have much redundancy. Like today, if you see the like a seismic area like California, the system has much more redundant, which means they have a much bigger piers, and also it can take a lot of impact. So therefore, it's much more redundant in a sense for against this kind of impact. Remember, this ship is huge, it's 100,000 ton at empty, it's about 300 meters long. And traveling about 10 miles per hour, it's about a speed of a bicycle, kind of slow, but such a huge element. So, therefore, the momentum is big so that's why it caused the collapse there.",

But because it was a smaller ship, of course, the bridge survived.However, we have seen other similar deadly disasters, the most recent just a month ago involving a cargo ship hitting the Pearl Bridge in Guangzhou, China. What needs to be done to reassess the stroke -- structural integrity of these older bridges here in the U.S., and of course, around the world to update them? So, they're less vulnerable to accidents like this, because these enormous container ships, they're here to stay.",

So, it's definitely due to those bridges exposed to the quiet risk.Now, 1980s, a bridge like that collapsed in a Tampa Bay, in Florida State. And they actually reconstructed in a much more robust way. The pier is -- actually, the piers what I was talking about, protect by the actually island, so they Island around the pier, and also the -- so-called bumper around it. So, when the ships are coming through, it will actually absorb the energy in a slowdown. But there's no structural system can withstand such a huge impact, you know, just to make it slow down and hopefully, to lessen that the risk of a collapse. Now, today, if you follow the modern bridge design code, or guideline, the probability that it will collapse each year is one in 10,000. So, it's definitely a rare event. But there's definitely a risk exists. So, for the older bridges, best thing what we can do is built the protective devices or elements around pier, that's probably the most cost effective and fastest way to reduce risk.",

Now, you know, blaming the U.S. for this is just sanctimonious nonsense. And it is intentional and deliberate.
