      "sentences": "Now President Biden huddled with his top military and civilian leadership in the Department of Defense at a time of increased tensions really across the globe. Certainly, in the Indo Pacific, China's provocations as it relates to Taiwan, North Korean missile testing, the possibility of a nuclear test coming in the next days or weeks.And certainly, in the most acute manner, Ukraine. U.S. officials have been grappling with the escalations presented by President Vladimir Putin over the course of the last several weeks. A very real, palpable concern that these escalations may move to the point where Putin considers the utilization of tactical nuclear strikes. Something U.S. officials have warned privately to Russia in very definitive terms that there would be a serious response. I mean, the president has warned in ambiguous more terms that there would be a very serious response from the U.S. side as well. At this point in time, U.S. officials made clear they have not seen any shift in Russian nuclear posture. They've not seen any moves by Russian forces or Russian leadership to go down that path. But concerns about false flag operations related to dirty bombs allegations that Russian leaders presented over the course of the last several days have really only animated the discussion inside the administration, inside the White House. One thing remains very clear, the United States willingness to provide support for Ukraine, despite some of the political dynamics currently at play on the domestic front. That is not shifting any time soon. President Biden and his team making clear there will be more defense assistance sent in the weeks and months ahead. More humanitarian assistance as well. And the president making clear that the Western coalition that has come together over the course of the last eight or nine months remains very strong. Take a listen.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, people have tried in the past and failed to get these two countries as we noted technically at war to reach an agreement. Keep in mind, in Lebanon you still have the Iran back militant group Hezbollah who had in the past vowed to destroy Israel. And yet here we are today the formal signing day of this agreement between these two countries.Now the motivating factors behind this, what's potentially changed in the past few years are a few things. For one, you have Europe desperately seeking new sources of energy. And Israel had already had a gas field ready for pumping. You have Lebanon in dire economic straits, desperate for new sources of income. And Israel also really wants to see some more calm on its northern borders especially with Hezbollah. And so, all of this put together, Amos Hochstein, the U.S. envoy -- the one who mediated this agreement -- managing to get it through. Now this morning the Lebanese negotiator calls it a new era and the Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, just in the last few minutes, called it a diplomatic achievement knowing that it's not every day an enemy state recognizes the state of Israel in a written agreement in front of the entire international community. So, both the Israeli and Lebanese sides have now formally agreed to the agreements within their own governments. Now the agreement is being flown up to -- from the Israeli side -- to northern Israel where then they will have a meeting at the U.N. base on the Lebanese side in a place called Naqoura. We're still not entirely clear whether we will actually see images of both the Lebanese and the Israeli negotiating teams together in the same room with the Americans. Because, Max, although we keep talking about this agreement between Lebanon and Israel, it's actually each side is signing an agreement with the United States who mediated it. So, there's no direct agreement between the two of them. What's also notable is after that signing in Naqoura, is that both sides will submit the coordinates of this maritime border to the United Nations. This is the first time that this as happened between these two countries. Sort of a de facto recognition. And it's a major change to what's happening here for Israel, they really hope that this will mean that there will be some calm on the northern border, especially with Hezbollah. And Israel's gas field is ready to start pumping gas to Europe right away. In Lebanon, even though there gas field is not yet online, they hope that just the fact that there will be explorations, they will potentially be pumping gas, that will bring much-needed investment to their economy -- Max.",

That is the last full month of what we call the summer of flight cancellations. Remember, the airlines canceled about 55,000 flights in the U.S. between Memorial Day and Labor Day -- According to FlightAware.The big take away from these new numbers, August complaints were up 6 percent compared to the month before. But get this, the numbers are 320 percent higher than back in 2019 before the pandemic. It is a lot of anger about the airlines. The data shows the top of issues for passengers was over cancellations and delays, followed by problems with baggage -- mainly with foreign carriers. Also, issues getting refunds from the airlines. The data also included details on who canceled the most flights in August. United took the top spot, followed by American Airlines and then Southwest. What is interesting, is that these new numbers are coming out as so many of you are considering buying tickets from the airlines for the holidays.
