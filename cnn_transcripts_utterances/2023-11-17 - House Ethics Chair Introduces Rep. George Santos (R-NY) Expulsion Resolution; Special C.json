Santos has already survived one expulsion vote, but this time, things appear to be different. That is because the House Ethics Committee released a scathing report accusing Santos of stealing campaign money and using it for his own personal gain, and the details are extremely damning. Santos is accused of spending donors' money on luxury goods, Botox, Sephora hauls and OnlyFans subscriptions.CNN's Lauren Fox is joining us now from Capitol Hill this morning. Lauren, what are you starting to hear from lawmakers? I know that there was this call for, yes, we're going to file this. Now they have filed it.

What you are hearing from members over the course of the last 24 hours is many of them who had voted against expelling George Santos from Congress in previous resolution votes, they are saying now that they are ready to get rid of George Santos and kick him out of Congress. It's an extremely high bar to kick a member out of the House of Representatives. It takes a two-thirds majority of the House of Representatives, but so far there are at least a dozen House Republicans who voted against expelling Santos before, who are now saying that they would be supportive of that measure.And assuming that all of the Democrats voted to expel George Santos, you'd need around 50 Republicans to change their vote and support that resolution. So, they are well on their way. Now, this resolution has officially been introduced. Once again, lawmakers will be on a Thanksgiving recess next week. We expect that when they return, that resolution could come to the floor for a vote. We are also expecting on November 30th that George Santos will hold a press conference and speak to reporters about what his plans are. But obviously a lot of questions about whether or not George Santos will remain in Congress, either by his own volition or whether or not his colleagues may vote to kick him out. Sara?",

They burrowed in, built an organization and focus above all on mobilizing, consolidating Evangelical Christians. And they all won.When they got to New Hampshire, they immediately careened into a snow bank. None of them got to even 12 percent of the vote. Evangelicals are half the share of the vote in New Hampshire as they are in Iowa. And what happened to Huckabee, Santorum and Cruz, is that once they got, in effect, stamped as the candidate of the religious right, of the social conservatives, they had very little audience in New Hampshire.

It's more moderate, more college educated, a lot of independents vote, somewhere around 40 percent of the electorate, and then she goes home to South Carolina.Now, you know, if she finishes second to Trump in South Carolina, that's probably it. I mean, you know, the winner of the South Carolina primary, as you know, has won the Republican nomination every time since 1980, except for 2012, when Gingrich had kind of this fluky win there.

And among what the IDF says they have discovered is the bodies of two Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. They are 65 -year -old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old Noa Marciano. Noah is a corporal in the IDF. Their bodies have now been taken back to Israel.Still, the IDF estimates around 237 hostages are still being held inside Gaza, now 42 days after the October 7th terror attack by Hamas. Now, along with that grim news of this discovery, Israel has released what they say is a first look at the Hamas infrastructure that they say that they're finding at the hospital complex. The video showing what the IDF claims is an operational tunnel shaft, that's how they describe it, found feet away from the building at the hospital. And there's also video released of weapons and ammunition, as you saw right there, released by the IDF, they say they found it at the hospital. Israel has long said Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital is being used and has been used by Hamas to shield its operations. The Biden administration says that U.S. intelligence backs that up.

The key question is, what is behind that tunnel door, what's inside the shaft that you see there. And that, of course, would go a long way to confirming what the IDF has long asserted, which is that Hamas uses the hospital complex above to shield and protect its infrastructure below.We haven't seen into that infrastructure. We don't know if there are multiple shafts there or the large complex that the IDF has long said is there. But this is the beginning of what the IDF says is a process of releasing evidence to show that as they work their way through now on the fourth day or so through the hospital complex still searching, still looking for that underground infrastructure. Again, as you pointed out, the U.S. has given its own backing. President Joe Biden says the U.S. has its own intelligence that also shows or says that Hamas has infrastructure below the complex itself. The IDF says they also found weapons and ammunition in the vicinity. Meanwhile, doctors and officials at the hospital have asserted that it is simply a medical complex, but this is a very black and white issue. There either is or is not Hamas infrastructure below the hospital. There isn't really a spectrum here. And that's why this is such a fundamental important claim for the credibility here of establishing that it is there or it isn't there. The U.N. has said there needs to be an independent commission or an independent check to really go in and look at what's underneath the hospital itself as IDF operations continue there.",
