Held in contempt, Donald Trump is fined at his hush money trial for violating a gag order and threatened with jail time if he does it again. The former president says it's unconstitutional and calls the trial ridiculous. Campus clashes. Classes are cancelled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And students occupying a building at Columbia University are threatened with expulsion. And men set to make their first move. Dating app Bumble opens the door to men, starting conversations on the platform. All that and much more coming up. But first, the latest on Donald Trump's hush money trial, Keith Davidson, a former lawyer for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, testified about how their deals were done, saying interest in the adult film star's story reached a crescendo when the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out. Earlier Tuesday, the judge fined Trump $9,000 for violating his gag order. After that ruling, Trump moved the nine social media post that had got him in trouble. And the judge also threatened the former president with jail time if he keeps violating those orders. Here's what Donald Trump had to say after the court adjourned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This gag order is not only unique, it's totally unconstitutional. I'm the Republican candidate for president of the United States. I received this honor in record time. Nobody's ever gone to faster. It's never happened. Nobody's ever got the numbers that we got. And I'm sitting in a courthouse. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's when police sort of came into the situation. The protesters had arms entwined around the flagpole. The officers who responded to that began pushing down and pulling down the protesters.

They then took the Palestinian flag down, tried to put the American flag back up. It was taken back down by a protester.

Because if it's in the mountains, all of that water has to run down into the city before it finally goes away. 694 millimeters. Get out a meter stick and see where 694 is. 69 centimeters of rainfall anywhere will cause flooding. But there were places in Kenya, this big square right here, that were 400 percent of normal just for this month alone. We expect it. This is when the big heavy rainfall comes in the middle of the spring, when the intertropical convergence zone is right over the top. And then later on, by June, it's all gone. And it doesn't rain at all. But here is the problem, they had too much too fast and still more coming down. We're coming down everywhere that you see yellow, that's at least 50, some spots, 150 more millimeters. So, that's another six inches of rainfall still to come down.

This is just the time of year when America gets the severe weather, hail, wind, and of course, yes, the tornadoes. There's been more than 120 tornadoes just in the past five days or so.

Well, large groups of protestersinto Tbilisi, Georgia have clashed with police outside the country's parliament throughout the night there. Demonstrators are angry over the so-called foreign agents bill, which would require organizations to declare funding sources from outside of Georgia. Critics say the bill would hurt the country's bid to join the European Union. Haiti's Transitional Council has proposed a new interim prime minister. Fritz Belizaire is the country's former sports minister. The council is responsible for setting up elections with the goal of eventually handing over power to a new president. Haiti has faced waves of violence and unrest since its last president was assassinated back in 2021. The Philippine Coast Guard says one of its ships was damaged by a water cannon fired by a Chinese Coast Guard vessel. The incident took place in a disputed area of the South China Sea. China also targeted another Philippine government ship. The Chinese Coast Guard said on social media that it had expelled the two ships for \"intruding.\" The Biden administration will move to reclassify marijuana as a lower risk substance. That's according to a person familiar with the plans. Currently, the U.S. federal government lists cannabis as a highly addictive schedule one drug on the same level as heroin. If the approval process is successful, marijuana will move down to a schedule three. Most states already allow medical use of cannabis, with almost half also permitting recreational use by adults. Well, turning to one of our top stories now, pro-Palestinian demonstrations on university campuses across the U.S. More than a thousand people have been arrested so far across more than two dozen campuses. At Columbia University, the epicenter of this movement against Israel's war in Gaza, one group began occupying a campus building overnight. The school is now threatening expulsion to the students involved. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a CNN crew witnessed police turn physical as they push back protesters.

A Delhi police officer was caught on camera last month kicking a group of Muslim men praying by the side of the road. The video went viral. The officer suspended. Another police officer arrested for killing three Muslims on a train, praising the prime minister while standing over their bodies. The worst was in 2020. Violence broke out between Hindus and Muslims in the capital, New Delhi. Dozens of people died, mostly Muslims. It happened around the same time Modi was meeting then-President Donald Trump. Even those who survived one of the darkest chapters in India's recent history will never be the same. Nasir Ali says a Hindu man shot him in the face near his home, the one place he should have been safe. He says the police did practically nothing, a charge they deny. NASIR ALI, DELHI RESIDENT (through translator): Everyone was feeling unsafe. We can no longer rely on the police. RIPLEY (voice-over): A court order called their investigation casual, callous, and farcical. Four years later, the case is still ongoing in a higher court.",

Now, that's not necessarily going away. Women will still have the option to make the first move if they want to, but women users can also select to use a new feature that Bumble is calling opening moves, which is a prompt that they can put on their profile, a question like, what somebody's dream dinner guest would be. They can put that prompt on their profile as an indicator to their male matches that they want the man to make the first move. And Bumble says this still fits with that original mission of empowering women, but now, they're just giving women more control about who they want to start the conversation.",

And so, they're seeking to return to growth, return to profitability. At the same time, a lot of single people have sort of soured on dating apps. People are kind of tired of swiping and looking to find more in- person connections.

But Bayern responding very well. Actually, now we're caught up. This is Vinicius Junior with a wonderful opening goal of the match there for the opener. But I will say, Bayern Munich roared on by the home fans, came roaring back in style. Leroy Sane leveling masses there for one apiece in the Bavarian capital. And then a bit of a clumsy foul there. Bayern winning a penalty. You're never going to guess who takes it. It's Harry Kane, of course. Bayern 2-1 up at this point. Plenty of time for Real though. And they get a penalty of their own. It's not the best defending, I will say, and it's the South American player, Vinicius Junior, smashing it into the back of the net. Two all, the final score.

Nice work, I tell you, if you can get it. Amazing year this has been for Travis, no question. 2024 is already seen him win his third career Super Bowl title. And then, of course, is that high-profile relationship with music superstar, let me try, oh yes, Taylor Swift. I recall, Lynda, after winning that third Super Bowl, he and Swift took a vacation in the Bahamas and did an exclusive interview with \"People\" magazine, the tight end, sharing his joy about his current life.
