And there were certainly outside advisors, other top Democratic officials that were eyeing whether it's February, March, maybe early April, lining up with what President Obama did back in 2011.But I think the importance of this anniversary, this four-year since he launched his campaign in 2019. And really the thread -- the connective thread between that campaign to his first two-plus years in office to now and what he wants to do going forward is something that the president is quite fond of. And I think it's something that underscores the fact that for all of the things they believe they've accomplished in those first two years, there was more work to be done. Now, it's worth noting. The President hasn't officially signed off according to people familiar with the plan with the Tuesday announcement. We'll be heading to Camp David soon, definitely headed in that direction. Advisors make clear though, that this is a moment where they're not going to talk about anything until it's official. A lot of tea leaf reading though.
