It deliberately writes rules so vaguely that empowers unelected bureaucrats. And our constitutional system, the branch of government that is the most democratic has the most power.

A lot of these lawmakers don't know anything about a lot of things. And so I think, first of all, it's not practical. And secondly, I think more worrying for me is that this is an old battle, right, big government versus small government. But the real problem, I think, is that what we're seeing on the right is the idea of destroying the federal government, is this idea of the destruction of the administrative state which was an idea coming from Steve Bannon and that has now migrated to the heart of Republican policy insofar as there is Republican policy. I just interviewed the head of the Heritage Foundation, which is a storied conservative think tank, and their entire ethos at the moment, and this is running on Sunday, is that basically when a Republican gets into government, they want to get rid of entire agencies.

They should be scrutinizing these regulations that have enormous effects. But to do that, you actually need resources in Congress. So I actually firmly agree with Jonah. If you're lamenting the state of Congress right now, the issue is that we elect certain kinds of people, and they punt certain kinds of things because they can.
