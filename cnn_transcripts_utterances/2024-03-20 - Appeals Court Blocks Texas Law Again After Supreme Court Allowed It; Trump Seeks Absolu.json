This is all about the state's controversial new immigration law that would allow state law enforcement to arrest and deport people suspected of entering the country illegally. And it's now the subject of a dramatic back and forth with the Supreme Court overnight.Here's where things stand right now. The law is on hold once again. And here is how we got there. The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court had cleared the way for the law, and it is known as Senate Bill 4, SB4, to take effect, while the legal battle was playing out making its way through the court system. But then just hours later, an appeals court said, hold on, once again pausing these new law enforcement measures as they consider whether or not the law violates a Constitution. Critics say that SB4 at its core, what this gets down to, critics say that it violates human rights, stokes racial profiling and overreaches government authority. The Texas governor though says it is necessary to slow the crisis at his border. CNN's Rosa Flores is in Arizona following all of this for us this morning. Rosa, there are a lot of moving parts. You have been following the path of SB4 from the beginning and a dramatic turn overnight. Where do things stand and where do things go?",

      "sentences": "Okay. First of all, I just want to, for our audience, let them know just how condensed this timetable has been and how condensed it will be today. It was around 2We have a hearing going on at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals around 10:00 A.M. Central Time, 11:00 Eastern Time, but then it could come back up here. And let me just say what the heat that was produced at the Supreme Court yesterday afternoon and that could come back to this and how it could be reignited at the Supreme Court. The majority, when it let this law take effect, did not explain its reasoning. Two of the justices broke off and referred to the procedural posture here. And I'm going to get to that. But, first, I think it's important to hear what the three liberal dissenters said and how much they thought it was wrong to let this law take effect, given how much turmoil is going on at the border. And they said that the chaos that the federal courts were creating were adding to that. And our first Latina justice, Sonia Sotomayor, said something that was joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. She said, the court invites further chaos and crisis in immigration enforcement. Texas upends the federal state balance of power that has existed for over a century in which the national government has had exclusive authority over entry and removal of non-citizens. This is the key part. This is what this all comes down to, is who's responsible. And for ages, of course, it has been the domain of the federal government. But as I mentioned, John, I want to just refer briefly to the little word we did get from two of the justices in the conservative-dominated majority yesterday. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh referred to the unusual procedural posture that this case was in. And just as they wrote, I think it unwise to invite emergency litigation in this court about whether a court of appeals abused its discretion at this preliminary step. That, essentially, John, was a signal to the Fifth Circuit to go back and do something more formal, to actually review whether this state law, if it took effect, would actually bring more harm to the challengers, the Biden administration and immigrant rights groups, or more harm to Texas. So, what we had, the action around midnight tonight, was just -- it's still preliminary. And after today's hearing, we will have a more formal order, presumably, that says whether this law should take effect while appeals on the merits of it play out. But there will still be several steps and likely back up to the Supreme Court where the losing party would go. So, as I said, the chaos at the border is being matched, in part, by turmoil in the federal courts, John.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, Donald Trump's team wants the Supreme Court to dismiss the charges against him in Washington, D.C., that federal case related to what he did at the end of the presidency before January 6th and the 2020 election.What they're doing in their filing to the Supreme Court, this brief that lays out the argument that Trump's team is making to the Supreme Court is likely to argue to them in person as well, is that there is a massive fear that the justices should have about how this could destroy the presidency if someone who served in the presidency can be charged with a crime when they were in office. So, this doom and gloom, fearful scenario that they're painting starts by saying that this would hurt the presidency because it would make presidents fearful whenever they are in office. They write, once our nation crosses this Rubicon, meaning a president charged, convicted potentially, every future president will face de facto blackmail and extortion while in office and will be harassed by politically motivated prosecution after leaving office over his most sensitive and controversial decisions. That bleak scenario would result in a weak and hollow president and would thus be ruinous for the American political system as a whole. One of the ways that they are appealing to the justices here is they cite Brett Kavanaugh, a law review article that that justice wrote 15 years ago, saying it would be a worse -- it would be a situation where the president will do a worse job if he could be prosecuted. All of this taken together is a hope where the Trump team has to appeal to the justices to dismiss that case. But if they're not willing to do it on the grounds that Trump or a president should be absolutely protected and immune from any criminal prosecution, they say, you could just add in more time to the case, send it back to the lower courts, have more fact finding to see if there is some sort of immunity idea that could come up through the court system, is there something more that could be done? That option would ultimately result in delay. Kate?",

Legal experts said Mr. Trump was unlikely to prevail, but added that how and when the court rejects his arguments will effectively determine whether and when Mr. Trump's trial, which had been scheduled to start March 4th, will proceed. I get the when. We understand that depending on how the Supreme Court rules and when they rule, the trial could be delayed. But what about the how, how they rule after these April arguments? What does that mean?",

And it's really embarrassing that it's at the court. It's so far off base and in the left field that if that was the only proposition they put forth, likely to just be a quick slam dunk against them.But the potential off-ramp for the Supreme Court would be to send it back, as Katelyn was saying, for some further factual development by the trial court, that aspect of the how would definitely result in further delay. And what's dangerous about that for the prosecution, good for Trump, is that it's the kind of off-ramp that the Supreme Court would traditionally like, which is they can avoid put off such a major decision and do it more piecemeal and have further factual development on it, and that could be very appealing to them.",

And this is a deliberating illness. I mean, it affects the brain, it affects the nervous system, mostly it impacts children.But just this morning, the company behind the drug, Orchard Therapeutics, announced the price tag, the wholesale cost is $4.25 million per one treatment. And this is given as a one treatment, a one and done, so to speak. But as for why it's so expensive, Orchard Therapeutics says in a statement that it set the price tag at that number because it is, quote, reflective of the value the therapy may deliver to eligible patients and their families, as well as the potential long-term impact treatment may have on overall healthcare utilization, minimization of productivity loss for caregivers and life opportunities for patients. But the number, John, is striking, I will say there are other expensive drugs out there that are taken more than once and over time they may add up to more than $4 million, and there are drugs in that million dollar price range. There's a blood disorder drug that costs about $3.5 million of muscular dystrophy treatment that costs about $3.2 million, but $4 million, $4.25, John, that's definitely up there when we look at drug price tags.",
