It shares a border with Israel and Gaza. Can it help during or after this brutal war?

We heard the Qatari prime minister as you just mentioned say that there has been good progress, that the challenges are mainly logistical. The Deputy National Security adviser in the United States, Jon Finer, just last hour telling Jake Tapper that we are closer than we have been perhaps at any point in these negotiations since weeks ago, and he also -- and we also heard from the Israeli ambassador who said that he was hopeful, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, he was hopeful that there could be a deal in the coming days as well. Now it's important to obviously underscore all of that optimism with what we have witnessed over the last several weeks which is that we have seen at other points that we have come close to a potential deal and talks have fallen apart. And that is because these talks are extremely fraught, they're extremely complex, they're also not talking to each other. Israel and Hamas aren't talking directly to each other. They are talking via the Qatari government, and so that adds another layer of difficulty to all of this.",

His latest column on the subject is called \"What We Get Wrong About Israel and Gaza.\"Hi, Nick. You talk about three myths and I just want to quickly list them. The first myth is that this is a conflict in which, you know, it is absolutely morally clear all the right is on one side and all the wrong is on another, and you point out actually it's a clash between two rights. The second you say is that the Israeli myth that the Palestinians issue can be strung along indefinitely, the can kicked down the road indefinitely. I want to get to the third one, though, which I think is one I've heard so often in recent days, particularly from Israeli friends of mine, which is that it's too bad that we have to use so much force but the other side only understands brutal violence. This is something I've heard a lot of people say in Israel. We live in a rough neighborhood, we just have to show that we can be absolutely brutal, and perhaps even irrational in our use of violence. Why do you think that that's a myth, in other words why do you think that's wrong?",

That there is, you know, we have no peace partner. That the only way to get attention to this cause is to blow things up. And I don't think it works.You know, having watched this crisis as you have over the years, what you do see is that violence and hardliners tend to lead to violence and hardliners on the other side. You know, why is Netanyahu in power? I mean, he took power in part after Hamas was engaging in suicide bombings, you know, originally back in the 1990s. It was Hamas' takeover of Gaza that kind of helped destroy the Israeli left and the Labour Party there. And so many times in Gaza, I've talked to children and you ask them what they want to be and, you know, they don't want to be a firefighter, they don't want to be a doctor. They want to be shahid, they want to be martyrs, and that's because they've lost family members close to them, and I think that we are again in this cycle of violence that simply perpetuates it. And, you know, I don't think that's going to advance Israeli interests or obviously Palestinian interests when, you know, half of 1 percent of the Gaza population has already been killed.",

And, you know, Netanyahu thinking that one way of undermining a Palestinian Authority and reducing the possibility of a Palestinian state down the road is to support Hamas? Absolutely.

Yes, I think that is an element. And I mean, one thing that I think both sides have in common, including Hamas, is that they don't greatly care for the lives of Palestinian civilians.",

For the first three weeks of Israel's siege, Egypt's government kept the crossing closed. Now it is intermittently opened to let a trickle of aid into Gaza and a few foreigners and injured Palestinians out into Egypt. That despite fact that the Egyptian public has rallied in large numbers in support of the Palestinians in Gaza.So what is motivating the Egyptian government's decisions and what whole might the nation play once the hot war is over? Joining me now is Tariq Masoud, a professor of Democracy and Governance at Harvard. Tariq, so help us understand Egypt's sort of basic orientation because generally speaking people have tended to view Egypt as a country that in some sense has been part of the containment of Hamas. It was enforcing the blockade in various ways over the last 16 years. It doesn't let Palestinians in. How has it reacted to this attack, the Hamas attack?",

So, look, the Egyptian reaction to what happened on October 7th is very plain. They've been calling since day one for a cease-fire. You know, one of the I think problems and I think Nick Kristof mentioned this in your earlier segment, is that we've kind of blown past the horrors of October 7th.The Egyptians moved past the horrors of October 7th almost immediately because they felt that they could see what was coming down the pike which was a massive retaliation operation by the Netanyahu government in Gaza that would yield a humanitarian crisis of incredible proportions and that would put Egypt under a great deal of pressure. So Egypt from the very beginning has been calling for a cease-fire. They've been calling for restraint. They convened, remember, a peace conference in October that didn't yield anything but it was a pretty clear demonstration of what Egyptian intentions were. The Egyptians today are trying to negotiate along with the Qataris with Hamas to get a cease-fire in exchange for the release of some hostages.",

Some untold number of who might be Hamas fighters who would then use Egypt maybe as a staging ground for their operations against Israel. And then suddenly Egypt, which since the peace treaty with Israel has been part of the solution in the region, would once again be drawn into the theater of war and be part of the problem. So Sisi is very concerned about that.The other thing he is concerned about that he has said very publicly and every Egyptian official you talk to will say very publicly is that they do not want to be party to the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza because they believe that once the Palestinians are pushed out the Netanyahu government will never let them back in. And so, there are fears, I don't know if they're credible or not credible, but they are deeply felt that Egypt does not want to be part of what would be termed as a second Nakba, the second displacement of Palestinians from their lands.",

The Egyptians have a difficult time governing themselves. I think there is also not enough attention paid to again the cost to Egypt of being involved in such a thing. What is that line Metternich said about France? If France sneezes, Europe catches a cold. If Egypt sneezes the Middle East gets cancer.And to the idea that you would put Egypt in this position which could be very destabilizing for the country I think is one that should give us real pause. The issue in Gaza right now is once Hamas has been tamed, the issue is establishing governance. I don't know how we do that. I know how we don't do that and that's by getting very beleaguered, weak, impoverished countries in crisis like Egypt to try to shoulder that burden.",

It is said we need to resume collaboration on things like climate change. And the United States throughout has said that we want a stable and predictable relationship. I think the big change dynamic here in all fairness to the U.S., Fareed, has -- the depth of the Chinese economic slowdown has really brought about a fundamental relook at the dynamics of this relationship. And speaking of major American corporates, of course, they'll breathe a sigh of relief. That's normal and natural, and so they should. But here the proof of the pudding will lie in the eating. That is, we can talk about a resumption of mil-mil dialogue between the PLA and the United States' armed forces, and this is a good step forward. It will be the substance of these two or three sets of new tracks and what it will deliver which will either determine whether there is a material change in geopolitical instability across the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea or whether there won't be. And what boardrooms are reacting to around the world in Europe and in the United States is this underlying fear that we were beginning to move step by step inexorably towards crisis, conflict and war.

That is been a patent since the Pelosi visit to Taiwan not so long ago. Returning to the status quo ante on that would be good. Plus, frankly, depending on the electoral outcome in the Taiwanese presidential elections in January, our friends in Beijing not to recourse to other forms of military and economic coercive pressure against whatever political outcome the Taiwanese electoral process delivers.
