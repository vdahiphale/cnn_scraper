The suspects, 16- and 17-years-old. They're charged as adults, though, with reckless murder. Four people at the party were killed, dozens more injured. Prosecutors said that more charges are expected. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is pushing to release his debt limit bill. Here he is speaking now on the House floor. He wants to hold a floor vote next week. That, according to three sources familiar with the matter. McCarthy, facing the toughest challenge of his leadership, says it will have enough votes to pass the Republican-controlled House. Just minutes from now, President Biden expected to blast McCarthy's spending strategy during a speech touting his own economic plan. The president touring a union training facility in Maryland. And we are also following, as we get a new look at Ralph Yarl, the Kansas City team who rang the doorbell just at the wrong address, and he was shot in the head and the arms by the homeowners. Here, this is a new picture. That's a 16-year-old green spirit sitting next to his attorney. The family spokesman calls Ralph a walking miracle but does note he still faces a long recovery traumatic brain injury among these injuries.",

You know this whole idea that the alarm bells are getting louder when it comes to the pilot shortage.And this is coming from regional airlines, which operate those flights between those major hubs and smaller cities. And they're saying the service could come down to smaller cities. And in some cases, some places would lose service completely because of the pilot shortage. The tsunami of retirements there warning about really goes really deep. This is the impact. Eleven airports with no service, 42 states with less service compared to before the pandemic, 500 airplanes right now sitting idle. The issue here is that about 50 percent of all commercial pilots, according to the Regional Airline Association, will retire in the next 15 years. This just came out of the House committee hearing on Capitol Hill. The other issue here is how to deal with it. They're not a ton of good ideas, and they're pretty controversial. One idea is to raise the retirement age for pilots. Mandatory that they retire now at 65. The idea is they can retire at 67. We'll see if that takes hold. The other idea is to lower the requirement and the bar for pilots to reach before they become an airline pilot. And 1,500 hours is the bar that they must reach. And so this is the rev now. And I want you to listen now to heads of trade associations and the Airline Pilot's Union and what they say here is the best idea. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON AMBROSI, PRESIDENT, AIRLINE PILOT'S ASSOCIATION: I'm not here to say who's dangerous. I can tell you that the Europeans have studied this extensively. Raising the retirement age past 60 with medical - in evidence and have said, no, it's not a good idea, and they're recommending against it. FAYE MALARKEY BLACK, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, REGIONAL AIRLINE ASSOCIATION: These pilots are not operating in a different world. They're operating in our country. They're flying over your schools, your churches, your synagogues. They're in our system, and they're flying safety -- they're flying safely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're having bringing training in house, trying to lower the cost of things. But really the other issue here is that so few young people are interested in learning to become an airline pilot. The under-30 corps of people right now, that's only about 8 percent of all airline pilots. So it's really hard for them to matriculate up, especially as we're facing the shortage.",

I know when I was telling you was going to happen to telling folks they looked at me like that can't happen. Well, guess what is attempted to try to happen now. Massive cuts in programs you count on. Massive benefit protected for those at the top. A lot of, you know, all the tax cuts go to the top. None of the bottom. The threat of defaulting on America's debt for the first time in 230 years. We've never ever default on the debt. It would destroy this economy. And who do you think will hurt the most?

That's what this legislation calls for.Remember, if they don't raise the debt ceiling, there could be the first ever U.S. default as soon as this June, or it could even slip into September. But that is the real fear here. And under this Republican proposal, it would allow for another $1.5 trillion for the debt limit was already north of $31 trillion to be increased. But pair that with a range of spending cuts. That is what McCarthy detailed on the floor. Among the matters, dealing with the repeal of the Democratic Inflation Reduction Act. That would be part of this legislation. As well as imposing new work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as cutting domestic spending, rolling back current spending levels for domestic programs, not defense programs, but a range of other ones for 2022 levels, which would amount to a significant cut across the board. We have not seen all the details of this yet. But McCarthy said it would cut and it would save about $4.5 trillion. It's likely over 10 years, according to their estimates. Now McCarthy is pushing very hard to get this done. He knows full well that Democrats in the Senate won't accept this. The Democrat in the White House won't accept this. But he wants to prove House Republicans can get a bill through that would raise the debt limit and cut spending. And he's trying to get this on the floor as soon as next week. And behind the scenes, a furious effort is going on to try to ensure that Republicans, particularly conservatives, who have been skeptical about raising the debt ceiling, would come along to this. And McCarthy's middle margin for error, he cannot lose more than four Republican votes in order to get this bill, this party line built across. And what McCarthy hopes to strengthen his negotiating position with the White House and essentially forced Joe Biden to the negotiating table to find some sort of deal to cut spending and pair that with a debt limit increase, something that President Biden right there, as you heard is rejected. Now. I just spoke with McCarthy as he left the House floor. He is still confident that he will get the votes next week to do this. And he also defended the push to simply raise the debt ceiling, which differed only do it for about one year, which means that it would kick this again into the election year of 2024. McCarthy believes that he's doing the right thing here. But this conference will be aligned and the showdown will happen next week -- Brianna?",
