Biden made his first visit since taking office to the U.S. southern border on Sunday. Of course, enormous political implications here.

Supporters of Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, laying siege on the capitol, smashing windows, as you've seen in the video here, clashing with police, breaking into congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court. Hundreds have been arrested.Meantime, in Washington this morning with Kevin McCarthy finally locking up the House speakership over the weekend, GOP members set to meet at any moment to select their remaining committee chairs. All of this comes ahead to of a critical vote later today on the rules package, which McCarthy negotiated with those GOP hardliners in order to get the speaker's gavel. We do want to begin, though, this hour in Mexico City with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. So, Priscilla, this is President Biden's first full day in Mexico City.

This is an issue that has been a major political liability for President Biden at home and it is one that the White House is trying to reshape the narrative on, with his visit to El Paso just yesterday, and now in Mexico. If you put these two stops together, really underscores the predicament for President Biden, trying to find solutions at home while also trying to seek assistance here in Mexico.Now, the United States has historically looked to Mexico to try to shore up support as they enforce the U.S./Mexico border and there is no exception here where President Biden is expected to talk with Mexican President Lopez Obrador about migration and ways in which they can stem the flow of irregular migration at a time of mass movement across the western hemisphere. Now, administration officials tell me and underscored the coordination between the two countries up until this point, and they've also said that they hope that the discussions between these two presidents will reinvigorate that support. We got a glimpse of that last week when President Biden gave a border security speech and announced a program that migrants would use to apply to come to the United States legally. But if they didn't, they would be pushed back into Mexico under that Trump-era COVID restriction, again, something that requires agreement between the United States and Mexico. So, those are the conversations that they're going to be having, in addition to also trying to tackle economic development, climate change and security. That, of course, includes fentanyl, as you mentioned.",

A lot of people comment on the accidents and the acts that took place yesterday. They were very angry. Most politicians in Brazil reacted against it. They condemned the attacks and then supported President Lula. Today, the president had a meeting with the heads of congress, the heads of the military and some of his ministers, including also the head of the Supreme Court. They all discussed and they issued a letter together condemning those actions and fate of democracy in Brazil.

This package was part of some of the concessions that Kevin McCarthy had to cut in order to get this -- get the speakership. There are some key concessions in this package. Not all of them are in there but one of them in particular having allow one member of the full House to essentially call for a vote of no confidence in the sitting speaker, something that could create some instability in the speakership. That is one part of this rules package. Another part, making it harder to raise taxes, making it harder to raise spending, as well as providing new provisions to actually reinstitute actually an old rule but a new provision in here to target federal officials' salaries.And here is the speaker. Mr. Speaker, are you going to -- what do you say to folks who are concerned about the concessions that you cut particularly on vacating the chair? The speaker didn't answer that. He hasn't, in the past, when I've asked him about this specific issue, about vacating the chair, allowing one member of the House to essentially call for the speaker's ouster, he has said he's not afraid of that. He said bring -- he'll be able to survive this if it were to come to pass. He was asked late Friday night after he secured the votes for the speakership whether or not he could maintain his -- keep his job for the next two years. How confident he is. He said he's a 1,000 percent confident he can keep his job. But the governing will get incredibly difficult. That rules package we've been talking about, we do expect at least one member of the Republican conference to oppose it, another one has raised concerns as well. They could only lose four votes on any party line bill, any four Republican votes. That will mean that there is very little margin for error. And assuming that bill passes tonight, then we expect other legislation to move forward that Republicans have been talking about. One, to go after funding for the IRS, that was some of that Democrats had approved as part of their inflation reduction act plan that was enacted last year, as well as other number of party line bills that they planned to advance on energy, dealing with abortion and also creating a new investigative committee to look into the FBI and the Justice Department. That is a House committee, that select committee that they plan to approve later this week. But, again, the challenges of governing only beginning here as McCarthy and other Republicans meeting in the room behind me to select their committee chairman in some of the key committees as those people will be central to shaping the legislation going forward and Kevin McCarthy's challenge lays ahead.

I don't think we know of an on-the-record plan for somebody else yet to vote against it, though, Nancy Mace and others have sort of said they're open and thinking about this. But the expectation is it will pass.But, again, this is about organizing the House. To Sarah's point, I mean, I think what is going to happen here when we get to the big ticket items, like raising the debt ceiling, you know, it used to be what they called the Hastert rule in the Republican conference, when Denny Hastert was speaker, that if you had a majority of the majority, he could go to the floor and then wheel and deal as needed. Well, this whole rule that Manu was just talking to you guys about and asked Speaker McCarthy about, only one person necessary to put into motion a vacate the chair and try to put another speaker election front and center, grinding everything to a halt, that is -- that allows every member to retaliate against McCarthy if indeed something like the debt limit, he needs to bring over Democratic votes, where it used to be a faction of Republicans may be angry about that, but now they actually have a tool in their hand to be able do something that would grind everything to a halt.",

And that is really important.And there has been almost this shadow Congress that has worked together to keep governing going. So, that is possible. The problem is, as David points out, this new rule with the motion to vacate, what those chaos agents want in the Republican Party is to close off that lever. They don't want to see Kevin McCarthy negotiate with Democrats. And so this is the central most fundamental problem where nobody wants to see -- that chaos group doesn't want to see compromise, and so how Kevin McCarthy balances that is going to be really difficult.",
