Police in a Philadelphia suburb have issued a shelter in place order after three people were shot to death in what officials are calling a domestic- related incident. A manhunt is now underway for the suspect who is considered armed and dangerous.It's all unfolding in Falls Township, Pennsylvania, a Bucks County community, about 30 miles northeast of Philadelphia. We have team coverage of this breaking news. We'll get to former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey in a moment.

You mentioned it's actually a suburb of Philadelphia the following information coming directly from Jeff Dence, who's actually the township Chairman of the Board of Supervisors there.And according to Dence, they are currently investigating what he is describing as a spree killing that took place in the township this morning. He is saying that this is domestic related three people were killed at two different residences and the actor then -- or suspected this case, then, allegedly carjacked a citizen at a third location. Dence saying that this suspect is currently armed and dangerous and his location is currently unknown. Authorities there, Fred, in Falls Township saying that they are closely working with the Bucks County District Attorney's Office, as well as the FBI as they tried to track down this individual. At this point, we don't have really much suspect information available coming from authorities since, again, this happened not long ago. And this information is preliminary. But just to give you a sense of the concern right now, some neighboring townships, including some information that I've seen from Middleton Township Police Department, now asking residents to shelter- in-place, though they do not believe that this suspect may have made it to their community. They are still taking this precaution. So, really does give you a sense of the scope of the magnitude of this investigation. Because though, according to authorities, this may be a domestic- related incident. The fact that an armed individual is still in the community would certainly be concerning for officials. And finally, I do want to add that CNN's Danny Freeman, speaking to the district attorney's office who said that they are still gathering details at this point, this is still a very active, not only investigation, but also a manhunt. And the D.A.'s office promising to get back to Freeman there with some additional information as well. But again, this is what we have at this point about this shooting that left at least three people killed in Falls Township, Pennsylvania this morning, Fred.",

So, obviously there'll need some support. And but there are a lot of agencies in that area that work very, very well together. And so, I'm not concerned about resources. Right now, the focus has to be on catching this guy before he can hurt anyone else. They don't know if he's got anybody else in mind as a target.

And the carjacking victim, by the way, had no affiliation with this guy at all.And the person was not injured, according to reports. It was -- it was just a straight up carjacking. So now, they are trying to figure out where he would be heading toward Trenton. And Trenton is not that far from where the shootings took place, it's actually closer than Philadelphia would be. So, they are probably going on the assumption he's headed in that direction. But you can't take anything for granted because you just don't know. So, they'll have aerial support, they'll have support on the ground. Certain checkpoints and things of that nature that they'll be doing to try to track this individual to find out where that person is right now. And they may switch cars, he may do a lot of things. But right now, they are just doing everything they possibly can follow any leads they have. They do have a license plate number. They've got all that. I'm sure that's being flashed on interstates.

I mean, you know, criminals don't tend to use maps to stay within a particular jurisdiction. I mean, they go wherever they can go. But they can also be very predictable. I mentioned earlier that, you know, he was tied to Trenton, New Jersey. Where did they find a car? Trenton, New Jersey.So I mean, there's only so many places he can go where he's comfortable, where you can seek shelter. He may very well try to force his way into a location. So now people in Trenton in that particular area, need to be on the lookout. They need to be aware. They need to be sheltering in place until the authorities are able to locate this individual. But they will get him. There's really no question in my mind since they've identified him. They'll be able to locate him. The question is whether or not they'll be able to take him into custody without any incident at all taking place. Hopefully, no one else gets hurt.",

There are no genuine opposition candidates on the ballot, leaving President Vladimir Putin set to secure a fifth term, a victory that would keep him in power through 2030. But there have been some sporadic acts of violence over the vote, including fires at polling stations and people spoiling ballot boxes with dye. Matthew Chance joins us live now from Moscow.

At the moment, the figure is just over 52 percent. And that's after two days essentially, of voting in this three day voting process. There's another day to go.Tomorrow, which is Sunday, local time, is going to be a real focal point, not just because it's the last day, but also because it's the day that Alexei Navalny's widow and Navalny's team, the prominent opposition figure, of course, who died in his Arctic penal colony last month. It's on that day that Navalny team have called on opposition supporters across Russia to go to polling stations and to, you know, spoil their ballots or vote for somebody who isn't Putin who's on the ballot as a form of what they believe would be a safe protest. And so we don't quite know what that's going to look like yet, or how the authorities are going to react. But the authorities have issued a stern warning, saying that anyone who attends an unsanctioned protest will be dealt with, you know, will be facing strict legal consequences. So that's another potential flashpoint. Up until now, there have been a number of, as you mentioned, acts of defiance, people splashing ink and green dye into voting boxes, and even arson attacks at various places across the country.",

What can you tell us about that?[12:45:11] CHANCE: Yes, vacuum bomb, a thermobaric bomb is another word for it. These are extremely powerful, but sub-nuclear munitions that have been in use in the battlefield in Ukraine for some time now. This was an announcement made by the Russian Deputy Defense Minister, essentially, or the deputy of the defense staff, anyway, saying that, you know, in an attack, in an undisclosed location by Russian forces, 300 Ukrainian service personnel were killed. That's been quickly rebutted by the Ukrainians who have told CNN that that's nonsense. The trouble is we don't have here at CNN, any way of verifying battlefield losses on either side of the conflict. And so, you know, moment it's just a question of one say -- side saying one thing and the other side rejecting it, Fredricka.",

US officials say they're cautiously optimistic about this next round of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas. Meanwhile, the speech by U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer calling for new elections in Israel sent shockwaves that are still being filled from Washington to Jerusalem. In his address, the Senate Majority Leader gave a stunning rebuke of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with unusually strong words for a U.S. senior politician, signaling the Democrats growing frustrations with the way Israel is conducting its military campaign in Gaza.

We did hear from John Kirby, the National Security Council Spokesman yesterday who said that President Biden himself was not calling for new elections in Israel, that that's a decision for the Israelis to make.But it is hard to interpret this series of events is not the latest sign that this relationship between this White House and this government in Israel is not careening towards complete fracture. You do hear mounting frustration inside the White House, from President Biden on down at how Netanyahu has seemed to reject a number of American recommendations when it comes to the war in Gaza, whether it's taking more steps to protect civilians, whether it's taking more steps to get humanitarian aid and whether it's the future of a Palestinian state. These are all things that Netanyahu has publicly broken with the White House on President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu who once spoke on a daily or weekly basis at the onset of this conflict have now not spoken by phone for more than a month. And you do see a much more public break sort of on the horizon. As Israel says it's preparing for a major operation in Rafah. The White House has said that something like that should not go forward without a credible plan to protect the millions of civilians who are sheltering in that city. As of yesterday, the White House says that they haven't seen such a plan. And certainly there are steps on the table, I think for President Biden and the White House potentially respond if Israel were to go forward. So you do see this relationship, really taking a toll. And President Biden and White House officials certainly growing more and more frustrated as this conflict goes on. Fredricka?",
