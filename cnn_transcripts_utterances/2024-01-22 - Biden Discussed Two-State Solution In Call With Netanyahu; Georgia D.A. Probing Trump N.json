Now, President Biden and Netanyahu jumped on the phone for about 40 minutes on Friday, just one day after Netanyahu appeared to pour cold water on the idea of creating a Palestinian state. But a source says that in this call that Netanyahu said that those comments weren't meant to rule out the possibility of a Palestinian state in the future. The two men talked in detail about what attributes a Palestinian state would need to have as negotiations progress. A source saying that it was a serious and detailed conversation. One thing that Biden administration officials have been speaking about is the possibility of a demilitarized Palestinian state, something a source said President Biden finds intriguing. And after that phone call, President Biden told reporters that he does think it is still possible that a Palestinian state emerges in the future. But it completely remains unclear at this time how exactly that could happen as Netanyahu has quite publicly been trying to shoot this down. And it all comes as even as the U.S. has publicly supported Israel there has been some frustration bubbling behind the scenes with the fact that Netanyahu has publicly pushed back on American ideas and proposals at a time when he is also facing a lot of political heat and pressure back home in Israel. So all of this really speaks to the challenges President Biden is facing at this moment as he's trying to apply more pressure on Netanyahu not just as he is waging this campaign in Gaza but also in discussions about what happens there when the conflict ends.",

This tunnel system that the Israeli military is showing us in this video runs about a half-mile long under the center of Khan Younis, the second-largest city in the Gaza Strip. It goes 60-plus feet underground.And the Israeli military says that 20 hostages were held at different times in tunnels. In the video, you can see that there are about five prison cells with a toilet and a mattress in each of them. The Israeli military says that they determined that hostages were held there based on DNA evidence that was collected from those cells as well as the testimony of some former hostages who said that they were, indeed, held in those very same tunnels. What they also found was a kitchen, bathrooms, as well as child's drawings that the Israeli military says they believe were drawn by 5- year-old Emilia Aloni who was held hostage and released as part of that weeklong truce that led to the release of dozens of former Israeli hostages. But, of course, we know that there are still many more hostages who remain in captivity -- 132, according to the Israeli government. About 25 of those are believed to be dead. But the pressure is certainly rising -- as we are starting to see -- on the Israel government to get another deal to secure the release of those hostages.",

Having said that, they'd obviously have to come out with a win tomorrow. I don't think she has to win. But you've seen a lot of consolidation. You see Gov. DeSantis getting out yesterday. So there's going to be I think a big push to bring this field down to one after New Hampshire.

He won, as you point out, with mid-30 percent support in 2016 with multiple candidates in the field. It's stronger today than it was. And so, for months, he's been in around the mid-40s and so it suggests there's a path here. The challenge, of course, is that as Ramaswamy and DeSantis have dropped out, their voters are likely to break towards Trump.And so I think what's happened is over the course of eight years you have had -- he's had the opportunity to shape the party, to mold people, and to bring people along with him. So he's got a very devoted, dedicated support of voters with him. Nikki Haley has taken a different approach. She's trying to build a broader coalition with moderates and with Independents, which would be great for a general election, which is what's so attractive about Nikki Haley to a lot of people.
