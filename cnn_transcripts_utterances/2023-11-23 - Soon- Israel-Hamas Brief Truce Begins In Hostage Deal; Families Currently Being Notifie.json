      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Kaitlan Collins, live from Israel tonight as this is a special edition of THE SOURCE. We are here on the ground, in Tel Aviv. Hours from now, a temporary truce is slated to begin and desperate families on both sides of the Israel and Gaza border will hopefully get an answer to their prayers. For some, it's an anxious wait that could be coming to an end as Hamas does plan to release at least 13 hostages on the first day in exchange for 39 Palestinian prisoners.Israel has continued to pummel Gaza tonight, but all the fighting is supposed to stop at midnight Eastern, 7:00 AM local. That, of course, what that pause is going to look like if everything goes according to plan, and that is a big if here. The pause is going to last four days and about 96 hours of no fighting between the two sides, and at least 50 hostages will see freedom. A Qatari spokesperson described the fragile pact as the first glimmer of light after 47 brutal days of war.  But the situation remains tenuous here on the ground. As I noted, cameras have been seeing explosions, bursts of gunfire in the final hours before this temporary pause is set to begin. And today, the IDF detained the director of that Al-Shifa Hospital, of course, the largest medical complex in Gaza City. They claim that Israel has been claiming that has been used by Hamas as a military headquarters. I should note hospital officials have denied all of those accusations. Here with me tonight is CNN's Matthew Chance talking about all of this deal. Matthew, obviously this deal has not been a given. We saw it get delayed yesterday. Do things look like they're on track right now based on what you're hearing from sources?",

And the expectation is that, you know, at some point tomorrow, that will start happening. Those releases will start happening.But, you know, it is a very complicated logistical operation. There are lots of moving parts. And we've seen already this week the deadline for the pause in fighting.  Well, the start of the pause in fighting to be moved back 24 hours. It's meant to start on Thursday morning. It's going to be Friday morning now. And, you know, the Israeli military, the IDF, is warning that this deal could change, because it is so complicated. But yes, at the moment, we're on track for the first pause to take place, the first batch, the first group of 13 hostages to be released. And, of course, the -- three times as many 39 Palestinian prisoners in return. And so that's going ahead at the moment. But, you know, the whole country is really waiting very anxiously, very stressfully about whether it actually takes place or not.",

She was 3 years old. But where you are, Kaitlan, today is her fourth birthday, so she is turning four in captivity.Now, the Israeli government has said that they are alerting the families of the 13 to be released tomorrow because they are Israeli citizens. We, at CNN, did speak with Abigail's family earlier today to an aunt, and she said that she had not heard from either the US or the Israeli government. So that may mean -- may, because this is so fluid -- that Abigail will not be among that first group of 13.

You can see them buzzing right overhead. And those have been key -- we've been told by intelligence and military officials -- at tracking Hamas movements, at trying to figure out where those hostages are. So the understanding that they have come to during this negotiation is that, for a period of six hours each day during this pause, those American and Israeli surveillance drones will stop flying overhead. That will give Hamas the capability of moving around, of releasing these hostages, handing them over to the Red Cross without what they view as prying eyes. Now, at the same time, I've been speaking with officials and experts who say, Kaitlan, that even without those drones overhead, that certainly Israel has other ways of peering into the Gaza Strip to keep tabs on Hamas during this pause -- Kaitlan.",

But in cold fact, Israel's strategic mission here is much more important. But if the Hamas effort can help break the morale, can help break the resolve of the Israeli forces, what they really want to do, and this is the real play, is to turn this four-day pause into a permanent ceasefire. Now, I don't think they're going to achieve that at the first iteration, but they're trying to put the onus on the Israeli forces if and when they begin hostilities again. They are playing, I think, a surprisingly sophisticated psychological game here. I don't think this one event is necessarily going to be the alpha and omega.

I didn't see it as limiting it to two months. But part of the psychological campaign, part of the propaganda effort here, is to undercut Israel's ability to get to that stated objective.For example, the Russian Prime Minister Medvedev, said a couple of weeks ago that Israel as an occupying power, which it's not, by the way, in the Gaza Strip, but as an occupying power, did not have a legitimate right of self-defense. Meaning, implicitly, that everything Israel has done since October the 7th has been illegitimate, since it doesn't have the right to self-defense. A senior U.N., quote unquote, \"human rights official\" said the same thing about a week ago. That's going to be part of the argument here to say, you've gone far enough. You don't have to eliminate it. Just sit down and negotiate with them. You can see it coming. And what I worry about is the pause, if it begins in a few hours, is just the opening wedge to achieve that objective.",

If you read in American papers, you can see many of the pro-Palestinian elements of the Democratic Party are saying they want the pause to be transformed into a truce or into a ceasefire.A lot of these words become interchangeable after a while, and that's the objective. And I think Biden recognizes he's got a severe problem because of the schism within the Democratic Party. So domestic U.S. politics are going to play a role here. And if the mood can be shifted talking about the anguish of the hostages, nobody really talks about the 190 hostages who are not going to be released in the next four days. You know, this can have a significant impact. I think, really, the questioning that Medvedev has started off of the legitimacy of what Israel is doing is just going to be amplified. What the Israelis need to do, and frankly, what the United States needs to do is reinforce the legitimacy of self-defense. Permitting Israel in this situation not to minimize the threat, but to eliminate the threat. And the threat really is not just Hamas. Ultimately, think of Hezbollah in the north. For almost the entire seven weeks since October the 7th, they've been shelling targets in northern Israel. All of this under the watchful eyes of the mullahs in Tehran. This is a much bigger conflict than just in the Gaza Strip.",

But in the back of everybody's minds is the specter of the statements that we keep hearing from the IDF. That the minute this pause is over, they plan to return to their primary objective of destroying Hamas, an objective that has resulted in the death of thousands and thousands of civilians. And that's before we factor in what agents -- aid agencies are going to find, right? As you said, they're burying their dead where they can in pretty shallow graves. There's an attempt at, I think, at one large mass grave, but there are fears of disease. The sense is one aid worker we spoke to who asked not to be named for fear of jeopardizing this little window of opportunity, said, I worry that we are walking into hell.

What we do know is it's the end product of weeks of stop and start negotiations and very difficult conversations.Among them are reportedly contentious phone calls that have happened between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They've had more than a dozen calls since October 7 happened. Joining me now for perspective on this is CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger, a New York Times White House and National Security Correspondent. David, great to have you here. You know, as we're hearing -- and he's also the author of \"The Perfect Weapon\", I should note. David, as we are hearing what this is going to look like, what Israel could do at the end of this pause. I mean, do you believe that Israel is going to be facing a lot of international pressure once these 96 hours are up to not restart their military campaign in Gaza?",

Listen, we understand the first two steps of this. I mean, tomorrow, if all goes well and we all hope and pray that it does, that you'll see 13 hostages released, and that will take its way over the next four days up to 50.And there's even the possibility built into the agreement that it could be extended a few days and that you could negotiate some additional releases, although presumably the price for Israel would be higher because you could be releasing then some of the elderly, and then perhaps people begin to be of military aid and so forth. But it's clear Hamas is not going to release everyone because that's their leverage to keep the Israelis from starting up again. And Israel then will face a really vexing choice. Because if it begins the bombing again, as Prime Minister Netanyahu seemed to suggest when he said the war will continue, it will clearly be the focus of a good deal of international criticism. That in the midst of hostage releases or at the end of them, they went right back to a strategy of bombing that the United States has said has resulted in far too many Palestinian deaths. And I think that's the core of the tension --",

But those are relatively small tactical details. The question to my mind and to the minds of many American officials, particularly Pentagon officials, is whether Israel's got a long term strategy here, because think of the big issues on which we still have significant disagreement. First of all, whether they resume the bombing at this kind of level. Second, if they actually achieved their strategic objective of degrading or dismantling Hamas, would Israel for some period of time, run Gaza? You've heard Netanyahu say they would have to. You have heard that Secretary of State Blinken say repeatedly that can't be, that while Hamas can't run it, we need to come up with someone else. And the best idea they have is a Palestinian Authority which can barely operate, as you know, on the West Bank. So we're going to have some big strategic differences with the Israelis ahead. And I just have to hope that the same group that worked out this hostage deal, Brett McGurk, who's the special adviser to President Biden on this, Jake Sullivan, the National Security Council head, have also worked out -- begun to work out with the Israelis, what the longer term plan is.",
