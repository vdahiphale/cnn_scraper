Plus, playing politics with the military, one single senator is so determined to make a point about abortion he's blocking the Pentagon's most senior promotions. And that Republican is here with me, in just moments. Also tonight, I have some new reporting, inside, on Donald Trump's thinking, regarding the Special Counsel's January 6th probe. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, with the window, until the first votes are cast, in 2024, narrowing, and Trump headed to trial, is there still time, for a viable alternative, to emerge? Ron DeSantis is still number two, in the GOP race. But he's trailing Trump, by more than 30 points, in most polls. So, what is the Florida governor's strategy? What is he doing, to turn things around? Blaming the media. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The media does not want me to be the nominee. I think that's very, very clear. If you look at the people, like the Corporate Media, who are they going after? Pretty clear that the media does not want me to be the candidate.

Our whole House, our whole Senate is up. That's what I'm really focused on. And that issue sets really clear. Cost of living has run away from folks. And they're worried about the economy. They're worried about public safety. They're really worried about education. They're worried about behavioral health. I hear it over and over again. And so, we focused on that in 2021. And we put together a really commonsense platform, in order to address these issues. And when I was hired, we went to work. And we got a lot done, even with a split Legislature. With a House controlled by Republicans, and a Senate controlled by Democrats, commonsense prevailed. We cut taxes. We invested a record amount, in education, a record amount in law enforcement. We went to work on behavioral health. We've made tremendous strides. And that's why I'm confident this year that the voters will be very pleased with the work that we've done, in Virginia.",

And Virginians viewed that as way too extreme. And so, when the Roe v. Wade decision came down, I viewed it as a chance, to bring people together, a chance to bring people together, around a bill that would protect life, at 15 weeks, 15 weeks, when a baby can feel pain. And I believe this is the place that we can come together. What I hear from Virginians over and over again is that abortion all the way up through and including birth is far too extreme, and that they want fewer abortions, not more.

Joining me, Scott Jennings, who is the former -- well, Ashley Allison, first, the former National Coalitions Director for the Biden 2020 campaign; and the former Senior Adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell, Scott Jennings; both here with me. We'll get to everything else we were going to talk about, in a moment. But what did you make of Senator Tuberville's comments? ASHLEY ALLISON, FORMER NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN-HARRIS 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well, he is right that there are White nationalists that live in America. But it doesn't mean that the term and definition of White nationalists is not a racist. This is why it is so important that we teach an accurate history, in our country, that we explain to children that are coming up, the history of our country. There are -- we have a torn and tattered and sad history in our country. It doesn't mean though, that I'm not a proud American. But we must be honest about the truth. And what Senator Tuberville is doing is trying to conflate two things to say, \"But if you're an American,\" well, what does it mean to be American? America needs to live up to its greatest ideals. And we need to acknowledge that we have a racist past, towards Black people, and Native American, and Asian American, and Latinos. And yet, we can still become the greatest country, and become -- and sustained being the greatest country. But we have to be honest about where we come from. And we can't do it, when we have people, like Senator Tuberville, who won't acknowledge the truth, about even the definition of what a White nationalist is.",
