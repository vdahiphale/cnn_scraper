Former President Trump campaigned in Montana last night and with his first rally in nearly a week as he railed against his new democratic challenger. Last night in Arizona, Harris and Walz held what the campaign is calling its biggest rally yet, where she doubled down on border security.

Medical officials in Gaza say those targeted were civilians, children and the elderly.Witnesses say they were given no advance warning of the attack. The IDF claims the school was being used by Hamas terrorists and that they took steps to mitigate the risk to civilians. The strike marks the fifth Gaza school targeted by the Israeli military in the last week. CNN's Clarissa Ward and Ben Wedeman are tracking the developments.

Save the Children is saying that this is the deadliest attack on a school since October.Five schools hit in the last week alone. As you said, more than 17 in the last month. Obviously, these schools are not in session, but they are being used as shelters. And the Gaza defense are telling us that basically they think there were 6000 people taking shelter at the Al- Tabi'in Islamic school compound in Gaza City, that there were about 200 worshippers who had gathered in a hall to pray the dawn prayer, the Fajr prayer. When this strike occurred, we have been looking through just really astonishing and horrifying footage, Fredricka, that clearly shows scores of dead, many injured, women and children among the dead. The IDF, as you mentioned, is saying that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were inside the school, were using it as kind of a command center. They're also disputing the casualties, saying that they believe that 20 to 25 militants were killed. Now, we can't say whether there were combatants among the dead, and we can't verify the exact number of casualties. But as I said, we have been looking at some truly horrific footage. And among that footage, we also came across video of one of the munitions used, which is a U.S.-made GBU-39 small diameter bomb. It is produced by Boeing. And this comes, Fredricka, crucially, just one day after the U.S. agreed to release $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel. So, undoubtedly, this is underscoring the necessity for a ceasefire. But also, you can understand how to the people of Gaza, those calls for ceasefire talks really are sounding very hollow at the moment, and many people fearing that this will only do more to damage those talks' chances of succeeding, Fredricka.",

But because this is also something the Israeli warplanes regularly break the sound barrier over southern Lebanon. But over Beirut is really seen as a message not only to Hezbollah, but Lebanon as a whole, a warning not to retaliate for last week's Israeli assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander. Now, regarding reaction to that strike on the shelter in Gaza that killed more than 90 people, we're seeing that Jordan and Egypt, two countries that have peace treaties with Israel, peace treaties increasingly strained as the Gaza war continues. The Jordanians are accusing Israel of systematic targeting of civilians. The Egyptians are saying that this is clear evidence of the lack of an Israeli political will to end this war. Increasingly, there is the feeling even among those Arab regimes that are understanding to a certain extent of Israel's desire to destroy Hamas, to continue with this war. There is a feeling that increasingly the war, the mounting death toll, which is now almost 40,000 in Gaza, is becoming a destabilizing element and that it endangers any possibility of these ceasefire talks that the United States wants to hold a summit on on the 15th of August, including Egypt, Israel, Qatar, the United States, and remotely Hamas. There is a feeling that, for instance, the United States, the optics is they're getting it all wrong, that as Clarissa mentioned, the releasing of $3.5 billion in military funding to Israel just hours before the strike on the school does even more damage to an already damaged U.S. reputation. The U.S., of course, has been talking for months about trying to get a ceasefire in Gaza, get a hostage, get the release of the hostages, but the feeling is it's a lot of talk, but very little in the way of real action to bring the bloodshed to an end.

So far, however, Fredricka, only two victims, two bodies, have been identified, and these are the pilots and the co-pilot, because they were the only ones that were possible to identify through facial recognition. All the Brazilian authorities that we've been speaking with in since coming here have been telling us that the bodies are in such a state that it's impossible for them to recognize them, to identify them.

They're urging the relatives to go to a location in Sao Paulo, an auditorium that has been prepared and set up as a location for them to receive psychological help, treatment, and also to provide whatever information they can to try to identify as many people as quickly as possible. The Brazilian authorities have also told us, Fredricka, that two black boxes have been recovered from the plane, and they hope that these black boxes will be able to explain what really happened up there, because right now, neither the company nor the Brazilian aviation investigation authority have a clue of what could be the cause of such a tragic accident.

She is bold. She is strong. And she is a balanced leader, a balanced leader who is measured and objective in the way she handles things. And above all, she has integrity. And I think those are the qualities that we want to see in our next President of the United States, in which she embodies in spades. And then, you know, just looking at her credentials, you know, going from district attorney to attorney general to senator to vice president, and each of them being historic positions, and now the Democratic nominee for president. You know, you just put credentials up and you know that that's who she really is.",
