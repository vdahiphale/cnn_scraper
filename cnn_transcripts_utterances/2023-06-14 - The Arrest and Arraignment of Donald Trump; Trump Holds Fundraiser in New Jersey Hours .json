There is a concern, I think, for at least the prosecution that there may be something on paper that says, what the president or former president can't do, but no one is there and all those rooms when he's by himself for any defender for that matter.

The first is that we saw the well worn playbook that he is used time and time again, and also, the same language that he has been using for several days now which that these charges are political, that they amount to election interference, but also that he was entitled to take these documents with him after leaving the White House and also that others were not prosecuted for the same thing that he did.Of course, prosecutors in this case say that that's not true. That he took with him some of the most sensitive national security documents and also that his unwillingness to turn them over amounts to obstruction. That is the first thing. The second thing that I found notable was that his tone. He was very angry during his speech and it's something that I know some of his advisers picked up on as well. Yes, he was surrounded by's most sympathetic supporters, his fiercest allies, but you could tell during his speech that there were some underlying anger there. And also, he did not linger after he gave remarks. He did not stay in the crowd and talk to people like we saw him do following his arraignment at the Versailles restaurant in Miami, which is a landmark in the state of Florida. No, he left the stage almost immediately and went back into his club. And the third thing that I found very interesting was the substance of his speech. I talked with some Trump allies prior to him taking the stage, and they told me that they were hoping that it would be more forward-looking. That he would focus on him being a leader of the Republican Party, lay out some of his 2024 agenda items. But he did very little of that. He spent the majority of his speech railing against his opponents, railing against President Biden, and also his 2016 campaign rival Hillary Clinton.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When you look at a part in the issue is less about guilt and more about what is good for the country. And I think it would be terrible for the country to have a former president in prison for years because of a document case. That is something that you would see in a third world country, I saw that at the United Nations. So I would be inclined in favor of a pardon. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

And, you know, if he is convicted, could he face jail time? What does this mean and what does it mean for future presidents moving forward? Is this kind of going to be a new normal?I think the issue with Donald Trump is that he has just done so much to break the norms and in many cases to potentially violate the law. And so, the question is that if you're not going to hold him accountable through the impeachment process, if you are not going to do that, and we saw them go through the impeachment process, twice than what is the remedy? Because the answer cannot be that if you are a president or a former president that you can run around committing whatever crimes you want.",
