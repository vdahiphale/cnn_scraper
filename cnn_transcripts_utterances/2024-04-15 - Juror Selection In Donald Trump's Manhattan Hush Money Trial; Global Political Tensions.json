I'm Wolf Blitzer here in Washington. Aaron Burnett is outside the courthouse in New York City. The former president is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Just moments ago the judge just set another hearing date after prosecutors argued that Trump violated the court's gag order for social media posts attacking various witnesses. Erin.",

So I want to bring in Paula Reid and Phil Mattingly, who are also here talking to their sources and breaking so many of these details. So, Paula, what are you learning about this?

This is a wide array of questions, everything from where do you live, to where do you get your news, to how do you feel about former president Trump. And it appears that what the judge is saying is that if either side wants to ask questions of a specific juror during that phase, that they're going to remove all the other potential jurors. Now that is, the judge says, to help the jurors feel more comfortable, to feel less intimidated. Imagine how intimidating this is, right? You're the former President of the United States. You have a judge, you have a whole army of of lawyers. It's incredibly intimidating, especially if you were in front of, you know, 20 other possible jurors.

And just that's going to be how they're going to actually tell you and listen to what's happening at the sidebar. But instead, if you can turn to where it looks like, instead of that, you're going to have this very limited area instead in front of this judge. You see this? This very limited area over here. I don't think you can get a good view of it, what's happening right now. And in that very limited space, you're going to have multiple people. You're going to have the defense counsel, Donald Trump, a potential juror as well, who will be sitting there. A very, very crowded space.And also, think about this. You're going to have a former president of the United States who's actually going to be not lording over a defendant or a juror, but certainly there to see every single expression you have and breathing down your neck so to speak.  Then you have to think about the fact that for every time they want to ask questions, you've got to clear out a courtroom of people with dozens of potential jurors inside, the logistics of it. Just think about what it's like to get off of an airplane all of a sudden, right? And people have to take their luggage down or get up and they're trying to move around. It's not going to be a very easy process. And so, in this instance, you're going to have the combination of there are different people at the sidebar in front of a husher, which is a device they'll use to say and silence everyone else in the courtroom, having to be close enough to the actual microphone to then not have everyone hear your responses. And imagine the type of questions you have to ask. They're going to have the former president of the United States sitting there while they ask, what are you feeling about how Trump has been treated before? Should a president be criminally charged? Have you attended any rally? Have you attended an anti-Trump rally? Imagine the intimidation by presence and environment alone on those different questions.

And one thing that I assure you the lawyers are doing now, they have the names of the jurors. We won't, but they do. And so, they are allowed to go on social media and look at these folks, because think about how revealing someone's Facebook page or Instagram page can be about them. And so, I guarantee you they're going through those now. And when we look at jury selection in total, it's important to know it's much more art than science, right? You're going to have the facts that the juror discloses. But as a lawyer, prosecutor or defense lawyer, you are analyzing and assessing everything about that juror. If they're holding a book or a magazine or a newspaper when they come in, you're trying to see what's she reading. You're looking at the way they dress. You're looking at their mannerisms.

Now, in a prior trial, he asked each individual juror who made that self-proclamation about why they felt that was the case. Probably to try to understand whether they actually could be persuaded to tell the truth or be impartial. Here he says it's just not logistically possible to do so. But he will distinguish them because of the appellate rights. The Trump team will want to be able to suggest that there was maybe an overwhelming jury pool that was not able to get a sufficient number of people, for the bottom of the barrel in terms of impartiality, and then they were left with these numbers.What is difficult to actually prove, though, is, look, you've got not just the luck of the draw. You've got a body of people who are supposed to be the peers of a defendant. In this case, obviously, it's hard to find a peer of a former president of the United States, sort of Obama and Bush and Clinton. But that's not the requirement here. It's just, are you able to be impartial and put aside your opinions in order to actually follow the presentation of evidence and the instructions. They want to distinguish you to show that, look, here was the amount of people you had available to you. Here's who you chose.

That's going to be baked into the case of any juror's mindset. I think it's possible to get an impartial jury in this case. Even though there have been political reasons, people look at to say the voting practices of different jurors. At the end of the day, the prosecution has to carry their burden. If they do not, you are going to be punished for it as a prosecutor.

It was an extraordinary performance by military personnel from multiple countries, historic indeed. And it sends a rather embarrassing message to the Iranians as to the capabilities of their weaponry. But I think it also sends a message to the Russians, the Chinese and others as to what happens when you have a coalition of Western allies with such a technology and such smooth cooperation.",

If there are sanctions, the sanctions must touch equities that are of most importance to the supreme leader and the inner circle of Iran's leadership. If this is just additional sanctions on Iran's missile programs, personnel, weapons systems and some mid-level officers, this will have no impact on Iran's decision making. I should point out that although there are significant sanctions on Iran's oil program, Iran's oil exports last month touched a five-year high, and it has earned over $40 billion in oil revenue this year, in the last year, because these sanctions aren't significantly executed. So it's not just sanctions, but the type of sanctions and how seriously will we take them.",
