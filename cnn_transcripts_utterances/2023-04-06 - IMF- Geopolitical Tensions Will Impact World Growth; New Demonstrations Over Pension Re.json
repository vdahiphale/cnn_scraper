The market as you can see, having been sharply down, thenpopped up above the parapet, and now I'm a little concerned by that smidgen of red, and whether that continues because of course markets in Europe will be closed tomorrow, so we'll keep a watch on that over the course of the hour. Those are the markets. The events that we're talking about, which are very much market related: Fragmentation is dragging down global growth, warns the head of the IMF, a warning for politicians. French protesters are unleashing smoke bombs at BlackRock. And inflation isn't slowing down this fast food giant, the President of Restaurant Brands International says the company behind Burger King and Tim Hortons, he is with me tonight. We are alive in London. Thursday, April the 6th is the date. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. A very good evening to you. Tonight, the IMF is warning global growth could weaken to the slowest pace in three decades. The Fund expects annual growth of three percent over the next five years, down from 3.8 for the previous two decades. Rising interest rates are a major factor as are geopolitical tensions. The head of the Fund says the long term cost of trade fragmentation could be as high as seven percent of global GDP, and technological decoupling sounds good could cost some countries up to 12 percent. The Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva said these outcomes can be avoided. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Got it. But be pragmatic about it, because what the IMF is saying is, hey, don't try to solve this one problem over here, but then create this other problem over here in terms of yes, sure, if you suddenly start to direct all of your foreign direct investment into areas and regions where values are the same as yours, friend shoring, for example, well, then certainly maybe you gain some political stability, but you also lose diversification and that creates its own host of problems in terms of being more vulnerable to economic turmoil, economic downturns, not to mention the impact it has on our emerging economies.",

LOUIS, REVOLUTIONARY MILITANT (through translator): Violence is no longer on the fringe of demonstration. It's become central to it. In fact, the people have understood that. In protesting calmly, they will get nothing worse, especially from this government. BELL (voice over): But in a worsening cycle of violence, the police is now accused of its own disproportionate use of force.

One brigade in particular created during the Yellow Vest Movement, the Pravem (ph) accused of particular ferocity.

Its unclassified summary is blaming the Trump administration for the deteriorating security. The Pentagon is sending its findings on the controversial troop downgrade now to Congress. And they include details about the attack on the Abbey Gate at Kabul airport. That's where 13 servicemen, U.S. servicemen were killed during the evacuation. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon.

So essentially what the White House did was theyreleased, via the National Security Council, a 12 page summary of what they describe as their perspective on the events leading up to the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And this is complementary to the report that the Pentagon has transmitted today to Congress about lessons learned from that debacle. And so what we're hearing from the White House is really a lot of the same arguments that they have been making over the last several years, which is that the Biden administration was dealt a bad hand by their predecessor, the Trump administration, who they say made a bad deal with the Taliban that required all U.S. forces to withdraw essentially by May of 2021. So the U.S. is now saying -- the White House, I should say, specifically, is now saying that they were left really with no option but to withdraw. Now there are some acknowledgements in this 12 page summary of lessons learned and things that they now feel that they will be doing better in the future; namely, they say, they're going to start evacuations sooner when security environments deteriorate like this. They say that, in the case of Afghanistan, they did not do that because they did not want to erode confidence in the Ghani government. But now they say, look, we are not going to do that anymore. We are going to message aggressively the risks of staying in country. And we're going to start these kinds of evacuations sooner when the environment is so bad like that. And so we're waiting to see, of course, what comes out of this report that goes to Congress. It is classified but, hopefully, some lawmakers will be willing to disclose some of what they have learned. But in the meantime, this unclassified summary released by the White House is really the only public perspective we are getting about what the White House learned from the situation in 2021 -- Richard.",
