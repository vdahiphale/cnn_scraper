His disturbing social media posts, on more on why and how this happened.Plus, New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, pleading for help, from President Biden, as the migrant crisis, in the New York City, gets worse. Federal officials are in the city, tonight. And Mayor Adams is here live. And paradise is burning. Hawaii is in flames, as deadly wildfires are creating apocalyptic scenes, in one of the biggest tourist destinations, in the world. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. A presidential scare, tonight, as President Biden is spending the night, in Salt Lake City, during his first trip, to Utah, since taking office. But just hours, before he arrived, the FBI shot and killed a suspect, while they were carrying out a search warrant, against a man, allegedly making death threats, against the President and other high- profile Democrats. It happened, while they were trying to arrest him, this morning. A source tells CNN that SWAT agents were giving commands, to the suspect, Craig Robertson, when he pointed a gun, at them. President Biden was briefed by his senior staff, on the incident, before he touched down, in Utah. And we should note that some of these threats, from the suspect, here, were posted only days ago, including this one that was shown, in the criminal complaint. He said, quote, \"I hear Biden is coming to Utah. Digging out my old ghillie suit and cleaning the dust\" from my M24 rifle. An agent, on the case, said in the complaint that the suspect did actually own that sniper rifle, and the camouflaged suit. And these pictures were posted along with it. A witness to the raid described what she heard, early this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All of this happened, this morning. And the big questions now, what happened, when agents moved in, to arrest the suspect? And how do the Feds tell the difference between bluster, and what is a deadly serious terror threat? Let's get some answers, from CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Correspondent, Shimon Prokupecz; and CNN National Security Analyst, Juliette Kayyem. Thank you both for being here.

I'm standing at a marina, because, of course the other way that you can get there, is by sea, which the sea, as you can see, is incredibly choppy. It is very windy, right now. But there have been many expedition boats that normally take people to go out whale-watching, they have been loading their boats up with supplies, from volunteers, who had just showed up, at this marina, as well as distributors, local businesses, who're bringing pallets of water, dog food, mattresses, anything that people over on the other side of the island might need.

So, well the boring explanation is, it is not uncommon, for prosecutors, around the country, to send search warrants, to social media companies, for public content, just so they could have a good strong chain of custody that they can prove in court, this was something that was said.As you've pointed out, the things President Trump tweeted, on January 6, have been widely reported on, in the media, have been screenshotted and such. But what the prosecutor is going to want is the ability to pull up a witness, from Twitter, who could say definitively, \"These tweets came from this device, at this exact time.\" And that includes the three that were deleted. So, one of the key things that have happened here is that when President Trump's account was reinstated, by Mr. Musk, after his takeover of Twitter, the tweets that were most inflammatory, on January 6, did not exist. And so, I think part of it might be also going into Twitter's database, to get evidence of those tweets, and to prove that was President Trump himself that sent it. I think it's another complication about this account, is it's pretty widely believed that over time, many different people have had access, to the realDonaldTrump account, because you'll see the things that are obviously written, by President Trump, and the things that seemed to be written by aides or campaign workers. And so, what they'll want is the data that only Twitter has that proves this tweet was written, on this phone, at this time, at this location, which should be strong evidence that it was President Trump himself that typed it out.",

There could be drafts of tweets that he wrote, and did not send, things that he wrote and deleted, right before, or that are still kind of in his drafts folder.There's also the possibility of those Direct Messages. Although it's pretty widely reported that President Trump didn't use DMs, too often. So, I don't see that as extremely likely. I expect this is mostly about being able to prove it was President Trump himself, and not one of the many people, who at some point, had access, to his account that sent those tweets that are of interest to the Special Counsel.",

So, there's a couple of things going on here.First, there was the gag order that was attached to the warrant, which turns out to be a pretty common practice, by prosecutors that they do not want the subjects of investigation, to know they're under investigation. It has been a very controversial practice. Because what's happened over the years is the case law has developed that the only person, who can really challenge a search warrant, is the person, who's targeted themselves, not the companies. But if the person, who's the target doesn't know? Then they can't go fight it. And so, there is a long history here, of tech companies, fighting in court, to say, \"We want to drop this gag order, so that we can give this person a fair chance of fighting the search warrant.\" In fact, when I was at Facebook? That happened multiple times. I got involved in multiple cases, where we made that argument, in cases, where we thought the gag order was not necessary. The second thing that that's going on, is kind of the overall idea here is that the Special Counsel wants to be able to maintain the integrity of this data, possibly also including the integrity of data, on President Trump's phone. And I think that's one of the interesting questions that hasn't been asked is, does this indicate a broader search of devices? Are there other search warrants that we don't know about yet that would go with it? So, that would be a normal part of a prosecution, for this kind of electronic evidence, is you would not just be looking, in the cloud, but you'd be looking at the devices, because they will have other pieces of data that aren't available to Twitter. As for the fine, Twitter did fight this. But they also just had mess- ups. If you look at the appellate record --",
