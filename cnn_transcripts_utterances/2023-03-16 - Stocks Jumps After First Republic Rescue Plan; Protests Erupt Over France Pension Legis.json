It has been a rocky few days. We are in the green. As you can see we started down in the negative. It has all got to do with those regional banks. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events: A rescue to shore up confidence. Some of the world's largest banks provide a lifeline to a smaller rival. The European Central Bank plows ahead with a half-point rate rise. And Macron forges ahead with pension reform, but without Parliament. Live from Dubai. It is Thursday, March 16th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very Good evening. Great to have you with us. Tonight, Wall Street soared on news that the largest US banks offered to help a struggling mid-sized lender. My First Republic shares popped on that reports that the bank would get a $30 billion lifeline. They closed, as you can see, almost 10 percent higher. The US Treasury Department said 11 banks are depositing the money into First Republic. It was facing a crisis of confidence after the collapse of Signature and Silicon Valley banks. The news seem toed ease broader market worries. The S&amp;P 500 rose more than one-and-a-half percent on the day. We've got green across the board and earlier Thursday, the US Treasury Secretary said the American banking system is sound. Janet Yellen spoke to the Senate Finance Committee about the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and she said the government response shows that the system will not be allowed to fail.

They are coming to the rescue of First RepublicBank, which is a San Francisco based regional lender that has come under enormous pressure over the last week or so because it fits some of the same characteristics as Silicon Valley Bank, the California bank that collapsed just about a week ago. And so First Republic Bank's shares had been down this morning. At one point, it was down 36 percent, but everything turned around on these rumors of a rescue, and now we have the confirmation, 11 of America's biggest banks, they are providing $30 billion in deposits. Now, this is designed to give First Republic some additional financial firepower to meet demands from customers for withdrawals. And also, it is designed to really bolster confidence in the system. Now the 11 banks providing this cash, these deposits -- Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo -- they're all providing $5 billion a piece. On top of that, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, they're providing two- and-a-half billion dollars in uninsured deposits each. And then below that, we have been BNY Mellon, PNC, State street, Truist, and US Bank, they're all providing another $1 billion each of uninsured deposits. If you add it up, you get $30 billion, and the banks put out the statement and they say that they are deploying their financial strength and liquidity into the larger system where it is needed the most. They also say that the banking system has strong credit, plenty of liquidity, strong capital, and strong profitability. They said: \"Recent events did nothing to change this.\" So Eleni, this is just a very interesting, very significant development. We had the Federal government coming in and rescuing depositors over the weekend, and now, the banks themselves are coming to the aid of one of their rivals.",

There were a lot of concerns about the regional banking sector, and markets turned around as soon as reports of this deal came out. You can see First Republic closing up 10 percent. US regulators, they are welcoming this news. They put out a statement announcing this $30 billion rescue, and they said: \"This show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system.\" And the Federal Reserve itself put out an additional statement reiterating that they stand willing to provide liquidity to the banking system, and that the discount window remains open. So, it is really interesting that we are seeing officials on both sides of the Atlantic trying to bolster the banking system, whether it's the Swiss National Bank coming to the rescue of Credit Suisse, or now we have the banking industry and US regulators welcoming this rescue. Clearly, a lot has changed in the last 10 days or so. We've learned just how fragile confidence can be in the banking system. The question now is whether all of this is enough? Whether the efforts from regulators and from the banks themselves is enough to sort of put out this fire and restore the trust that really had been eroded by these bank failures.",

People aren't sure what other vulnerabilities might come to light. Investors are certainly on a hair trigger, looking out for that. And there are questions swirling still around Credit Suisse. You know, an JPMorgan analyst came up today and said that they think the most likely scenario for the bank is that they will eventually get taken over. They don't really see that they're going to be able to complete this turnaround on their own and what the Swiss National Bank has done in terms of funding this credit line is just not going to be enough. So there is potentially more volatility and more turmoil ahead. But for now, certainly, the European stocks rallied towards the end of the day of the back of what happened in the US, and it seems that for now, potentially, we might see a little bit of stability come back, but we just don't know, Eleni.

Good to see you. Dramatic scenes right now in France, where the government has sparked anger by raising the retirement age without a full vote by lawmakers. Several thousand People have been out on the streets of Paris, with police firing water cannon on some protesters after a fire was lit in a central square. It comes after the government pushed a Pension Reform Bill through without the votes in the National Assembly. The bill raised the French retirement age from 62 to 64. So, that's two years. Jim Bittermann is in Paris for us. Jim, without a vote, this sounds like a political gamble for those that made this decision and it is coming with consequences within Parliament and also out in the streets.",

And out on the streets, of course, like you said, there were protesters who had gathered in front of the National Assembly gets to kind of watch and look on as this vote was supposed to take place. And when it didn't, they started protesting. The protests continued for some hours. The protesters moved over to the Place de la Concorde in the heart of Paris, and the police as you mentioned there, they used a water cannon and teargas to finally disperse the crowd. So it's just some evidence of the kind of outrage that is still out there in the street, and we're going to perhaps see more of that later on and in the next week, because the unions, a Joint Union Committee has gotten together and they've decided there's going to be a big day of strikes and demonstrations next Thursday in France -- Eleni.",

The UK joined theUS on Thursday banning TikTok from devices used by government workers. The US is also threatening a further step, saying it may ban TikTok from the US entirely if its Chinese parent company doesn't spin off the app. China says there is no proof that TikTok presents a security threat to the US or any other country. Sara Fischer is following the story from Washington for us. Sara, fascinating. You know, this isn't the first time that we're talking about banning TikTok. I remember in mid-2020, it was a hot topic, and this is really fascinating seeing the app being removed from government officials' phones. Can they ban this app?

The news yesterday, a TikTok source confirmed to me was that CFIUS has sort of backchanneled to TikTok executives that they plan to ban the app unless TikTok sells to a US company, and so it does appear that unless TikTok can broker that deal, they do risk being banned, at least here in the United States. And by the way, that would mean off of all devices, not just government devices as you mentioned. They are now banned from government devices in the UK and Canada, and that is something that we are discussing actively here in the US.",

So you're saying that it's hard to spin off the US app, but at the same time, you're saying, oh, but wehave separated it from the backend so that the data is secure and I don't think TikTok can really have it both ways. But I think in terms of what actually can be done technically, and practically, if you think back to 2020, TikTok had started to broker a deal to spin off the US app. If you'll remember, they were in talks with Oracle, with Microsoft, with Walmart, et cetera, so it is confusing to me as to why they aren't able to technically do it now if they said that they weren't able to do it then. The other thing that's a little bit of a missing piece in this whole equation, to me is that TikTok has a lot of private investment. You have companies like Tiger Global and Softbank that have invested billions of dollars into this company, and they are desperate, sources tell me to get their money back, they want to return. So why aren't -- why isn't the ByteDance company trying to spin out the US division to liquidate their investors? To me, that's the big question. And you know, the only reasonable answer one would think is because China does not want them to spin it out. They like having that access. And then it goes back to of course, they like having that access because they potentially have access to US user data, trends about how we consume content, et cetera and that's the National Security concern.",

So there are two features that make it very interesting. There is a third one that this is a reactor that potentially could also recycle, that means burn fissile material that is the waste material from classic nuclear plants.

Get off gas from the heating part and you know, heat pumps are now in demand in most locations in Europe. So if we reduce the use of gas and fossil fuels in these two very large, energy consuming sectors of our economy, our life, then we can spare gas for industrial use, which is really critical for some industries, and therefore make use in a wiser way of the residual fossil substances that we still need until we find a different opportunity. So how can Europe get more secure on its fossil fuel imports? Reducing that volume, and that can be done acting on these two fronts -- electricity production and heating.

Nevertheless, this is a pretty clean case when we see that it was specifically the banks that had the loophole and then the tailored, as it was called, supervision from the Federal Reserve were the ones who got in trouble, meaning it's not all the small banks. It's a specific group of large but not considered systemic banks. The $100 billion to $700 billion size, that that's where the problem was. Similarly, we saw that there was no problem in the money centered banks, they survived a bunch of real world stress tests these last few years. So I do think it was a specific regulatory and supervisory mistake.",
