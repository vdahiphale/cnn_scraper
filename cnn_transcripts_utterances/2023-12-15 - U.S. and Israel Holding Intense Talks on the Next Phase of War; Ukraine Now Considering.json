Ahead right here on \"CNN Newsroom.\"High level talks underway right now between Israel and the United States as Israel's official says, the days are numbered for the leader of Hamas. The unimaginable devastation in Gaza. Now CNN gets a firsthand look inside one of the few hospitals with space left for patients. Plus, the European Union is considering an expansion which would include Ukraine, but that means for future aid requests as the country's war with Russia rages on. Now the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees warns that social order in Gaza is teetering on the edge of a possible implosion. More than two months into Israel's war on Hamas, the World Food Program says half of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are starving. UNRWA commissioner-general Felipe Lazzarini says huge crowds of hungry people are stopping U.N. aid trucks as they cross into Gaza and helping themselves to food. He says that's making it nearly impossible to get aid further into the area and imperiling future deliveries. Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official says that Israel is working to eliminate the highest-ranking Hamas leader in Gaza, who it accuses of masterminding the October 7 attacks. The U.S. official says, quote, \"it's safe to say Yahya Sinwar's days are numbered.\" CNN's Melissa Bell joins me now live from Paris. And Melissa, we know that Biden's national security advisor is in the region. He's meeting with top Israeli officials, including the president right now. This comes as the U.S. is applying the pressure on Israel to de-escalate. What is the latest from these talks?",

He's met not just with the Israeli war cabinet, but with Mossad leaders as well to get a clearer picture of what's been happening on the ground in Gaza. With those cracks appearing between the positions of the Israelis and the Americans, first of all, in the question of the phases of this war, the United States urging Israel to move to a different phase, a lower intensity phase, and one that relies on intelligence for targeted strikes against Hamas rather than the bombing campaign that we've seen so far, the aim of the United States to limit civilian casualties.But there's also disagreement, Kristie, on the question of what happens after Hamas. And Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to that just a couple of days ago, speaking to that difference of view. The United States, we understand, and this has been part of Jake Sullivan's message, that the Palestinian Authority should have regain control over the Gaza Strip after this is finished. And that is something that for the time being the Israelis have ruled out. And that is likely to be very much at the heart of the discussions between Jake Sullivan and Mahmoud Abbas when he makes his way to Ramallah later today. We've also been hearing from American officials, as you mentioned a moment ago, that it is Yahya Sinwar who is one of the biggest aims of the Israelis right now. It is just a matter of time we understand before justice is served. He is very much the target of the Israeli campaign as they seek to make progress inside the Gaza Strip. Kristie.",

Melissa Bell reporting, thank you.Now our colleague Kaitlan Collins spoke earlier with Mark Regev, senior advisor to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the situation in Gaza and just how far Israel plans to take its fight against Hamas. And here is some of that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK REGEV, SR. ADVISER TO THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Well, we have to fight this war. It wasn't a war that we sought, but it's a war that we've been forced to fight and we have to win it. Because leaving Hamas in power in the Gaza Strip is just to condemn us all to more bloodshed in the future. Hamas says openly that they would repeat the October 7th attack again and again and again. Their words, they would continue to try to butcher our people. And frankly, Kaitlan, Israelis just refuse to live any longer with this terrorist threat on our southern border. We will, as our defense minister said, we will eliminate this terror threat and so Israelis do not have to live in fear, terrorists crossing the frontier and butchering their children. No one should have to live like that. We refuse to live like that. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE SOURCE WITH KAITLAN COLLINS\": But what about the scenes in Gaza? I mean, I understand Israel's purpose with Hamas. I mean, that's been made quite clear.

And this is part of a humanitarian effort that Israel is facilitating, that Israel is supporting, that Israel is encouraging other countries to get involved as well. We want to see, as we pursue Hamas, who is a bitter and brutal enemy, we want to see a maximum humanitarian effort for the people of Gaza, that anyone who has been injured in the crossfire between the Israeli Defense Forces and the Hamas terrorists, that there'll be medical support for them, other humanitarian support. We understand that's part of our values, part of our moral values, but we also understand that this is also successful counter-terrorism. We've got to show that our enemy is only the terrorists and that we will do what needs to be done to support the Gazan civilian population. COLLINS: Well, I should note that field hospital that Clarissa visited, the doctors told her there it is the only one in that area that has any hospital beds left and has very few left. But let me ask you about CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has been using in Gaza since October 7th have been these unguided munitions, they're known as dumb bombs. Would that not undercut the claim from Israel that you were trying to minimize the civilian casualties given the very nature, the imprecise nature of these weapons?",

Of course, the United States continues to be Israel's biggest backer. Turkey is one of its biggest critics. And when you read the two respective readouts of this call, it's remarkable how little crossover that there is. In fact, there's no clear indication from those two documents that they really agreed on anything.President Biden, according to the White House version, says that he made clear the United States stands by Israel's right to defend itself. The Turkish version says that Erdogan pushed the United States to withdraw its unconditional support in order to get a ceasefire. And part of the fundamental problem here, Kristie, is that the U.S. and Turkey simply view Israel and they view Hamas also very, very differently. And one example that illustrates that is the conversation that I had with Erdogan's chief advisor for foreign policy and security this week. And I asked him about unconfirmed reports that the leader of Hamas himself was actually in this country on October 7th when the Hamas attack on Israel began. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Frankly, it was very unexpected that he didn't veto the decision to allow Ukraine to move towards its next step on the path of European Union membership.It all happened in a fairly surprising way. We understand that the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after going through all of Orban's arguments against Ukraine, taking this next step bit by bit he presented him the idea that actually Orban could just leave the room and be absent from the vote so therefore he doesn't have to be a part of it, he can sell that back to his domestic audience but yet the E.U. can continue with their plan to bring Ukraine closer into its fold and that's ultimately what happened but then Orban did decide to block this 50 billion euros earmarked for the future of Ukraine's economy, not to mention other lethal aid packages that are being discussed. So essentially what we're seeing this week, as far as Volodymyr Zelenskyy is concerned, is a big diplomatic and symbolic win. But there was disappointment leaving the United States, and now there are no tangible, cold hard cash commitments going to him at this stage. So that is going to be delayed until January, which will be a really key moment for Ukraine, Kristie. But it's a historic day. We know that Ukraine wanting to become closer to the European Union was a large part of what Putin was resisting back in 2014 and with his invasion of Ukraine.

We had that commitment from the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz doubling down on his allotment of funds to Ukraine for aid and lethal aid. So all of the countries can do that individually. But the trouble with that is it just isn't the same kind of guarantee. It's not the sort of long-term commitment that would be offered by this 50-billion-euro injection, which would ideally be used over four years and would make Ukraine feel more solid in terms of sustaining its economy over the next year. So that's been postponed until January. Maybe it will be a more palatable decision for Orban to make, not to veto it then, not to block it then.

At the same time, we have about 130 Israeli hostages who are still being held inside the Gaza Strip by Hamas.Sometimes, those two objectives and how do we get them back? Those two objectives at times might appear to contradict one another. But we have to remember, like you said, Kristie, is the prime minister trailing in the polls, losing support. He wants to shore up that support because the assumption in the political system here is that there will be an election highly likely in the aftermath of when this conflict ends and for him to climb back up, he needs to appear to be strong. He needs to regain that position of the Mr. Security, Mr. -- I can take care of America. I can run the country without hesitation. And right now people don't see that. One of the ways to potentially do that is to stand up to U.S. and international pressure. And my fear is that this could lead us to an unnecessary crisis with the Americans, right? We've seen how Joe Biden has fair, for the most part, stood up strong alongside Israel, made a historic visit to Israel, has supplied Israel with munitions and supplies and equipment that it needs is pushing through Congress a $14 billion aid package for Israel, has not called for a comprehensive ceasefire like some other world leaders have called for, and on the contrary has said, I don't want Israel to stop. Israel needs to take out Hamas because they have no right to continue to exist after the horrific attacks of October 7th.

So this is going to be a continued question and cloud that will hoverabove the decision-making apparatus that's making these decisions throughout the conflict and the war. Let's also just throw into the mix, Kristie, is the fact that There are mounting calls for many of the leaders, not only on the security side, but also on the political side, to step down in the aftermath of the intelligence debacle and the massive failure that led to those Hamas attacks on October 7th.
