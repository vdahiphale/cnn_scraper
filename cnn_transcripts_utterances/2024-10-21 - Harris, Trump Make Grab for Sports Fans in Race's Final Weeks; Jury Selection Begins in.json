Now, the way that these documents were classified, a large number of people would have actually had access.But one of the two documents was a scan from a printed briefing book. And so that could give investigators a bit of a leg up because they can track who's actually printing things. But no doubt, there was some significant secret information here about what Israel is doing. It talked about the movement of their missiles, of their Navy, of their Air Force, and their nuclear weapons, which, guys, Israel doesn't even acknowledge exist.",

Vance served as bartender ahead of the Packers game in Wisconsin. Meantime, the DNC is going with the 10,000-foot approach, with pro-Harris banners and skywriting messages like this one above NFL games in battleground states. Let's get some insight on this collision between politics and football with CNN sports analyst and host of the Right Time podcast, Bomani Jones. Bomani, great to have you, as always.

But also with some of the appearances that Harris made, that reaching men and young men, it seems to be a goal right now with both of these campaigns. And it's a pretty easy, logical through line to decide that sports is the way to go about doing it.Like that, I mean, keep in mind, the Democratic campaign started with getting Tim Walz on there and calling him coach like he's a coach right now.

So then it gets you to your next question.Who is it that puts Antonio Brown on stage and is like, you know, this is going to impress people? I could be wrong. I just feel like the people who hear Antonio Brown talk about politics and not along with it are probably not people who are going to go and vote.

So far, 58 of 86 prospective jurors have already been dismissed. But by the time that they are done, they will have selected 12 Manhattans who will have something in common with all other New Yorkers.The fact that they likely ride the subway almost every day, that's something that all of us can relate to here in New York City. And that is going to be key because that is, of course, where this incident took place. They are going to try and put that jury as if they were inside that subway car. Now, Daniel Penny is the Marine who, as you said, was riding the subway on that day last year. He saw Jordan Neely, who was also on the same subway car, and he says that Neely was acting erratically, that he was screaming, that he was shouting, and that he was saying he was not afraid to go to prison. So Penny felt that he was going to hurt someone, and he decided to take action. He put Neely in a chokehold. He brought him down to the floor, and he held him there for more than six minutes until he stopped moving, he stopped breathing, and Jordan Neely died. Now, Daniel Penny is facing manslaughter charges and criminally negligent homicide. And much of the prosecution's case is going to hinge on this video, on the witness statements that were in the car. While the defense is going to try and argue that there was panic and fear in that subway car that Penny was responding to. We know that some people reported being afraid, while others said that it was just another day on the city's subway. So that is going to be a key element of this, and really an encapsulation of a key issue here in the city, which is crime in the city's subway and public safety -- Boris, Brianna.",
