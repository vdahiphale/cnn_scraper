I do want to get right to our breaking news this hour. The U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has resigned her post, just over a week after a failed assassination attempt against Donald Trump, and just a day after appearance on Capitol Hill. She faced bipartisan calls to step up -- step down after a roof-top gunman was able to fire several times on the former President. Cheatle was grilled by lawmakers from both parties on Monday at the House Oversight Committee hearing. A new hearing is actually happening today. The U.S. House Homeland Security Committee is speaking to police officials from Pennsylvania. The Secretary of Homeland Security and Cheatle declined their invitations to testify today. This as the House is set to launch a bipartisan task force to lead its own investigation of the shooting. With more on the breaking news, CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider joins us now from Washington. And Jessica, I wonder, have there been any responses to her resignation so far?",

He gave a multi-paragraph glowing statement about Director Cheatle's service, in particular to the Secret Service. She has been with the Secret Service for a total of 29 years, and he spoke very glowingly about her commitment to the Secret Service, as well as praised the work of Secret Service agents on an everyday basis.But then, of course, on the other side of the aisle, we're hearing from House Oversight Chairman James Comer talking -- reacting to this resignations, saying that there will be more accountability to come. He says the Secret Service has a no-fail mission, yet it failed historically on Director Cheatle's watch. And he has continued to say that while Director Cheatle's resignation is a step toward accountability, we need a full accounting of how these security failures happened so that we can prevent them from going forward. Director Cheatle's resignation does come 10 days after that assassination attempt on the former President at his Pennsylvania rally. And Jim, since then, there has been not only this growing criticism, but also the beginning of investigations from multiple different agencies, both on Capitol Hill, also with the Inspector General's Office. There is a lot of question as to how that shooter was able to get on the roof, not far from where the former President was speaking at his rally, fire off a shot that came very close to the former President. And then there is also questions about the Secret Service and their communication. Local law enforcement did notice this would-be assassin, why was there such a time lag between when they noticed and why was nothing done about it? So, there have been a lot of questions related to all of the likely security lapses that happened, and then obviously growing calls for investigation, growing calls for the resignation of the Secret Service Director, which we have just seen this morning. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, she has been in the role for two years, and this morning stepping down, Jim.",

If you want to fix the problem, then fix the problem. Don't just point fingers. Finger pointing has never fixed anything.

Harris has already cemented her spot as the presumptive Democratic nominee, quick to secure the backing of thousands of Democratic delegates. The Vice President visited campaign staff in Delaware for the first time at the top of the ticket. She touched on her time as California's district attorney and delivered a preview of how she will go after her opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, &amp; U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.

It's a very quick collection of endorsements from sitting lawmakers, and it's the delegates. I mean, that's a lot to happen in less than 48 hours since President Biden stepped down. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yeah, and it speaks to the level of relief the Democrats have that the long Biden process was over. They were getting very uncomfortable with it. I had a story Saturday morning, a day and more ahead of Biden's announcement, that had one well-known Democratic operative saying to me, \"F\" it, I am coconut pill, referring to the online meme there. I just want this to stop. So, that is where a lot of Democrats are, and you see that. It is really astounding that, as you say, 48 hours ago, Joe Biden was still the presumptive nominee, still in the race.

Good to have you both on. I want to begin, Julie and Lanhee, with just very basic questions. Julie, I'll give you first dibs here. Is Kamala Harris a strong challenger to Donald Trump? Is she stronger than Joe Biden? JULIE ROGINSKY, U.S. DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, she is stronger than Joe Biden because she is able to take the fight to Donald Trump in a way that unfortunately, sadly, the current President has been unable to do. She is the complete antithesis of Donald Trump in every way. And so, if you're trying to draw a contrast both politically and personally between Donald Trump and the anti-Donald Trump, she is the woman to do it. So, I'm very excited and energized by the fact that we now have somebody who is able to carry that message forward and draw that contrast, which has been sorely lacking, unfortunately, despite my love of the current President, sorely lacking in this current election.",

In your view, is she a stronger challenger to Donald Trump?LANHEE CHEN, U.S. REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Look, I think she has got a higher ceiling in a lower floor. And I guess I would say that the potential for her to do better than President Biden is there. The potential for her to do worse than President Biden is there. And I think that anytime you're running a presidential campaign, you want to limit the variability as much as possible, right? You want to limit the factors that will influence resource allocation decisions, for example. And what this does is it does force both campaigns, but particularly the Trump campaign, to examine everything, where they're running TV ads, where they're sending their candidates, the kinds of arguments they're going to make. Even though I think broadly speaking, the American people are concerned about the same things, it does force a reexamination of these questions. And so, I don't know that the Trump campaign would see it as being more challenging. I do think that it creates a whole new dimension of work that wasn't there before.",

And whatever polls were done, even hypothetically, thinking about a Trump-Harris matchup, what you have not done is seen her as an actual candidate yet. She is going to get a lot of grace. She has gotten a lot of grace, I think, in the last 24 to 48 hours. But now, the hard work begins. And I think any poll that you're looking at probably won't be able to tell us that for at least another week, even if people put them in the field right now, it's not -- I don't think anything that I wouldn't necessarily look at.I think Lanhee made an excellent point about the fact that she does have a higher ceiling and certainly can compete potentially in the places that you mentioned, plus the Midwest. She also is at a lower floor, as he pointed out. I think it's a great point to make. And so, we'll see. But, we don't know yet.

They've been divided, dejected over the last month or so, as they are trying to grapple with Joe Biden staying at the top of the ticket. What it really meant for their efforts to keep control of the Senate and try to take back the House, both of those were really in serious doubt with Biden at the top of the ticket. Now, with Harris, it adds a different dynamic. They still don't know how difficult of a campaign this will be for them. But, certainly, with elements of the Democratic base, with more enthusiasm, they believe they now have a much better chance going ahead.Now, Republicans on their side are still trying to figure out their strategy. They are trying to attack her, namely over some of the more unpopular aspects of the Biden administration, over immigration, in particular what's happening at the border. And one of the aspect to that is still remains outstanding is how Republicans deal with this on the legal side. The Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, yesterday told me that perhaps there could be lawsuits in individual states to try to deny Kamala Harris from getting onto the ticket. That is unclear exactly what state laws will be in violation. He did not specify that. But, that is one thing that Republicans are examining how to do -- use the courts to their advantage. I asked the Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries about that Republican strategy, and he told me this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): It is such a laughable proposition. It's a laughable proposition. The extreme MAGA Republicans are in total meltdown mode right now. I mean, you almost feel bad for them because they continue to embarrass themselves. It's laughable that they're threatening frivolous litigation. It's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. Secretary -- Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has resigned, just over a week after a failed assassination attempt against Donald Trump. The resignation coming as no surprise. At the House hearing on Monday, she faced fierce bipartisan criticism after, you'll remember, a rooftop gunman was able to fire multiple times on the former President. President Joe Biden has just in the last several minutes thanked Cheatle for her service. A new hearing is happening today. The U.S. House Homeland Security Committee is speaking to police officials from Pennsylvania. This as the House is set to launch a bipartisan task force of its own to investigate the shootings. CNN National Security Reporter Zachary Cohen joins us now from Washington. Zachary, can you give us a sense -- as this investigation gets underway, you will have the Hill investigation. You will have an internal Secret Service investigation. What they're focusing on, in particular? I mean, is the focus given that you have local law enforcement officials on the Hill today, in part that division of responsibility between Secret Service and local law enforcement?",

And you're exactly right. One of the core issues that's been identified already during today's hearing, but also through sources that we've talked to that are familiar with the investigation, is the breakdown of communication between local law enforcement and the U.S. Secret Service that were on the ground, involved in the planning, ahead of Donald Trump's rally on July 13th, even up to the moment when officers on the ground did see the gunman on the roof.How is that communicated? Why was that not communicated before Donald Trump took the stage? And why was Donald Trump not prevented from taking the stage once a threat was deemed to be present at the rally? Those are the communication issues that really lawmakers are trying to hone in on, and even in during today's hearing, lawmakers making very clear that the responsibility for those failures lies solely with the U.S. Secret Service, a much different tone than what we heard yesterday during the House Oversight hearing where Director Cheatle was grilled for over six hours, where she had to take accountability for the failures themselves as well, calling it a colossal failure on the part of the Secret Service and a personal failure. In addition to that, we're seeing the fallout in her resignation today. But, the Oversight continues and the effort to prevent this from happening again also continues.",

Authorities in Gaza say nearly 100 people have been killed, including at least two dozen children. Israel says the operation in Khan Younis is targeting Hamas militants and their weapons and infrastructure sites. [11:40:00] The trouble is, so often, civilians get caught up in this conflict in enormous numbers. A journalist working for CNN filmed this video of the mass exodus, some people fleeing on foot, carrying what they can, others on donkey carts. Journalists say some people were shot at as they evacuated. Well, the Israeli Prime Minister says conditions are ripe for bringing home all the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. He made those remarks in Washington, as he met with hostage families, insisting that Israel is putting quote \"very strong pressure on Hamas for a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal.\" One hostage relative tells CNN, it wasn't a dialogue, saying that Netanyahu spoke to them but did not really address their questions. There has been a lot of frustration like that from hostage families. The Prime Minister is now gearing up for a major address to Congress tomorrow. He is also set to meet President Joe Biden on Thursday. The date of that meeting had been fluid after Biden's COVID diagnosis. Prime Minister Netanyahu will also meet with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. We're joined now by Jerusalem Correspondent Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, can you give us a sense first of what is happening in Gaza right now? Because, yet again, Israeli incursion, a large number of Palestinian casualties, this despite pressure from the U.S. President and others.

They then issued evacuation orders for parts of eastern Khan Younis, which were previously part of this expanded Al Mawasi humanitarian zone, effectively tightening and making smaller that humanitarian zone that exists there.But, the United Nations is raising enormous concerns about the way in which the Israeli military did this. They called the evacuation orders confusing. And they also say that the evacuation orders were issued at the same time as the Israeli military was already beginning its offensive in those very same areas, as they were increasing the intensity of their attacks. And that seems to be part of the reason why we have already seen nearly 100 people killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, amid this renewed Israeli military offensive in Khan Younis. And the people who are being forced from their homes, in addition to those who are being killed and injured, many of them are people who have already been displaced multiple times in the Gaza Strip. We have seen these images of thousands upon thousands of people fleeing this area over the course of the last couple of days, trying to head somewhere for safety. And in listening to these people, not only are they terrified, but what we're also hearing is a lot of anger, anger at Israel, anger at the Arab world for not stepping in, for not doing more for them, and also anger at Hamas, with some people who were fleeing this area blaming Hamas militants for their predicament and also accusing them of remaining safe in underground bunkers, while they are above ground facing bombs and bullets.",

Really, that moment highlights some of the tension that's existed between this administration and Netanyahu throughout this war.Now, the Vice President and her team, as this conflict has played out, one thing that they have really been focused on is trying to discuss what happens in Gaza after this war ends. So, that is something that she certainly brings to the table in these conversations, as they are trying to look at the path forward beyond just when a ceasefire would be struck. Now, it also comes at a time when the Democratic Party was facing significant pushback from some parts of the party, including young voters, Arab American voters and Muslim voters, regarding President Biden's handling of the conflict in -- between Israel and Hamas. That is something that really has plagued Biden's campaign. It'll be interesting to see how Harris might navigate that going forward.

Now, you ask, what should be done? Who should be responsible? That question was actually put on the survey, who is responsible for your own online safety? And overwhelmingly, the response was from 67 percent of those surveyed that they feel it is their own responsibility. The majority felt that they should get better education. There should be programs to help bolster your own digital safety in that sense. But, you'll see that 11 percent do think that tech companies have the responsibility here as well. And we actually asked, which platforms are you most likely to experience online harm with? You can see Facebook there at 72 percent, followed by Instagram -- sorry, WhatsApp and Instagram. All three of those owned Meta, and then you have TikTok. CNN reached out both to Meta and TikTok, and they pointed out that they already have a number of measures in place to try and limit the amount of online harm that is spread and shared with young people and vulnerable people. Meta also gave us a direct comment, saying they work with experts closely, including Plan International, who helped do the survey with CNN. And so, this is an ongoing project.
