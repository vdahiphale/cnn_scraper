The attorney general's office in New York says it will rest its case after her testimony. The former president spent hours in court yesterday. And his performance signaling what's to come as his legal problems and the race for 2024 collide. Let's take you to West Palm Beach now with CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's been covering the Trump campaign. Kristen, Trump is set to hold a rally tomorrow. He's trying to counterprogram that third Republican presidential debate. Obviously, some contentious moments on the witness stand yesterday. Have you heard from his team about what we might expect? Is that testimony going to come up tomorrow night?",

As you'll remember, she stepped away from any kind of politics after he left office.She and her husband, Jared Kushner, live in Miami. They don't work in politics. And really, for all intents and purposes, are not around Donald Trump very much. And that is how many people around Ivanka have said they want to keep it. So we have not heard that. But I have heard from sources close to Donald Trump who said he's been particularly angry that his children have been involved in this case, that they are taking the stand. Of course, they will be watching to see what happens tomorrow.",

Now, to be clear, she was a defendant in the case initially but they ultimately, for statute of limitations issues, because the claims against her were pretty old, so they had to take her out. So she is appearing as a witness.Now, I say all that to make the note that she certainly has information about the functions of the Trump Organization. And what prosecutors are trying to get at in this case in general is who knew what about how the Trump Organization kept its files, valued properties, kept its bookkeeping and so on. So she may have something to say, even if she's not one of the people who's personally held responsible in the end.",

There's a really fine line between what an individual can say and what they can't. And particularly a candidate for office. So for instance, if he were to say, \"I am innocent and assert my innocence,\" and frankly even \"the whole system's aligned against me,\" you could probably get away with that. Now, if you say I'm innocent, the system's aligned against me, and the judge is a Socialist who kicks puppies, that's probably going to cross the line. Now, there's grayer areas than that. But any court is going to have to use a scalpel, not a hatchet to carve up statements that step up to but not over the line. He will probably do that. It's been his sort of M.O. beforehand.

And even if he does, it's generally not in a defendant's interest to testify because he can step in it and get himself into trouble. The reason why he testified in this case, he really kind of had to, Boris, because of the fact that the judge had already found that there was fraud in the case. They've largely already lost. It was sort of a bit of a Hail Mary, you had to put the defendant on the stand to just try to talk himself out of trouble. Doesn't look like he did yesterday.

He was walking toward that officer. And -- but there were a group of officers behind him. One officer with a taser.
