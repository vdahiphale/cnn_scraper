France and Morocco hoping for everlasting World Cup acclaim Croatia. We England fans especially truly feel your pain. And from the U.S. Central Bank a softer economic landing remains its same. The hope is today's rate hike will be a little more team which really is the waiting game for both Fed watchers and game watchers. Today the World Cup semifinal match and today's Fed action beginning at exactly the same moment 2 pm Eastern time, five hours from now. In the meantime, U.S. futures with a change to Europe stocks are softer as you can see slightly there as we wait. It follows U.S. gains though on Tuesday and a positive tone set across Asia so a little unchanged here for the U.S. stock market futures. A less aggressive half point Fed hike appears a virtual certainty, especially after Tuesday's a softer consumer inflation read, but a lot of course is riding on rate projections for next year, which will also be released similarly, inflation information from the U.K. too. Price rises there easing from 41 year highs to a year over year rate of fewer than 11 percent, last month. That's still a huge ouch, but fresh price hikes for food and drinks at restaurants and pubs while cup gatherings have clearly been taking a bite out of budgets later in the show. We'll also hear from the largest restaurant chain in the world that's Yum Brands. So think KFC and Pizza Hut. The CEO David Gibbs will join us to talk about the global inflation challenge and their growth plans too. We spoke Tuesday at the New York Stock Exchange as you can see there. Also today, Sam Bankman-Fried, Former FTX Chief has been denied bail in the Bahamas and is set to remain in custody until February. All this after a damning hearing into the FTX collapse on Capitol Hill Tuesday with the current head of the firm calling the scandal a case of \"Plain Old Embezzlement\" the U.S. Senate kicks off its FTX hearing one hour from now. And the probe into whom on Capitol Hill benefited from millions of dollars in FTX political donations is just getting started. With apologies to Shakespeare, Sam Bankman-Fried what a tangled web he allegedly weaved much more on this story in just a few moments. But first, Ukraine suffering a new wave of drone attacks on the Capitol, Kyiv, but President Zelenskyy says Air Defense Systems prevented further damage to the power grid.

Some people were up already and getting ready for work when they heard that very, very distinctive sound of the drone engines followed by explosions. One of the drones actually caused, you know, a huge hole in the side of a building there was damaged people have their apartment windows shattered. And yet Remarkably, the Ukrainian Military says that in this drone attack on Kyiv, the first in a number of weeks here in the central area, there has been no significant damage to the power grid on top of what they're already dealing with. There are rolling blackouts continuously affecting people who live here in Kyiv. And affecting people who live all over Ukraine the power grid is far from stable, it's going to be quite some time, as crews continue to work to try to repair these facilities. That is continuously damaged by these Russian attacks. Weaponizing winter targeting the power grid trying to make civilians lives miserable as the temperatures plunge ever colder and the official start of winter is just days away. Even though in this instance, the Ukrainians did shoot down, they say 13 drones fired from Russia. These are Iranian made drones that explode upon impact. There were incidents just within the last week where some of the drones did make it through. For example, in the Southern Ukrainian region of Odesa, 1.5 million people were plunged into darkness last weekend, when out of 15 drones that were launched by Russia, five of them did hit their targets. They are certainly welcome news here in Kyiv that the reporting by CNN that the Patriot missile defense systems will be arriving at some point in this country. But of course that comes with its own set of challenges and risks including threats from the Russians. That this will make NATO and the United States complicit in escalating this war.

Well, the government is now saying that you don't need them to enter most public places. So I don't need to scan my code. It feels surreal though, that I can literally just walk in. So she said I can only do online delivery so you can't even sit inside or order inside and Shake Shack. So outside the Starbucks they have a sign saying you need to show a 40 hour COVID test. Even though the national rules don't require it in Beijing, you still need a recent PCR test in order to enter restaurants, gyms, and entertainment venues. The way less places now to get COVID tests of the city and the lines are short because most people are just staying at home but just a week before access exact same location. This was packed with people waiting in line. So behind me is a graveyard of COVID testing booths. It's like almost overnight in Beijing. They removed all of these testing locations and here are the remnants. After years of harsh lockdown, the government is finally letting people manage their own health, but people don't feel ready and experts say the country isn't either. The country hasn't vaccinated enough of the elderly population and hasn't improved the health care capacity enough. So this reopening it's going to continue to be messy and uneven.

Qatar was not named by the Belgian prosecutors as the country alleged to be buying influence in the EU. It has been widely named in media reports and by some EU officials, for instance from the checks. We have this from Qatar, they say the State of Qatar categorically rejects any accusations of misconduct and they go on to say they think these claims are baseless and gravely, misinformed. Now all this hugely damaging for Qatar not least they are hosting the World Cup right now and allegations of course of human rights abuse. We know that as recently as November 21, Eva, Kaili, for one actually defended Qatar on that front in a plenary session. Its interesting looking back at her comments now and the reaction from the EU has been one frankly, of shock. We had the President of the European Parliament earlier this week, saying that the institution is under attack. We you know, several offices in Strasburg have been sealed up by those investigating all this going on.

The judge said that she had no decision or she had no other way of putting it. She felt that SBF had accessed too much money and therefore he was a flight risk. And as you said at the same extradition hearing, SBF told the court that he was going to fight extradition to the U.S. And you can kind of understand why if he's found guilty of the charges in the U.S. Bankman- Fried faces up to 115 years in prison. At that very same extradition hearing the 30-year old also told the court that he is taking several prescription drugs for a number of health issues including depression as well as insomnia and attention deficit disorder. His attorney was concerned that if he was denied bail and was remanded to prison that he would not be able to access some of these prescription drugs. The judge in the end said that he was going to have access to a lot of these medications once he was taken into custody. Again, right after that hearing yesterday, he was allowed some time with his parents and as well as his attorneys, but then he was brought to this prison here, where he's expected to remain until at least February.

It's also played a crucial part in the COVAX initiative shipping over 1.8 billion COVID vaccines around the world. And now it's looking to the future and beyond the emergency response to the pandemic from 2024 and that date matters. Gavi plans to end support for vaccine delivery in 38, middle income nations. Though the 54 poorest nations of the world will still get access and help with delivery costs. The priority for the next year is on targeting at risk populations and boosting coverage overall. Joining us now is Gavi CEO, Dr. Seth Berkley. Dr. Berkeley, it's always a pleasure to have you on the show. I have to say, it's not often board meetings like this managed to break news and the details here the timing, the dates are vitally important to understand. Just explain what your future plans are? DR. SETH BERKLEY, CEO, GAVI: Well, first of all, just to thank you for having me on again and to say that the critical issue here is we want to make sure the world is continued to be prepared for COVID outbreaks. I know most people are tired of COVID and tired of the virus, but the virus I don't think is done with us. And so the critical issue here is how we make sure countries continue to get their coverage up, but particularly to focus on those high risk groups. So in 2023, we will continue the work we've been doing up until now working with each country to get their vaccines up, but also to do boosters. And the good news is we're at 81 percent coverage of health care workers and 66 percent in the elderly, that's really too low. So this is going to be the focus. And what the board meeting was discussing is should we be thinking about a longer term program? And the answer is we don't know yet what the epidemiology is? But the idea would be that we would certainly continue through 24 and 25, providing vaccines for the lowest income countries. And for the higher low income countries, the ones you talked about, the idea would we would still make vaccines available. We would provide some subsidy for them, but we would have them cost share those vaccines, but no decision is firmly being taken. That was what the board was discussing. We will now go out and talk to countries, as well as trying to understand better what the epidemiology is? Are we going to see a set of future waves going on as we've seen over the last few years? And how does that affect countries desires to have vaccines?",

And by the way, the point here is even in 24, and 25, we will still provide some financing. You know, we may even provide full financing if it turns out that makes sense, but now we need to sit down with countries and have those discussions, what are they want to do? What does it look like on their side? What are the barriers to them? And lastly, the critical thing here is we've seen routine coverage dropped by about 5 percent over the last two years. We need to get that up. And one of the reasons it's dropped is because people are focused on delivering COVID vaccines. We need to make sure they deliver COVID vaccines and routine vaccines.

We have three public health emergencies of international concern right now, COVID, m-pox, as well as polio. And of course, we're just finishing an Ebola outbreak in Uganda and Cholera outbreaks across the world and so it has become more challenging for countries. And the good news is countries have built resilient health systems, resilient immunization systems, but we really have to beat those up so that they're prepared to provide interventions whenever it's necessary to try to control these infections.

The bad news was we had a lot of nationalism, and therefore, countries were shutting down and not sharing and so we ended up if you look at Africa. Africa absorbs a lot of vaccine, it has a large population and yet only 0.1 percent of the world's vaccines are made on the African continent. So rightly African leaders said, well, yes, it's true that there's enough vaccine around the world, but in an emergency, we have to have the capability to produce our own and so there is an effort now to try to build capacity.

But of course, we're a team that is looking forward, not backwards.
