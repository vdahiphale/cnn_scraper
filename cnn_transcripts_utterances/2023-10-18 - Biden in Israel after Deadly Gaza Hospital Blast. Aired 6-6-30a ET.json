All of this because of what happened at that Gaza hospital and because of the anticipation of Israel launching a broader assault on Gaza. It is an incredibly tense moment, and as you know, Phil and Poppy, part of the reality is, part of the problem is President Biden was walking in thinking that he was going to be able to show he was meeting with the Israelis, as well as with Arab leaders, including the leader of the Palestinians. That meeting, of course, was canceled because of the hospital attack. So while he says he'll be speaking to them on the airplane, that is a huge blow. It is a blow to what his efforts are here. And it is -- you really can't underestimate the significance of the fact that those people and those images you saw, it was after dark when that hospital was struck. It was hours later, 11, 12 a.m., 1 a.m., 2 a.m. When we saw those protesters come out all through the night, it wasn't as if they woke up in the morning and decided to do it. They got up, and they went out in that moment. And that should give you a sense of the intensity and the passion here.",

      "sentences": "I mean, there's no question this feels like a watershed moment in this already gruesome conflict. We've been speaking, Erin, to doctors on the ground, some of whom were at that hospital.They say that on October 14, there were two Israeli hits very close to the hospital. They also said that they received a phone call the day afterwards from the IDF telling them that they should evacuate from that hospital. They're using that to bolster their argument and their conviction that this was, indeed, an Israeli strike. They point to the fact that they do not believe that a rocket attack would cause that kind of damage, would cause that kind of death toll. They also have been describing just gruesome scenes, Erin, some of which we have seen borne out in videos of the horror, of the aftermath of this explosion. Body parts strewn across the entire area. They said that basically people had been taking shelter in the Al Ahli Baptist hospital, that they had been, many of them, sleeping in tents in the garden of the hospital. This is a common thing during times of heavy bombardment in Gaza. People flocked to hotels. People flocked to hospitals. They believed that those areas are largely safe. They set up camp there. They wait for the situation to improve. Obviously, in this case, we're seeing now hundreds dead. It is still unclear what the exact number is. The efforts to try to sift through the wreckage and identify how many people have been killed continues. But at this stage, as you say, the focus now is very much on the reaction, on the fact that for many Arab states, this is now becoming a national security issue in their own countries, because people are horrified. People are angry. People want revenge, and they are taking to the streets. And we have seen protests erupting all throughout the region. So, this becomes a real challenge, as well, even for allies of the U.S. I think that's partly why you have seen Arab leaders cancel this meeting with President Biden, because it just becomes too difficult for them to be seen as tacitly endorsing anything coming from the U.S. or Israel in this very, very contentious moment. One other thing to mention: the U.N. secretary-general has come out and said, listen, there needs to be an immediate humanitarian cease- fire. So far, no indication that that might be in the works. We have been hearing heavy strikes continuing throughout the morning, Erin.",

And Kaitlan, we heard Biden appearing to agree with Israel, right? And that they were not responsible for the deadly hospital explosion is significant. It seemed he went further than his national security officials. So -- so how significant is this, what he exactly said?",

He had not been on the ground for very long, Erin.He had greeted the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the airport, and then he made his way here to this hotel that I'm standing in now, where he is having his slate of meetings, the very few meetings that he is having while he's on the ground here in Israel. And it was one of the first comments that he made, and it was incredibly significant, because the president took the time as he was seated one-on-one there with Netanyahu, with their national security officials by their sides, to say that, based on what he has seen, he said it was the other team, and he specifically said,, \"not you,\" referring to the Israeli prime minister. Of course, that is greatly significant, because he is endorsing Israel's denials that they are responsible for the explosion that happened at that hospital in Gaza. Now, Israel has denied it. You have seen Palestinian authorities blame the Israeli -- Israel Defense Forces and to say that they are to blame. Israel has strongly denied that. So it is significant to see the president coming out and saying that, endorsing those denials. But what I'll note is that he said \"the other team,\" which, of course, raised a lot of questions of what specifically he was referring to. We asked him those questions. I was in the room as he was having this meeting with the prime minister. He did not clarify, of course, that. And the other big question is, what it is that he has seen that has led him to endorse these denials by Israel that it was them who is responsible for that explosion at that hospital in Gaza. He had only just been on the ground here for a very short period of time and had not had any meetings behind closed door with Israeli government officials, but he had been on Air Force One traveling with his own national security team, his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who was in the room. So that is still a key question here. And of course, that is going to be something that is hanging over this entire trip as the president is moving forward, a trip, Erin, that I should note is looking a lot different than what the White House thought it was going to, even just 24 hours ago. I mean he'll be here. He's about to have a meeting shortly with the newly-formed wartime cabinet. And then he's going to be meeting with the families of victims, the families of hostages, first responders who were there on that horrific day here in Israel as that attack unfolded. Of course, he is not going to be going on to Jordan to have meetings with those other world officials. That is incredibly significant and certainly a setback to what the president was hoping to do. But key questions still remain of what the deliverables of this trip will look like. Is it humanitarian aid? Is there a certain -- as they were trying to ward off this turning into a bigger regional conflict, those are the key questions that still remain here this morning.",

They use that, first of all, to conduct strikes on that area. You want to kill the enemy. But it also shows you the trajectory of the round, because that's how the Iron -- the Iron Dome works. You pick up this trajectory somewhere along its route to knock down the rocket. In this case, they've got several rockets coming out of this area on several trajectories. One of them goes right out of the hospital. This is -- Or right over the hospital. This is pretty good evidence, in and of itself, but it's not enough.

And just seeing some of the films that were shown this morning, there were pockmarks on the side of the building. That's an indicator of a blast of a rocket, but there's no craters there. And the IDF, to try and make their point, is saying this is what a bomb crater looks like here and here that are coming off of aircraft. The other thing that's important is what I don't think they did say, is if the IDF is aiming for a hospital with their precision rounds, they're going to hit it. They're not going to hit the parking lot. They are going to hit the building. And what you've seen inside of the building with and outside, again, this is the site of the original fire so the round probably hit somewhere in here and then what the IDF shows is the hospital here with the fire in the parking lot.
