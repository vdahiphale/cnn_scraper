Also on top of that, we don't necessarily know if there is a genuine authentic willingness on the part of Benjamin Netanyahu to actually bring this conflict to an end.

      "sentences": "Well, clearly, the discussion focused on the Gaza Strip, on Lebanon, and also, of course, on thepotential for Israel to carry out these retaliatory strikes against Iran. And potential is maybe, you know, pretty soft given the fact that Israel has said that they will indeed retaliate. And we have seen in the past that the United States has been closely consulting with Israel in anticipation of these kinds of attacks. There's no question that one of the main focuses, though, as Kylie was just saying, is this of notion of seizing this window of opportunity to try and reach some kind of a hostage and ceasefire deal to wind this war down in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. But in recent days, what we have really heard from the Israeli prime minister is continued defiance, vowing that Israel will continue with this war, that Sinwar's death does not mark the end, even though he did say it does mark perhaps the beginning of the day after Hamas. But he did make clear that Israel will continue to press forward until victory. And that is clearly the perspective of many of his right-wing allies who are keeping him in power, some of whom I was with yesterday as they were calling for Israel to actually create settlements inside of the Gaza Strip. And then, of course, beyond that you have the actions that the Israeli military is carrying out, which gives us a sense of where the Israeli government's thinking is right now. And we have seen nowhere in where the Israeli military is acting, whether it is in Gaza or in Lebanon, that Israel is in any way taking its foot off the gas. In Gaza, we have seen a series of deadly strikes. We have seen very little aid get into Northern Gaza, even as the United States is calling on Israel to ramp up aid getting into the Gaza Strip. And in Lebanon, we saw just today this latest deadly strike right next to a hospital, a major hospital in Lebanon, Rafik Hariri University Hospital. At least 18 people were killed there, including four children. And so it's very clear that the Israeli military is continuing to keep up the military pressure on Hamas in Gaza, on Hezbollah in Lebanon, and, of course, we are seeing that many of these strikes are also coming at the cost of civilians. In that strike that killed 18 people in Beirut, we saw that four of those were children. Zain, Bianna.",

So we have Secretary of State Blinken in Israel. We have U.S. Envoy Amos Hochstein in Lebanon, both pushing for some sort of resolution, some sort of off-ramp here to both hot wars at this point, both also representing a lame duck president. It's notable that the leader of Hamas is now dead and the leader of Hezbollah also has been killed. And still, it doesn't look like there's much hope for an imminent resolution to either conflicts. In your view, which one do you think is closer to at least coming to a temporary ceasefire at this point?",

Just give us your thoughts, because Antony Blinken is expected to really reiterate this idea that the U.S. is going to halt military assistance to Israel unless Israel does more to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. I mean, obviously, this has come up multiple times before over the past year.

The -- what you're referring to is a letter that Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent the Israelis a week ago saying that unless there's a dramatic increase in aid, the United States would start suspending military aid to Israel over 30 days. That was about a week ago. The Israelis have three weeks until the United States takes some action if the Biden administration is good to its word. I see the 30-day period as one in which the Israelis are likely to try to press their advantage as much as they possibly can to destroy as much of Hamas as they possibly can. They are laying siege to Jabalia in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, and preventing humanitarian aid is actually part of this strategy.",

I don't think whatever the intelligence that was leaked is going to change the Israeli mindset here. It's not a question of when, it's not a question of if, but when the Israelis will strike.

      "sentences": "No, it's a great question. And I think also it's very clear that both campaigns, the Trump campaign and the Harriscampaign, really see Hispanic voters as a key demographic, particularly Hispanic men. And this also comes down to what their strategy is in this final two-week stretch before November 5th, which is really any votes they believe that they can siphon away from the other side or turn out, perhaps first-time voters, low-propensity voters, who they believe, you know, even if it's just a small number compared to the overall vote. They really do believe that these demographics, these core demographics that they're targeting, like Hispanic men, could make a difference on the margins. That's why you see him doing this roundtable today. I'd also note that Donald Trump has actually canceled a lot of these types of events in recent weeks because he has such a packed schedule. There's some reporting that, of course, he's very tired since he's been traveling so much. But this is one he kept. So I think that just underscores how important they view Hispanic voters right now. Now, during that roundtable, and this gets to your question, Zain, about why is he being successful. You know, he gave off his normal pitch. He talked about the economy. He talked about issues that he believes that community cares a lot about. He claimed that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party is moving towards socialism, something that some of Hispanic voters, particularly those who have maybe traveled from South America, are worried about. But one thing he also talked about, and this was him veering off script a little bit, was about the border. Particularly the southern border, and of course the issue that Donald Trump always discusses and paints a dark picture about, which is that he believes undocumented immigrants in this country are committing crimes and stealing jobs. Now, you would think that normally that type of messaging, that hardline rhetoric on immigration may not play well with Hispanic voters and particularly many people who are immigrants themselves. However, when I am on the campaign trail and when I talk to Donald Trump's senior advisors, they acknowledge that that's actually an issue that they do care a lot about. That particularly immigrants who have gone through that process and are in the United States legally, they care a lot about immigration. So that's part of what this messaging has been to try and target that key group of voters.",

The downside to that, of course, is you have to question whether Cheney is that influential to many Republican voters. She was driven out of the party that was transformed by Trump. She is a hark back to a more hawkish, conservative, internationalist Republican Party, which doesn't really exist anymore. Most of the people that share her views have been driven out of it. But nonetheless, the Harris campaign believes that there are Republicans voters, especially women, some of whom have voted for Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor in the Republican primary, who might be out there and be persuadable.
