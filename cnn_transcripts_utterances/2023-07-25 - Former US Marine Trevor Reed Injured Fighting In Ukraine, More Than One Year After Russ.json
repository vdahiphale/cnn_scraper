Also tonight, Dr. Sanjay Gupta on the new research showing the potential side effects of wildly popular new weight loss drugs like Ozempic. Good evening. It has been more than a year since we last mentioned the name Trevor Reed on this broadcast. Reed was the former US Marine detained by Russia for more than two-and-a-half years until a prisoner swap was arranged by US authorities in April of last year. His parents had worked hard to keep his plight in the public's mind and obviously, were thrilled he was finally released. Well, today we learned that Trevor Reed at some point decided to go to Ukraine and fight against Russian troops. We don't know his motivation. Was he inspired by Ukrainians resistance to an invading army? Or did he see this as a way to strike a blow against the Russian leadership which held him unjustly in prison?  Details are scant at this moment. We do know he was injured during the fighting and has been flown to a US military hospital in Germany. The extent of his injuries is not known. At the time of his release, Reed was said to be in poor health. His father had said he had suffered a broken rib during his captivity, also that he was coughing up blood, possibly the results of a tuberculosis infection. Reed had also engaged in two hunger strikes to protest his treatment. Our chief national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto joins us now. Do we have any more details on how or why Reed ended up in Ukraine roughly 15 months after being released from Russia?",

There are a number of former American servicemembers who have done that and former service members from other Western armies who have gone to join Ukrainians in the fight. But I will tell you this, Anderson, that the Biden administration is deeply concerned for two reasons here. One, it does not want to give any impression that the US is sending or encouraging Americans, particularly former military -- members of the US military to go fight there, but two, also they're concerned about ongoing negotiations for Americans still held wrongfully by Russia, including Evan Gershkovich, but also, of course, Paul Whelan.",

As I said earlier, it is partly about not wanting to escalate the war in Ukraine. They don't want Russia to believe that the US is deliberately sending former servicemembers there. But also the idea of someone being released at great effort from Russian captivity, through negotiations, a prisoner swap then going back to fight, they are concerned that Russia would use this as propaganda points, and I think you heard some of this in the statement from the administration today.

But tonight, we do have a clearer picture of what may have been going on in the Kremlin in the early hours of the incursion by Wagner forces. It comes from \"The Washington Post,\" their headline: Putin appeared paralyzed and unable to act in first hours of rebellion. Shane Harris shares the byline of that story, he joins us now. Shane, can you just walk us through your reporting of what happened in the Kremlin during the first hours the Prigozhin rebellion because it paints a very different picture of Vladimir Putin than people are used to seeing or believing? SHANE HARRIS, INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, that's right, Anderson.  I mean, really even to put it succinctly what happened was not what officials were expecting to see, which is namely that Vladimir Putin was not apparently giving orders that were then traveling down the chain of the military command to local commanders and security officials who would have been trying to stop Prigozhin on this lightning strike that he was making up north to Moscow. And as sources described it to us there was paralysis and indecision coming from Moscow and from the leadership. CIA director, Bill Burns said last week that Russian leaders appear to be adrift as this incredible scene was playing out. So really kind of a picture not of a Russian leader in command, but one that was indecisive and potentially afraid to try to counter Prigozhin, this warlord who he has depended on so much in the war in Ukraine.",

I mean, we all watched as Prigozhin really directly challenged and tried to undermine, I think Putin's rule and authority when he said his beef was with the military leadership and the defense establishment, but really, that's also a shot at the Russian president himself.And now to see that essentially, there was silence and indecision, people down the chain waiting for Putin to tell us, you know, what do you want us to do after he had gone on national television and talked about trying to squelch this rebellion. It is very much at odds with that portrait that he portrays of someone who is in total command, who demands authority, who demands loyalty. This seemed to be somebody who was, you know, on his backfoot, and really not clear on what exactly he wanted, and not even sure that he had a plan for how he wanted to counter this uprising.",

So at least in that initial phase, it does seem like this is someone who is getting ready for some kind of attack. But then these orders on what to do after that never really come, and then of course, we all sort of watched as Prigozhin stopped and this deal gets hammered out with the president of Belarus. So still things that we don't know about that, in particular, and why Prigozhin ultimately stopped. But Putin did have some warning that this person who he had come to depend on was potentially going to make a move, and as we saw, he did in the military headquarters in the south of Russia, and then turned his sights on Moscow.",

But not every cardiac arrest is caused by a heart attack. And a heart attack, in an otherwise vigorously healthy 18- year-old athlete like Bronny James, would be extraordinarily unlikely.

And some users tell CNN they're still living with side effects almost a year after they stopped taking it. According to the latest data from the maker of Ozempic, doctors were writing around 60,000 new weekly prescriptions for the medication as of April. CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins me now. So, what more do we know about these new concerns?",

That's essentially what it is.But what they found, and they looked at both these drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, and they found that they had symptoms of nausea and vomiting. That's typically what people -- they don't feel well. With Ozempic, about 20 percent nausea, 9 percent vomiting. Wegovy, higher, 44 percent nausea, 24 percent vomiting. Again, that is the specifics of the types of symptoms that people are complaining about. But it all relates to the same thing. It all relates to that decreased emptying of the stomach.",

Does there -- is there still enough of a reward of this medication in terms of its effect on diabetes, in terms of its effect on weight loss to outweigh the risks? And that's something the FDA is talking about.Now, one thing I will say is that diabetes itself can also cause gastroparesis or stomach paralysis. So how much of it is the drug? How much of it is diabetes? That's something else the FDA is going to look at. At a practical level though, anesthesiologists have weighed in on this. You know, you're not supposed to eat before you have surgery, right? The reason you don't eat is because you don't want food in your stomach. What the anesthesiologist, the American Society of Anesthesiology is saying, you should stop these medications at least a week before surgery, so that you're not accumulating food essentially in your stomach that you could potentially aspirate during an operation. So that's a practical note there.",
