In northern Syria, residential buildings are now reduced to mountains of rubble. Officials in Damascus say close to 300,000 people have been forced from their homes, but that's only the part of the country which is under government control.Buildings are still crumbling as far south as the outer suburbs of the capital, and with overnight temperatures plunging, mosques are now being used as shelters for the homeless. Amid the desire of the grief, though, there are moments of joy. 62 hours after the region was rattled by a 7.8 magnitude quake, two sisters were pulled to safety from under debris in southern Turkey. The UN reports the quake damaged road leading to the only humanitarian corridor from Turkey into Syria has reopened. Spokesperson at the crossing says they've received the bodies of about 300 Syrians from Turkey being sent back to Syria for burial. There has been no sign of aid, no sign of any assistance. Meantime, Twitter is once again working after it was shut down for almost a day by the government because of critical tweets. Mean tweets. More than a dozen people were detained over those mean tweets. The shutdown impacted rescue workers and aid groups which used Twitter to coordinate relief efforts. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan traveled to the disaster zone Wednesday defending his government's response to this disaster, admitting some initial shortcomings. He now says the situation is under control. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): As of now, a total of 21,200 personnel of the military, Gendarmerie and police are on duty in hate. Despite this, some dishonest people campaigning in Hatay are making false statements saying there's no one in Hatay.
