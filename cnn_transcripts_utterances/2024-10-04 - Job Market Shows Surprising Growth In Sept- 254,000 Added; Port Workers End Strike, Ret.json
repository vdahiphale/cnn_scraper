And a tentative deal has ended the port strike that threatened to damage the economy. Thousands of longshoremen are returning to work today. We're going to have more on that in just a moment.But first, let's get straight to CNN's Matt Egan to break down these latest job numbers for us that the Biden administration is applauding this morning.

First, the porch strike ending suddenly, and now these jobs numbers that came in much stronger than expected, 254,000 jobs added in September blowing away forecast.This is a very healthy number in any environment, but especially now because there's been all these concerns that maybe the jobs market is slowing down. But when we look at the trend, we can see that actually hiring is accelerating. The third straight month of faster hiring, this was actually the most jobs added since March. Now the unemployment rate was expected to hold steady. Some were bracing for an increase. But look this, it went down to 4.1 percent. That is historically very low. University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, he described these numbers to me as, quote, incredible, fantastic, and the kind of numbers we dream about. When you dig into the report, we can see that hiring was strong across many different sectors, leisures and hospitality, retail, government, all of them adding jobs. The only blemish was manufacturing, which lost jobs. Wages, they accelerated. That shows strong demand for workers. Paychecks are now growing up, are now increasing much faster than prices. That is very good news. So you put all this together, Pamela, and it paints the picture of a very resilient jobs market, much more resilient than people were expecting.",

Tens of thousands of dock workers at ports along the East and Gulf Coast are back on the job after a three day strike. If their walkout had continued, it could have had a widespread impact on the economa -- economy. CNN's Beth -- Vanessa Yurkevich joins us now. Vanessa, how did this tentative deal to end the strike come together? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there were growing economic pressures, growing consumer pressures and growing political pressures to get this deal done. And ultimately yesterday, according to our colleague, Kayla Tausche, President Biden nudged his economic advisers to put pressure on U.S. MX, which represents the ship lines, to put a better offer, a better deal on the table to try to get these workers back on the job. And one of those economic advisers was Lael Brainard. She spoke last hour about what this deal ultimately entails. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Part of a new filing looks at the Trump campaign's alleged efforts to create chaos at polling centers around battleground states. Prosecutors allege that the campaign used aggressive tactics like angry protesters claiming voter fraud in places like Philadelphia to force confrontation with election officials and so doubt about the voting and -- and where it was going, which they then used to claim his supporters were denied access to observe the ballot count.I want to bring in Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein. He was the deputy commissioner -- commissioner in 2020. Hi, Seth, thanks for coming on. So these scenes described in the Jack Smith filing that I just laid out of, do they align with what you experienced in Philly in 2020? Bring us into that. SETH BLUESTEIN (R), PHILADELPHIA CITY COMMISSION: Yes, thanks for having me, Pamela. And they do, unfortunately. I was at the Pennsylvania Convention Center throughout the ballot counting process in 2020, overseeing the staff who were there to count the ballots. And the building was surrounded by protesters that entire week.",

It's a little bit more remote than where the Convention Center was, so it's going to be harder to access for a lot of protesters.We put security around that warehouse a little bit further out than right at the door.
