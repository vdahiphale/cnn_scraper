Polls show Donald Trump still has an edge and is in a better place than he was in 2016. And by some metrics, 2020 still the race in the key battleground states as tightened between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, which is not where we were just over a week ago. Before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, you might remember back then, all of eight or nine days ago, battleground states were slipping out of Biden's reach. Democrats are sounding the alarm that even second and third tier purplish blue states good fall to Trump, including New Hampshire and New Mexico, Virginia, and even Minnesota. That internal Democratic polling document we told you about two weeks ago at the Republican convention had Biden with only a 0.4 percentage point advantage in Minnesota, 0.4, Minnesota. Now, according to a Fox News poll, shows Harris up by six percentage points in Minnesota. Nonetheless, Donald Trump, who is in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Saturday night, told his supporters this falsehood. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If they don't cheat, we win this state easily. Okay? They cheat. They have no shame. They cheat. Do you understand that you crooked people? They're the most crooked. They cheat. They cheated in the last election and they're going to cheat in this election, but we're going to get them.

And yes that even includes when Ronald Reagan won landslide Electoral College victories. Do we have -- we have those 1980 and '84 maps handy? Look at that. That's the 1980. Let's all see that sea of red. And then on top at the top in the middle there, that's little Minnesota. That's blue. One of the very few states in 1980 that did not vote for Reagan. In 1984, Minnesota besides D.C. literally the only Democratic holdout in the Reagan landslide of 1984. Trump himself lost to Hillary Clinton in Minnesota by 1.6 percentage points in 2016, the year he won. And he lost to President Biden there in 2020 by seven percentage points. And yet, Trump, who has also never won the popular vote and lost the electoral vote in 2020, is out there saying that if he loses Minnesota, it's because of cheating. It's not true. And more importantly, we have seen this movie before. We know that lies about election fraud are not harmless. When Trump falsely claimed repeatedly that the 2020 election was rigged, his fervent supporters believed him. And this is what those lies wrought. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
