This as President Biden is heading home from Israel right now after showing support for Prime Minister Netanyahu and the war against Hamas. The White House just announced the president will discuss the U.S. war response during an address to the nation tomorrow night. Back in Washington, U.S. House remains paralyzed at this critical moment after Jim Jordan lost a second vote to become speaker of the House. Jordan says the third vote is tomorrow even as he faces growing opposition within his own party. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're following the volatile and very complicated aftermath of that deadly hospital explosion in Gaza. The U.S. offering a more detailed and definitive assessment that Israel was not responsible. And President Biden just weighed in aboard Air Force One as he flies home from his very high-stakes trip to Israel and prepares for a primetime address to the nation tomorrow. Our correspondents are covering all the breaking news in the Middle East as well as here in the United States. First, let's go to CNN Anchor and Chief Correspondent Kaitlan Collins who's joining us from Tel Aviv. Kaitlan, tell us more about the president's Oval Office address tomorrow night and what he's saying now about his trip to Israel.",

      "sentences": "Yes. It's notable what the White House, Wolf, said that President Biden is going to be talking about tomorrow night when he does make that Oval Office address at 8They say he will not only be talking about the deadly attack from Hamas on Israel, of course, the center of the focus of his trip here to Tel Aviv today, where he spent several hours on the ground, he's also going to be talking about U.S. support for Ukraine. Now, that is notable given what you heard President Biden say here today that he is going to be asking for an unprecedented aid package for Israel from the U.S. Congress. And what we've heard from lawmakers on Capitol Hill is this idea of tying aid to Israel to more funding for the war effort in Ukraine as there has been a concern that after the attack happened here in Israel that Ukraine would fall to the backburner. So, it will be notable to see how the president ties these together tomorrow night. And, of course, Wolf, this comes as the president just spent several hours here in Tel Aviv where one of the biggest things that he was talking about is where the blame went, where it should be placed for that explosion that we saw happened at a hospital in Gaza city yesterday. That is something that you saw some lawmakers come out and criticize Israel over it even though is coming out with steadfast denials. It took about 24 hours or so before the president came out and cited his own intelligence, but he said he felt confidence in that intelligence. This is what he told reporter on Air Force One. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I can understand why in these circumstances they wouldn't believe (ph). I can understand that. But I would not -- you'd notice I don't say things like that unless I have faith in the source, in which I've gotten. I don't know all the detail but I know the people at the Defense Department, who I respect, and intelligence community that I respect, it is highly improbable that Israel did that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They put out the actual rocket trajectories and they're going to great lengths. They understand what's at stake, right?These are the trajectories that they put out. They're putting out a map of all the misfired rockets since this war began 12 days ago. Obviously, that's not going to convince people in the Arab world about what happened but they obviously feel that this is very crucial. And we'll say, Wolf, talking to sources in the IDF, they have great frustration. They say when people talk about what happened to babies on October 7th, we had to put out the proof of what happened to those babies. What happens at the hospital, we have to put out the proof. And they feel that the world believes Hamas without question and that they are always forced to a double standard, as they call it. But, nonetheless, I think the Jordanian foreign minister on CNN, Wolf, said what you and I know to be the case, the Israeli military is saying it's not responsible, but, to be honest, try and to find anybody who's going to believe it in this part of the world, Wolf.",

They were responding with tear gas and water cannon.And, obviously, the situation in Lebanon, in particular, because of the potentially explosive situation on the border with Israel, is sending jitters throughout the diplomatic community. The United States has authorized family members of the staff at the embassy in Beirut as well as non-emergency personnel to leave if they so desire. The United Kingdom has just put out, an advisory to British subjects in Lebanon, saying that leave now if you -- because perhaps you won't be able to get a flight out of here afterwards. Saudi Arabia, same message to their people in Lebanon, because, let's keep in mind, Wolf, that in 2006 when the war between Hezbollah and Lebanon began, one of the first things the Israelis struck was Beirut Airport, knocking it out of operation until after the war was over more than 33 days later.

And I'll share with you a statement from the National Security Council that we got just this afternoon. An official said that the U.S. government now assesses that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that kill hundreds of civilians yesterday at the Al-Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip. Our assessment is based on available reporting, including intelligence, missile activity and open source video and images of the incident. Intelligence indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed that the explosion was likely caused by an errant rocket or missile launch carried out by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The militants were still investigating what had happened. And so, Wolf, now, I think the important thing for the Biden administration is to try to get this message out sort of as widely as they can in an effort to try to tamp down some of these anti-Israeli protests that have sprung up across the Middle East in response to the sort of initial belief that this hospital was struck by an Israeli missile, Wolf.",

This Hamas gunman recorded themselves moving freely through the gardens of Israeli homes. Code red, code red, the Israeli loud speaker blares in Hebrew, punctuating the sporadic gunfire. After the attack, Israeli first responders saw bullet holes and bloodstains in room after room in what looks like a coldly methodical killing spree. But while hundreds of Israel Israeli killed, some Israeli communities managed to repel the Hamas gunmen and saved lives. The Kibbutz Mefalsim, also near Gaza, residents pushed back a Hamas attack and found documents on the bodies of the militants they killed with disturbing, highly accurate intelligence on their homes, including precise numbers of armed guards there, regional defense force, at least 20 residents, one document reads, and ten soldiers.",

But, certainly, from a humanitarian and even from a military standpoint in terms of Israel's interests, having as many civilians head south, that is something they have been urging, and, certainly, from a military standpoint, the fewer civilians in the north, in Gaza city, the better whenever their ground operation begins to launch.

And I think in the principles, we' agreed with the Americans and others, and we are -- as Anderson reported, we are encouraging people to move south, to move out of the heavy fighting we expect to be in the north. And at the same time, of course, we understand that those people moving to the south will require humanitarian assistance and we've okayed the idea that that assistance come through the Gaza crossing. There are, of course, issues, fuel-purpose items and the fact that Hamas is quite possibly going to, again, try to steal some of the aid for its own military mission, I should say.

We had an example earlier this week. CNN reported that those six oil tankers entered Gaza with fuel that was supposed to go to Gaza hospitals to run the generators so they could have electric power and there was clear documented evidence that Hamas stole some of that fuel, and our assumption has to be that that was diverted to Hamas' military mission.",

It was a malfunction in the rocket, fell short and it hit the hospital, the area of the hospital.This is not new. We've seen this sort of malfunction in Islamic Jihad rockets before. There was another case in 2022 when there was a family that was killed in a refugee camp in Gaza. Once again, a missile shot into Israel, malfunctioning, and landing in Gaza and killing people. But you asked a more important question. The truth is Israel was, of course, not involved, but will people believe it? And, of course, that is difficult. But I think and I think, Wolf, you might tend to agree with me, you know the region well, there can be a difference between what Arab governments know and what they can say publicly. I believe Arab governments who work with the west who are -- have all sort of defense and security relationships with the United States, that they can't ignore reality. Whether they can say that publicly to their people or not with the feeling on the Arab street and so forth, that I don't know, but I think the evidence is overwhelming that Israel obviously was not involved and that that evidence, I think in leaderships across the Arab world, I think that's pretty clear that they will accept that.",

There is settler violence. Last year alone, 300 Palestinians died, 60 of them only last week. So they point to all those evidence, and the fact that there is no -- anything on the horizon in terms of a political solution. They point to that also is they are trying to cancel the Palestinians.
