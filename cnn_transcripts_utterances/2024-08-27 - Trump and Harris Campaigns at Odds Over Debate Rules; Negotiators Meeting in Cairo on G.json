His family say that he passed away peacefully at the age of 76. Eriksson revealed in January that he'd been diagnosed with terminal cancer and given a year to live.He's most famous for becoming England's first foreign manager, leading the Three Lions to the quarterfinals of the 2002 and 2006 World Cup tournaments. As a club manager with the likes of Gothenburg, Benfica, and Lazio, he won 18 trophies. Since going public with his illness, Eriksson was warmly received at many of his former clubs, and he was even able to manage the Liverpool Legends team for a day. He'd said that Liverpool was a team he'd always wanted to manage. He was a lifelong fan. He bravely lived with his cancer, and he told CNN earlier this year that he was grateful for all the love he was feeling. SVEN-GORAN ERIKSSON, FORMER ENGLAND MANAGER: That was fantastic, very, very nice and beautiful, of course. And I'm a little bit lucky they telling me how good I was when I was still alive.
