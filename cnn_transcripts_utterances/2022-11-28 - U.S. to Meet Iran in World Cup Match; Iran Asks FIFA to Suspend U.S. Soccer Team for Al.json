That's not to say that the players aren't in favor of the decision to show support for the women of Iran. The men's team has publicly supported a number of causes that they felt passionately about in the past.But it is worth noting that this decision didn't come from them. U.S. Soccer told CNN that they always planned to go back to the original flag. They called it a one-time change. But the stakes are very high here, as you know, Don. There's a lot at stake. No subtleties are going to be missed. Everything that the United States says and does is going to be used as ammunition. And right now, Iran is calling for FIFA to suspend them from the tournament. Whether or not FIFA decides to respond, that's still very much in question. They haven't publicly said anything yet.

The United States continues to find ways to support the Iranian people in the face of state-sponsored violence against women and a brutal crackdown against peaceful protesters.\"So it's significant there, the spokesperson not coming out and saying that this was the wrong decision, but making it very clear that the U.S. government didn't coordinate with U.S. Soccer on this. I do think it's important to note, however, that the secretary of state has been critical in some part about some of the decisions surrounding the games. Just last week being critical of FIFA because they said that they were going to be doling out these yellow cards to players who are wearing that one love armband that represents diversity and inclusion. So the U.S. does have a history of saying when they want to be critical in this case. In this case, they're saying we are going ahead and we're supporting U.S. Soccer. We look forward to a match.",

Most people, most Americans might not know his name, but he is a known quantity within the Trump base. Listening back on a podcast from about two years ago he spoke about some Republican politicians.

I'm reminded of something a very long time ago, and I keep bringing it back to 2016, but during the 2016 election, there was this long standing White supremacist in California who somehow ended up as a Trump elector.
