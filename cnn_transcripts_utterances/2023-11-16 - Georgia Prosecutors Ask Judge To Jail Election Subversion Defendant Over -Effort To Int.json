      "sentences": "That's a -- that's a good point.Charlie, I also want to zero in on what the judge is looking at here and that is what is viewed by them as intimidation against Ruby Freeman. I mean, this is someone who volunteered their time to be an election worker, who was attacked by the likes of Rudy Guiliani -- who, by the way, had to walk that back recently -- and by Donald Trump. You see her there. And prosecutors say that the latest Floyd comments about her have made her quote, \"the subject of renewed threats and violence from third parties.\" Just speak to that -- that how extraordinary it is to, in the worst possible way, to have to endure something like that when you're a volunteer trying to help in an election. CHARLIE BAILEY, FORMER FULTON COUNTY SENIOR ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, (D) FORMER CANDIDATE, GEORGIA LT. GOVERNOR:  Well, it's unconscionable and it's one reason that this prosecution is so important to stand up not just for Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman but for the citizens of Georgia. I mean, the people that work our polls every election season are patriots and it's just the height of I think unpatriotic behavior that Mr. Floyd is accused of in this very indictment and that he continues to participate in. And it shouldn't come as a shock to me. I've seen this a number of times in my career as a prosecutor how often folks that have been indicted for felonies, after that indictment continue the kind of conduct that got them under indictment in the first place. And I think Mr. Floyd is -- if he hasn't realized it already is about to realize the consequences of that.",

The judge is going to take some action related to it. We now know who says that they leaked some of the video, saying they're doing it because they believed it should be seen publicly. What's actually happening here -- because most people just watch thevideos and say oh, that's interesting, that's stuff I didn't know, or that's helpful for understanding things. Why would you not want these public?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it kind of depends who the you is in that sentence.But I will say this. First of all, while there wasn't a protective order in place -- so there was no order specifically saying that the defense could not disseminate these videos and I wish there had been -- but even putting that aside, it is absolutely not something a lawyer should be doing. It's a possible violation of ethical rules to leak a video to disseminate it for the purpose of I want the public to see this. Trials are not in public. Trials are in courtrooms where there's rules of evidence. Some of this testimony, while fascinating and substantively revealing of new facts that are potentially very good I think for the prosecution -- not all of it would necessarily come in at trial based on the rules of evidence. And if you're the prosecutor, you want to put your case in the way you are structuring it. There's a strategy to how you put your evidence in -- in what order, et cetera, and you may be waiting on rulings from the judge as to whether certain evidence can come in. So while the substance of it is good I think, overall for the prosecution, it isn't good for the prosecution that this got out. And it absolutely, I think, is beneath any lawyer to be doing this and particularly, when they admit they're doing it because the public should see this. That's not your job. Your job is to try your case in court in front of a jury and a judge.",
