There should be a bipartisan investigation this year leaving no rock or stone unturned. There are many things we still need to understand. Who were the earliest cases? Were there any affected animals at the market, in the supply chain? And what were the Wuhan lab scientists working with, what virus had they found and what experiments are they doing?

Because even if the Chinese came forward and say nobody in the lab had been infected, that they didn't have this virus in the lab, would anybody in the world believe them? So, I think we have to move on. And I worry that we're wasting time getting prepared for the next virus to hit us where both lab leaks and the potential for spillover are possibilities. That's what we ought to be spending our time doing right now.

I do think that maybe waiting for the truth to come on either through perhaps an investigation that has subpoena power or perhaps through a whistleblower.So, I actually think that the way to prevent future pandemics depends on finding the origin of this pandemic. When you have a plane that crashes, you try to find a moment-by-moment playout of what happened in order to prevent the next plane crash or learn how the plane could crash in the future. In the same vein, with the pandemic, you need to find out what series of events led to this happening and you need put in countermeasures in each one of these places where there might be risk. In the case of a possible origin of this pandemic, I think it's very hard to persuade the community of scientists that do this is risky work to have actual changes unless you show them that this pandemic started from a lab.",

He said no. And McConnell, I just asked moments ago, about whether he has concerns of McCarthy's move to give it to Carlson. He did not say directly. Only thing he's concern about the security of the capitol. And, yes, this comes just as McCarthy himself and the House Republicans are giving access or indicating that January 6th defendants can review security footage as part of their efforts to defend their case. McCarthy, I just asked him about this. He claims this is nothing different than what was allowed under Speaker Pelosi.
