And that is a dynamic that kind of keeps them in the game, even though his approval rating is at a level that historically you would say would be -- would be difficult for an incumbent president.I mean, they believe that they have a formula that will allow them to improve a few points among those swing voters, working class swing voters in those key rust belt, you know, Midwestern states, and that Trump or DeSantis, or almost anyone that Republicans nominate will solve the problem of generating a lot of enthusiasm among younger voters, in particular, who have never been, you know, entirely wowed by Joe Biden.

According to DOD, some of those contingencies include the need to secure the embassy and perhaps the need to evacuate the embassy.Now, the Defense Department won't say what additional forces or where. But we've learned from the U.S. Defense official that there are now several hundred marines in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier. Those marines have an aviation combat element with them, essentially aircraft that can move marines and other ground forces in, if necessary, and those forces could be used again. Both to secure the embassy and to evacuate if needed, given the situation. The U.S., and that includes the State Department, the Defense Department and the White House are watching the situation in Sudan and in Khartoum very closely. According to DOD records, there are only about 14 troops based there, including 13 marines, and those would largely be embassy security in Khartoum, in the capital of Sudan. To move those out to secure them, it will take many more forces and this is why we're seeing that build up in Djibouti. In terms of when an evacuation might happen, a senior U.S. official says it's not imminent. And that's because they're looking for an open window, an active ceasefire that holds between the two warring factions here. The best chance for that, the senior U.S. official says, might be the upcoming Eid al-Fitr holiday in the coming days. And that's what they're looking at. Again, that's not a guarantee. It is simply the best window. It looks like the evac might be possible. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END OF VIDEOTAPE)",
