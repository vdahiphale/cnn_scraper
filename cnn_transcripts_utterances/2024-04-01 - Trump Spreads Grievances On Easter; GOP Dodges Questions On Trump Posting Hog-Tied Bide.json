Will his incendiary comments lead his party to ruin for a contrast? Take a look at President Biden's Easter message calling for peace, security and dignity for people around the world. Trump's message this past weekend was unsurprisingly Trumpian, he railed against the quote, crooked and corrupt legal system unleashed his millions of followers on a federal judge's daughter and shared this far right op-ed equating his legal troubles with the crucifixion. It all comes after he posted this video depicting the President, President Biden that is being hog- tied in the back of a pickup truck when pressed. Republicans once again refused to condemn Trump's actions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think everyone needs to tone down the rhetoric, the language. And you know, obviously social media has become a vehicle by which to bludgeon people. I just think at the end of the day, the former president, current president, and on down all of us have a responsibility to check our language, to watch what we're saying. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm the first to admit it.But -- but simply saying, we don't like what he says, you know, also feeds into his narrative that it's a -- it's a real problem.

We should note, CNN has been investigating the specifics of this report, we last reported that the U.S. intelligence community can't make a link between these cases, and a foreign adversary.

I don't think the government frankly, when I was there, took it seriously enough. I don't think they've taken seriously enough since then I commend CBS for going after it, I think you should continue to go after it too. Because the danger that the Russians or any adversary could actually perfect this kind of weapon, the damage it could do to our troops, to high level government officials in a time of crisis is very, very concerning.And I just think people swept that aside too quickly. Some of the people who were affected, actually were National Security Council staff when I was there. And the idea that these people had some kind of psychosomatic experience was not credible to me.

However, some polls can show you if they're warning signs or blinkers that need to be on in your campaign and one of those is with Black voters. There's not much concern that Black voters are going to vote for Trump, I think you've seen some very misguided reporting on this belief that all of a sudden Donald Trump is going to take on 20, 25 percent of the Black vote, he's just not. But there is a concern, as Isaac said that Black voters will choose the couch and simply stay at home for a very long period of time. Black voters in particular Black women have carried the Democratic Party. And there is some sense of fatigue and a question of resources coming to our you know, our respective communities.And so, Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, everybody running up and down the ballot have to meet these voters where they are, and not tell them why they shouldn't vote for Donald Trump, but tell them why they should vote for Joe Biden again.",

A lot of African-American younger voters in my age group in a millennial, we're really hopeful that you will see more in terms of Student Loan Forgiveness, which we know most economists argued would really benefit African-American young individuals, and particularly as we really look at the wealth disparities between Black Americans and white Americans. So, I think on some very consequential issues, a lot of African- Americans don't feel that the President really met his mark.Now, I will say this, I'm not convinced, just like Bakari, that you'll see 25 percent of African-Americans, all of a sudden voting for a foreign President Donald Trump. But as you did see in the reporting from Isaac, 2016 to 2020, saw a 4 percent increase, is it mathematically possible to see a 2 or 3 percent increase, particularly among Black men?

That's actually I think, doable for Joe Biden this summer, depending on how this campaign goes.But as you know, Bakari, it just takes a sliver here, a sliver there, it may come down to several thousand votes in one of these key states, especially with an RFK Jr. and Cornel West on the ballot, you just don't know how it's going to break down.",

I think watching the results from North Carolina, early in the night, we'll be able to tell you and project what's going to happen in that race. North Carolina is very unique. You call it, you have places like Charlotte, you have Greensboro, you have Winston-Salem, you have the Research Triangle where there are loads of Black voters, particularly Black men. But there's also another strain of Black voters that doesn't get talked about often, we got to do a better job just identifying them. But that's rural voters, rural Black voters, particularly along the coast of North Carolina are going to be very important in this race.The White House understands that and one of the things that they're doing differently than past campaigns. And I give all praise to Julie Rodriguez, who is just amazing. Without Julie Rodriguez, I'm not sure this campaign is actually going in a straight line. But -- but they've -- they've been focusing early on -- on messaging, meeting people where they are for a long period of time. You know, a lot of times my white progressive friends that run these campaigns, they start wooing Black voters at high school football games after Labor Day, just saying come vote for us again. And that's just not the way you do it. People are tired of that type of outreach.

They want to see a ladder for them to be able to climb economically so that they can provide for themselves, their families, their communities. And I think whomever articulates that best case, is going to be the individual that sees those numbers on their side.Now to Donald Trump, the idea that because he's facing these criminal indictments, as somehow makes him palatable to Black men, is such an insult.

Well, you know, you remember that those meetings was supposed to take place last week, with Benjamin Netanyahu canceling the departure of these very delegation a day before as sort of a protest to the U.S. decision not to veto a Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages. Netanyahu was very upset and use this U.S. decision as a pretext for cancelling the delegation only to restore the talks about the delegation a day later. And in order to save face, this was the solution, it was found that on the one hand, there will be a meeting, will be a virtual one on a secure video conference call. But on the other hand, Netanyahu will be able to say that he didn't send a delegation to Washington, but I think this is only the first meeting.
