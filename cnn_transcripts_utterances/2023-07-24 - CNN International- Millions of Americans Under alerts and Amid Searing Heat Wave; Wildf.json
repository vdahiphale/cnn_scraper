They to be outside. And those people are being reminded to wear the appropriate clothes. To take water breaks, to be in the shade. To stop working when you feel dizzy or when you begin to feel sick. And it is very important to point out the significant impacts of these heat waves. Starting with hospitals, for example, who have reported an increase some of the patients that they're seeing, heat-related illnesses and heatstroke for example in some of the hospitals in the most affected areas. And then there's also the economic impact of all of this. A recent study showing that it costs the U.S. about $100 billion a year, and that's only in productivity loss alone. That's what the extreme heat is costing the U.S. and many of the industries. The most impacted being agriculture and construction. But really there is no industry or business that is immune to this. Think about, for example, a food truck and being in a kitchen when it's extremely hot. Think about pets or animals at the zoo and people that actually work at the zoo. But even people who are working indoors and have to go to work are seeing the impacts or effects of these heat waves. Take a listen to this librarian and what he had to deal with.",

And these are numbers in the shade. Vegas around 110, Phoenix, still around 117, Death Valley right around 120.Now this heat dome that we've been talking about for weeks will eventually begin to spread out a little bit. It's going to move out to the north. The jet's going to get pushed up into Canada and these temperatures are going to begin to slide off to the east rather significantly. Temperatures are going to go up a lot as we work our way to the middle part of the week from 80s to over 100 in some spots. Like Minneapolis, so for today, 91, but then by Thursday, Friday, you're up above 100 degrees. And this is typically not a dry heat in Minneapolis. Because the corn is all through Ohio and Iowa, Indiana, we call it corn sweat, the expo transpiration of the corn that's out there giving humidity to the air, and so 101 is going to feel much warmer than that is some spots. And then for New York City, you're going to take a little longer to get to that heat you're going to be all the way to 96 on Friday. So get ready for some much warmer weather out there.

More forces have been sent in, about ten aircrafts and helicopters are operating on the island right now. Including assistance from other countries that have come after Greece's request for international assistance.The tourists have seem to have been mostly evacuated. The people wanted to leave the island. Mostly have or they're. Waiting to be evacuated. Some will remain in other parts of the island because the area we're looking at is about 10 percent of the island, the area that's now in great danger. So many people have been moved to other places. This time of the year Rhodes is jam-packed with tourists. So some people are also going to other islands and airlines are doing their best to get people out. Some airlines are also suspending services to the island of Rhodes. Now Rhodes is not the only fire unfortunately that we actually having Greece right now. We had a large fire that has been developing since yesterday on the island of Corfu. It's another very popular island with tourists. We understand that authorities are now sending more forces there as well. At the moment, we don't have any houses burning, just preliminary, precautionary, evacuations for the time being. But they're preparing in case they need to get more people out. This has been an incredibly hot time in Greece. It's been the most prolonged heat wave in Greece's known history so far. And with temperatures that are likely to remain extremely high for at least the middle of the week. So, as we understand, the country really feels like a tinderbox right now.

It's the latest escalation and the feud between President Joe Biden and Texas Governor Greg Abbott over the handling of the U.S./Mexico border.In a letter on Thursday, the Justice Department said that Texas did not have authorization to set up the floating barriers this month. Citing a clause in the law to that effect. They also went on to say, quote, the state of Texas's actions violated federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government's ability to carry out its official duties. Now, officials have been talking for months within the administration as to what actions if any could be taken by the Justice Department as they watch with concern the action that the Texas governor was taking along the Texas/Mexico border. Those floating barriers have for example, posed a potential drowning risk to migrants who are crossing. Now the Texas governor in a tweet said that it is the sovereign authority to defend our borders. So, he is standing firm on his position keep the those barriers. But again, he can reply by Monday afternoon as to whether or not he will take them down. If not, the Justice Department says in their letter, they're ready to take the Texas governor to court.

He was hospitalized over the weekend for what doctors say was a transient heart block. This comes as Israeli lawmakers are debating a bill that would curb some powers of the country's Supreme Court and a preliminary vote is expected in the coming hour. Mr. Netanyahu earlier said he would attend the vote. Meantime, this was the scene or the scenes outside of Parliament this morning, as thousands of demonstrators continue to protest against the legislation. These are in fact live pictures coming into CNN here. And police are using water cannons to try and disperse this protest. For more, let's go to journalist Elliott Gotkine who's live and joining us live from Tel Aviv. These protests, Elliott, as we know have been going on for months now, six or seven months. And today, we could see the beginning of the complete reshaping of the Israeli judiciary. But we do know that attempts to bring a compromise is still ongoing.

He has expressed his concerns about the issues with the reservists and Israeli Air Force. He has been trying to hold talks with them as well.As things stand there is one big business group that has announced a strike or today, along with tech workers. The main labor federation, the Histadrut, has not called for a strike just yet. Now that could change. But that was what seemed to push Netanyahu to pause passage of this judicial overhaul last month and to kind of cut it up into bite- size pieces.

In Moscow, meantime, the Defense Ministry says it intercepted two drones in what has been called a terror attack by Kyiv.

I looked out of the window. I live in the neighboring building on the side where there's less damage and it felt strange. The damage was so minor. Well, OK, not minor. Any explosion is scary.

Ukraine's digital transformation minister coming out saying drone attack, the Russian capital in Crimea last night, electronic warfare, he says, and air defense are becoming less and less capable of protecting the occupier's skies.

It's already taken back about 50 percent of what was initially seized. Now they're in a hard fight to take back -- to take back more. These are still relatively early days of the counteroffensive. It is tough. The Russians have put in place strong defenses. But I'm convinced with the equipment and support they've received now from more than 50 countries, with the training that their forces gotten -- and many of the forces who've gotten their training have not yet been put fully into this fight. And maybe more than anything else, with the fact that unlike the Russians, the Ukrainians are fighting for their land, for their future, for their country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
