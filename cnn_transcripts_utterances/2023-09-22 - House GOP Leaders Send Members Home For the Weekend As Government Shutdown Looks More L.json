Lindsey, good morning. It's great to have you here. I want to talk about McCarthy's predicament because right now, he is caught between his hardliners on the one side and his moderates who are starting to talk more and more loudly about trying to join with Democrats to keep the government open.

He's not really, you know, putting a bunch of his own ideas out there, he is letting they will in the room and talk it out.But everything they come up with is just falling short when it comes to about a handful, up to -- about -- you know, started about a dozen but I think we're down to under about ten or so hard line conservatives who are opposing every plan that's thrown out. And they have come up with a new plan to just put aside what they were working on, which is a stopgap government funding bill, something that needs to happen before the end of the month, or the government will shut down. And then instead focus on their 12 annual appropriation bills. Again, these do not help them get to the point of avoiding a shutdown, so they are in a really desperate place right now.",

So they're going to keep the war going at a steady pace until they really know what is going to happen there.And that's why Ukraine needs these extra, you know, equipment because it is a long time line. We need to see the result of the election. And then I don't know what that really means. Does Putin believe that Trump could potentially come in as president and resolve the whole situation? But does America intervene in world conflicts? I mean, this is a huge debate for America, isn't it? And I think the worry here is that -- there, that some of those American politicians are against the war in Ukraine, might see as an Afghanistan type situation that you can't win and you're just going to have to pull out.
