When you build from the middle out and the bottom up, everybody does well. The wealthy still do very well. But that trickle-down economy, not a whole lot dropped on my dad's kitchen table growing up. It's all part of an economic vision for this country. I came to office determined -- it's to the point of some my own team thought I was too determined -- to change the economic direction of this country, to move trickle-down economics and get rid of it, where everyone from \"The Wall Street Journal\" to \"The Financial Times\" called the program Bidenomics. I'm not sure they meant it as a compliment at the time. Our plan is working. And one of the things I'm proudest of, it's working everywhere, not just in the coast and big cities, like previous recoveries. This time, investment is working in factories being built and jobs being created, happening in rural America to the heartland, all across America, in communities that have been left out and hollowed out. This is what it looks like across the country. Over 13 million new jobs since I have been elected to office, more jobs than any president's ever created in the first two years, nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, including 14,000 in this state alone, this state alone.

Job satisfaction nationally, nationally is at a 36-year high. The share of working-age Americans in the work force is as high as it's been in 30 years. Remember, they used to say, Biden spent all this money to keep people from working? People are off the sidelines, 20 years, 20 years' high, higher than every single one of my predecessors. And to pay for low-wage workers -- the pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in two decades. And, folks, it's no accident. It's Bidenomics in action. Trickle-down economics has failed the country for decades. It means slashing public investment on things that helped America lead the world in innovation. We used to invest 2 percent of our entire gross domestic product in research and development. You know what it is now? Point-seven percent. We used to be ranked number one in the world in research and development. Know where we're ranked now? Number nine. China is number eight a decade ago, and now China is number two. And other countries are closing in fast. This is the United States of America, for God's sake. We used to have the fastest infrastructure, the best infrastructure in the world, rated number one. Now we're rated number 13 in the world in infrastructure. How can you have the best economy in the world and not have the best infrastructure in the world?

Just a couple hours ago, Walt Nauta, who is Trump's personal aide and accused co-conspirator, pleaded not guilty to helping his boss hide classified documents. The arraignment comes after a judge unsealed more of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant affidavit, that justification for searching Mar-a-Lago last summer. And it reveals the prosecutors have surveillance video showing someone moving dozens of boxes before the FBI search. CNN's Carlos Suarez is outside of the federal courthouse in Miami for us.

Her name is Sasha Dadan. We're told that she is a former public defender with experience trying cases across South Florida, that according to a source with knowledge of the situation. Nauta is being accused of moving several boxes with classified documents from a storage room at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort to other parts of the property and lying to federal investigators about it. Now, prosecutors say that all of this was in an effort to keep some of these classified documents from a Trump lawyer who had been tasked to find them after a grand jury subpoena. Prosecutors have said that they have surveillance video of Nauta moving these boxes around the Mar-a- Lago property before the FBI searched the property. And the feds say, Brianna, that Nauta lied to them about the whereabouts of these boxes, and, more importantly, he lied about not moving them -- Brianna.",

We have seen so many Trump aides come and go, but he has stuck around. Talk to us about your reporting in his role in all of this. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  He has stuck around. And what was interesting about today, Boris, to me, that really stands out is the fact that he really waited until the last minute to be able to have this arraignment. He delayed for about 28 days, saying that he needed to find a local lawyer to represent him. He's represented broadly by the same lawyer as former President Trump, but really waiting, dragging this out as much as possible. And that delay is a tactic that I think we're going to see repeatedly, not just from Walt Nauta, but also from the former president, because it's a part of the political strategy broadly as well, which is that the former president wants to delay this as much as possible, all of these potential indictments, to go beyond the 2024 election cycle, so, that way, he could potentially pardon himself.",

You have got a former president of the United States, an redact -- unredacted portions now have an indictment, of a criminal indictment, of an affidavit that shows probable cause as to why this entire thing began down in Florida. It includes surveillance footage. And before they even had an indictment, before they went through everything else, they were aware they saw boxes moving, the boxes you're seeing behind the screen, of course, put in one area, not removed -- not put back in full.

They wanted to see whether you were credible when you spoke about it. They could then guide their entire prosecutorial development, in terms of which witnesses to call who would buttress the testimony, who would corroborate other aspects of it.
