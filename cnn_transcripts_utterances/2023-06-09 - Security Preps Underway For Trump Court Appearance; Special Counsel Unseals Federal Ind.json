They found no credible threats we're told.Joining us now is John Miller, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. This is a major scramble for law enforcement following yesterday's indictment. Tell us about this process. Who was involved, what are they doing? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: So this is going to be similar to what we saw in New York. But the key difference is, what we saw in New York City when Donald Trump, former president, was indicted and in this unprecedented charge, you know, several weeks ago, was a police department that had 36,000 officers, hundreds to throw at it, thousands to have on stand by and a good deal of time to plan. The turnaround time here is much shorter. This is the Miami City P.D. That's 1,100 officers. It's Metro Dade, which is the county police. That's 2,400 officers. So they're going to have to work with the Secret Service who will be responsible for the security of Donald Trump as a former president, which is always unusual when the person you're securing is also the suspect in a criminal matter. The city police and the county will handle the traffic, crowds and getting him into that courthouse. Once inside, the security is the bastion of the United States Marshall, which secures that courthouse. So you've got agencies that are going to have to be working hand in glove to make sure he gets in and gets out without incident. But also that they have sufficient personnel for things like demonstrators, counterdemonstrators and of course the unforeseen.",

They absolutely could have lined this up so they had already gone, requested the unsealing, notified the team and unsealed it for the American people.

The reason why you seal documents of any kind of nature is because we don't, as a society, believe it's appropriate to tar and feather someone in the public square. Because there is a presumption of innocence, it benefits the defendant -- although this is an extraordinary defendant, it benefits the defendant not to have it out in the public until there is a presentment and arraignment. He's making the extraordinary step to say he wants it public, part of the track record, is likely what would also prompt them to be even considerate of that very notion.

On top of that, Trump's narrative about this case has been pretty consistent from the beginning. Indictment or no indictment, he has said that he is being, you know -- this is a witch-hunt, he's being targeted. He would have said that no matter what sequence of events this took. The Republican Party is going to have to deal with the facts of this case. No matter how Trump spins it, the documents will speak for themselves. The American people will decide not just about this case, but about the overwhelming evidence around Donald Trump and his activities in this and all the other cases that he faces.

I'm going to read some descriptions of the documents involved here.Number four, top-secret special handling, including military activities and planning of foreign countries. Number five, document dated June, 2020, concerning nuclear capabilities of a foreign country. Number nine, undated document concerning military attacks by a foreign country. Some of them not just the top-secret label but the \"no foreign\" label. That stands for no foreign, meaning these documents were not to be shared with anybody outside the U.S. intelligence community due to their sensitivity. In other words, these are not low-level classification markings. And by the way, not low-level topics for classified intelligence markings -- nuclear, foreign attacks, military activities by foreign countries. It's sensitive, sensitive material.",

As you read part of it, you can see they're looking at the deposition of Walt Nauta where his testimony and underscoring what they say they know to be false about the movement of some of these documents.There's a lot that this reveals. There's a lot that it also does not reveal, to your point, Laura Coates. I do want to go back to Dana and John as we look over this indictment and these dozens of counts here.",

And they detail -- again, Donald Trump is innocent until proven guilty, Donald Trump will have his day in court. But this indictment just details -- in stunning detail. Number one, text messages from his employees. \"Donald Trump routinely says outside forces are against him. This indictment is built on information from within Trump's inner circle.\" \"Former White House officials, current political aides, current Mar-a- Lago employees, text messages, photographs of sloppy handling of documents, of deliberate, -- as you noted, on page three, they lay out that Trump asked his attorney to lie to the federal government about these documents. And so now that you that you have the scope of this from the special counsel, who we will hear from today for the first time since he took this job, I suspect the conversation is going to change quickly. Again, the legal consequences are what matter most in this historic unprecedented now case against a former president.
