He's a former foreign policy advisor to the George W. Bush administration and to Mitt Romney. He's also the co-author of the book, The Genius of Israel. Dan, we appreciate you coming in, always enjoy our conversations. Right now, when you look at Bill Burns, the CIA director, meeting with his counterpart in Qatar, the Israeli -- his counterpart in Israel, also having meetings as well, what do you think the odds are that a pause in hostage swaps comes back onto the table? DAN SENIOR, CO-AUTHOR, THE GENIUS OF ISRAEL:  Look, it seems that Hamas wants it. It seems that Israel wants it. Certainly, the international community wants it. Obviously getting from all the parties wanting it to executing it is always a bit of a challenge. I think the real time to have done it where you could have made real progress on this front was adding days to the long pause that occurred at the end of November. That's when you had a big pause and then you were just adding incremental days. Now, they've gone back in pretty heavy with the war fighting. They're making a lot of progress. The IDF is making a lot of progress, which is why Hamas is eager to get a pause again because Israel is really moving in and making a lot of progress in the south. So, I think all the parties want it, but getting to the pause that will be acceptable to all the parties is going to be a challenge.",

But on the idea of the two-state solution, which the Biden administration has been explicit about, they have raised the Palestinian Authority. Obviously, Netanyahu has rejected both the two-state solution and the Palestinian Authority.The regional allies that are necessary to have an endgame here aren't saying anything publicly, but certainly wouldn't go in without a two- state solution to help. Netanyahu says, absolutely not, not on the table. I don't understand how you thread this needle. SENOR  There's two pieces to it. One, in principle, could there be a two-state solution? And I think all the parties, the leaders in the gulf and the broader Arab world, Israel -- sorry, the U.S., are all open to a two-state solution. The question is who is the leadership in that Palestinian state. Nobody has confidence in the current Palestinian Authority that operates in the West bank. The Israeli government doesn't have confidence. The U.S. doesn't really have confidence. The Gulf States and the Arab world do not. I've spoken to Arab leaders who say that Palestinian authority in the West Bank is corrupt and it is inept. The idea that we're going to take them from barely hanging on in the West Bank and plop them into Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank and expect them to run it is crazy. If you listen to the language that Jake Sullivan used, he did an interview with Yonit Levi of Channel 12 when he was in Israel, he called -- he said the Palestinian Authority could come into Gaza in a revamped and reformed way. So, I think that's the administration's way of saying, in principle, we're okay with the Palestinian Authority. It's just going to look a lot different than it does now, which means it's probably not going to happen.",

And it comes after the region had been experiencing weeks of intense earthquake activity since late October, promoting officials to evacuate -- prompting officials to evacuate about 4,000 people from a nearby fishing town earlier this month. Glow from the volcano is lighting up the sky so much that it can be seen from the capital of Reykjavik, which is about 30 miles away. No injuries have been reported up to this point.

And he says it so often and with such real sincerity that there has become this tension where he ends up overextending himself, that basically aides feel that he does not know his own physical limitations and that he tries to do too much.
