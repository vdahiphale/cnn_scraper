Flights began at Maryland`s College Park Airport in 1909 when Wilbur Wright trained two military pilots. And up next, we`re continuing with part two of our feature from yesterday on the future of travel. New technology in the years to come will likely change travel as we know it forever. The planes, trains and automobiles we use today may someday be as antiquated as the horse and buggy. Thought leaders in the travel industry are formulating plans that might make travel faster, cheaper and safer. From hyperloops to air taxis to supersonic jets, here`s CNN`s Rahel Solomon with more on \"The Next Frontier\". (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From highways to railways, flight paths to bike lanes, we have plenty of mobility options on the ground and in the air. But could the next frontier in transit take place over water? One sea-bearing startup is looking to turn coastlines into corridors.",
