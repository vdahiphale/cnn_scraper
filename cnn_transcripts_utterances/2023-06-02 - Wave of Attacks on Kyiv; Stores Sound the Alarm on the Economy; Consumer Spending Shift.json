Residents of the city taking shelter in the subway, as they have so many nights in the last few weeks. Ukraine says that all 36 missiles and drones launched during the attack were destroyed, but an 11-year-old child is hurt and a 68-year-old man has been hospitalized from the falling debris.Meanwhile, the governor of Russia's Smolensk region says that two drones targeted fuel and energy facilities there. CNN's Sam Kiley, live in Kharkiv, Ukraine, with more. Sam, good morning. So, what do we know about yet another wave of strikes there?",

But, clearly, you're talking about Kyiv in the first instance.This is, yes, another attempt by the Russians to penetrate the air defenses of the Ukrainian capital. It's very interesting how the Ukrainian capital itself has been the overwhelming focus of the drone and missile strikes by Russia over the last month or so. A relentless campaign there trying to get through. In the past, last year, they were targeting the energy facilities and energy generating capabilities of Ukraine, particularly in the winter months. Now what do we see? We see mysterious drone attacks against energy facilities in Smolensk and a few days ago in Krasnodar, almost opposite ends of the country in terms of the Russian border with Ukraine. Both of them targeting oil refining facilities. Both of them causing fires. Neither of them being claimed, obviously, by Ukraine. But you could certainly assume that Ukrainian backed groups at the very least are responsible - they're then responsible for them, as indeed they were for the drone attacks recently in Russia. And we have the ongoing, according to the Russian governor of Belgorod, campaign not far north of where I am in Kharkiv, just across the border there, with raids and shelling going on with claims from the Russians that we can't verify of some civilian casualties there too.",

Macy's said yesterday that sales dropped 8.7 percent last quarter from a year ago. The company said that people were buying less clothes and they were shifting their spending to basically paying for essentials, and also to spending on travel. They weren't able to take trips early in the pandemic, so shifting some of their discretionary spending there. The CEO called it a reallocation of spending. Then you look at Dollar General. Dollar General reported earnings yesterday. It's a really good way to look at the state of lower income shoppers. Sales increased just 1.6 percent. Now, that's not very much. Dollar General, the typical customer makes under $40,000. And the company said that they're really squeezed right now. They basically have very little income to spend on anything discretionary. And so that's why we see sales nudge up just a bit. And the stock yesterday plunged, down about 20 percent.",
