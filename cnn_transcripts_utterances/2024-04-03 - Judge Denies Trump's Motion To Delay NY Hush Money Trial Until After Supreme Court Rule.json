And then the judge today coming out with a ruling denying this motion, saying, frankly, that Trump has made it too late. He initially filed this motion on March 7th. That was when this trial was scheduled to begin on March 25th. Judge said that was just way too close.He wrote, \"The fact that the defendant waited until a mere 17 days prior to the scheduled trial date of March 25th, 2024, to file the motion, raises real questions about the sincerity and actual purpose of the motion.\" He also mentioned that the notion of presidential immunity was something that Trump knew because he was using it in the federal case, but he also tried to use it in this very case to try to move it into federal court. A federal court judge kicked that back to Judge Merchan. This is just one of a flurry of motions that Trump's team has been making in the past few days and even weeks to try to delay this trial. They've asked the judge to recuse himself because of work his daughter has done with Democratic groups.

Jean Carroll defamation case, which also took place in New York. And they pointed out that New Yorker's - New Yorks tend to vote for Trump's rivals overwhelmingly. And so their concern there is that now that they have this data presented to the judge to try to persuade him that he needs to do something, I mean, the judge was skeptical of this argument once before asking them, do you really think it's going to be better in May, when he denied it from the bench at one point. And prosecutors are opposing this because they say no matter when or where this trial takes place, it's the trial of a former president, there is going to be substantial media attention.

I think what's happened is the defense in its argument is turning the Presidential Records Act on its head, and she seems to have bought that. And in layman's terms, what she's doing is really allowing, via these questions, suggested questions, the jury to make a determination as to whether a record that Trump has taken is covered by the Presidential Records Act as personal.

They didn't sign up to be killed.\" What do you make of the former president's recent social media attacks on Judge Merchan and his daughter?

What I've opined, and what I fear greatly, is we're going to get somebody killed, 99.9 percent of the electorate will not act out, whatever their feelings may be. But you're talking about that fringe element that hears this like a dog whistle and thinks that they're doing the will of their benefactors. What really worries me, and Judge Merchan is riding the tiger here, but if I were presiding in this case, I'd bring him in personally, have a really pitched discussion, and I think I'd have to tell him that if he continued down this road, the next appearance would be one where he'd bring his toothbrush, because you cannot tolerate this kind of painting outside the lines. It is not a question of the First Amendment. It's a situation where it's injurious to the administration of justice.

We should know President Biden won all of these states, except North Carolina, in the 2020 election.Meanwhile, in Florida, a pair of State Supreme Court abortion rulings this week have Democrats hoping it could flip blue again. On Monday, the State Supreme Court decided against halting the 15-week abortion ban, paving the way for a six-week ban to take effect May 1st. But in a separate filing, the court gave Floridians the option to decide whether to enshrine abortion protections in the state's constitution on the ballot this November. 360's Randi Kaye spoke with some Florida women following the ruling. Here's her report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They raised the funds, and they got more than enough signatures, almost a million signatures. I don't think they left the Florida Supreme Court much of a choice, but to approve this constitutional amendment, to go on the ballot in November.

But the -- what the Biden team is going to have to do is be able to communicate.

So, I do believe that there's a bit of a disconnect.I think that for a lot of Republicans, they identified as pro-life when Roe was the law of the land. And now when they see in their home states, some of these rules being brought back to something like six weeks, which is extreme, most women don't know they're pregnant at that point, they're comfortable kind of parting ways with the party orthodoxy, but they are still going to vote with the top of the ticket.
