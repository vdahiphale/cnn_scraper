I'm Jessica Dean, in for Fredricka Whitfield.And we're going to start in the Middle East where fighting is intensifying after the expiration of a weeklong truce between Israel and Hamas. Israeli Defense Forces saying it's carried out more than 400 strikes in Gaza over the first 24 hours since the truce expired yesterday, and those strikes include targets in southern Gaza. They're coming as negotiations over the remaining 136 hostages in Gaza have hit a, quote, dead-end, that's according to Israeli officials. Israel recalling its team of negotiators from Qatar. Hamas calling it a, quote, predetermined decision by the Israelis, but the Israelis are accusing the terror group of not fulfilling its promise to return all the women and children who are being held hostage. CNN's Oren Liebermann and Matthew Chance are both tracking the latest from Tel Aviv. We'll start first with Oren. Oren, walk us through how these negotiations break down and what happens now.",

      "sentences": "So the negotiations to this point focused on a very specific group of people, women and children. That was what the agreement was, to release 50 women and children at the start, and then 10 women and children per day to extend the truce for 24 hours.This is where the disagreement comes in. Israel and the U.S. believe that Hamas is holding at least 17 women and children which would allow for at least one more day of pause. Hamas says they're not holding women and children at this point and wanted to move the discussions on to elderly men as well as men and women who were soldiers. It is on that point that the discussions fell apart. Hamas insisting that the women they are holding are soldiers, a point that Israel denies and said, look, they fall under the initial agreement, and before we move to other discussions, they have to be released. At that point discussions broke down. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he was pulling the Mossad team that was directing the negotiations out of Qatar back into Israel, and that effectively is the collapse of the ongoing diplomatic effort to keep this truce going that had been led by Qatar, the United States, and Egypt to have indirect discussions between Israel and Hamas. Now the question, what does it take to get those back on track? The problem is, of course, in the meantime, Israel and Hamas promised they were ready to resume fighting, and that's absolutely what we have seen, with Israel carrying out strikes across Gaza, 400 striking what they call terror targets in the first 24 hours after the truce, including some 50 strikes in southern Gaza in the city of Khan Younis. The challenge there is to the south that Israel told Palestinians in the north of Gaza strip to evacuate to. Meanwhile, Hamas has launched a barrage of rockets, some of them last night reaching us here in Tel Aviv, most of them directed toward the communities right around Gaza, as you see the force and the intensity with which this fighting has resumed. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is in the region, backed Israel's right to strike legitimate targets in Gaza, but also added that Israel must do more to protect civilians. So far, according to health authorities in Gaza, some 200 Palestinians have been killed since the truce expired.",

The CDC saying hospitalizations for cases of COVID-19, flu, and RSV are all on the rise. Overall, COVID-19 remains the main threat, with about 15,000 hospitalizations and 1,000 deaths every week despite the relatively low levels of the disease. For children, the CDC says it's seen a rapid rise in RSV infections. Weekly hospital admission rates have risen 69 percent since the first week of October.And here with us now, primary care physician, Dr. Saju Mathew. Dr. Mathew, thanks for coming on. We're just kind of laying out the current state for everybody. And according to that federal data, about three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds are currently in use nationwide. It's the highest capacity since December of last year. Why are these viruses spreading so fast right now? And I can't help but notice it was December of last year when this was happening. Is this just seasonal? DR. SAJU MATHEW, PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIALIST: I think part of it, Jessica, could be called something, the immunity gap. That's the scientific terminology that we use. We think that a lot of the COVID restrictions, keeping children away from other children, not letting them go to schools, basically prevented them from being exposed to these winter viruses, RSV, the cold, the flu. And now that most societies are wide open, we're seeing a rise in infections. So it's not surprising. It is the season where you're going to see a barrage of viruses. And just as you mentioned, RSV in children, Jessica, is the number one cause of hospitalizations below the age of two.",

A lot of times I ask patients to get that COVID PCR test, which is way more accurate, so you can rule that out.But almost always with flu, it's a sudden onset of fever and body aches. And now COVID-19 and the flu and cold have very similar symptoms. So really what you want to do is listen to the patient, listen to the onset of symptoms, the different type of symptoms that they have, and do some of these tests, like the COVID-19 test, the flu test, rule that out, and then decide what you think a patient might have.",

But before we get to that point, Donald Trump and his attorneys are trying to throw out the indictment. They're trying to challenge it any way they can.And this latest challenge from them was an argument that he had absolute immunity from the actions that he took while he was president. They claimed that everything in this indictment covers conduct that took place while he was the sitting president, and therefore he cannot be prosecuted. The only problem with that is that the judge completely disagreed. Judge Tanya Chutkan here in D.C. resoundingly rejected that argument. She said it's not supported by the text of the Constitution. It's not backed up by any Supreme Court precedent. This was an extensive ruling. It was 48 pages long. She said that it did not fit with the intentions of our founding fathers. She quoted Alexander Hamilton and \"The Federalist Papers,\" and even George Washington's farewell address where they made it clear the founding principles of this nation are that the president is not a king, that the president is not above the law. Jessica, let me read for you one of the key quotes from Judge Chutkan's ruling. She said, quote, \"Whatever immunities a sitting president may enjoy, the United States has only one chief executive at a time, and that position does not confer a lifelong get out of jail free pass.\" There's just some strong words from the judge. But it won't be the final word. Donald Trump is sure to appeal this ruling. He may take it all the way to the Supreme Court, and they probably will want to weigh in.
