Israel now declaring war on Hamas in Gaza after a truly unprecedented attack on Israeli soil. At least 40 people, Israelis, are dead, and more than 770 are wounded, we're told, official numbers coming in from the government of Israel. The attack catching Israel clearly by surprise. At sunrise earlier today, the Palestinian militant group launched their offensive by air, sea, and land. Hamas fighters have now infiltrated various Israeli towns, we're told, and thousands of rockets have rained down from the sky above over civilian populated areas of Israel. Israel is clearly already striking back, sending its own rockets into Gaza. And we've just gotten new numbers from Palestinian officials there. They say at least 198 Palestinians already have been killed in Gaza, and more than 1,600 people in Gaza are injured. This once again, according to the Palestinian health ministry there. This is quickly developing, this situation. We want to go back to CNN Hadas Gold who is watching it in Jerusalem for us. Update our viewers, Hadas, on the very latest.",

The Israelis have a decision to make, and it is going to be informed by politics as well as security. What is their response going to be? The prime minister has declared war, declared war on Hamas. When you declare war, you aim for victory. But I ask myself the basic question -- exactly what do the Israelis hope to achieve? Reoccupation of the Gaza Strip? A major ground incursion to destroy Hamas's military leadership, Mohammed Deif, who has already been a legitimate target of the Israelis, has been very vocal. And the Israelis may want to eliminate Hamas's leadership. But where does this go? That's the real problem. Where is the strategyto ensure that this is not a brutal and horrific rinse, wash, and repeat cycle? Because that's what it has proven to be over the last several decades when it comes to Israel's relations with Gaza and Hamas in particular. And you have a very risk averse Israeli prime minister under tremendous pressure from so many fronts now. His trial, the judicial overhaul, inherently risk averse, but he may very well be risk ready.

The Qataris, of course, have been serving as a sort of a bad men, funneling money, with Israeli acquiescence into Gaza, to sort of quiet the situation and to defuse Hamas's efforts to take on something like this.But I think on Hamas' part, this was an effort to demonstrate that Hamas is in the forefront leading the Palestinian national struggle against Israel. It is not Abbas. You think you can do Israel-Saudi normalization? Remember, we're here. And these attacks against civilian, terror attacks against civilians is part of that campaign to remind the Israelis they're here. Hamas may -- the Israelis may think it is unfinished business. I just don't see how, unless the Israelis are prepared to mount a major incursion, eliminate the Hamas leadership, somehow bring the Palestinian Authority back into Gaza, that there is going to be an end state here that is going to be better, somehow better, Wolf, than the one we've witnessed over the last several decades. I just don't see this. And I think American leverage here -- on the Saudi business, I think there is no way any administration in the wake of this -- you could end up with 100 Israeli dead or more by the time that this is over. No American administration is going to press Benjamin Netanyahu now for concessions, given this blatant, flagrant assault by Hamas to demonstrate that it, not Abbas, is the leader of the Palestinian national movement.

So what you're seeing is, as you mentioned, land, sea, and air components coming together, in essence, kind of a joint force type maneuver, using very cheap methods. And they are able to use small arms, they're able to use paragliders, motorized paragliders, to come into Israeli territory. Those have the purpose not only of evading Israeli defenses, Israeli radars and other defenses, but they also have the capacity to swarm into Israeli territory. And there is basically a swarm attack, both in the sense of the paragliders coming in as well as the number of rocks that have been used against Israeli targets. The idea there is to overwhelm the Iron Dome defense system, missile defense system that the Israelis have, which is exceptionally good. But any type of air defense system is going to be subsumed at some point by the shear number of missiles and rockets coming into.So this is, in essence, the kind of thing that we're looking at, trying to overwhelm as many Israeli defenses as possible. They will try to take temporarily at least some territory. But this is not a conventional war like the kind we're seeing in Ukraine. This is basically a larger guerrilla action on multiple fronts. And as such it presents a significant amount of challenge to both the Israeli Defense Forces and the Israeli police, because they're also going to be called upon to defend the communities, especially around Gaza.",

They're going to not only go after command and control nodes, like they traditionally do, but they are also going to go after individuals. They are probably going to try to mount an incursion into Gaza to try to dislodge some of the fighters, and frankly, for retribution. That's kind of the way this has been going, and that is I think what we're seeing here. So the Israeli response is going to be fairly massive. It's going to involve many members of their armed forces, and it's also going to require air power to be integrated with the ground forces. They will be using precision bombing in this campaign.",

They also have to reevaluate every bit of intelligence over the past several weeks. What did they miss? Did they see a pattern, but they didn't put it all together? How did this come as a surprise attack on Shabat, on a holy day in Israel?",

The fear right now is this war, and it is already being billed by the Israelis as a war, could dramatically escalate in the coming days and weeks, for that matter, to other fronts, not only in Gaza, but as you point out, in Lebanon, maybe even the West Bank.

The Israeli public, I'm already hearing from some, as I'm sure you're hearing from some friends over there, is furious about this. I've heard from the former officials who can't believe that this was missed. They're comparing it to not just the October War of 1973, when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel in a surprise attack, but to the U.S. 9/11 attacks that they had been caught so flatfooted.So when you have that kind of anger, that's the kind of thing that will drive the government to really crack down hard on Gaza and root out every last conspirator, as they see it. And Gaza is so tightly packed, there's no way to do that without also hitting civilian areas and taking civilian casualties.",

And as all of us know, in these weeks and months leading up to now, there were a lot of reservists who were saying they weren't going to go serve in the military because they oppose Netanyahu and his government's efforts to overhaul judiciary. But it looks like the reservists, whether pilots or intelligence operatives or commandos or whatever, if they're getting their orders to be activated, they are beginning to activate and go into military activity. At least that's what we're being told. This is significant, right?",

But in a time like this, when the nation is under attack, everyone pulls together.I've talked to some people who I consider on the leftwing of the Israeli spectrum, and they are sheltering in bomb shelters and scared right now. So I think that kind of fear and the number of casualties and all of the funerals we're going to see in the coming days is going to wipe away the internal political dissent, and they will unify and fight back. One of the reasons they need so many reservists is if they do something like a ground incursion into Gaza, which is at this point speculation, analysis, we don't know for sure that they're going to do that, but what they would do is use their active duty forces to do that kind of incursion, and then the reservists would most likely backfill a number of positions across the country, especially as, at this point, the security services have been gut punched, and they don't know where the next strike is coming from. And they want to cover all the bases because the Israeli people demand that.",

I have spoken to at least one, or communicated with at least one former official who believes that this could bring the Netanyahu government down. But then you have the question, this is a conservative government with a lot of nationalist members. It is arguably one of the most security-minded administrations Israel has had in decades. If they can't keep people safe, Israelis will wonder, who can? What can you do to stop this from happening again?",
