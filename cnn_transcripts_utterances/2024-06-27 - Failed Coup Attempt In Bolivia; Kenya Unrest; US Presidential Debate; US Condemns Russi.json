The president calling the public to mobilize in defense of democracy as officials arrested military rebels. We are live in the region. Plus, we are just hours away from the unprecedented Biden-Trump face off and America's first presidential debate of this year. And later, another whistleblower comes forward to reveal more of Boeing's dangerous secrets. So an attempt to overthrow Bolivia's democratically-elected government has been stopped, and the former army chief behind the failed coup d'etat is now in state custody after a dramatic confrontation with the Bolivian president inside a government palace. President Luis Arce reportedly told one Juan Jose Zuniga, I am your captain and I will not allow this insubordination. Zuniga was later shown handcuffed national TV before being forced into a police vehicle. This all comes a day after he was relieved of his duties. Earlier, armed vehicles were seen ramming the doors of the palace's armed troops around in government buildings in a main square in La Paz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because what we're seeing in the rest of the world, the militaries are going more and more into the army barracks. Here, we're seeing that many leaders have brought military men back into civilian life, Paula.Take, for example, former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, former president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and the military dictatorships in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. What happened in Bolivia today was perhaps just the cry of alarm. Bolivian institutions, they seem to have held strong, not many presidents perhaps would have faced off one on one with a coup attempt in general. But, of course, it's a cry of alarm that many people in the regions will pay very close attention to. Paula?",

In other words, he wants to return to power after having been out for five years and after assuming that Arce would give way in return power to him. So we don't really know. We do know that this General Zuniga gave a talk, gave an interview to the media over the weekend, where he threatened to go after Morales, and where he essentially acted., many say, at the behest of the current president. So we really don't know what happened, how much theater there was, whether in fact this was a -- a real coup or a self coup that now strengthens Arce's hand in the next few days and even next year.",

We are just hours away from the biggest events so far of the 2024 US presidential campaign, the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Now, the 90 minute face off will take place at CNN World headquarters in Atlanta. It's the earliest general election debate ever and the first between a president and a former president. It's also the first with a convicted felon on the stage is set, and the podiums, they are in place. The two men will be standing just eight feet apart, much closer than in any other time they've debated. Now, there is no clear leader in CNN's latest polls, and there has been no shortage. As you know, dissatisfaction for months now with either candidate. We're expecting close scrutiny of both men's age and mental acuity, the economy, immigration and crime are among the most important issues for voters. The Biden campaign says the president will focus on a number of key issues including abortion rights, and the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, attacks on democracy, political violence and 2020 election conspiracies and Donald Trump's economic plans. Sources say Mr. Biden is also preparing for Trump to go after his son, Hunter, who was convicted on three felony gun charges earlier this month.

And really strike down some of the criticisms against them.LANHEE CHEN, FELLOW, STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S HOOVER INSTITUTION: I do think it's an opportunity. I think it's particularly an opportunity for Joe Biden, because of the nature of the race, obviously, given Donald Trump's positioning in the key swing states that will decide the selection, the six key swing states where Donald Trump has, in some cases, a very narrow advantage, but an advantag nonetheless. I think for Joe Biden, he's got to look for opportunities to alter the nature of the race, to alter the trajectory of the race. And this debate presents an opportunity. Now, how long that impact lasts, I think Caroline's point about public opinion, you know, it's not clear that there will be a long lasting impact. But there will be an impact probably on the race, at least in the short to intermediate term. And Joe Biden is looking for every break he can get at this point, I think. So there is an opportunity for Biden, certainly there is an opportunity as well for Trump.

He needs to stay on the policy message, and not get pulled off by, you know, following the audience and meandering which sometimes he is known to do.And, you know, Lanhee brings up a really good point about how much more this will matter for Biden, if it matters at all. It just he has a lot more ground to make up. The he's behind in five out of six swing states. He's especially behind, if you look at the polling right now in Arizona, he's behind even in Michigan by big digits and in Nevada. And in fact, in the last week, we saw polling that Biden -- that Trump is now competitive in the states of Minnesota and Virginia, which are Democratic stronghold.

Yes, it might be a more subdued debate, which, you know, really -- really helps Trump.But at the end of the day, you know, I imagine that it will much more be about style over substance, right? And so -- and interesting, you talk about expectations, Paula. Trump has way lower the expectations for Biden. I mean, he just has to show up and not basically, you know, fall asleep like an old man during this debate. And he will done just fine because of the low expectations.
