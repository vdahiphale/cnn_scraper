Prosecutors in Georgia accuse Donald Trump of leading a criminal enterprise in an historic fourth indictment. China's youth unemployment numbers have gotten so bad Beijing says it will stop recording them. And the biggest companies in AI invite hackers to try to outsmart their chatbots. We will show you the results. Live from Atlanta, it is Tuesday, August 15th. I'm Lynda Kincaid, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, Donald Trump is lashing out as he faces a fourth criminal indictment, this one, in the US state of Georgia. A grand jury here accuses the former president and 18 others of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results. His former attorney, Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, the former White House chief-of-staff are among the co-defendants. All of them are being required to surrender to Georgia authorities by Friday, August 25th no later than noon. Marshall Cohen is in Washington following the developments for us and joins us live. Marshall, good to have you with us. So this is the fourth indictment after a two-year investigation, and it is not just Trump facing charges here, but his allies, including his chief-of- staff, his legal team, and some Republican officials here in Georgia. Could this case be the most consequential for Trump so far?",

His former chief-of-staff, Mark Meadows. Some of his most trusted attorneys and longtime advisers like Rudy Giuliani and others, members of the campaign, but it is so much bigger than the Trump White House and the Trump campaign.' This indictment alleges several different elements of a multi-pronged scheme to overturn the election. There was the phone calls that Donald Trump placed to his top officials in Georgia trying to twist their arms to flip the votes. There was the fake electors plot to try to subvert the Electoral College. The indictment also alleges intimidation of election workers, trying to persuade them to falsely admit that they had committed fraud, and even a breach of an election voting system in a rural county in Georgia by Trump supporters who were trying to prove the fraud. Lynda, it all ties back to the Big Lie from 2020 that the election here was stolen, it was not, and the attempt by Trump and these 18 other defendants to overturn that defeat, that is the basis of this landmark indictment in Fulton County in Atlanta.",

I am certain that many of the defendants are going to be lodging a ton of legal challenges between now and then. She also said in response to a question from our colleague, Sara Murray, that she wants to try all 19 defendants together as co-defendants. That means former President Trump at the defendant table with these other 18 individuals. Surely, they will try to fight that, prevent that because it could make their legal defenses complicated. She is going full speed ahead, the DA. Of course, it is going to be up to a judge to set this timing, set the schedule, and Lynda, this is just one of four potential criminal trials that Donald Trump might be facing while he is campaigning for the 2024 presidential race.",

But essentially, that is what she is saying, the prosecutor, that you ran a criminal enterprise, and in that criminal enterprise, it was very far ranging, very broad. You had a number of people who were carrying out the conspiracy. What is a conspiracy? It's when two or more minds meet, and they engage in steps to have crimes committed. And what were those crimes? A crime, the core, was to really overturn this election. And so this was a very broad-ranging type of program that they were following in order to supplement electors. Georgia has 16 electors, long story, Electoral College, et cetera. But the reality is, is that they were supplanting real with fake, attempting to do that. They were looking at people who were really having an oath of office, public officials, state legislatures, and trying to get them to avoid that, of course, looking to the vice president of the United States to do that, trying to intimidate election workers, breaking into a computer system software as it relates to votes -- and so a number of things that should not have been done. The electoral process is pretty sacrosanct, right? I mean, you have to respect it. What this indictment alleges, is that Mr. Trump and these 18 others did not respect that process, and it goes through, Lynda, chapter and verse with regard to the activities they engaged in as we looked at them there to circumvent the electoral process. So it's a significant development, and quite frankly, I think it's something that the president and those that we see there need to be very concerned about, particularly because of the consequences associated with a conviction.",

We never know anything with certainty, but what happens is, when you have 18 defendants,the general experience is that of that 18, they get pared down very readily. Well, how does that happen? The first way it happens is that there are people where the evidence is so compelling, and this is just an indictment; an indictment in the United States is an accusation. It's an accusation that suggests that there is probable cause to believe that you engaged in criminality, right, the targets of the investigation did. It's not proof beyond any reasonable doubt, et cetera, far different. However, having said that, what happens is sometimes the evidence as we look at all the charges Mr. Trump is facing, are so compelling that of the 18, you may have those who take pleas, right, that means a plea bargain, I plead guilty, you got me. Nothing to see here and I'm doing it now because I want some leniency. Then you have another paring who want to take pleas, maybe the prosecutor will not allow them unless they turn state's evidence, meaning you're going to cooperate, that pares it down further. Then you have defense lawyers who make what's called Lynda, a motion to sever, that means I want my client separated from everybody else because he deserves a fair trial, and if he is lumped in with everyone else, the reality is birds of a feather flock together, jury will get the wrong impression, he'll get convicted. So there'll be a lot of motions made to pare it down from the practical realities it will be pared down, and in a six-month process, that's very aggressive, it is very ambitious.

But remember that you have 50 states in the United States, and each state is a sovereign. They have their own rules, their own laws. They are governed by them, and so to what extent should a state not be independent? And why would the federal government take authority and jurisdiction over something that is a violation of state law?

The National Bureau of Statistics announced the suspension on Tuesday, which quickly led to criticism and ridicule on Chinese social media. Now previously, the bureau had put out this data, which looks at the urban unemployment rates for 16 to 24-year-olds every month. Now officials are saying the methodology of these statistics needs some work. On Tuesday, Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said young people are now spending more time in school. So there's debate over whether students looking for jobs before graduation should be included in this data. It needs further research, he added. The bureau will now conduct in-depth research to improve its methodology and will once again start releasing the data once the process is completed, he said, without giving any timeframe. Now, this news immediately started trending online, with some critics suggesting this was an excuse by China to detract from data it doesn't want more attention on. After all, China's youth unemployment rate has had consecutive record highs lately. From April to June, it shot up to 20.4 percent, 20.8 percent, and 21.3 percent respectively, for 16 to 24-year-old, figures that have caused huge concern as more than 11 million college grads look for work this year. Also on Tuesday, China released new data that pointed to a slowdown on multiple fronts including consumer spending, factory production and investment in fixed assets. Now policymakers have taken some steps to help support the economy, but economists say that much more needs to be done. Michelle Toh, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Wagner mutiny in June also shook the currency market. Right now, according to the Central Bank, supply is not keeping up with demand in Russia and that is driving imports higher at the same time as export revenues are down partly of course, because of sanctions and lower oil prices. This was a risky move in some ways. A weaker ruble was good for exports and higher interest rates will be felt by the Russian people, but the weaker ruble is also a potential threat, not only to financial, but to political stability, an unwelcome signal to the population that Fortress Russia isn't invincible, something Moscow couldn't risk if it's going to keep up public support for this increasingly costly war.

It is exactly as you said, this was the biggest military parade in Poland since the Cold War, but it has to be noted that this is an annual event. This was not some special one-off. This is something that happens every year. It was put on hold for a few years due to the pandemic and due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And today in Warsaw, there were 2,000 service members; there were 200 items of equipment; there were 92 aircrafts present, and on display were Abrams tanks bought from the United States, South Korean K-2 tanks, K-9 self- propelled howitzers, HIMARS rocket launchers and Patriot air defense systems. Also FA-50 combat aircraft, AW-101 chopper, also Polish-made Borsuk infantry fighting vehicles and Rosomak armored personnel carriers. They were things that are in the Polish arsenal, they have been here for decades, things that have only recently arrived to Poland and equipment that has only just been ordered, but has not been taken delivery of just yet.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's become the most beleaguered symbol of Russian occupation. This weekend, Moscow saying this incident was just a smokescreen, foiling a Ukrainian attack on the $4 billion Kerch Bridge, the link between Russia and occupied Crimea that Putin seems to dote on. Now CNN has obtained exclusive footage, heralding a new way of warfare of another earlier devastating Ukrainian seaborne drone strike there in July from the Ukrainian Security Services, the SBU who say they did it and more will follow. This is exactly what the drone pilots saw, thermal imagery, the water rippling as up to a ton of explosive approaches the bridge. The feed, then obviously went dead as it hit the concrete. Russian officials said two civilians died in the attack. Cameras on the bridge captured the first blast on the road section, the cursor shows the drone moving in, and another on the railway tracks at about the same time. Ukraine has been coy, some officials saying these huge blasts are from \"an identified floating object,\" but no longer. The head of the Ukrainian Security Services told CNN this is just the start. VASYL MAILUK, HEAD OF SBU (through translator): Sea-surface drones are unique invention of the Security Service of Ukraine. None of the private companies are involved. Using these drones, we have recently conducted successful hits to the Crimean bridge, a biggest assault ship, Olenegorsky Gornyak and SIG tanker. WALSH (voice over): This, another Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian amphibious assault boat, the Olenegorsky Gorniak on which Ukrainian officials said, a hundred personnel were on board. It was a remarkable feat carried out by a growing fleet of what they call the sea babies. Hundreds of miles away from Ukrainian bases, and right in Russia's coastal heartland, it put the Black Seas east suddenly at risk. MAILUK (through translator): These drones are produced and an underground production facility in Ukraine. We are working on a number of new interesting operations including in the Black Sea waters. I promise you, it will be exciting, especially for our enemies. WALSH (voice over): Ukraine's ingenuity again and again, toppling the lumbering Russian Goliath.

In the case in Washington, D.C., they're trying to move it out of diverse, Democratic, Washington, because they say he won't get a fair trial with an untainted jury pool there. And they want to move it to West Virginia, one of the most conservative states in the union, where Trump won with 70 percent of the vote in 2020. This is the fundamental plank of their campaign, that this was all political. This can work, I think, in a political context outside the courtroom. But the standards of evidence are much stricter inside the courtroom. I think you're seeing a lot of the judges, in these cases, trying to keep politics out. The judge in Washington, D.C., in the January 6 last week, talked about how Donald Trump's day job, i.e. running for president, couldn't take precedence over the fact he was a criminal defendant. So this is all political. Basically, the entire U.S. political campaign before the next election right now is bound up in Donald Trump's trials, one way or the other.

All he said was that the Taliban needs to wait for the environment to become favorable. It is important to note that this was the very same line that the Taliban gave back in the 1990s when they ruled for five years. In that time, girls were never allowed to return to  school.

It was part of DEF CON, the world's largest hacking conference. The task before them was to trick the chatbots into doing things they shouldn't, like generating fake news, making defamatory statements and giving up potentially dangerous information. Donie O'Sullivan was at DEF CON and joins us now from New York. Good to see you. Obviously, the question about whether artificial intelligence will destroy humanity and whether it'll take over the world has been a question and a conspiracy that's been discussed well before the launch of AI. You went to this hacking conference where so-called ethical hackers were asked to, kind of, test these chatbots. What did you find? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN TECH CORRESPONDENT: Exactly. This is a pretty common tactic in the cybersecurity world, of right teaming. Essentially you have these hackers who try to attack your systems to see where they can be vulnerable. When it comes to AI, the chatbots like ChatGPT that we all know are supposed to have guardrails in place where they're not supposed to do certain things. And this weekend, in Vegas, thousands of hackers tried to take them on. But before we went to Vegas, we stopped by Pittsburgh to Carnegie Mellon University where some professors also tried trickling these AI bots, have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
