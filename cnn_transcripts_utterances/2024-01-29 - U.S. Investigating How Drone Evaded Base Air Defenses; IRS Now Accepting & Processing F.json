We got to figure out -- the intelligence now is marching down the path to determine with a level of certainty, who directed it, and then who actually executed this strike. The United States will not go after targets within Iran, that's fair to say.There certainly are targets where proxies are located, where their inventories are located, where the fighters are located, may not be the same location as where their inventory or the capacity is located. So, you've got to be able to have a very robust target list. And there needs to be a sequence of attacks that take place. The response minimally cannot be a one-and-done. There has to be a very strong, very crushing blow. It won't eliminate the capacity, but it needs to attract it sufficiently. And then you need to see how the enemy responds. And then you go after those responses. That's the notion of action, reaction, and counteraction, which is the construct that you use in a planning and execution environment.",

If you try to strike everywhere, you'll dilute yourself, and you'll strike nowhere, essentially.So, in this particular case, the strike that came after Tower 22, and caused the casualties and the deaths, that needs to be responded very, very precisely. Don't try to solve every problem all at once. Make a very hard, very precise strike, and then keep up the pressure against those that did this strike. Simultaneously, we have a presence in the Red Sea that will continue. But don't escalate that. There certainly are laws of proportionality that the United States pays attention to, and in this case, we need to do that here.",

She had abdominal surgery. Kensington Palace though not saying exactly what it was for. Her recovery is expected to take months still, and she will not return to royal duties until sometime after Easter.The Russian figure skater at the center of the doping allegations during the 2022 Winter Olympics has officially been slapped with a four-year ban and retroactively disqualified from those games. The Governing Body overseeing this whole thing found that Kamila Valieva, she was guilty of doping -- they found her guilty of doping after she tested positive for a medication used to increase endurance. But it's still unclear what the verdict will mean for the Russian team who won gold in Beijing. It could go, the gold to the United States, which came in second. The final decision on that will be made by the IOC and the International Skating Union. The Kansas City Chiefs are headed back to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in the last five years. Super Bowl 58 in Las Vegas is going to be a rematch now of the 2020 thriller against the San Francisco 49ers. The Niners crushed the hopes and dreams of people across the world.

We've been hard at work getting ready for filing season, making all kinds of improvements to help taxpayers if they need our support.

And what we're doing is we're adding another option to that list. Small pilot this year, it'll be in 12 states starting in mid- March for simple tax returns.

So, if someone's knocking at your door, it's not the IRS. And that is important because one thing that I'm very worried about and I'm worried about every tax season is scams.And filing season is when bad actors come out of the woodwork. They have promises of fake tax benefits or false threats of a tax penalty that doesn't exist. Sometimes they show up at your door often they call you. Well. I can tell taxpayers first of all, if it's an unannounced visit, it's not the IRS. And second. The IRS will rarely call you. And in the rare exception that the IRS does call you, there are things we will never do. We will never demand immediate payment using a prepaid debit card or gift card. We will -- the IRS will never demand immediate payment and threaten to bring in law enforcement to arrest or deport you. I would encourage taxpayers to go to irs.gov to search free help. We have a ton of information on scams, the latest scams, and tricks what to be on the lookout for and by staying educated. You can avoid these scams and protect yourself and your family.",
