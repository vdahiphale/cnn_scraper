National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman is about to answer questions on the catastrophic bridge collapse in Baltimore. Will bring that to you when it begins any minute now. And these are live pictures of what's left to the Francis Scott Key Bridge where search and rescue teams are desperately looking for survivors in the Patapsco River. This video shows the moment of impact on a large containership hit a support column on the massive bridge, plunging cars and people into frigid waters. Officials are describing it as a mass casualty event. The damage that you see here up close is just hard to comprehend, especially for the tens of thousands of people that cross over the bridge every day. And that includes Maryland Governor Wes Moore. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD): We know the Key Bridge. I've been (ph) over the Key Bridge countless times. So many of us know the Key Bridge because it is our normal commute. This is a place that is a normal commute route for over 30,000 Marylanders every single day. And so, to hear the words that the Key Bridge has collapsed, it's shocking and heartbreaking.

I'm going to step out of the way and let you take a closer view of that massive container ship just down the way you can see mangled pieces of steel what's left of the Key Bridge laying across the front of that ship as well as steel on either side of the boat. They're down in the water. You can also see their boats, several of them still out there with divers that have been searching through the water still looking for six construction workers that are believed to be in the water still missing. Over the past few hours, they managed to pull two people from the water one of them was basically unharmed. The other taken to the hospital with serious injuries.And look we are more than 10 hours into this operation at this point and we are talking about freezing cold water Manu. I was here as you mentioned early this morning, conditions were brutal. Strong winds, choppy water things have definitely calmed down since then. But of course, that is a long time for anyone to be in this water. We have heard from officials who talked about the moments before the bridge collapse, that vessel seeming to lose control, maybe losing power. You talk about flickering lights that we saw just before it collided with the column of that bridge, but we do know they are still very much in search and rescue operation mode. We have seen vehicles along the riverbank not far from -- from the site where this is unfolding. But bear in mind, this is not a small section of river that they are searching. It is a huge part of the bridge that fell early this morning. And so, we have watched Coast Guard helicopters and so many more than a dozen of these rescue boats that have been combing the water just searching for any indication of life. But the reality is the clock is ticking. We have heard that from first responders from officials who have given these press conferences. But they have said they are still going through with this search and rescue even as the morning turns into afternoon, Manu, there -- they are holding on to hope that they can find someone find people and save some lives.",

Will zoom -- excuse me, will zoom in closer to where you can see rescue operations are ongoing here. Several smaller vessels, police vessels and others go just buzzing around the -- the main ship there that's the (INAUDIBLE) about 1000 feet long that slammed into the bridge there. You can see from our angle here, we're about 1000 yards away, maybe a little bit more.This was a fully loaded tanker ship that just slammed into this bridge with massive force. This was fully loaded because it was outgoing at the time of the accident. And you can see the entire center of the bridge has just gone. Remnants of the bridge on to the left and to the right in the water. And as Gabe mentioned from his angle, you can also see from our angle, you can see parts of that bridge, kind of gliding across the bow of the ship itself on the other side there. And you can see some of the damage there as we zoom in tighter here. This as we mentioned, this is an ongoing rescue operation. The only vessels that are allowed here are rescue and recovery boats, and there have been divert -- dive teams in the water all morning. Now we mentioned the treacherous conditions for them as well. This water is extremely cold, 46 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit, very treacherous conditions for divers. And of course, for anyone who might have fallen in the water, you can only survive in that water for maybe one to three hours, according to experts. So, the condition of the water and the currents. The water is smooth right now at the surface. But the currents are also a factor here. Pretty strong currents coming in and out of here is that we're in the Baltimore Harbor in the Patapsco River area here. What we can tell you also is that this bridge is a very important hub for transportation up and down the East Coast for hazardous material. Hazardous materials not allowed into the tunnels around Baltimore that were most of the vehicle traffic goes up and down the East Coast, but it is allowed on this bridge going up and down the East Coast. So, hazard -- hazmat materials cannot be transported here. This is also a massive disruption because no vessels, no ships, no cargo ships, no container ships can come in or out of here. And that could take days to rectify. I did speak to a gentleman here who's involved in the -- in the effort to kind of salvage whatever's left to the bridge. He said it's going to take days just for floating cranes to get here to be able to pull some of this wreckage out of the water. And when they get here, they're going to have to cut parts of the -- the bridge that have collapsed into smaller pieces in order to remove it. And that could take days. So, Manu, that gives you an idea of the disruption here.",

And the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report card every year on the infrastructure in America and especially -- specifically roads and bridges in America. So, this was not a structurally deficient bridge, according to Maryland Governor Wes Moore, served about 13,000 cars a day a few million every year. So, this is pretty critical.The good news here and maybe the only silver lining in all of this is that this may not pose that much of a problem for traffic in the Baltimore area because there are two other tunnels, the Francis Scott Key, sorry, the -- the Fort McHenry tunnel, and then also the Baltimore Harbor tunnel. So, people will still be able to get around. Although this is creating a little bit of a bottleneck, at least here for now.",

The FBI has a lot of things to be able to contribute there, not the least of which is the underwater search and rescue team. They have a lot of experience using side scan sonar, deployed from boats, with divers in the water to help find things people, vehicles, whatever that might be on the -- on the bottom. And they need a lot of those resources right now with a crime scene this large. So, I'm sure they're doing that.As far as the investigation goes. They are likely helping process the review of kind of backgrounds of the folks who are -- who are identified as crew members and the -- and of course, the pilot, they may participate in interviews of those individuals to rule out things like terrorism or criminal activity. But all the indicators so far is that that's the direction we're headed. This seems to have been, you know, essentially a tragic kind of industrial size accident. There may in fact be recklessness or negligence underlying some of -- some of what took place on the boat. We don't know that yet. If there -- if there is criminal charges are certainly are not impossible in those circumstances, but the big ticket items like terrorism and intentional sabotage of the vehicle of the vessel or the bridge.

And they say they object to that and that's what gives them standing. [12:20:08] But lawyers for the government have said, wait a second, you haven't actually been harmed, there's no imminent harm. And there are already federal exemptions and protections for you if you object to something related to abortion in terms of medical treatment.

And I just wanted to tell you that whenever there's a big argument like this, you know, you get lots of people coming there as a field trip and for different reasons.And, you know, I'll just mention a couple of people in mind. This is just right up your street. Senator Josh Hawley was there because his wife Erin, Hawley represents the challengers here saying that physicians who are anti-abortion are harmed by these FDA provisions. And they're the ones challenging. But also, Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, because the states are very much involved on the periphery of trying to have a stake in this. So, I can tell you that it was, you could -- you could feel the energy in the room. But you could also feel if you take this at face value, just face value, and I'm going to give you a caveat on why the justices, key justices, Justices Kavanaugh, Justices Barrett and the Chief Justice John Roberts, seem to have enough skepticism that these anti-abortion physicians who do not prescribe Mifepristone but who are claiming that their emergency room were are affected by botched abortions, that they have standing, but there was a less suspicion about that. Do they really have -- they ever had to really participate in terminating a pregnancy? But I do -- the one caution I have is that sometimes Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett can send a little bit of a false signal, especially on the issue of abortion. But I think as it stands, these -- the court will probably not get to the merits of the FDA's provisions, that they will stop it and say this particular group had no grounds to bring the lawsuit.
