Who caused a massive breach in the biggest dam in Ukraine.A senior U.N. official says this could be the most significant damage to civilian infrastructure since the start of the war. Water has been gushing from the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine after part of the dam wall collapsed just over 24 hours ago. With floodwaters rising downriver, evacuations have been ordered for multiple towns and cities, including Kherson. One official says more than 1,300 homes along the west bank of the Dnipro River appear to be underwater. Kyiv says Russian forces which have controlled the reservoir since the early days of the war, littered the area with explosives and are responsible for the breach. Moscow says a Ukrainian attack is to blame. Both, however, acknowledged the dam's destruction will cause severe environmental damage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The whole world will know about this Russian war crime, the crime of ecocide, such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers of the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydro power plant is an environmental bomb of mass destruction. SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): In order to prevent offensive actions by the Russian army in the Kherson region. Kyiv regime carried out an act of sabotage, in fact, a terrorist act, which has led to the flooding of large areas and will have severe and long term environmental consequences. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
