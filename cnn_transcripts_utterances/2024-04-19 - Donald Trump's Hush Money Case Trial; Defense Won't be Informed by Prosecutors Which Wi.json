One more was selected just a few moments ago. Four additional alternates are now needed, and the judge thinks they are on track to start opening statements on Monday.Now, ahead of that, the prosecution is playing hardball with the witness list, refusing to tell Trump's attorneys who they're -- they will call to stand first. They are not extending that courtesy due to Trump's repeated posts about the case. The defense even offered to assure the court that the former president would not post about anyone on the list.

Then you have to have the six alternates.Now, there were questions today where they could actually get to that number, given that yesterday, even those two jurors who had already been seated were that eventually dismissed. One because she felt she could not be impartial, given that her anonymity she felt had been compromised. The other who apparently had been disingenuous on a form in response to that jury questionnaire. The question now has been whether there will be the ability to get those six alternate jurors who, we are told, are likely aware that they indeed will be alternate jurors, but they will have to still be focused, nonetheless. I want to bring in Evan Perez because we're learning a lot of information today, Evan. It's interesting because we know that Donald Trump coming into this has said in no uncertain terms, he does not think he can get an impartial juror.

Falsifying of records. And so, they're going to have to lay out how those connections take place.They also are going to have to lay out what they intend to present as evidence in terms of the knowledge that the former president had and the intent that he had.

And it really does seem to indicate that we're into a period now of ambiguity and not escalation. And this is a sort of strategic off ramp that both Israel and Iran appear to be taking. The reason I say that is a few hours after the explosions were reported in Iran, I contacted a regional intelligence source who told me from all the information he had didn't appear that Iran was going to respond.And what we heard from Iranian officials today was saying that this -- these incidents were under investigation. That the air defense systems that have been triggered earlier in the night had intercepted some objects, which in Iranian political speak really is nothing to see here. The reaction that we did see in Tehran were clearly government sanctioned, protests on the streets of Tehran, anti-Israeli -- anti- Israel protests taking place. So, the voice that the government is speaking with is not missiles, and that was the threat, of course, by Iran's foreign minister almost as those strikes were taking place. He told CNN's Erin Burnett that there would be, instant and devastating response if Israel was to strike. So, we don't seem to be in that place. And the ambiguity is also on the Israeli side because we're not hearing from the Prime Minister or anyone else saying, yes, we responded. We did our job. This is what we did. X, Y and Z. It's not that. The only thing that we've heard was from a far-right member of Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Taking to the social -- social media platform X saying, lame. And he was quickly lambasted by opposition, politician Yair Lapid, who said that this was damaging to Israel's security interests, something that could be heard from Tehran to Washington. Even neither of them actually saying that Israel had carried out the strikes, implicit in the statements. [13:15:00] But yes, ambiguity rather than escalation. And of course, that's what, all regional partners here, the United States, European allies as well, have all been calling for. It doesn't mean the war and the tensions are over between Iran and Israel. It just means that the direct strikes are not going to happen at the moment.

But just to show some of the video that we've seen from Isfahan here is some flashes in the sky, indicate that air defense assets were trying to shoot down whatever object was coming toward them. So, there's several theories as to what those objects actually were. There's a lot of reporting about drones possibly being used by the Israelis.

And there's no way that a drone like a velociraptor drone, the ones that you can buy in a hobby store, can make it all the way without, you know, without crashing.So, what probably happened there, if it was that kind of a drone, is that they were launched either in Iran itself or possibly in Iraq, depending on exactly what type of drone it was. So, there's some kind of mechanism or facility that the Israelis used to actually go ahead and go into an area where they could actually use those drones in a way that that would actually work and especially if they were hitting here.
