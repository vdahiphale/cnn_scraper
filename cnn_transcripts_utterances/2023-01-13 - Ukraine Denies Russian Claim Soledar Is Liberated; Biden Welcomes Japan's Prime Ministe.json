We are on Broad Street, which is the main street here in downtown Selma. And as you look this direction, you can just see how the storm plowed through this area. We're going to walk this way to show you that building in the background, as we were looking around and even doing our own assessment, there are houses that they still haven't been able to reach, because there are trees down throughout this area. Power companies have been surging in to try to restore some of the power and phone service is very spotty throughout this area. The terrifying part about this, we were talking to people who did not know this storm was going to be that powerful, had to run for a closet because they were terrified by what they were hearing.

They're confident that they can hold these positions, a rear position, but what appears to be going on is an organized pullout from the town of Soledar. We've been watching as they've been firing mortars in the direction of Russian positions and rockets, as well. You can hear in fact, some of the thuds of some of that fire.

We're talking about 10-30 meters away from the enemy and fighting in very small groups, maybe four to 15 people is what he said. He also said that the Wagner mercenaries well, they were extremely bold and not in the smartest way. He said that some of them didn't have any small arms at all. He said they came armed only with grenades trying to get as close to Ukrainian positions as they could, and then firing grenades before they would inevitably be killed. He described that as a kind of suicide mission. As for where the town actually stands at the moment, he says, first off, the strategic importance of it is not all that high. Second off, he says that there are still Ukrainians inside of the town, but they have just a very small toehold on the western edge, a very minor slice of the town as for a full withdrawal, he expects that will happen in the coming days. Listen. CAPTAIN TARAS BEREZOVETS, 1ST SPECIAL FORCES BRIGADE, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES: I believe this decision, this decision to withdraw will be made within the coming days.

The move comes as analysts say Russia seems to be gearing up for a massive Spring Offensive after mobilizing more than 300,000 people late last year. But also with its top brass under fire as the only gains Russia is making around the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine are coming thanks to the private Military group Wagner. Wagner's boss Yevgeny Prigozhin has ripped into the Army's leadership essentially calling the generals running the war incompetent. And now in an audio message making clear, he is the only one who can give Putin some wins. \"I want to emphasize that in the storm of Soledar no other units participated than Wagner.\" Wagner is known for extreme brutality. This video purports to show the mercenaries advancing around Soledar, passing the bodies of dead Ukrainian troops. Insiders are convicts recruited from Russian jails with the promise of freedom if they survive. It's not clear whether the army's change of command is a move to counter Prigozhin's pressure and many folks on Moscow streets certainly weren't keen to comment.

Now, if the pattern of the old Soviet Union is to be repeated, and this has been a criticism leveled at the Putin's regime, but above all at his generals by none other than Prigozhin of the Wagner group. If they are pursuing a Soviet style effort here, then what will have gone on is that the generals and others will have stolen a lot of the money, briefed back up through the system that everything is absolutely fine, that the plans for the invasion of Kyiv were absolutely rock solid. And then they're confronted with the reality on the ground, which is that they've been lying about their military capability. Now, this is a major frustration for the Russians on top of their very poor doctrinal approach. They are being completely outmaneuvered literally and out-thought, by the Ukrainians with much smaller forces, much, much fewer weapons. But because they've had NATO training that has completely changed the form of warfare that they're pursuing on the ground. Now, the reason the Wagner group is able to boast about its successes, perhaps even have a few successes is it's a very linear structure. It has a CEO, if you like, and then it has subordinates, and very few people in the system to steal and to bend the rules. But what we're really also seeing here, again, is perhaps echoes of the late Soviet era, is the fraying of the system around Vladimir Putin. He's losing his temper with his cabinet ministers. He's losing his temper with his generals, we've had two or three replacements of the battlefield commander in the east of Ukraine. Now we've got Gerasimov, the author of the main doctrine, the International doctrine of Russia in terms of Military operations, which is permanent destabilization chaos in the ranks of the enemy is victory.

To give you some context, it's the worst drop since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak in February 2020. So what's behind the contraction?

So I think the message that he may be sidelined from his position, mindful that his term was supposed to come to an end months ago, however, they decided to extend it, just give him give him enough time to complete the nuclear negotiations, which have been stalled for months now. If he is sidelined from this position, the question arises, what's next with the nuclear deal? What kind of signaling is going on here if Biden does not intend to revive it, to take any additional measures, especially given the political climate harding because of the protests because of he wants Military cooperation with Russia, all of those things complicating the picture. And this suggests to me that we're going to see potentially a heightening of an escalation of the nuclear crisis in the coming weeks and months.",

However, personally, I don't see this case having great bilateral UK-Iran ramifications or dimensions. I think it's mostly about internal politics. It's about how key segments of the IRGC want to position themselves, particularly amid leadership transition. That's what this is all about in my view. Iran is undergoing leadership transition. The current Supreme Leader is in his - in his 80s. He's not, he hasn't been well, all of this is going on. It's about setting all the chips in place for the day when he passes away or when he steps down. Which faction will be strongest that day, and right now what we're seeing is that the hardliners are empowered by these protests, are empowered by their ability to crack down and now they're going after even the conservatives having sidelined reformists.

And they have found these documents in three separate locations, one at President Biden's privateoffice in Washington, DC, and two locations at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. One in the garage and one in an adjacent room and the White House and his, President Biden's lawyers haven't specifically said what those documents are. But people familiar with them say that they do include classified material about foreign governments, including about Ukraine, including about Iran. And we have just learned today that some of the documents included a memo that President Biden wrote to then President Barack Obama, as well as briefing materials about phone calls that he placed to the British Prime Minister, and to Donald Tusk, who is then the President of the European Council. And so these are documents that were found, that should have been turned over to the National Archives. And what we're learning from people who were involved in the process of packing the President's materials at the end of the Obama administration is that this was a very chaotic process. Because President Biden was very intent on continuing his job, he continued meeting with world leaders. In fact, just in the three days before he left office, he took an international trip to go to Ukraine. He also spoke at Davos, he met with the Chinese President Xi Jinping at Davos, he met with leaders in Ukraine. And so there was all of these activities that were ongoing at the time that made packing up his office very difficult. So Junior level aides had to work basically overnight to get all of this classified material into his boxes. And these are the circumstances that these classified materials ended up with President Biden's personal effects. Now these are all questions that the special counsel will now want to answer. And we still don't know specifically, who packed those boxes, who brought them to President Biden's office and who brought them to his home. But it does sort of fill out some of the picture of how this all may have happened back in 2017, Becky.",
