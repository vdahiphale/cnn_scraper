But certainly, come Monday and Tuesday, for certain, things are going to change. The big concern is will people come to try and cause some kind of disruption? And that is certainly something that law enforcement is looking for there, FBI and other intelligence officials, looking at social media, and other sources and methods, trying to determine if anyone's going to come here and start any trouble. The key here, obviously, for the Secret Service is to get the president in here safely. The plan right now is to bring him underground so that they don't have to walk him into the courtroom, that they would drive him in through one of the driveways here underground, and get him into the courthouse, and process him, get him up to the courtroom, get him arraigned, and get him out. And it's expected that he will leave and perhaps head back to New Jersey where he spends the summer.

They had provisions when they took off on their flight on May 1st, the flight, as we know, crash in the middle of the jungle. Unfortunately the mother of the four children and two other adults perished in that crash. What is most important right now that we're hearing from officials is that the children are in safe condition, they're in stable conditions. They're out of critical danger. It was hard to see yesterday at the hospital when the director of the Colombian children's welfare institute said that when she visited them, the two youngest children who are for, she is a one year old baby, they were very playful, they want to play, and they wanted to get out of their hospital wards.

He did say, however, that military forces had advanced nearly a mile in some parts of Bkhmut.CNN's Sam Kiley is in Kyiv with more on this. So, Sam, we should separate what's happening in Bakhmut with this counteroffensive because of the fight in Bakhmut has been going on for months. [08:20:00] SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, absolutely, Victor, dead on there. And it may develop into part of the counteroffensive, particularly with this recent push in which the Ukrainians are claiming to capture about a mile of territory. A few days prior to that, they claimed of have captured about two miles. Cumulatively, they have been able to punch through significant salient into the southeast and areas south of the city of Bakhmut, that they could potentially explode as part of the wider counteroffensive. But as you rightly note there, Victor, this has been what both sides have described as, I quote, the meat grinder, because of the level of intensity of the fighting there. It's also been a great deal of infighting between, particularly the Wagner mercenary group and the 72nd brigade there with very dramatic developments between -- and squabbling between officers on the Russian side. So, I think, again, the Ukrainians would like to exploit. And they are, I think, we are seeing the early stages of a counteroffensive and have been seeing it for sometime in the shaping operations, particularly around Zaporizhzhia, with a very significant increase in the number of Ukrainian probing attacks on those heavily fortified frontlines in the direction of the Crimean peninsula, which will be a major prize and then a ground offensive by the Ukrainians if they do eventually launch something that we would all recognize it was a massive push, the sort that I covered twice last year with those very big pushes when they liberated the territory around Kharkiv and then later on recapture the city of Kherson -- Victor, Amara.",

We shouldn't give him a hall pass just because he has on his resume or his LinkedIn account that he's the former president of the United States. He broke the law and it is being proven. And I think the weight of that and continued now we've got the Fulton County case that's going to come most likely somewhere in the August range and a second federal DOJ investigation around January 6. You add all of that together, could you imagine being 77 years old and getting up and having to tackle that every day before lunch and then go try to tackle, try to convince tens of millions of Americans to vote for you.

It is just shifting a little bit farther east into new states that we didn't have yesterday. But we do still have the potential over Oklahoma and Texas which also had it yesterday. We're now just adding some more southeastern states into the mix that have the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms. Already this morning you have got some thunderstorms making their way into Cincinnati and also several around the Atlanta area. This is the first wave. Then you're going to start to see a secondary wave come back this afternoon and into the evening hours. That is where the bulk is going to be for the chance for strong to severe thunderstorms. Places like Dallas, Little Rock, Jackson, Mississippi, Shreveport, Nashville, Huntsville, Atlanta -- all of these cities have the potential for those severe thunderstorms. The main threats again will still be damaging winds and the potential for some large hail. But we cannot rule out an isolated tornado especially around the Tennessee Valley region. There is that first wave. Here is the secondary wave that comes in right behind it. So there is not really going to be much in the way of a break in between those two rounds especially for cities like Atlanta, Nashville, Knoxville, even Cincinnati -- a lot of these areas it's going to be back to back. So if you've got some travel up and down say Interstate 75 today it is likely going to be pretty close to a washout for much of the day today as these storms continue to progress off to the east. But also some heavy rain. Maybe not as high of a chance for the strong to severe thunderstorms but of the potential for some isolated flooding for states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, as well as Michigan. But the best chance for that flooding is going to be to the southeast where you have those multiple rounds coming in. Areas like Atlanta, Nashville, Memphis, and then the secondary area out to the west that include cities like Denver, also looking at the potential for some flooding as we go through the rest of the day today.",
