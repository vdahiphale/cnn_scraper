But it is not compelling enough to say that you have to use race exclusively as a factor or a plus factor or a quota or part of a holistic notion.Now, many will quibble with that very portion of his opinion and it accords to other aspects as well. But I think overall, what we're seeing here is the value of precedent and the shaping of precedent and the nuances of it over periods of time that are far shorter than they used to be. Remember, Roe v. Wade was a nearly 50-year-long precedent. Many attacks about it. Many attacks were in the form of litigation. Now, you've got affirmative action being recently decided in 2016, as Steve pointed out. And now the contours are yet again reshaped. I think you should expect to have some form of litigation still pending because it is not black and white. Forgive the pun. But it is not a black-and-white issue to think about how one is able to objectively assess subjective criteria of an application and application process.",

Because that's where black Americans are suffering right now. It's at the K-12 level. At the college level, you can't change a lot of the things that are going on in their lives, but you can at the K-12 level. That is what I would encourage people to do.",

And now, this.And the question is, when does this happen? I think the answer is that this is a result in part of elections having consequences. Supreme Court nominations have enormous consequences. This one today is a little different because the Supreme Court had 20 years ago, put a time clock of sorts. In the majority opinion, then they said, we're going to keep affirmative action, race-based affirmative action in place. But it's not meant to last forever. They put this estimate of 25 years.

This was a decision -- generations in the making that will have implications for generations to come. Your view?WAYNE A. I. FREDERICK, PRESIDENT, HOWARD UNIVERSITY: Yes, most certainly. I think it's an unfortunate decision as well. And I think as Justice Thomas referenced, the historically black colleges and universities. I think what should have been in that opinion as well is the fact that historically black colleges and universities are carrying an outsized burden to diversify so many industries in America. We represent only three percent of the institutions -- the Higher Ed institutions. But we're responsible for 25 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans. And in terms of medical school and doctors, how the university has produced more African American physicians since medical education started in America than any other single institution? So, by not allowing race to be considered in admissions elsewhere, you can put an even more outsized burden on historically black colleges and universities that don't have the capacity to carry that type of burden. So, I think this is an unfortunate decision.",

To take that one step further actually, historically, black colleges and universities are in the law because of an amendment of the Higher Education Act in the 60s so that we will be created through that system basically for special funding. And I think that these are the types of things that when you listen to certain people in Congress, these are the types of things that they may want to go and overturn. And therefore, funding could be in jeopardy.The other thing that's interesting is if you look at our university's medical school application process, we have a supplemental application process that speaks to whether you come from an underrepresented or minority background and how that has affected you. Very similar to what Chief Justice Roberts alluded to that you can use. The problem with that is -- at least on our side, what we're concerned about, does someone come and challenge that? Does a student who does not get into a medical school turn that? And why is that a concern? We have the fifth most selective medical school in the country. We had 8500 people apply for medical school this year, we only admitted 126 students. And that applicant -- that supplement application. We do use that to give disadvantaged students an opportunity. But I think that that can now be challenged, so, whether or not we should do that. And that would be problematic for the production of black doctors in America.",

And as pointed out, I think earlier on your show, the questions that people are going to ask if they don't get in and how we supply that data, how we collect and curate that data, and how that subjectivity gets into the discussion could be very, very difficult.
