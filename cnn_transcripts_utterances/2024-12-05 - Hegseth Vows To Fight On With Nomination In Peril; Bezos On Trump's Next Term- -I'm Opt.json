He talked to House Republicans who have no say in his nomination, but he went in asking them -- telling them I need your public support. He met with the incoming majority leader, right? He is -- he's not giving up yet and that's also something that we know that the president-elect appreciates. He wants people who want the job -- who are going to fight. Who are going to be loyal.

You know, publicly lambasting him because of the U.S. Postal Office issue.And so I think that this is a contentious relationship, but both recognize that it needs to be a working relationship. You know, Jeff Bezos is serious when he says that he wants there to be a deregulatory environment, and I think Donald Trump recognizes that part of his agenda is going to be making America the big innovation capital of the world.
