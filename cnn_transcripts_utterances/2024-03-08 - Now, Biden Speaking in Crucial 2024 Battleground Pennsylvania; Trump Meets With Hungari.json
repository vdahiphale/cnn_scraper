There is a real feeling in the White House that they know this resonates with people. They're very concerned about losing that access and losing their right that has been established for 50 years, the threat to democracy. And then also these day-to-day issues, things like price gouging, things like junk fees. I know it can seem like these are two very different kinds of problems. They see them as generational challenges on the one hand and then real practical day-to-day issues. You put these things together. And it's important to add you make a joke or two about your age.

Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining us. The president in these remarks repeatedly took on Trump by name this time as opposed to last night. He's touting his record on the economy, reproductive rights and healthcare. Does that resonate -- do you believe, does that resonate more than his arguments about protecting democracy here in the United States and around the world? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): I think it's going to be all of them. Today was a political speech. Last night was the official State of the Union speech. That's why you saw the more direct naming of the person today. I think being worried about what's going to happen to our democracy, treating each other civilly is an important issue, but there are a lot of different groups that are going to matter that have to show up in November at the polls. Women are going to be the biggest. In Michigan, a few years ago, when abortion was on the ballot, had one of the highest voter turnouts we've ever had. We need to turn out women. A lot of the economic discussions he's having right now, we've got to get in the union halls. We've got to talk to those workers.
