Notably, Ukraine's military says 45 of the 55 Russian cruise missiles fired Monday was shot down. That's still meant at least 10 hit their mark. Along with Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Zaporizhzhia region in the south, there have been reports of heavy damage. There appears to be no other reason for these strikes, which of course water shortages and rolling power blackouts nationwide, (INAUDIBLE) the coming winter the worst ever for Ukrainians, and Putin has warned there could still be worse to come.

So, what Putin might be hinting at here could be the use of some other kinds of weapon, some other kind of tactic, you know, something that could perhaps, in his opinion, change the calculus of the war, but so far, we haven't seen them use that.

Not just that, but also what they were doing there. The majority of the 137 police officers that were told were deployed to the area are actually focusing on crime prevention. They weren't there for crowd control at all. Now, we have heard from the police chief about an hour ago, he has bowed in apology for what has happened, saying that the sheer number of emergency calls that they received, we understand there were at least 100 of them, was they did not have an adequate response to those emergency calls. Now, certainly this is something that many people have been saying since Sunday morning when they have woken up to this disaster, but it's certainly going to be a focus of the investigation.

All part of an effort by Tehran to end more than a month of protests demanding basic women's rights and an end to government brutality. Police in India have arrested nine people in connection to a deadly bridge collapse on Sunday. There's disturbing video, which now shows the moment the disaster happened, the bridge falling apart and plunging into the water. At least 134 people were killed, among them 30 children.

And really then, charges are decided.But they've been booked under culpable homicide, not amounting to murder for now. Criminal charges have been booked with nine of these people, as you mentioned. What's interesting is, John, that most of them are affiliated to a contracted company that was in charge of taking care of maintaining this bridge. And these are junior officials we're talking about. These are junior officers. None of the seniors have been arrested or booked yet. So, we still have that question to the police in Gujarat. Where are the people who should be held accountable? Investigation is underway is what they're saying. So we're waiting to hear more from them. But I'm going to start with the visuals of what's left of this bridge in the Western state of Gujarat. What you see is debris. What you see is a crane pulling out the debris from the river. Now, as you mentioned, 134 people dead. We don't know if that's the final count. I doubt that's the final count as I speak to you. Over 30 children have died in this incident, and we don't even know if that figure is really going to go up. A lot of people are still missing, as we know. But speaking to a local agency, one of the survivors said something that stayed with me. He said, I faced death. And within moments, I caught onto the safety net, along with my family, and we saved ourselves as we saw so many slip into the river and be washed away. That's a story, not just of that one man, John, but of more than 100 people of 100 families that have lost near and dear ones. And they want accountability for what's happened, and that's yet to come. It's shocking, isn't it? A bridge that was renovated and repaired for over six months and was reopened just last week collapses? You've seen footage, and this is CCTV footage that we have of that collapse take place, of moments later, as well, of people just hanging onto the safety nets, trying to save themselves and their near and dear ones. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi will be visiting the site today, later in the day, in the afternoon. Remember, this is his home state. We also know that there was a high-level meeting that he chaired on Monday evening, where they did go through the rescue operations the state has offered, which continues even today while they look for more bodies of those who have died in this incident. So, yet, more is to yet come, John, as I speak to you. What we also do know is that there will be a state of -- a day of mourning, rather, that has been announced by the state of Gujarat. That is to take place tomorrow. Even the U.S. president, Joe Biden, has come out and has expressed his grief over the incident. But, the question remains: who should be held accountable? Are just those nine enough? We're talking about the small fries, really. What about those who should be held accountable, right at the top of that company that was contracted for the maintenance of this bridge? Whose answerable from the Gujarat state, government, the local government there? Who gave the nod for this bridge to start operations again for these tourists to go and visit the bridge once again -- John.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Paul Pelosi, still in intensive care following surgery after a violent attack at his home Friday that left him with a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and his hands. The suspect in the attack, 42-year-old David DePape, now charged with federal crimes -- assault and attempted kidnapping -- after he allegedly broke into the Pelosis' San Francisco home through a back door, went to the bedroom, and confronted Pelosi, shouting, \"Where's Nancy?\" according to law enforcement. According to the federal criminal complaint, DePape stated he was going to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage and talk to her. If she were to tell DePape the truth, he would let her go. And if she lied, he was going to break her kneecaps. And he said she knew she would not tell the truth. DePape also later explained that, by breaking the speaker's kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress, which would show other members of Congress there were consequences to their actions. DePape also attempted to tie Paul Pelosi up before the assault. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott discredited conspiracy theories the two knew each other before the break-in.",
