Four construction workers who were on the bridge when it collapsed are presumed dead. And the bodies of another two workers were recovered yesterday. We're also seeing some new video of the final moments before the tragedy. You can see there near the top of the frame that is the doomed construction crew's flashing lights and the ship closing in there on the right of the frame, the video cutting out right before impact. In the meantime, federal investigators are focusing on the roughly five minutes before the Dali container ship slammed into the bridge. These are images of investigators on board, where they secured the ship's voyage data recorder, which is also known as a black box. Let's go now to CNN's Gabe Cohen, who is in Baltimore.

And so now the process of clearing it out begins. And that could take many days. But getting that lift crane vessel in is the first step. Once that is done, officials say divers are going to go back in and they're planning to try to recover those four men and bring closure to their families. But there's a lot of concern that they could be pinned, along with several vehicles, under all of that rubble. Meanwhile, there's also a roadblock from hazardous material that's been discovered around the bow of the ship, where the bridge came down, more than 50 containers, more than 700 tons of flammables, corrosives, lithium batteries that are making the area, according to officials, unsafe for crews to actually come in. They're trying to figure out how to clear that. And, Brianna, it's also been a very busy day for investigators. You talked about that timeline, how frantic the scene was in those few minutes before the collision with the bridge. We have learned as well that investigators are speaking with the two pilots of that vessel again today. And they're really trying to zero in on what caused that power outage, that total blackout where the pilot lost control of the ship, lost the ability to steer, a lot of questions there. The NTSB is saying even a preliminary report is likely a couple weeks away. And all of this could take a couple years, Brianna. But, again, the focus today largely is starting to clear the bridge. And that update of a crane finally arriving, that is significant, if it does in fact happen later today.",

Was there an issue with them going ahead and sending the ship out knowing there were problems? On the human performance side, why did they release the tugboats and proceed on into the channel, although, with that problem, they weren't having issues? And, of course, the engineering team, what went wrong with this ship? Why was it having power outages? Did it have power outages on the dock, while it was docked, rather, in the days and hours before? Who repaired it? What did they find? And one of the -- by the way, one of the NTSB working groups is the records group. They will be having -- getting all of the records of the problems, the repairs, the records from Singapore on prior cruises and work on this ship. And then the recorder group, they're downloading it right now. And they will probably have pretty soon -- I'd be surprised if they don't have another announcement tonight of what they have learned from the ship's recording devices, both the data recorder and there will be some voice recording on the ship.

Meanwhile, the three stooges, Biden, Obama and Clinton, will be at a glitzy fund-raiser in the city with their elitist out-of-touch celebrity benefactors.\" Now, a lot of that is just Trumpian language, but there is something to the fact that Donald Trump is often trying to appeal to working- class voters, and he does appeal to working-class voters, and he has the ability to paint Democrats, and particularly when it comes to Clinton, Obama and now Biden, as elitist and out of touch.

So if you look at him coming out now, he was able to pull together these coalitions, whether they were African-Americans and specifically young people. Everybody remembers hope, the big poster of hope. Well, Barack Obama is going to come out and try to capitalize on that and try to bring some hope to this campaign. Now, Bill Clinton, a little bit different. Probably most voters do not remember Bill Clinton when he was in office, but there still is that sliver of folks that could potentially go for Trump. These tend to be a little bit older Americans who may remember the fact that Bill Clinton, who will stand beside Joe Biden tonight, also created basically the center way for American politics.

I mean, Donald Trump has largely been behind closed doors for the past several weeks doing meetings with donors, having fund-raisers, having people over for lunch to Mar-a-Lago or up at Bedminster.

That is the week that the Congress returns from their current Easter recess. As a reminder, the House impeached Mayorkas all the way back in February by a very narrow margin after failing to do so the first time, and made Mayorkas just the second ever Cabinet official to be impeached. But Speaker Mike Johnson decided to hold on to those articles until after government funding was resolved and that's what is happening now. So they're going to send those over, but that does not mean that the Democratic-controlled Senate is going to convict Mayorkas. In fact, even some Senate Republicans have said they have little appetite to go down that route. Now, Schumer's office did put out a statement saying that: \"After the House impeachment manners present the articles of impeachment to the Senate, senators will be sworn in as jurors in trial next day.\" So they could dismiss those articles pretty quickly.
