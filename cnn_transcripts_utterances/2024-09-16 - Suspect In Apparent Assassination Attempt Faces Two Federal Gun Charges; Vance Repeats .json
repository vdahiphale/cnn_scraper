      "sentences": "Hello, I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. And you're in the CNN Newsroom. And we start with more breaking news right now. The suspect in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in federal court right now, 58-year-old Ryan Routh was taken into custody yesterday after fleeing the scene at Trump's West Palm Beach, Florida golf club. Trump was playing golf when a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel through a fence and opened fire before Routh fled by car.Afterward, officials found an AK-style rifle with a scope and materials for a bulletproof vest. The FBI has launched an investigation, and the interim U.S. Secret Service Director is now on the ground in Florida, we're told indefinitely as they seek answers in an incident which has sent shock waves through the country for the second time in just two months. CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid, is joining us now. She's live outside the federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Paula, so what's happening in court right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, we have just learned the charges that Ryan Wesley Routh will face, and he's in -- at least initially, additional charges may be added. This hearing is just wrapped up, and during the hearing, it was revealed that he is facing two counts, including possession of a firearm, while -- while a former felon, and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.So today's hearing, this was before a magistrate judge. This is not the judge that would oversee his case going forward. This is just so he understands the charges that have been filed against him, and the judge can assess the current terms of his detention, but a formal detention hearing is scheduled for next Monday, and then he will be arraigned on the 30th. Now, our colleagues inside report that he was dressed in dark prison garb, and he was actually shackled, which isn't something you always see in these kinds of hearings. But the hearing has just wrapped up. But he will be back in court on Monday. It is notable, Wolf, that the Justice Department is handling this case. These are federal charges, and I would expect that additional counts will be added. This is just his first appearance in federal court in this likely historic case.",

They're all challenging. It's the time of day. It's the day of the week. It's are there other people on the course? Is it, you know, you have all these factors to put into play. That being said, that protectee has the right to go play golf, swim, ski, do any sport activity. It is challenging for the Secret Service, because we have to figure out the best way to make sure the protectee stays safe at all times. There's no one -- one stop solution for that.",

When you come from the world that I came from, when you're talking about people who are going after a -- a -- a president and wanting to make a threat and -- and trying to take it to the next step of trying to assassinate them, we're looking at a different type of person.So when I say that the person, it didn't surprise me, when you're getting involved in situations where people want to make threats against the president, that's a different type of individual. They can be calm. They can be cool and collective. But they're very calculating in their thought process. So I'm not surprised at that.
