But as the former President prepares to take the stage in Detroit, there's another stage that he's now suggesting he may not step foot on for his September 10th debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC.CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes is live for us in Detroit.

I do want to be a little bit quieter because he has taken the stage who's actually early this time, which is generally unheard of for politicians in this presidential race. But he took the stage. He was invited to talk about his future with the National Guard if he were to be reelected. We are told he would talk about the military, he would talk about the three-year anniversary of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.Obviously today, earlier he was in Arlington, some of the family members of the fallen soldiers from that event. It's become one of his main talking points against the Biden administration. We will be listening closely to see if he actually stays on message. But we're also told in just a few moments, Tulsi Gabbard, who was once a Democratic presidential candidate, she's now an independent. She's actually helping him prepare for the debate against Kamala Harris. And she shared the stage with Harris. She's going to come out and officially endorse Donald Trump. Now, that might not seem that surprising given the background there, but clearly, they are trying to capitalize off of what we saw last week with RFK Jr. coming out and endorsing Donald Trump, kind of the mindset of two Democrats, former Democrat, coming out to support Donald Trump, something they want to shine a light on. As you said, this is just the beginning of many stops this week. He's going to be back in Michigan later in the week in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, a series of these various battleground states. They say they are really ramping up this campaign. We've seen that the last two weeks, we'll see if that continues because this is something we have heard before. But we also know they want to make some changes to the campaign, particularly now that Kamala Harris is at the top of the ticket with this change in enthusiasm, a boost on the Democratic side, as well as a boost to the polls for Harris.",

That's an important state for Democrats. That's one that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes in 2020. And so they want to replicate that and more this time around, which means a lot of visits to the state. What's going to look like this time is a bus tour and concluding it with a rally with the Vice President on Thursday.Now, this pace of travel may seem like a little less than it was over the last several weeks where the Vice President was blitzing all the battleground states. The reason for that, I'm told, is because they want to put a lot of focus on the debate preparations. Of course, there has been this behind-the-scenes feud about the issue over the mics. And now that former President Donald Trump has said that he is open to it, the Harris campaign feels as though the matter is now put to rest. What she is doing behind the scenes, however, is familiarizing herself with the former President's record, with his statements, doing practice sessions, and essentially just doubling down on these preparations, not leaving it until the week prior to go into depth on these issues and policies. So this is another moment, essentially, where they see an opportunity to have a large audience and especially bring in those grassroots donations, which have really come in and they've capitalized on these key moments.",

They were talking about Kamala Harris's lead in certain national polls. And they were saying that they were not focused on that, especially as they're showing Harris pulling ahead. They want to keep their eye on the ball. So what do you see as far as the seven swing states and where polling is there? What does polling indicate to you about where they stand?",

And in the case of the seven swing states this year, I think it honestly is very, very close. Now, nationally, right now, at least, Harris has a lead. You can argue about what it is, a point, or two, or three. But of course, as we've learned over and over, certainly in the year 2000 and then in the year 2016, the popular vote, it doesn't matter except in individual states. It's the Electoral College that matters.So if that's what they mean by the big picture, then I get it. Although I have to say, all politicians and certainly Trump fits into this, they will cite the polls endlessly while they're leading. And if they stop leading or it's a close case, and they had been leading, you won't hear them mention it, or they'll diss the polls and call them inaccurate. You know, Lyndon Johnson used to carry the polls, the newspaper clips of the poll results in his pockets until he started to fall in the polls and then his pockets got clean.",

I was curious about another bit of your analysis about the popularity of an incumbent president determining the outcome of an election. Obviously, Harris doesn't technically count as the incumbent president, even though she's running to stay in the White House.

Maybe it cancels one another out, Donald Trump, the former President. I've often wondered if Grover Cleveland had some of these same problems when he ran after losing for a term. And Kamala Harris, so while she lives in the naval observatory, she doesn't live in the White House. She does have an office very near there. And so she is a quasi-incumbent.But one thing that we've discovered that I think most people have forgotten is that people really don't associate the vice president with a number of the president's policies, I think that's true in most administrations. Why? Because logically, people say a vice president doesn't make the decisions. He or she is there to cheerlead for the president when the president makes the decisions. So they're listening to her to see where she's different, what she might do differently, what her approach is. And that's been helping her.",

And if that was not possible, they would communicate through a state police representative over to the local police. This is far too attenuated.We learned after September 11th, the benefits of what we call joint incident command, having everybody together in the same room on the same wavelength. So they were working with a tough situation to begin with. By failing to even collect the radios and clearly not using them, they really set their own course to this mess. SANCHEZ: So we got what appears to be the first step toward accountability. It may be the only as far as we know at this point, but some of the Secret Service staff was -- and I'm not sure if reassigned is the right word, but they were essentially told to work from home.

It was a few folks at the Pittsburgh Field Office and one person from the detail. But the fact that they're not allowed to participate in investigations, they're not allowed to go out into the field, and they're supposed to stay home, leads you to believe that they are caught up in this investigation in some substantive way, and that we might ultimately see a negative finding about their performance.
