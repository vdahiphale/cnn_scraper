Because even though there are wars raging overseas, their political battle still to fight here at home. There's a campaign underway and Americans are viewing the economy poorly. And his advisers believe that his message on the economy can and will break through.We do expect him to lead his remarks by talking about an emotional conversation that he convened this morning virtually with the families of Americans who are believed to be held hostage in the region. That is something that the White House has told us to expect. But it just shows you the juxtaposition of President Biden's week. On one hand, you have these routine events, like today's speech on the economy, at Rose Garden events talking about junk fees. And these very forceful and poignant messages that he's delivered to the American people and to the country of Israel as the U.S. issues this forceful response. But there are also various conversations happening about how best to help Israel. Several top lawmakers at the White House today to talk about potential funding packages for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and the U.S. Mexico border. Though the U.S. -- the White House might have to take matters into its own hands by unlocking about $12 billion in existing aid, if there's no speaker of the House that can approve such a package.

Right now, Israel's Defense Forces say troops have raided Gaza over the past 24 hours, look for hostages taken by Hamas. Large scale strikes also continue in Gaza, and Israeli tanks are on the move near the border ahead of what is likely to be some form of ground incursion.The Israeli military has also ordered more than a million people out of the northern Gaza for their safety, suggesting people move to the south. The United Nations calls that impossible -- and that's their word. Jonathan Conricus from the IDF joins me now. Jonathan, appreciate you being with us.

And I'm happy to say that we, indeed, did find some useful intelligence to disambiguate the situation a little bit. I can also say that it is a massive focus of effort of intelligence officers from all over Israel in order to locate where our hostages are and to find a way to get them out.",

So I am not aware of any confirmation and I am definitely aware of the fact that Hamas would likely try to place responsibility on anybody else but themselves.

The sheer scope and the complexity, the amount of people and the fact that they are held in a hostile area that is inaccessible as of now for us. And in something that was likely prepared in advance and that Hamas was prepared for this, makes it very, very challenging. To answer the question, I would say that the aim of our operation is to dismantle the military capabilities of Hamas.

      "sentences": "Yes, this is a secret ballot election in which Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, is expected -- the favorite in this close -- in this election to nominate the next Speaker of the House. He is facing against a congressman named Austin Scott from Georgia, someone who has been frankly concerned about all of the events of these last week, the historic and unprecedented nature of the events by ousting the then speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, on the floor. First time that's ever happened in history.Since then, this badly divided party has tried to figure out a way forward. Trying to decide whether or not to get behind any candidate for the speaker. But there's a problem. No one so far has been able to secure the votes in order to become speaker of the House. This vote will be very, very important, because even if Jim Jordan does win the nomination, that doesn't mean he has the votes to be elected speaker of the House. The key thing to watch here is the number of votes against him or the number of votes for Austin Scott. Assuming Jordan wins here, the majority of the 221 members, how close is he to that 217 vote threshold? If he is far below that number, then there'll be pressure on him to step aside and see if there's another candidate who could emerge. But if he's closer to that number, perhaps he'll try to push ahead and try to get more votes on his side. He has indicated for some time that he wants to have 217 votes behind him before going to the House floor. But has he changed his approach in any way? I've tried to ask that question to him several times today. He has not said one way or the other, other than the fact that he said we are going to try. We're going to push to get 217 votes. But if Jordan falters because he cannot get members to his side, then other candidates may jump into this race in this incredibly chaotic situation caused by Republican infighting that led to the speakers ouster and the paralysis in the House. And of course, guys that nothing can get done in this House until they are elect a new speaker which is adding such a sense of urgency to this moment as they try to select a new candidate who could potentially bring this House out of paralysis.",

Do they have a sense of how this looks not just to voters, but to people around the world, whether it's allies or foes of the U.S.? RAJUevery single member that you talked to realizes and recognizes that. But even they -- even though they recognize that they still cannot find consensus just because of how narrowly divided this conference is in the handful of members that scuttle their plans going forward, as we've seen. And that's what's happened all of this whole -- this whole time. So will it happen again? That's the key question.",

This is for those who are pro-Palestinian. Saying this is about freeing Palestine. And this is what we keep hearing from the chants here in the crowd saying free, free Palestine.We've spoke to one Palestinian who said, look, we understand the concerns over Hamas, that we are not in favor of Hamas. But they are facing a humanitarian crisis and this is why the thousands and thousands of them have come out here to voice their support for the Palestinian people. And it's also a very diverse crowd, I should note. You know, some of these folks are just here because they are anti-war. You know, they've done other protests like this across New York City. But overall, the concern here so far from folks, it has been the humanitarian crisis that could develop. And they're out here now voicing their support for the Palestinian people and that's why we're seeing the thousands and thousands. You know, there have been other rallies like this here in New York City, but this by far now the largest one since here the war began.
