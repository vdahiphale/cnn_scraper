The Red Cross reports that at least 41 people are believed to have died in a migrant shipwreck near the Italian island of Lampedusa last week. It comes amid a spike in the number of migrants making the treacherous journey from North Africa to Europe. The Red Cross spoke to some survivors who say the boat left Tunisia several days ago. The Italian government says so far this year, more than 93,000 people have arrived in Italy by boat. That's more than double the number over the same period in the previous year. CNN's Senior International Correspondent Ben Wideman shows us live now from Rome. Ben, what more do we know about what happened here?",

Now, four people survived. They managed to somehow use -- it looks like they used inner tubes to stay afloat until they found apparently an abandoned other kind of boat. They say that they were told the Red Cross that they were at sea for six days before finally being picked up by a merchant ship. They said that of the -- originally there were 45 people on board the boat, obviously not 41 According to that account are missing, presumed dead. Among the 41 was a three-year-old child, as well as a pregnant woman. Now, we understand that the four survivors came from sub-Saharan Africa, I believe Guinea and the Cote d'Ivoire. But what we've seen is that, certainly, over the last few months, there's been a huge increase in the number of people crossing the Mediterranean, reaching Italy in this instance. As you mentioned, the Italian government says that, as of today, 94,000 migrants and refugees have reached the shores of Italy, which, yes, it's twice as much as last year. It's three times more than the year before that. Now, the Italians have worked out agreements, for instance, with Tunisia. The European Union is giving more than a million euro to the Tunisian government to provide training, drones, and other equipment to try to stop people from leaving the shores of Tunisia and heading toward the Italian coast and other parts of Europe, but very little is being done. In fact, I can probably confidently say nothing is being done to address the problems that cause these people to leave their homes in the first place, homes in sub-Saharan Africa, homes in the Middle East, homes as far away as in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

And you can see from the satellite imagery, the storm, the central portion of the storm, the eye of the storm, just heading to the north. So, on the latest forecast track, it is going to pick up some forward speed. It is going to remain a tropical storm, weaken even more within the next two days or so, and then head into northern sections of China. So, the forecast radar keeping very heavy rain in place. You can see a front sort of moves through and absorbs it. So, the rain for northern sections of China won't be quite as much, but we are going to expect some very heavy downpours and very gusty winds across South Korea in the coming days. So, your forecast wind gusts are going to be anywhere from say 70 to 80 kilometers per hour. As far as the rain goes, we could see anywhere from 150 to 200 millimeters of rain all across South Korea.

      "sentences": "Yes, it is mainly another beginning of civil war, but this is in the Amhararegion, instead of Tigray region. So, it's important to have few features of the war or the violence that recently emerged in the Amhara region. The violence erupted in the region, paralyzed government administration and led to assassination of different number of government authorities and government services collapsed. And as a result, the government felt threatened and imposed the state of emergency. Now, this war has some basic causes and immediate triggers. The immediate trigger is what the federal government under Abiy Ahmed did in April this year, disarming the regional militias and the special units. Amara region complained against the federal government pushing back the measure to disarm its special forces. The major complaint was that Tigray was not fully disarmed, and it should not be, it should not put down its arms. But the federal government forcefully pushed and completed the disarmament. And members of the special forces then mixed with the paramilitary Fano, who was a major actor in the Tigray war. And as you remember, the Amara forces, the special units and the Fano were accused of war crimes and ethnic cleansing during the Tigray war. So, the impact of this is significant in the entire northern Ethiopia and the security of the country, because the Fano militias are allied with major government organs and the politicians within the Prosperity Party and the military commanders of the state itself, because the Ampara Party, which constituted a good part of the Prosperity, the ruling Prosperity Party, was a major ally of Abiy Ahmed to stay in power. So, the military confrontation is not just a military fight in the north. It's also a political divide within the Prosperity Party. And in this sense, it's a major challenge for Abiy Ahmed to keep his party together and to be able to impose his grip on the leadership of the country. But the major cause of this war is the growing Amhara nationalism, which is infused with interests of territorial expansion, irredentism, and territorial conquests of the neighboring state. The best example is that the Amhara region has territorial claims over Western Tigray. And that is the major reason why Amhara regional forces complained about disarmament. They refused to leave Tigray, western Tigray, after the Pretoria negotiation which requested the Amhara forces.",

So, he always loses excessive power of the federal government, and this is deteriorating his ability of leading the country from time to time.

There's now big fears about a cholera outbreak in Khartoum, the capital. I want to read this section for you from this statement from \"Save the Children\" that blames it on a horrifying combination of rising numbers of corpses, severe water shortages, non-functioning hygiene and sanitation services and a lack of water treatment options. So, that's the combination of factors leading to this situation. I'm also hearing from people in the Khartoum who talk about a fuel shortage. So, on top of all the problems they've had, you're looking at an almost total collapse of the health and sanitation infrastructure in the country. Keep in mind that so many hospitals have not been operating for months because in some cases they've been bombed out, in some cases the staff cannot get there. And now you see the situation of either cops that are lying on the street or that are just overcrowding the few modes that are still operating. The wider picture here is that more than four million people have been displaced in this conflict since it began. Nearly a million have now crossed into neighboring countries like Egypt, like Chad, like South Sudan, anywhere to get away from this conflict that does not appear to be coming to an end. And all the attempts at mediation, all the talks did give to a ceasefire that was not observed in any meaningful way. So, while this appears to have fallen from the world's attention, it is still a real ongoing crisis that has a real impact on ordinary people's lives in Sudan. Zain.",

We were 12 hours of navigation from them. And finally, these four people were rescued by a merchant vessel. What we understood when they arrived in Lampedusa, is that people at the shipwreck, maybe four or five days ago, because of the weekend, the weather was extremely dangerous and not suitable for navigations. Then it's already three shipwrecks over this weekend from Tunisia shore to Lampedusa. What is interesting is this boat was adrift and we find this last known position was more closer to Libya or Tunisian shore, mostly over the border, at the line of the border, 14 (ph) nautical miles north. Just for me to give an overview, it's more than 900 people who have died only in 2023. In total, it's 93,000 people arrived by sea, and more than 50 percent are departing from Tunisia. This is the first time since we are rescuing at sea, and since the central menu was a major and the Daedalus migration roads of the world, that we experience this change of patterns in the departure. It's linked from one side as Libya is known as a very dangerous and like described often as a hell for migrants. And so, Tunisia was a kind of an alternative world, but now this condition and the situation in Tunisia highly deteriorated with heavy xenophobia, but we also see more than 1200 people who have been deported in the middle of the deserts between Tunisia and Libya.
