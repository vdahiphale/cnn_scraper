Nobody has the infrastructure but Joe Biden. So, like, I'm not saying, shut up and get in line. Air your grievances. Talk about fantasy world where we have this other thing.

He was just on with me. Let me play what he said as he was campaigning with Biden yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA):  I actually spent the entire day with the president. And he was - he was perfect. He was crisp and he was engaged. And the Harrisburg event, it was actually in the 90s, and he was - he was crushing. He was just doing fine. It was like a perfect normal kinds of Joe Biden that I've always seen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Listen, I don't think so. I mean they have a tough task ahead of them in keeping Joe Biden as their nominee. I think he's going to remain their nominee because he's clearly their president. If he were to resign the race, if he were to drop out of the race, he'd have to resign the presidency, because you can't be mentally unfit the run for president and be mentally fit to be president. So, they're at a very dangerous position. They had a primary. They've resolved all these issues. They don't get to - they don't get to have a mulligan just because of one bad debate. Now, the reality is, is Joe Biden is headed to a landslide defeat in November, but that's a result of his own actions, as a result of the Democratic Party, the cabinet, the vice president, covering up the neurological decline of President Biden. We've all seen it. People are going to - try to continue to cover it up. But we can't unsee what we've seen. And the reality is, is the uphill battle that Joe Biden has to take place between now and November, he'll never hit it because you're going to have more and more moments where you can see the neurological decline. But that doesn't matter. The Dems have made it - they've  made their bed. They've chose their candidate. They ignored everybody else who was saying Joe Biden was unfit to go forward. And now they're stuck with a candidate who can't complete sentences, who can't find the door, who on the world stage looks week, at a time that our world is on fire. So, listen, there's no savior. There's no mulligan. They're stuck with the guy. They're trying to find ways out of it. They're eating each other up as a party. I love watching it. I encourage more people to watch it. But the reality is, is a week from now, two weeks from now, Joe Biden's going to be the nominee. He's going to be president. And we're going to have this vigorous debate through November. And I think the debate (ph) is ultimately result in the Donald Trump presidency.",

We usually start getting hints of who that person is, is on Thursday and Friday. We'll probably know by next Monday.But the reality is, that the whole tenor of this election is if Joe Biden has a neurological fitness to go forward. And people are making that decision now. They're making the decision on the economy today. And it's not a talking point. I mean the reality is, we saw with our own eyes, this guy's not fit to be president. Now, he can't resign. They're stuck with them. They made the choice. I mean there was another Dem candidate in their primary that they slammed for running and claimed that Joe Biden's age was an issue. So, they're married to this guy. Now, they can try to prop him up. They can try to resurrect him. But I've got to tell you, as a Catholic, I don't even think Jesus Christ could be resurrected from that debate performance last - or two Thursdays to go. So, they have an uphill task. They need to try to make it about Donald Trump and what he does. But the voters are looking at this election saying, this is our president now, and on the world stage he's just not fit to lead.",
