There have been many evacuation orders that have been given by the Israeli military when they want to operate in a certain area of the Gaza Strip, they give warning to civilians to move to another area, and that's the key here.Al Mawasi was one of the areas that they have repeatedly said is a safe humanitarian area. They have designated it so, and they say that is where there will be shelter. That's where there will be humanitarian aid. Now, what we've heard from on the ground, from the humanitarian aid groups, is there is not sufficient to consider this a humanitarian zone. There is not enough shelter, there's not enough humanitarian aid, food and water is still scant, but this is where the Israeli military has consistently said that Gaza civilians should move to stay out of more dangerous areas where they're operating, to try and root out Hamas operatives, but we have seen a number of times that this is an area that is also targeted, if Israel believes that there are significant Hamas targets in that area. So I mean, that's the long answer, the short answer, John, to that question, is there isn't anywhere safe in Gaza. We've been hearing it for months from those on the ground, from humanitarian aid groups, and we know that after this particular strike happened, that many surrounding these large craters then packed up and left fearful that there could be more strikes, but it's very difficult for them to know where to go",

We're now on the eve of Vice President Kamala Harris coming face to face with Donald Trump, an encounter which also has the potential to be another election defining moment.Harris arrived in Philadelphia Monday and has spent days preparing. She predicts Trump will lie and use his old, tired playbook of personal attacks. The Trump campaign spokesperson says Trump will just be himself while previewing some of likely attack lines, including that Harris owns everything from this current administration. The latest polling shows the race remains extremely tight, both candidates hoping to sway still undecided voters when they meet Tuesday night in Philadelphia. CNN correspondents are in Philadelphia covering both campaigns in a moment.

These are things they call his kind of preparation. We also know he sits for what they call policy sessions to talk to some of those senior advisers about policy, but also about how to pivot to the issues that they believe will help Donald Trump win in November, like immigration, like crime, like inflation. The biggest question we are hearing from a lot of Donald Trump's allies is, will he be able to control his temperament? Though, all of this preparation is for not if he shows that he lets Kamala Harris get underneath his skin? That is what I've been told by number of allies.

And the Pope I should also add, according to his official schedule, is not scheduled to meet with victims while in the country. This morning, he visited children with disabilities at a school. He met with religious leaders. And when he arrived at the cathedral in Dili, the capital of East Timor, he was greeted by multitudes, by throngs of well-wishers who filled the streets and chanted \"Long live Pope Francis\". Now in about two hours from now about 4:30 p.m. local time, the Pope will preside over a much-anticipated open-air mass that could draw more than half of the total population of East Timor. This country has deep ties with the Catholic Church, which has played an outsized role in its struggle for independence, which was decades- long and earned in 2002. But all that has been overshadowed by accusations of clerical sexual abuse. It was two years ago when the Vatican said that it secretly disciplined East Timor bishop who had won the Nobel Peace Prize in the mid-1990s. His name, Carlos Ximenez Belo, after he was accused of sexually abusing boys in East Timor decades ago. And again, speaking yesterday in Dili, Pope Francis did not directly address the scandal. Instead, he issued a call to quote, \"do everything possible to prevent such abuse\". Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POPE FRANCIS, LEADER OF CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): We shall not forget those children and adolescents that had their dignity violated. This phenomenon is happening across the world. In response, we are all called to do everything possible to prevent every kind of abuse and guarantee a peaceful growth for all young people.

And so the news is that the vice president has been preparing for a range of potential insults, name-calling and derogatory comments from Trump with Harris expecting attacks on her racial and gender identity. Clearly that is one debate challenge. The other, Trump's superpower seems to be the ability to lie about pretty much anything and everything. But instead of worrying about Trump's behavior, his lying and the insults, at the end of the day would Harris be better off presenting herself as a viable president to win over those conservatives who detest Trump but are not yet sold on her.
