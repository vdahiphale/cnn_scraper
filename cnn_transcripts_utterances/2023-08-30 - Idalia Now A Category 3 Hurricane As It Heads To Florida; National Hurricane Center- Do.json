Florida's governor is warning residents of the state's Big Bend coast to prepare for hurricane they haven't seen since the likes of the late 1800s.And breaking news as of just a few moments ago. Idalia has just been upgraded to a category three storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles an hour. But it's forecast to reach category four by landfall which would mean winds potentially more than 130 miles an hour. The storm is already bringing coastal flooding and Western Florida. It's expected to make a hard turn to the east later on Wednesday, dumping more rain across Georgia and South Carolina. Forecasters are predicting 12 to16-foot storm surge in the Big Bend area where Florida's panhandle turns into its Peninsula. That's enough to completely submerge most one-storey buildings. And they're warning that in some of those areas, it may likely not be survivable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's definitely going to hit the Big Bend. Everywhere in the Big Bend is going to get storm surge. It's going to see major, major impact whether the eyewall is hitting you or not. So please prepare for that. It is going to be a significant, significant impact to that region of Florida. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But you were just talking about the hurricane officially being a category three hurricane now. You were mentioning the wind here in the area. We are in Clearwater Beach. The rain has stopped as you can see, but the wind significantly increased in the last few minutes.So, the rain has led up but we are feeling the force of that wind just sweep through the area now. As you said, Hurricane Idalia now officially a category three hurricane and we are expecting that to become a category four hurricane by the time it makes landfall in the early hours of Wednesday morning which we are getting into now. So, conditions here are changing really minute to minute. It was raining hard just about an hour ago when we last spoke. That stop now but it is very windy. Storm surge is going to be the primary thing that we are watching for in this area. We are expecting to see anywhere from four to seven feet of storm surge coming in. That is going to be catastrophic for the area. That is a very large amount of water, dangerous levels of water. And so, as a result of that, this area has been put under a mandatory evacuation order. Not everyone has heeded those orders. I've spoken to people who were local to the area, who told me they weren't going to ride this out in their homes just writing it out hoping for the best. But as we heard from the governor earlier today, he believes that most people who are in the path of what is now a very dangerous category three storm have heeded those warnings. So, we are standing by here as we await the arrival of this potentially historic, catastrophic storm. Omar?",

That's enough to inundate a bus. The storms outer bands are already causing flooding in some coastal areas of the state.

And we're low laying in our communities down on the coast of Swanee and Horseshoe and Gina.And back during Hermine (INAUDIBLE) was devastating. We had a lot of major damage to residents and commercial structures. So, for us with the storm surge of a potential of 16-foot is just total, you know, catastrophe and devastation. And there's no way people that stay down there can survive that unless they get the elevated ground above that. And so, we're really concerned what we will find in the morning once it moves on for those that we've got word that did not evacuate. And we do have someone that we know is down there that was just adamant, they didn't want to, you know, evacuate. And when we talk about storm surge we're talking about on a normal dry ground where tide is at its normal. You're standing there looking out on the golf and then you can add 15 or now 16-foot potentially to that of water. And you got to thank that's moving with winds pushing and waves on top of that.

For this area we are expecting to see anywhere from four to seven feet of water, moving inland where we are right now.The ocean is in this direction. It is about a quarter of a mile or so to the water from where we are standing. So, if that storm continues to gather strength, if it continues to get stronger over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, it means that conditions here are prime for that surge to come in and potentially flood much of where we're standing right now.

We have been pushing public information, public education about the severity and intensity of this storm since we first got the initial notice. So for several days we have been telling our residents, particularly on the west side of US19, along our coastline, that this storm is serious, that this storm surge is life-threatening. 6 to 9 feet above ground level is absolutely nothing to sneeze at. So we are actively messaging that, we are encouraging registrations for special needs clients so that we can appropriately plan for them.
