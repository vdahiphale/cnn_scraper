Lebanese officials say four people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon in recent hours in Beirut. Smoke visible, rising above the skyline this morning.Several Israeli airstrikes have hit the capital in recent days, including the one that killed the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Saturday's strikes in Lebanon reportedly killed more than 30 people and wounded close to 200 others. Caught in the middle of it all, the residents, civilians of Beirut. Those airstrikes by Israel have displaced more than a million people just since Monday. Hundreds of families have now resorted to sleeping on beaches and in public squares. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is standing by in Beirut. We begin this morning, though, with Jeremy Diamond. He's in Haifa in northern Israel. Jeremy, we talk about preparations for a ground offensive inside Lebanon by Israel. I know you've seen some of those forces along the border.

It's unclear what that is, but this really has become commonplace here in Beirut over the last 48 hours or so.You've had these intense Israeli strikes, this bombardment, especially on Beirut's southern suburbs. That, of course, was the seat of power of Hezbollah. That is where the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in that Israeli strike where you've had other top commanders also killed by the Israelis there. But it's also home to hundreds of thousands of civilians. You know, right now, when we talk about these airstrikes, it's really unclear what the casualty toll is. We've heard from Lebanese officials saying that it's been very hard for them to get the exact figures because they say that there are many unidentifiable body parts, there's also people who are unaccounted for. But as of last night, they say that at least 1,030 people have been killed. Now, there's no breakdown of how many of them are Hezbollah fighters and how many are civilians, but we've heard from Lebanese officials that many, many women and children have been killed in these strikes in different parts of the country. And just to put it into context, Jim, the 2006 war, 34 days, about 1,100 people were killed in Lebanon. And then within a few days, since September the 17th, you've had at least 1,030 people killed and thousands others injured. That is one of the crises that the health sector here is dealing with, trying to treat the thousands of injured. But you also have this other crisis that is unfolding right now, and that is the displacement. As you mentioned earlier, more than a million people, according to the estimates by the Lebanese government, have been displaced from their homes because the southern suburbs is one of the most densely populated parts of the country. And in recent days, as these airstrikes have intensified, you've had this mass exodus with people either ending up in schools, turning into shelters like this one, or people with nowhere to go because there aren't enough centers set up for them that they have ended up on the streets sleeping on sidewalks, on benches in parks. And this is what we saw earlier when we were out in different parts of central Beirut. Jim, we're talking about Lebanese citizens, Syrian refugees and many, many migrant workers who are here in Lebanon. I spoke with one young girl from Syria, a 10-year-old who lost her father during the Civil War, Jim, and she broke down. She was crying hysterically saying that she is so afraid right now. She's so terrified of the prospect of leaving -- of losing her mother and her siblings.",

Of course, Israel has a long history of killing Hamas leaders, and those leaders are replaced. Same with the U.S., when you think of its experience with ISIS.

And then there are others like the president who are worried that by doing so, Iran may walk into a trap. And that's the dilemma now for the leadership.As you say, the statement from Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme leader, seems to suggest that he's comfortable with Hezbollah taking the lead. But Hezbollah is now leaderless in considerable disarray. A lot of their top commanders are out. A lot of their military installations have been bombed out. They're facing a serious crisis. This does not seem to be the moment for its main patron to be saying you're out on your own, which is how many in Lebanon will interpret that message. So it speaks to Tehran being caught flat footed by the events. The -- for all that, the Iranian regime prides itself for being in control of events in the Middle East. This time, this came out of the blue. The loss of Hassan Nasrallah, a personal friend and protege of Khomeini's, was a big blow.

Obviously, it's there -- Hezbollah's on the team, but if not, you know, Soleimani was a national hero in Iran, and the Iranians continue to try and want to respond to that by, for instance, planning to assassinate President Trump and planning to assassinate John Bolton, his national security adviser.

The top issues for them are the economy, healthcare, gun policy, and only 37 percent say immigration is important for determining their vote.

You may start seeing, you know, sporadic, you know, shortfalls of, let's say, your favorite wine from Europe as an example, because there's no other way to get that here.

And so, a lot of the parts that would be needed to produce vehicles, let's say, towards the end of this month will be on those boats right now. And so, if those don't get unloaded, you start having sporadic plant slowdowns, and at that point, that could mean workers even being put on temporary layoff, that then cascades further upstream to domestic part suppliers, and you have some of these ripple effects like we saw in 2021, albeit it's important to understand we're not looking at a disruption unless this is a very, very long strike, anywhere near the degree we were experiencing in 2021 or the first half of 2022.",
