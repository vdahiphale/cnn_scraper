Does that start to change? In a week's time, you're already starting to see behind the scenes, Republicans trying to gauge support for whether or not they should run for speaker. Top of that list, of course, is majority leader Steve Scalise. He is already trying to reach out to allies, trying to understand whether there is a path for him. Obviously, he's already in leadership. He has a sophisticated team who's done this before. He knows his way to win a leadership race. He's probably considered the front runner at this moment. There's also of course though, questions about Kevin Hern, who is the leader of the Republican Study Committee, and Jim Jordan who has left that door open to potentially running for speaker. I'm told this morning that Kevin Hern is trying to understand whether or not there's going to be a lane for him, given the fact that he's sort of in between Scalise, who's in leadership and someone like Jordan who has the backing of members of the House Freedom Caucus in the past.",

I wouldn't be surprised if today he's asked about it by reporters or asked over the weekend when he's campaigning in Iowa and offers some sort of vague response like he has so far.But listen, I mean, I spoke with many of Donald Trump's advisors over the last 24 hours, as well as some of his allies, and they told me that he purposely did not want to get involved. And the reason for that is he has allies on both sides of this fight. He has many people who have endorsed him, and supported Kevin McCarthy. But he also is very close to Congressman Matt Gaetz, of course, who has endorsed Donald Trump and also is a key surrogate for his campaign. And so, his aides tell me, Donald Trump's aides, that really, he saw a little political upside to this. Now, I do have a quote from one Trump ally that thought know, captures how Donald Trump is thinking about this perfectly, they said, quote, \"He can't be sticking his neck out whenever there's a fight in the House, especially when he has people who endorse him on both sides.\" Now, as you mentioned, Phil and Poppy, this is very different from January when McCarthy was going through those 15 rounds of votes in his effort to become speaker. At the 11th hour, Donald Trump did call up. He called Matt Gaetz. He also called Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, other conservative holdouts, and opiates, really, to stand down. And we saw that they ended up voting president, some of them. We saw Matt Gaetz do that, and it helped McCarthy become a speaker. We saw no such effort yesterday.

Pelosi ran it differently; Bayer ran it differently and he wanted to give power back to the members. Now, some will say exactly that his idea of wanting to give the power back to the members empowered them to not be happy if they didn't get 100% of the things they wanted.And we're hearing that from members, the eight that voted to House Speaker McCarthy, that they didn't get everything they wanted, they're going to take them out. And is that how our politics is going to go from here on out in a Republican Party? It may.",

Four and five people, same thing.
