Asking if this is really what was intended, that each state could potentially be removing some people, not be removing other people for a national office.

Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.And that's interesting because it speaks to the real challenge.

Colorado should be able to bar oath breaking insurrectionists from our ballot.A really important statement. Now, this goes back to the heart of the matter, right? Of whether a state is able to actually disqualify or has to go to a federal government official or a state official. But, Paula, the timing of this is really important. I want to look ahead though, because this case was quickly seized upon by the Supreme Court for an oral argument hearing, for the oral argument itself, and now a ruling. If that same timeline were to hold, we have an April 22nd oral argument for the immunity issue. About a month could go by before a decision is made.

Because if he's reelected, he can make them go away. So, any delay. A day, a week, a month works to his advantage.So, when it comes to the immunity case, we know they're going to hear it on April 22nd. A lot of really smart people who cover the court believe that we won't get a decision until late June, because that's usually when the court issues their most significant decisions. But then that really throws into question, assuming that the former president doesn't win, which is what look -- sources on his legal team tell me, they don't expect that he'll win when that trial could go.

Really, really appreciate it.Joining me now is CNN's Kristen Holmes from West Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, what are you hearing from inside the Trump campaign? Obviously, they're very happy about this decision. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Jim, they're thrilled for a number of reasons, and it's not just this decision. Overall, they have a rosy outlook at what's going on with Donald Trump's legal issues. Now, I am told that Trump will speak. He's going to give him remarks at his Mar-a-Lago home in response to this decision. And make no mistake, they view this as a win. Going into this, and I think we heard Paula kind of talking about this, they believed that they were going to win this case. They believe of all the legal challenges that they are facing, that this is the one that they actually had the strongest argument on. Obviously, they did so, so you can expect a victory lap from the former president today. But the other part of this is that immunity claim. The fact that the Supreme Court has decided to listen to that, to hold arguments on that which won't be until April 22nd. Again, as you heard Paula saying, this delays that trial. Now, whether or not it actually delays it past the November election, Trump's team seems to think that it will. That it's going to be after November 2024. Now, again, we don't have any solid information if that's true but this is a win for them because this has been what they have been fighting for the entire time. Delay, delay, delay. That is their biggest tactic in trying to get this to happen after the election and with the hopes that Donald Trump will then be president of the United States and these can all be put to rest or he will put them to rest up. So, again, legally speaking, there have been times of darkness for the Trump campaign and times of more brightness. And this is one of the times where they're feeling very good heading into this. But obviously, as you noted, he is going to be going to trial in New York. He is going to still sit for that on March 26. The big question now is how does he do that and juggle a presidential campaign since tomorrow is Super Tuesday? He's looking poised to win in pretty much every single state. And he's looking like he's inching towards the Republican nomination. So, how is he going to actually juggle courtroom appearances and the campaign trail when he is forced to go to those courtroom appearances? It's not just on his whim when he feels like it.",

He'll probably -- he's certainly going to be on the ballot. He's certainly going to be the Republican nominee. We'll know that for sure tomorrow if we don't already know it. And that's the way it is. You know, the -- Donald Trump has had a run of great luck in several different dimensions. Although, Jim, both of us have been around a long time and we both know, the worm always turns. Sometimes the worm turns repeatedly during a presidential campaign. So, I don't think one candidate's good luck will hold for eight full months.",

It really is. And if you care about democracy and constitutionalism, then you have every right to be concerned. Notice what he did, Jim. He always turns an effective attack around.
