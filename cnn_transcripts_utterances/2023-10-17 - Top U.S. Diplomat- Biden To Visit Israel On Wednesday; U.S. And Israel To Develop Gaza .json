Well, U.S. President Joe Biden is preparing for his biggest show of support for Israel since the Hamas terror attacks, which killed at least 1400 people. He will travel to Israel on Wednesday to reaffirm U.S. solidarity and its ironclad commitment to the country's security.That announcement came from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken who is on a marathon diplomatic mission across the Middle East. Blinken also says the U.S. and Israel have agreed to develop a plan for humanitarian aid from donations to reach civilians in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The city is home to the border crossing where many Palestinian civilians have been gathering to try to enter Egypt. U.N. experts warn Gaza is being strangled by Israel's week-long siege and aerial bombardment. Before the most recent strike, the Palestinian Prime Minister said more than 2800 people had been killed in Gaza.And Israeli ground offensive into Gaza is widely expected to start at any time. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel won't stop until it destroys the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas. More now from CNN Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley. And a warning his report contains some graphic video. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): At stake, a widening war in the Middle East. A humanitarian horror and floods of refugees. The conundrum Israel faces is self-defense versus collective punishment. Still reeling from the October 7th Hamas attacks in which at least 1400 people were killed, and most of them civilians. Israel's Prime Minister has pledged to destroy Hamas and called for international support. He said, just like the world unite it to destroy the Nazis and destroy ISIS, now the world must unite in order to defeat Hamas. But at what cost? The U.S. Secretary of State embarked on a frantic round of talks with Israel ahead of a widely anticipated ground assault on Gaza.",

And that is that the Biden administration are making, as you mentioned, a very risky decision to send the American President into Israel at this very unstable time. And that message sends the clear signal that the American people, particularly this Biden administration are very focused on deescalating this conflict, ensuring that what is happening in Israel and the surrounding Palestinian territories does not spread into a wider regional conflict, as it seems at risk of doing so.And that was mentioned earlier in Sam's package about the 28 areas in the north of Israel that have now been evacuated because of skirmishes with Hezbollah, the militant Arab region in Lebanon. That is one of the concerns for the American ministration, that there are surrounding neighboring states that are going to become involved in this conflict. And that would escalate it further. And ahead of Biden's visit, Secretary State Antony Blinken warned of effectively this message. He said that this visit by Biden will underscore our crystal-clear message to any actor, state or non-state trying to take advantage of this crisis to attack Israel, don't. That is what he said. It's a very firm message from him. But also, the same kind of wording we will expect to see from Biden when he arrives. The U.S. is warning those around Israel not to escalate to this conflict. And we're seeing as well with the reports now this morning, that the head of U.S. CENTCOM, the central command is also in Israel, talking to the head of the Israeli military as well, that this is something that the American military is gearing up to support and prepare for that if Israel is going to be engaging in a wider regional conflict, there may well be assistance from the Americans as well.

We know that Blinken, just yesterday was talking to the Egyptian President Sisi about this trying to reopen this crossing the Rafah crossing. That is the crossing between Egypt and Gaza where not only these humanitarian supplies that you mentioned, could get into Gaza.But also, people in Gaza could get out. Many people are swarming around the Gazan side of that border desperately trying to get out because of this besiege of Israeli airstrikes and the many desperate shortages of food, medical supplies, among other things. We know that we've seen this morning there are some reports from Egyptian state media that the humanitarian convoy is moving towards the border. Now, we don't know whether that means the border is opening. But that may be an indication that something has changed. But clearly there has been a pileup of humanitarian supply just sitting there, just 45 kilometers, that's about 28 miles from this border. And there is quite considerable support that has arrived, not just from neighboring countries, but also the E.U. has set up a humanitarian corridor. They're beginning flights into Egypt, to enable the supply to get to the ground. The issue is getting it across that border. Getting it from Egypt into Gaza. And as you say, time is desperately running out. And so, we may see with Biden's visit that this is something in particular that they need to reach an agreement on this thing. Rosemary?",

When Hamas butchered and abducted our civilians, they have put themselves in jeopardy and they have basically intended in order to bring in the civilians of the Gaza Strip as their human shield.From our perspective, Hamas is responsible for everything that is going on. The deaths and the civilian reality on the ground is a responsibility of Hamas that did not do anything except cause death and destruction for their own people. Our responsibility is to restore safety and security to the people of Israel and make sure that the Gaza Strip, Rosemary, can never ever be used as the staging grounds to butcher massacre and abduct Israelis.

The U.S. president is expected to make a high stakes wartime visit to Israel this week.[02:30:00] The US secretary of state says Joe Biden will arrive Wednesday in a show of American support. an Israeli military spokesperson says President Biden's planned visit will not complicate or delay any ground invasion of Gaza. Meanwhile, the UN's Palestinian human rights official is warning of a, quote, \"Mass ethnic cleansing\" by Israel. She says Palestinians have no safe place anywhere in Gaza and humanitarian concerns are mounting. Egyptian state media reports aid convoys have been moving towards the Rafah border crossing in Gaza, but there is no indication it will open anytime soon. And the Palestinian interior ministry says new airstrikes on Rafah have killed at least 28 people this Tuesday. It is estimated that a half million Gaza residents have fled the north following Israel's evacuation order and devastating airstrikes. And now we are going to share the harrowing story of one of our own CNN family members. Ibrahim Dahman is a CNN journalist who lives in Northern Gaza with his wife Rashah. Now they have two boys and Rashah is pregnant with their third child, but Ibrahim and his family, like so many others, was forced to leave on a dangerous journey south. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IBRAHIM DAHMAN, CNN JOURNALIST (through translator): I'm with my family fleeing airstrikes in Gaza. My son is terrified.I tell him, don't be afraid, son. But the truth is I'm afraid too. My name is Ibrahim Dahman and I am a CNN journalist. For years, I have covered the stories of people in Gaza. I never thought that I would become part of the story. Last week I was in Gaza City when I was told to evacuate. I don't know where to go. Where? But where do I go? My home, my family and my life are here. Like so many others, I don't have anywhere else to go. We reach a nearby hotel. There are journalists, families and people on their own. We're now among the displaced, 1.1 million people told to evacuate Northern Gaza. DAHMAN'S SON (through translator): They don't strike hotels, right? DAHMAN (through translator): They don't strike hotels, no. I know deep down no building is safe. We watch airstrikes, and the sound of explosions keep us awake at night. On our third day, a nearby building is hit. This man was injured in the explosion. He is my father's cousin. Thankfully, he only suffered minor injuries. I must get away from the hotel. The situation is very difficult. We load our car and head south to Khan Yunis. Seconds after we left the hotel, they fired a rocket that heavily damaged the entire area. Now we're in Khan Yunis. There are still airstrikes, but it is safer here. It's only a matter of time until we flee again. I hope one day we can return home. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
