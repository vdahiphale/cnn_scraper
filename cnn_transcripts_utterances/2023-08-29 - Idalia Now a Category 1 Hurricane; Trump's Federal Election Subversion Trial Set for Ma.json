And when he refused to participate, he faced retaliation from prison authorities for not getting involved in the filming. But the second thing to see here and what David, his brother pointed out, is that Paul looks relatively well. He said -- his brother said that you can still see the fight in his eyes. So, remember that earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was able to hold a phone call with Paul Whelan. He told him to keep the faith. He said it remains a U.S. priority to get him out. But as you mentioned, the U.S. says it has for months now had a proposal on the tables to get Whelan out of prison, but has heard nothing back from Russian authorities. So, what does this signal? What does this video mean? The other thing I have to point out, Omar, is that he is not the only American in Russian prison that the U.S. considers wrongfully detained. You also have \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich. He's also someone being held right now in a Russian prison, someone that the U.S. is also trying to get out.

So you have these conflicting messages and the judge said in the interests of the public's right to have a resolution of this trial, leading up to what is going to be this election, she set the trial for March. But it does cause complications because we know that there is that March trial in Manhattan. The hush money trial that has been brought by Alvin Bragg.
