We've got a lot to get to.And we're going to start this hour with another critical week on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill. Former president Donald Trump continues his march towards clinching the GOP presidential nomination, sweeping three more states on Saturday. His campaign is now aiming to build up an insurmountable lead in two days from now, Super Tuesday, when voters in 15 states and one U.S. territory head to the polls. Nearly a third of all Republican delegates will be handed out. And despite just getting a fraction of the Republican delegates so far, Nikki Haley is hanging around. Today, she's dropping hints that she may stick around even if she doesn't win any states on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've always said this needs to be competitive. As long as we are competitive, as long as we are showing that there is a place for us, I'm going to continue to fight. That's always been the case.",

Also with me, Patrick Healy. He's a deputy opinion editor for \"The New York Times\". So Daniel, I want to go to you first because President Biden this week essentially gets a chance to address the nation in primetime for a State of the Union speech when really it could be seen as a campaign kickoff of sorts to show what he is going to deliver for the American people this time around. What does that stake for the president here? DANIEL LIPPMAN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, \"POLITICO\": I think it's a hugely important opportunity for him to try to reassure Americans and Democrats in his base that he is up to the task of being president for the next four years. There is a majority of Democrats who think he's too old to be effective. And he can try to quiet some of these doubts if he delivers a speech without a single gaffe because you are going to have tens of millions of Americans watching this speech.

      "sentences": "Yes, and that was a question. Why he declined to do that Super Bowl interview.Patrick, look, the speech comes as the Biden campaign isn't seeing the best of poll numbers at this point. I mean, your New York Times/Sienna College poll showed Biden losing to Trump now in that general election. And that Trump has never really looked stronger head-to-head as far as polls show. You see those numbers 48 to 43. And that it stems in part from Biden's sinking popularity. We're still eight months from a general election, I want to be clear. But is this poll as bad as it seems for the incumbent. Basically, is this the floor for him to move forward or is this signs of further trend? PATRICK HEALY, DEPUTY OPINION EDITOR, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": It's a tough poll for him, but it's been a series of tough polls, Omar, you know for months now for President Biden. what's so striking is that so many Americans know who President Trump is, they know what their opinion of President Trump is. They know who President Biden is, they know what their opinions of Biden is. So it's very hard for either candidate or campaign to really define the other in a new way that's going to change minds. I do think that President Biden has a real opportunity on Thursday night, if he chooses to be pretty confrontational with the Republicans who he'll be looking right out at in that chamber. You know, wasn't just a few weeks ago when Donald Trump and House and Senate Republicans really sunk the bipartisan border deal that was moving through the Senate. That's an opportunity where a lot of Americans want to see action on the border. They want to see that crisis contained. And if President Biden decides to use the State of the Union speech to really confront Republicans and call out whether it's a do-nothing Congress, whether it's a Republican House that is blocking actual progress from being made, that might give him the kind of opportunity to start turning, you know, really sort of turning the campaign and the narrative in a better direction.",

If you talk to the Israelis and the Americans, it's Hamas has yet to provide a list of the hostages that it would release under an initial phase of agreement.The Israelis are also saying that they are waiting for confirmation about the ratio of Palestinian prisoners who would be released in exchange for those Israeli hostages during an initial six-week pause in the fighting. Hamas for its part, according to a source, says that it is -- has other major gaps that still need to be addressed, including whether or not Israel will agree to a path for a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and the return of displaced Palestinians from southern Gaza to return to northern Gaza. What is clear though, is that Hamas' refusal so far to provide that list of hostages seems to be the reason why Israel has not sent a delegation to Cairo for the latest round of negotiations. A Hamas delegation did arrive in Cairo earlier today. And so the question will be whether or not over the course of this next round of negotiations, if Hamas provides a response to the latest broad framework for this potential six-week pause in the fighting. Now, amid all of this, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, catastrophic situation is coming into increasingly clearer view, particularly when it comes to the issue of malnutrition and children. The Palestinian ministry of health saying that 15 children, including infants, have now died of dehydration and malnutrition in northern Gaza with several of those happening just in the last week. Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza say that they fear for the lives of six more children who are at risk of a similar fate if more action is not taken. UNICEF is also saying that there is a need for urgent action, including the opening of additional border crossing points into northern Gaza. And we are seeing as the United States is starting to step up those efforts, airdropping 66 bundles of a humanitarian aid over the Gaza strip yesterday. But Omar, we know that that is just a drop in the bucket compared to the overall need. And frankly, those airdrops, they are risky, they are costly, and they are pretty inefficient way of actually getting aid into Gaza. What is needed is more border crossing points according to humanitarian officials and more trucks being able to get into Gaza. They say that that relies on Israeli political decision-making calling this situation in Gaza right now a man-made disaster, Omar?",

We know at least three young children were killed, including a four-month-old. That bombing happened as Russia is intensifying operations in the eastern Donetsk region following significant Ukrainian retreats.

And now we are seeing Ukrainian forces under intense Russian assault in three key village, not in themselves remotely consequential, but the fact that Russia is continuing to put Ukraine on its back foot and challenges new defensive lines suggest two things. That Russia has got momentum potentially and might continue to move forward. And secondly, that Ukraine really didn't prepare its withdrawal from Avdiivka particularly well at all. That is sparking a lot of internal criticism that were hearing amongst soldiers se meet along the front lines. A lot of deep concerns really about frankly their ability to fight period in the weeks ahead because they're not getting western aid. We were with one tank unit today who have basically run out of Soviet era shells and are dependent entirely on foreign donations. And in the entire day we were with them, they didn't fire once or the day before and it wasn't because there wasn't a raging battle, it's just a matter of meters away. It's because they simply don't have discretionary chance to use rounds. So real fears here that that aid shortage is going to have a real impact on the ground. And yes, too, Russia appears to be finding its resources. It has an apparent use of personnel, relentless videos of mass Russian casualties, sending forward infantry troops often poorly protected with very little plan it seems. And we see endless videos of them being shot down by better prepared Ukrainians. But that doesn't mean necessarily that Russia isn't actually advancing. And again and again, we hear conflicting reports, but still persistent suggestions that the places that Ukraine said it would hold, it is now seeing Russian troops hitting repeatedly. And so that's a severe issue for the Ukrainian military and their commander, the new commander of the military on the job for about three weeks now or so, Oleksandr Syrskyi, he has on two occasions since Thursday, essentially berated his subordinates for not doing their job properly, saying they had the equipment, they had the manpower, but the commanders haven't been doing the right thing and even suggested he'd made personnel changes too. So a sense, I think of great unease and discomfort both amongst the higher and the lower ranks of the Ukrainian military. Certainly a sense that Russia is further forward than anyone expected it would be at all. We're not necessarily talking about some massive change in territory now, but we are talking about a change in momentum potentially. And you were referring earlier to that attack in Odessa. You know, we talk about this every single night, how Ukraine potentially with less air defenses than it wants because of a lack of western aid, isn't able to shoot down as many drones. But it may be that in the (INAUDIBLE) in fact, what we're hearing from this horrible attack on a residential area is indeed debris from a drone being shot down hitting that. But we spoke last night, (INAUDIBLE), four months old killed in one of those apartment blocks. Mark and other children who would have been killed, he would have turned three today had he lived to see that. And Sergei a ten-year-old, declared dead as part of the growing number dying there, now 11. And so when you ask why Ukraine is fighting this war, well, it's because their populations and their children are under attack every single night. And that really feeds into the sense of urgency we see on the front lines here because frankly, Republican Congress is not moving forward urgently needed aid and people are dying here because of it, Omar.",

I think there's a sort of feeling well, if you don't let us fight the Russians, then if we lose, then this becomes Europe's problem because there's a belief here, a belief frankly in European capitals to that if Putin is successful in Ukraine, he doesn't necessarily decide to call it a day. He potentially thinks he needs to keep moving forwards, potentially that emboldens China with Taiwan and a whole sense of international security problems could really become America's imminently if we don't see Ukraine at least manage to hold its lines here.And so I think, yes, there's some sort of shock, frankly that they're at this point where a tiny number of Congress persons who have extraordinary, it seems either antipathy towards assisting Ukraine or sympathy towards Russia are stopping this from moving forwards. And it's really urgent. It's important to realize that we don't necessarily have the weeks that Speaker Johnson thinks he has to, you know, calculate some new potential bid for this. They need it now and they're losing land and they're losing people now because of a lack of that. And at some point it will become too late for western aid to step in and try and fix that.

Now a bit of good news is once we get to Monday, you will really start to see those precipitation amounts coming back down, getting a little bit easier for folks to get out, maybe assess some damage or conditions around their home. But on Tuesday, we get another round of moisture coming back and see you're going to see those chances for rain and snow tick back up up again before finally coming to an end by Thursday of this week. Until then, however, some of these areas still expected to pick up half a foot, even as much as an additional one to two feet of snow on top of what they've already had. So, you're certainly still going to have some issues as we go through the rest of the day on Sunday, some of these wind reports here again, numerous this ones over 100 miles per hour. That's why we've had several areas dealing with power outages already. And while the winds are starting to come back down today and we'll continue to do so into Monday. They are still going to be up in that 40 to 70 mile per hour range at times, especially the higher in elevation you go.

This is a community coming together to get hay, feed, water to a lot of these ranchers that are in so much need. And we were told there for some of these ranchers that live maybe 25 miles away from the closest small town and the volunteers are doing everything they can to get all of this to them.

Methane Sat is the joint creation of scientists at Harvard and the environmental defense fund. It'll circle the globe fifth ten times a day to detect and measure changes in methane concentrations, which is significant because it could potentially sniff out large emitters of the greenhouse gas that's responsible for about 30 percent of today's global warming.And one of the satellite's creators and the president of the Environmental Defense Fund, Fred Krupp, joins me now. Fred, first of all, congratulations. Great to see you. What do you hope to achieve with the launch of Methane Sat?",

This satellite will be the first time that any greenhouse gas is actually being measured from the sources in a comprehensive way.And so, that data is the prerequisite for accountability the other thing is that the European Union and Japan and South Korea, big importers of LNG are on the path to imposing standards to make sure that the gas they import is clean and that the companies have reduced their methane pollution by something like the 90 percent that's been pledged.",
