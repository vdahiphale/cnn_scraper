We begin with an important political but largely symbolic move, which is being celebrated by Palestinians and condemned by Israel. Norway, Ireland and Spain say that they will formally recognize a Palestinian state beginning next week, joining some 140 nations that have already done so. Israel is recalling its ambassadors to the three nations in protest. Spain's Prime Minister says the move is aimed at accelerating efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. And Norway's Prime Minister stressed there can be no peace without a two state solution. Ireland's Prime Minister referred to the Palestinian suffering unfolding in real time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This paves the way to re-establish Israeli settlements that were evacuated and demolished nearly 20 years ago.

And I think he was perhaps implying the European Union or at least many European nations in the United States, if we all act together and then that has the potential for having the greater political influence, which at the end of the day is what the what the Irish Taoiseach, the Irish Prime Minister, Simon Harris, said that he wanted to achieve. He wanted to achieve or hope that this would achieve a powerful political and symbolic measure. He sort of recounts Ireland's own efforts to gain independence from Great Britain more than 100 years ago as sort of -- one of the sort of root drivers within -- within Ireland, why they see it as important to support that move by the by the palace, by the Palestinians. But -- but undoubtedly, you know, the Irish said that they could see that this was going to cause interpretations and reactions. And that's certainly what -- what has happened today. The Norwegian Prime Minister, when he spoke, said his view was essentially this simple, that peace in the Middle East comes with -- with a two-state solution, a Palestinian state and Israeli state. And therefore, he said without a Palestinian state, you cannot have peace. The counter argument has been that you can -- you can move to peace at the same time as agreeing a path to a Palestinian state. So, I think for these countries, it really is an effort to try to change and pressure greater movement and the conflict in Gaza. That was another thing that the Irish Prime Minister mentioned.",

This public mourning, of course, is extremely important to the people here in Tehran, but also very important to the governments here in Iran. They have been plastering the city with posters depicting the President, the Foreign Minister and the others who were killed in that crash. And they have encouraged people to come here to participate in this mourning. As far as the people themselves are concerned, many of them, of course, say that they are very sad. They are shocked by what's happened. But many of them also say they need to know what happens next. It's been interesting because the country's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, even while the helicopter was still missing, he came out and he said there would not be any disruption in the government. Iran's government has already called for new elections that are going to take place on June 28, as they're trying to portray stability, but also trying to foresight a new government to lead the country forward.

Multiple deaths and injuries have been reported. At least 18 tornadoes were reported in the state. Just part of a series of storms that have resulted in widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding throughout the region. Well, a delegation of Kenyan command staff arrived in Haiti on Tuesday ahead of the planned deployment of troops to the capital of Port-au-Prince. The Kenyan forces will enter a city under siege where gang violence has made life unbearable. The U.N. approved the security mission to assist Haiti's overwhelmed police force back in October. But deploying troops has faced numerous challenges and is only happening now. CNN's David Culver has been following the story for this. And quite controversial development, too, in the deployment of these troops which initially led to the current chaos that you've been reporting so vigorously on the past few months. David, what is the latest with these troops finally arriving now? DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Bianna. Yeah, this is really frustrating for a lot of the Haitians in particular who are hoping to find some sort of alleviation of the gang controlled territory that they find themselves in particularly within the capital, Port-au- Prince. Now, this Kenyan command staff that you mentioned, they have an assessment team on the ground and what we're hearing through sources and our colleague, Katelyn, who reported this, is that there is, in their minds, not yet enough infrastructure, equipment, some of the evacuation helicopters needed to sustain this MSS, this multinational security support. So, where does that leave things? Well, it delays them even further. And you'll recall that this was a foreign force that was supposed to come in now several months ago. It was initially delayed because of the sudden resignation of the now former Prime Minister, Ariel Henry. And it's because of his departure that the Kenyans were looking at this and saying, now wait a minute, if nobody's in charge, who's going to lead the forces that go in and where does that leave our teams on the ground? This transitional council is now in place in Haiti and so that's going to help with the structure of this and you've got Haitian police saying they'll take the lead. Still, when you think about Port-au-Prince, more than 80 percent of that capital is controlled by gangs, and so, they're going to be up against a significant force and resistance and these Kenyan forces know that. And it's not just the Kenyans behind it. You've got other countries that are going to be contributing here to try to assist with this effort which is going to be a really difficult one and they're well aware of that. But there's challenges when you think of these foreign forces coming in. Of course, Haiti has a very fraught relationship with external forces and folks on the ground will tell you that. But then, you've got everything from cultural differences to language differences. The Haitian police, they're saying, now we speak French and Creole. The Kenyans coming in will speak English. How are we going to be on the same page? So, there's a lot of confusion and uncertainty still at play and all of this, of course, coming ahead of what was supposed to be a big meeting between the Kenyan President Ruto and President Biden in Washington, tomorrow. They were hoping this would all be in place. As of now, Bianna, still no troops on the ground. So, folks there are desperately waiting.",

We will be having a conversationabout the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act, the AGOA, that gives us duty-free, quarter-free access to the American market with our goods. MADOWO (voice-over): African nations want the 24-year-old AGOA renewed before it expires next year. But some, like Rwanda, have been blocked from accessing the U.S. market. That country's President, Paul Kagame, stood his ground in a dispute linked to a 2019 ban on some clothing imports, a move designed to develop its local textile industry.",

But now, we have this Tennessee court chancellor blocking that sale, saying that Graceland stays in the hands of the Presley family for now. So, let me backtrack a little bit into how we got to this point. The creditor, the lender behind that sale, Naussany Investments and Private Lending LLC, presented documents according to a lawsuit claiming that Lisa Marie Presley took out a loan with them for $3.8 million and then defaulted on that loan and that she had used Graceland as collateral for that loan, meaning that Graceland now belongs to them, and it's their right to sell it in order to reclaim back their money. Well, Riley Keough, the granddaughter to Elvis Presley and the daughter to Lisa Marie Presley before her passing, she is the legal owner of Graceland, and she filed a lawsuit claiming that those documents were fake, that her mother's signature was forged on there, she never borrowed money, never used Graceland as collateral, and also saying that Naussany isn't even a real company either. The judge today, the chancellor, stating that she has a specific point here, proof to her allegations when it comes to the notary on that paperwork, a Florida notary actually put forth a signed affidavit swearing that they never notarized Lisa Marie Presley's signature and never even met her. Here's what the judge had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOADAE L. JENKINS, COURT CHANCELLOR: Which brings in the question as to the authenticity of the signature and, indeed, the leader's trust as being a fraud. It appears that you, Mr. Germany, your client, will be successful on the merits of the second trial, provided you prove at the ultimate hearing the fraud that has been alleged. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
