This idea that Russia and China are trying to say to the U.S. and its European allies, you're not going to set out the world order. There is a new world order. We get a say in this, and you can't ignore us.So, in that light, you can see China sending the jets into Taiwan, staking a claim that even though President Biden just signed a huge defense deal that includes new, more sophisticated military aid to Taiwan. But China is not giving up on eventually subsuming that country the way it did Hong Kong. Also, you have Russia saying -- sorry. North Korea saying, we're going to keep spying on the South, even though the U.S. has not been open to peace talks with us, and the U.S. and South Korea have had recent military drills together.",

They're having trouble resupplying on the ground, and they are not making much progress. The Ukrainian army continues to keep them on the back foot on a number of different battlefronts.That said, countries like Germany, there have been factions within Germany that have started really warming up to the idea of peace talks and showing their war fatigue. Putin knows this. So, by offering peace talks where he has no intention of meeting President Zelenskyy's ten- point plan. The Ukrainian president has laid out a plan that includes the Russian withdrawal from everything including Crimea, Putin doesn't intend to withdraw from Crimea. But by saying he's open to peace talks, that creates a divide that over time he can start working on and trying to widen between the U.S., Ukraine, and some of the European nations that are tired of this war.",

They feel in -- when you read their comments on Twitter or social media, you can see that the resolve of the public is to continue with this war and resist any talks that would see them giving up some territory to Russia.There's a real visceral hatred of Russia that is building with each passing attack, especially on the civilian infrastructure.

Right now, of course, the sun is out.A lot of them waiting because they don't necessarily want to stay here in El Paso. What they want is to go somewhere where they have maybe a family or a friend that could help them start their life in this country. So, in the meantime, a lot of them just hanging out here. They're on this bus because that is the only place where they can warm up, but not just warm up, it is the only place where they can go rest for maybe a few minutes or a few hours. So, they're taking turns going in and out of the bus because especially it's the only place they can go right now. Well, there is a huge backlog of asylum applications. These people say they want to do things the right way, but they are frustrated with the process here in this country -- Pam.",

In particular, Robert E. Lee, the commanding general of the Confederate army.And because of the work of the naming commission, West Point, officially known as the United States Military Academy, will change or remove those in some way. This has been a very long process to get here. The naming commission was created back in late 2020 and began its work shortly after that. But it first looked at different names for military bases. Then it looked at the academies and that's what brought us here to a list of these 13 things that have to be changed or have recommendations to change at West Point. In the letter, the superintendent of West Point said they would begin work on these and there's a committee set up to find first how to do this and then find replacement names -- if that's what happens here. But in terms of what will be changed, there's a portrait of General Robert E. Lee that will be removed, a quote from him, again, building names as well as street names. All of that will be part of this process to remove anything that commemorates or memorializes the Confederacy at West Point. In through the work of the naming commission, it's not just West Point. We're seeing the military change the names of bases. For example, Fort Bragg will become Fort Liberty. Fort Benning will become a Fort Moore. So, if there's this list the military is working through to make sure that it doesn't commemorate the Confederacy in some way because of the bipartisan support of the naming commission. And this will take time, but we're getting there, and we're seeing that process play out -- Pamela.",

We are talking about grounded planes and shuttered package facilities and delivery trucks that just can't get back on the roads. Even as of today U.P.S. was warning that there will be no package pickup or delivery at almost 900 zip codes across four states, Michigan, New York, Indiana and Ohio. FedEx warns of delays through today. The U.S. Postal Service had to close dozens of post offices and even Amazon was forced to shut down some facilities.Now, as far as how long this lasts, it really depends on when everyone is able to dig out, when the infrastructure comes back online, the power, the highways. It's going to take some time, of course, and you know, in the meantime this is really causing some headaches for a lot of people, especially for those of us who waited until the very last moment to do their Christmas shopping and their holiday shopping because all of that stuff is delayed. Pamela, in some cases this has turned those last minute Christmas gifts into early New Year's gifts.",
