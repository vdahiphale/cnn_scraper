Also in other parts of the U.S., forecasters warning that a new dangerous heat wave could break more temperature records, also threaten power grids. Meteorologist Chad Meyers joins me now. Chad, I mean, let's begin with these heat warnings. And I want to because you and I have been speaking so frequently. Bizarre intense weather patterns across the board. I know weather is not climate. But are these connected to climate change when you see this collection of events?",

Would it have been hot? Yes, but I think we're probably in the hotter because of category. So here's the heat dome across the Southwest. We'll talk about flooding in the Northeast and we'll talk about some absolutely ridiculous water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits.Heat dome right over the Southwest, it builds in. And we have heat warnings and watches and advisories when it's just a normal temperature. We're talking 10 to 20 degrees above where you should be this time of year. And the heat really, really peaks Sunday and Monday for Sacramento, for Oakland, all the way through the inland empire. 60 possible records just here between now and through the end of the week. Here are some of the stats though. I think you just have to look at this. Phoenix has had 12 consecutive days over 110. 12 over 110 in the shade. And look at the next seven. No help there. Still above 110. Hot all across the Southwest. But that hot weather sneaks up into Central California as well. We know about the flooding here across parts of the Northeast. Unfortunately, more rain is on the way. And typically, one to three or four inches wouldn't really affect this area but there is no place for this water to soak in. It's all going to absolutely run off again. The waters are coming down in many areas on these rivers. But with two to four more inches of rain over the weekend, that could change. Now we look at Miami. Miami is talking about heat index. Not the 110 in Phoenix, but the heat index in the afternoon in Miami in the shade has been over 100 degrees 33 days in a row. And what has that caused? Excessive heat in the ocean. The ocean heat content is truly unbelievable I think. I have friends that are crab fishermen in the Florida Bay. They don't know what they're going to do. The waters there is 93, 94 degrees. They don't know where the crabs are going to go or if they've even going to live.",

Bleaching can have devastating effects to the entire marine ecosystem. And just Monday, buoys off of the coast of Florida measured hot tub like water temperatures. You saw 93 degrees there on Chad's map. We're talking about near 97 degrees here.And my next guest saw the bleaching firsthand this past weekend while diving off the coast of the northern Florida Keys. Dr. Katey Lesneski is the research and monitoring coordinator for Mission Iconic Reefs, which is a division of NOAA. Katie, take us through what you saw. Just give us a description of what you saw and what it should have looked like but did not. DR. KATEY LESNESKI, PHD, RESEARCH AND MONITORING COORDINATOR, MISSION ICONIC REEFS: Thank you so much, Brianna, for having me speak about this important topic today. So, right now we are anticipating pretty severe bleaching that could start to really crop up several weeks to a month plus from now. Right now the waters are anomalously high for this time of year. So we are starting to see those hallmark tell-tale signs of bleaching where the corals start to lose their color. They go from vibrant browns and greens to looking like they are bleaching out. And soon again we do anticipate seeing really stark white corals even deep down off the coast.",

      "sentences": "So once a coral starts to experience heat stress that's driven by these really high air and water temperatures that we're seeing now, corals can start to lose their symbolic algae that inhabits their tissue. It provides them with most of their food. So, we start to see that peeling, that color loss. And if conditions don't improve within a week or so, that coral can certainly end up dying. And when we have many corals throughout the reef that are bleaching, that are dying, there is definitely an ecological cascade, a domino effect where all the organisms that depend on healthy coral reefs will see effect as well. KEILARmarine life? And how much time does it take to rebound if you can from these effects?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's a great question. So corals, the ones that we do see bleaching are the ones that make up the structural framework. All the habitats, the nooks and crannies and if those corals die, eventually they'll start to disintegrate. And so, we lose that physical habitat that actually more than 25 percent of all the world's marine species depend on coral habitat at some point in time.This recovery period is really dependent on if environmental conditions improve on or if there are other stressors like hurricanes that can come through and cause further physical damage. But Mission Iconic Reefs, which is the program that I'm a part of, is working on a 20-year long restoration effort actually with climate change in mind to physically restore these reefs in the face of climate change using corals that we hope to be more resilient.",

That is before -- we should note -- most women know they're pregnant. The bill does include exemptions for miscarriages, when the life of the woman is threatened, deadly fetal abnormalities and rape or incest if reported to authorities within a certain number of days. CNN's Jake Tapper he's covering the story next on \"THE LEAD,\" Jake, you know, this clearly has potential political impact.

Because obviously these restrictions go well beyond where the rhetoric of many in the antiabortion movement -- they call themselves the pro-life movement -- were saying in terms having some restrictions. These are close to all- out bans. Although the Iowa bill has more exceptions than other legislation we've seen on the state level, including in Florida.What is interesting is, of course, a lot of political experts, Jim, say they expect this legislation to have a huge impact when it comes to battleground states -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. The real question is, what kind of effect will it have in places like Iowa? We saw, for instance, in Kansas, the way that that referendum changed -- attempted to change abortion law to completely ban it essentially in Kansas but the voting did not go that way. Because ultimately, as you know, people when polled on the subject, the public in general even in Republican leaning states, do not support this kind of restriction. Coming up, we are going to talk to former Republican Congressman Will Hurd. He's running for president. He supports a 15-week ban. We'll ask him what happens if he gets elected president and a Republican Congress gives him a ban like the one Iowa is about to sign into law -- Jim.",
