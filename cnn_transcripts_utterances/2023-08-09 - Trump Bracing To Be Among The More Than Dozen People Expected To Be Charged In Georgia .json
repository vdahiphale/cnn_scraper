And it is expected to seek numerous charges in the next days.And the special counsel Jack Smith obtaining a secret memo the Trump team used to defend the fake elector scheme. The document citing writings by constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe. Well, he's OUTFRONT to tell us what he thinks about how they used his words. And breaking news, at least six people dead as wildfires rage on Maui. Some even jumping in the ocean to escape the flames. New video tonight revealing utter devastation. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, more than a dozen individuals could face new indictments, and former President Donald Trump believes that he will be among those charged. This time in Georgia where Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to seek charges against more than a dozen people when she presents her case before a grand jury next week. Now, these are live pictures on your screen right now. This is the courthouse where that grand jury is going to meet. Willis is expected to present her investigation into Trump's attempts to overturn the election in Georgia to the grand jury there and then issue indictments early next week. Now, if you look here at the calendar, it adds to Trump's jammed legal schedule over the next days. Tomorrow, a hearing on the Mar-a-Lago case. The day after, a hearing in the special counsel's federal election interference case. So, it's day after day after day. And we do have developments in each of those cases tonight, all of it adding to an agitated Trump. He's lashing out again on his social media today, railing against Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor investigating him, calling him, quote, deranged Jack Smith. He posted that today. He posted that yesterday, and he posted it the day before. And sometimes, he posts it multiple times a day. And these words are having some serious consequences already. According to a source with direct knowledge of Atlanta law enforcement movements, we're now learning the D.A. Fani Willis has recently been assigned additional security. She says she's received obscene voice message, perhaps encouraged by Trump's repeated false attacks against her, including ones like this. And this was just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So this development is that we now know prosecutors went to gain access to Trump's Twitter account without him knowing. We'll talk more about what could mean in a moment.Also though in a Mar-a-Lago documents case, a development in great irony. Tonight, Trump's team asking the court to allow Trump to discuss classified documents in the Mar-a-Lago case at or near his home instead of a designated secure facility at the courthouse where everyone else has to go to discuss the documents. He wants one of those secure facilities at his home. The irony, of course, not lost on anyone that this case is all about Trump having classified documents in various places, including bathrooms at his home, and, you know, not caring about how they were stored. We have all the angles covered tonight. I want to begin with Sara Murray. She has been closely following the Georgia case from the very beginning. And, Sara, here we are, right, the courthouse on high alert. The sheriff there tells us, right, he is ready at any day, at any moment for this to possibly happen.

But this is in the documents case in Florida. What makes this different is that it's a fight over how Trump can handle the classified evidence. So we know from the court records so far, there's about 1,500 pages of classified documents that are going to be very protected leading up into this trial. They are going to be things that can only be looked at in what's called a SCIF, a secured facility at places like a federal courthouse. However, there's also questions about where Donald Trump himself can talk about that material with his attorneys. The Justice Department has wanted to keep it very locked down. But Donald Trump and his lawyers made an ask to the court today in Florida, saying, couldn't he look at these documents, or not look at them actually -- could he talk about these documents inside secure facilities that you can establish either at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida, or at Bedminster where he lives most of the time in New Jersey. And they say quite reasonably in some ways that actually Mar-a-Lago had a secure facility like this while he was president. They have the ability to have security around him. The judge will weigh in on this and make a determination. But it is a question of how classified information can be discussed, where that can take place.",

You hear Trump's comments about deranged Jack Smith, his comments about her. You know, what's your reaction to that? GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, it's -- it's pathetic, right, to think that we have to add additional security because of a made-up fake narrative around an election.

The idea that he could say, oh, I still want to be able to access it at home while I'm under investigation post indictment or charge would be anathema to the entire system because that's where the alleged crime took place of the mishandling of information.

The government has already said the secret service's mandate is not to protect classified information. That's not their mission.

In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Georgia and the other states, the laws are different. And I never suggested that there was some universal rule that, regardless of what Congress says in the Electoral Count Act, and regardless of which slates are certified, that you could just keep counting and counting and counting.

That's my layperson summary of this.Even if in the end, the Supreme Court would rule that the power to count the votes does not lie with the president or the Senate but instead lies with Congress, letting matters play out this way would guarantee that public attention would be riveted on the evidence of electoral abuses by the Democrats and would buy the Trump campaign more time to win litigation that would deprive Biden of electoral votes and add to Trump's column.

I'll read you part of what is alleged to have been the suspect's troubling social media history. He said at one point, I hear Biden is coming to Utah, digging out my ghillie suit, that's that camouflage attire worn by snipers, and cleaning the dust off the M24 sniper rifle. That's obviously concerning to U.S. Secret Service and to the FBI. They were at this residence and they try to take him into custody. Now, this investigation actually began back in March. It was a social media company that saw something online that troubled them. They contacted the FBI's national threat operations center. This is the global clearing house for tips. They called the FBI, said we see something that's troubling us. That actually pertained to Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, an alleged threat against him. The suspect allegedly writing: Heading to New York to fulfill my dream of eradicating another George Soros two- bit political hack D.A. I'll be waiting in the courthouse parking garage with my suppressed nine-millimeter to smoke a radical full prosecutor that should never have been elected.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:56:12] BURNETT: Tonight, Shakespeare censored. One Florida school district says it will no longer have students read the full text of plays like \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Hamlet,\" and \"Macbeth.\" This is in response to changes in state law under Governor Ron DeSantis, which limits to talk sex in schools. Now, the Hillsborough school district, which includes most of Tampa, students will only read excerpts of Shakespeare's works to avoid racy scenes. OUTFRONT now, Joseph Cool, a high school teacher in Hillsborough County. Joseph, I remember reading those plays in high school. I don't remember anything sexually explicit. But I do remember reading them and reading them in full. You've been teaching Shakespeare in your class for more than 20 years, right? It's been a cornerstone of what you've been teaching your students as well. So, let me read a famous scene from Romeo and Juliet. These are the last words from Juliet before she dies. Oh, happy dagger! This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die. So, this is now explicit, so they can't read the end of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" it's banned?",
