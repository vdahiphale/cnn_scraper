This is part of a new effort to combat a recent surge in border crossings.U.S. officials still expect migrant crossings to remain high, at least in the near term. The mayor of El Paso, Texas, warns that the city is reaching a breaking point with more than 2,000 migrants coming in each day as opened overflow shelters deal with that influx. CNN's Rosa Flores joins from us Houston. Rosa, I want to get to the details of this agreement but, first, what is driving this latest wave of migrants?",

And what they say that is driving this particular surge is misinformation. A lot of it flowing from migrants themselves who have already crossed into the United States, have been sending videos or having conversations with migrants on the border. And the migrants are saying I've been, quote, :allowed into the United States. I have been released into the country.\" And the misinformation there, Jim is the nuance. When individuals say they've been, quote, \"allowed\" into the country, that's incorrect. A lot of these migrants have entered in between ports of entry. And what U.S. Border Patrol has to do by law as an enforcement agency, they have to apply the law. They have to process these migrants. And some of them are allowed to enter -- allowed to stay in the country, pending immigration proceedings. Now if you ask U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they say lot of this information is being disseminated by cartels and criminal organizations on the border. And I'll add one other thing from one of the community leaders in south Texas, who says there's an increase in kidnappings in Mexico as well, across the border from south Texas in certain places. And a lot of migrants have to make the decision, do they stay in a violent, dangerous location in Mexico or do they take their chances and cross illegally into the United States.",

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Canada has upgraded its travel warning to India, urging residents to be vigilant and cautious. And it calls for protests. This is coming as we have new details about why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of having a hand in the death of a Sikh activist in British Columbia. U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Cohen says intel shared among the so- called Five eyes partners led Trudeau to making the accusation. Five Eyes, referring to the intel-sharing pact between the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. India denies the allegations, calling them absurd. And its relations with Canada, though, have gone downhill since then. CNN's Paula Newton is joining us from Ottawa on this. Paula, what more are you learning about this new intel?",

I want you, though, to listen to Ambassador Cohen speak for himself.

There are protests planned in both countries. But more than anything, this is an incredibly sensitive topic, including for those countries you just mentioned and the Five Eyes, but principally the Biden administration. India was supposed to be the centerpiece of their Indo-Pacific strategy. It likely remains so. And this kind of spat between the two allies just doesn't do anyone any good. We're waiting to see if India continues to retaliate on this.",

How do we pick it up and get it back to earth? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: So it started back in 2016. NASA launched the Osiris-REx spacecraft. It then travelled seven years, four billion miles to this asteroid, a very ancient asteroid called Bennu. From there, they had to circle it, orbit it, find the best place to get up close and collect the sample. And they thought it was going to be one big rock, but they actually described it as like a pit of plastic balls. So the asteroid Bennu almost grabbed the entire spacecraft itself. But they were able to collect the sample. And the spacecraft was able to it back to earth, which is what we saw yesterday. That's an animation of it re-entering the earth's atmosphere at temperatures of about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. And then it landed just a cool 11 miles an hour with the help of some big parachutes yesterday.",
