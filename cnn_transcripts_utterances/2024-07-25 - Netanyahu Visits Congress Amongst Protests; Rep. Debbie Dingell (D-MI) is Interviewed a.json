And then, outside of Union Station, protesters ripped down the American flag, set it on fire. A Palestinian flag was raised in its place, while an effigy of the prime minister burned. At that point, somebody tried to rescue the flag from the flames, but it was quickly chased from the scene. And one act of protest from a member of Congress in attendance at the speech itself. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan held up a sign during Netanyahu's speech that read, \"guilty of genocide\" and \"war criminal.\" Netanyahu said this about the protesters outside.

And people forget that these days, in addition to the financial, it's social media It's everything you've ever said. It's everything you've ever thought of saying somewhere on social media. So, there's a lot that goes into it. What typically happens, as you know is, there's a book on everybody or a folder and everybody and you kind of see pluses and minuses.
