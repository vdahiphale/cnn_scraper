And he didn't just clench the gavel, he clinched the record for the longest speaker contest in 164 years. This was the scene after four days and 15 rounds of voting. But McCarthy's journey to the speakership was fraught with drama. It got a little intense. It almost came to blows last night. The 14th vote should have been the clincher as McCarthy and his allies thought they had the vote in the bag. But Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz had other ideas. He waited until the very end of the balloting process to vote present even though McCarthy needed just one more yes vote to win. McCarthy appeared stunned and walked up the House floor to confront Matt Gaetz himself. And watch what unfolded as McCarthy walked away dejected, Armed Services Committee chairman Mike Rogers appears to suddenly lunge at Gaetz and had to be physically restrained by a fellow Republican. This afternoon, I spoke to Republican Congressman Tim Burchett who was in the area of the incident about what happened in this moment. Here is what he saw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TIM BURCHETTE (R-TN): I realized that both sides have some older members and it was getting late, and I suspect most of them had missed the early bird special at the sizzler so they were getting a little cantankerous. And Mike, who is a friend of mine, came by and said some things, probably in haste as a lot of us do and probably responded to him with some things as well. You know, and Matt had -- Matt Gaetz had asked to review some of those rules before we voted on speaker. And he felt like he wasn't given enough time to do just that and asked for a little bit of time. You can see me later in one of the tapes going like that because I had asked our leadership to give us a little bit of a break so we could put our heads together and go over some of those things. It was just unfortunate situation and that's what happens when people are tired and you -- and, as you said, it was the 15th ballot that we were able to pass.",

Ron, great to see you. You know, Gaetz says because of all the concessions he made, McCarthy will essentially have to govern, act as speaker in a straight jacket.

It looked like he was lunging at him or was going to stick a finger in his face, we're not really sure. I know tempers are bound to get short. You have watched this kind of stuff play out for years, Ron. Did that surprise you? BROWNSTEIN: Yes. Short answer, yes. I mean this is what you read about more in the 19th century when physical altercations on the floor of the House, most famously the caning of Charles Sumner before the Civil War were more common. But Jim, to me there were two defining images from last night and they represent the two poles of risks that Republicans face in the choice of McCarthy made to get this job. One is that first image of Rogers lunging at Gaetz. And that's just a question of coming across as dysfunctional, not ready for primetime, not really capable of running the institution. I think an even bigger risk is the second defining image of the night which is when Marjorie Taylor Greene who was excluded from committees while Democrats ran the place on -- citing her previous remarks about violence and conspiracy theories and anti-Islamic and so forth comments -- she raced down the aisle to take a photo, a selfie with Kevin McCarthy, which may have been his first act as speaker.

They're going to be at the center of the imagery in many of these investigations that McCarthy agreed to, including one on the weaponization -- exact word -- of the FBI and Justice Department. Greene says she wants to investigate whether the Justice Department is being unfair to the January 6th insurrectionists. And now -- I mean it is going to greatly facilitate the ability of Democrats to basically say this is the face of this majority. That's what McCarthy has put in motion. And as I said, there are conservatives who say, fine, you know, this is going to turn out more conservatives and we are going to win. But the fact is that Republicans lost Independents in this midterm, the first time since at least 1982 that the party out of power lost Independent voters. And one of the reasons they lost them in the midterms was because almost 60 percent of them said the party was too extreme. [17:09:56]",

Police say the DNA is suspect Bryan Kohberger's. This is the house where the college students were killed. According to the affidavit when police arrived they went through that door where the Christmas wreath is. On the second floor to the right of the door is the bedroom where Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin were killed. Also on the second floor, to the left in the back of the house, according to the affidavit, that's where witness DM was. And finally on the third floor, you see that window there, according to the affidavit that's where Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen were and that's where the knife sheath was found. Based on the affidavit, it appears that Bryan Kohberger has been near this house many times before. The affidavit indicating Kohberger's cellphone signal was detected 12 times near the house over a period of five months prior to the murders. All of these occasions except for one occurred in the late evening and early morning hours of the respective days. It wouldn't necessarily be suspicious if Bryan Kohberger drove past this house 12 times over five months if these were busy or prominent streets or streets on the way to another neighborhood. But to come here you have to be looking for it. These roads are windy, they're narrow, they're curvy. In short, it seems difficult to accidentally end up here. The affidavit states that one of the students who survived with the initials DM heard crying and opened her door three times. She saw a figure clad in black clothing and a mask that covered the person's mouth and nose walking towards her. DM described the figure as 5'10 or taller, male, not very muscular, but athletically built with bushy eyebrows. The male walked past DM as she stood in a frozen shocked phase (ph). The male walked towards the sliding glass door. DM locked herself in the room after seeing the male. DM did not state that she recognized the male. This turned out to be critical information because on November 25th, shortly after the murders, Moscow police asked law enforcement agencies to be on the look out for a white Hyundai Elantra that had been seen near the murder site. Four days later police discovered a white Elantra in this parking lot just across the state line in pullman, Washington. According to the affidavit it was registered to Kohberger who lived up these stairs in this townhouse complex. Police acquired his driver's license information, and they say according to the affidavit that it was consistent with DM's description of the man she saw who was wearing black clothing and a mask. The affidavit does not contain information about motive or if the alleged killer knew any of the victims, but authorities could very well have leads about those topics that are not being publicly released yet. Next Thursday in this courthouse behind me Bryan Kohberger will have another hearing. This will be a status hearing to discuss scheduling in the case. Within the next couple of weeks he will be arraigned where he will likely issue a plea. Gary Tuchman, CNN -- in Moscow, Idaho. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's a fairly low standard.And sometimes in these complaints that's really all you will see, but here the prosecutors went way above that in terms of the evidence, the DNA evidence is really the most important piece as Gary said. There was a sample of DNA recovered from a knife sheath at the scene that has been matched to this suspect by a 99.9998 probability, scientifically -- that is very powerful evidence. On top of that, the police really did an exceptional job analyzing his cellphone records, his automobile records, to place him definitively at the scene of the crime. And on top of that, we know that this individual showed some signs that he was trying to cover-up his tracks afterwards.

And as Gary said, it is not something you would pass by. So there could be a suggestion here that there was some sort of stalking or obsessive type of motive. ACOSTA: And it does seem as though Bryan Kohberger was at the scene of the killings. What is stopping his defense team from just saying, ok, he was there but he didn't kill anybody.

And I think the prosecutors are going to come back with, first of all, he doesn't know any of these people. As far as we know, he has no reason to be there. I don't know that there's any evidence that anyone else was there. And here is where I think the evidence that this individual tried to cover up his tracks after the fact becomes so important. Our John Miller, our colleague, has reported that the police watched him. He went to his parents' house in Pennsylvania. They watched him cleaning his car inside and out. They watched him wearing surgical gloves. They watched him take his garbage out at 4:00 a.m. and put it not in his own parents' garbage cans but in a neighbor's garbage cans.

People will calculate risk and reward if they have the ability to play at a high level. Ephraim Salaam calculated, for his generation, it was worth it. His kids, perhaps different circumstances financially and whatever. And he knows what he had to endure and what effect it has had on his life post-football so he doesn't want his sons to do that. A certain percentage of parents and athletes will make that decision. But will it be a large enough percentage for football to fall by the wayside? No. It is not only the most popular sport in America. It is the most significant and successful thing in all of American entertainment. In a fractionalized media universe, the only thing that consistently aggregates an enormous audience is the NFL. It is not going anywhere. I give them some credit for doing the best they can with the knowledge we now have, with concussion protocols, and now, in this case, overall medical protocols. Some other silver lining aspect to this story, you are aware of this, I'm sure, Jim, I don't know the young player, but from all accounts he's a wonderful young man and he had a charity designed to raise -- his goal was $2,500 to buy toys for kids around Christmas in the Pittsburgh area, which is where he is from.

So there was no practical way to make it up. And you certainly weren'tgoing to bring the Bengals and Bills back a few days later to play that game considering what they just witnessed and the emotional state they were in. So here is what they're going to do. And I will not get into all of the scenarios. People can watch the NFL network or read about it online because it is too complicated. But it is possible, depending upon tomorrow's results, that the Chiefs and the Bills could wind up with the same number of losses, but the Bills by virtue of playing one less game, would have one less victory. So the way they'll decide this, should they meet down the road in the AFC championship game, one game short of the Super Bowl, they will play that game at a neutral site. That site hasn't been decided yet. It is also possible, if the Ravens beat the Bengals tomorrow, that the Ravens and Bengals would wind up in kind of the same situation and the game the Bengals didn't play would have had an effect on the seeding. So if they have to meet in a first-round game, for example, on a wild card round, home field in that game would be decided by a flip of the coin.",

The tabloids had a field day, from his scuffle with Prince William to pleading with Charles not to marry Camilla. \"The Daily Mail\" called Harry \"the prince of pettiness.\"  \"The Sun\" claimed he was \"throwing his own family under a bus for millions of dollars.\" For Harry, the negative reaction would have been predictable.

RICHARD KEMP, RETIRED, BRITISH ARMY COMMANDER IN AFGHANISTAN: The description you gave of British military training of training their soldiers to treat the enemy like, not human beings, like chess pieces to be swept aside.

From the serious to the salacious, Harry also describes losing his virginity in the book, behind a pub to an older woman at the age of 17. And we learn he asked for a driver to re-create the journey his mother, Princess Diana, took through the tunnel twice in Paris where she died. That's according to an excerpt in \"People\" magazine. By his own admission, he may be oversharing. But that's what makes this book so remarkable. Royals never overshare. They barely say anything about their private lives at all. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Is that what he means by mea culpa and by culpability? The fact is, he is spewing. Now he's done it whatever reason. We don't know. I'm not about to speculate. But he has spewed. And he's done so in a dramatic way, which will delight some people. The number of people who have taken issue to me, Jim, and said, ah, but they were horrible to Meghan. That might be true. But what he has just done, as somebody says, he's thrown the whole family under the bus. Knowing they hate this, he has told his truth without consequence or fear.
