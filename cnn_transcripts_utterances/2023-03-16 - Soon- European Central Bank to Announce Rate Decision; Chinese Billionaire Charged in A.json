Let's call it that position of being the first to make a rate decision since the collapse of U.S. Bank, Silicon Valley Bank. That announcement is expected in around 15-minutes time. Just remember a week ago we expected them to hike half a percentage point today. Well, it's anyone's guess though Lagarde --, aka not moving at all. Also risks sending a message those policymakers perhaps fear worse is to come. So that's the balance. Christine Lagarde's choice of language with them become incredibly key and other measures too perhaps remember they have all sorts of tools that they can use to address financial instability. So it's a high stakes decision that could give at least a hint to how the U.S. Federal Reserve will act next week too. I'm sure there have been plenty of transatlantic phone calls already. Now as we wait U.S. futures I'd call them choppy the DOW and the S&amp;P losing a little bit of ground here you can see the S&amp;P futures right now down some four tenths of 1 percent key regional banks in the United States once again, under fresh pressure. Bucking that trend, though Europe solidly higher driven by improvements in some of the major banks following news that the Swiss National Bank is lending Credit Suisse some $54 billion in emergency funds. Now shares of Credit Suisse are currently higher by more than 20 percent. That's a fresh look at that bouncing from Wednesday's all-time lows. The company's debt securities are also on the rise too. The cost of buying insurance against a Credit Suisse default hit record levels in the previous session too, a sense of the alarm that was out there. Now after a session of wild moves to across global government bonds, yields on Wednesday, and things are calmer certainly in Europe in the United States. 10 year yields still easing too, you can see that level there 3.4 percent or 3.4 and a quarter. Now we've seen a dramatic drop in bond yields this week that overshadowed actually the volatility that we've seen in stock markets too. Bond market investors, and now predicting that the Federal Reserve cuts rates towards the end of this year with the Fed forced to unwind some of its recent hikes destabilize the banking sector. We're going to discuss whether or not they can do that in the face of inflation wants to get to this hour. But let's bring you up to speed with the latest on Credit Suisse. And Clare Sebastian joins us now. The silence from the Swiss National Bank yesterday was deafening. And we saw the ripple effect across the European banking sector. The message saying look, you can take a lot of money on loan from us seems to have stabilized things. And it also says that the Swiss National Bank believes that Credit Suisse is still solvent. It's still viable and its important message.",

One analyst I spoke to this morning said it would have been much better if the first out of the gate was either the Bank of England or the Fed because they're much further along in their tightening cycles. So it would have been less sort of jarring if they were to suddenly pause, the ECB still playing catch up, and of course, facing 8.5 percent inflation in the euro area. I think, you know, there was a well telegraphed half point rate rise for this meeting. I think many believes that will now be moderated to a quarter point, of course, doing nothing might also raise concerns about what does the ECB know about the financial system that we perhaps don't. So quarter point would be seeming to be acknowledging the situation in the banking sector, while also you know, tackling continuing to tackle inflation? And of course, we will also hear from Christine Lagarde who will be needed to put across some soothing words about how the ECB will provide a backstop to the banking system. If things go wrong, the Chief Economist of capital economics this morning, saying that it would be best if there was no mention, he said, of conditionality or moral hazard, please.

Clare Sebastian, we should wait and see that decision momentarily. Thank you very much for that.

Matt Egan joins us now. Matt, sort of tell that to some of the regional banks that are seeing market pressure, certainly pre market today. Do we believe her? Do individuals believe her?

Western alliance, also down pack west, all of these stocks coming under a lot of pressure and that's despite the fact that the Treasury Secretary is out there this morning again, trying to reassure people that the American banking system is sound. The key line from Janet Yellen has prepared remarks she says, \"Americans can feel confident that their deposits will be here when they need them\". And she pointed out that the deposits even at Silicon Valley Bank, the California lender that collapsed on Friday, even those deposits were available on Monday morning when business opened. But we know that the FDIC, only insured up to $250,000 per borrower per bank but the fact that the federal government came in and rescued above that limit, right? They rescued the uninsured depositors, not just at Silicon Valley Bank, but also at Signature Bank, the New York Company that went under this weekend. You know it does imply, Julia, that they're willing to help depositors above an insurance limit, if that's what it takes to restore confidence in this banking system.",

      "sentences": "Exactly right, Julia. So what we are hearing from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MarkMilley is that it is still unclear to the United States whether that direct impact on the jet was actually on the drone, I should say was deliberate. They do know, however, that the reckless behavior that they saw the pilot take in that instance, getting really close to the drone dumping fuel on it, that was deliberate. And that was extremely dangerous, the U.S. has said and it could have caused injury or damage to the Russians and then the Pilots of the Russian jet as well. And so the U.S. now releasing this new video, to kind of directly contradict what the Russians have been saying, because the Russians have been saying in recent days, that their jet did not act recklessly that it did not make direct contact with the drone. Well, now we are seeing in this video that in fact, it did. And of course when we look at the video, we can see that moment of impact kind of where the video cuts out and you see it all pixelated that is the moment of collision when the video reemerge is you can see that the propeller on the back of the drone has actually been damaged. And that is the key proof that U.S. Officials are pointing to noting that the fighter jet made direct contact with that drone. Now this is all very significant, because it is the first time that a Russian jet and an American drone have made direct physical contact with each other over the course of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And it is important because the Russians and the Americans are operating in this space very closely in this region on a regular basis. And so while the Russian jets have tried to intercept American systems like these drones in the past kind of flying alongside them, never before have we actually seen this level of aggression by a Russian pilot. And I should note that we are told that the Russian Defense Ministry Officials in the Russian Defense Ministry actually did explicitly task. These pilots with harassing this drone, making it clear that this was not just the behavior of a rogue pilot here. This was a deliberate tasking by the Russian Ministry of Defense, Julia.",

And let's be fair, this was actually very much signposted in February at the last meeting. It's probably the most baked in forward guidance we've ever got, is that the Governing Council was planning to raise rates by half a percentage point. But given the turmoil we saw in the markets over the last couple of days, particularly Credit Suisse, there was a feeling that they wouldn't go whole hog. And perhaps they would consider the mood music and consider the pressure and the vulnerabilities that high interest rates are having on bank balance sheets, and at least the concern of investors maybe pull that back. I was reading bets for 40 basis points or even having it to just 25. So I asked, I'm quite surprised that they've continued with half a percentage point, but it does go to show inflation is what they care about right now and why it's fallen since October high, but it's still pretty sticky, isn't it?",

It does send a stop message, but I also do think we have to sort of pause here as well, and reiterate the fact that look at what we've seen in the United States where they provided that facility for banks that are holding government bonds that have lost value as a result of the rate decisions to get access to liquidity from the Federal Reserve. The ECB has all sorts of policy tools like this, and it's going to be fascinating to hear what Christine Lagarde says in what around 30-minutes time because the choice that she was going to have to make if she decided to go or this the European Central Bank members decided to do. Less here was that they were going to have to be verbally incredibly stringent about their plans to tackle inflation going forward, because it remains such a huge challenge.

However, that doesn't mean that there isn't stress on the system created by a massive amount of rate hikes in a short period of time.

I mean, if you think about it, the Fed hiked rates back before the global financial crisis between 2004 and 2006, about 400 basis points over the course of 24 months. What we've seen in the most recent year is the Fed hiking rates about 475 basis points of course of 10 or so months. That's a lot for an economy to take thus far, it's been quite resilient. But I think as we move forward, the Fed is pressing, it's luck. And I would era on the side of caution. I'm hoping we're close to a pause. It can be a conditional pause and the Fed certainly wants to be data dependent.

We had the U.S. government step in quickly over the weekend, to address the issues in that mini crisis. And now we've had the Swiss National Bank step in. So I think that the environment is one in which there's a level of confidence that has been created, that policymakers are far more proactive. They're much more sensitive to the likelihood of a financial accident, and are going to step in quickly. And I think that's all we need is to have that assumption that will continue to see that as problems arise, because this is unlikely to be the last problem created where we're probably going to see other shoes drop other financial accidents.

One is, you know, should our industry have been more aware of the overall financial conditions of the bank that we all use? So we could have seen this coming sooner, perhaps by the time that people in D.C. started talking about it, the panic had already begun. And two the banks that are now picking up all these accounts and by the way, this is a great opportunity for Chase for Citibank, for Bank of America, Wells Fargo, will they step up and provide the kinds of services that VCs need the tech startups need that they hadn't done before?

So even the pace of funding new startups in the last week, or so has plummeted simply because everyone's been dealing with a crisis and, so if we want to keep the innovation economy going, we need to have stability in the venture capital sector.",

      "sentences": "Thank you so much. Good morning, and thanksfor having us. Yes, exactly as you've said, human trafficking is a human rights crisis that happens all around the world, in every country in the world, but it's also an every state and city in the United States, across Europe, across every country. And it can look like many different things. You can have women and girls who are trafficked for commercial sex, you have men and boys trafficked for labor. And this happens all, in many places, it can look like a man trapped on a fishing boat in Thailand not allowed leaving for two years, not paid for that time, it can look like children in cobalt mines. Working endlessly with no pay, it can look like entire families trapped into generational debt bondage in brick homes in India, and Nepal. And even right here, just down the street from our offices in Washington D.C. it can look like a homeless youth who may be approached looking for a warm place to stay and someone waiting there to manipulate them into commercial sex or acts that they're not willing to do for the benefit of those traffickers.",

I think one of the other crucial things you say is one of the best ways oftackling this is to empower survivors of human trafficking and help them to help others because they've got experiences understanding knowledge that that many of us simply don't. And you're launching a scholarship, or fellowship, for a survivor to help bring them into the system and help them to help others. Just talk us through what that involves the kinds of people that you're looking for, and what it will help achieve?",

      "sentences": "Yes, thank you so much for bringing that up. We have learned so much about how to combat this problem around the world. And even thoughtrafficking is growing, we've learned more than ever about what is needed to stop this horrific crime. And the most important thing is to follow the leadership and the expertise of those with lived experience of human trafficking. Traditionally, in this field, survivors of trafficking have not always been the leaders of the movement. And we're really seeking to change that because we cannot help this crime if we don't understand what's happening. And people with lived experience of trafficking bring us that expertise to help us win this fight. So we know that survivors are looking for ways to become leaders in this movement. And the Pembroke fellowship, where applications are opening today is an opportunity that we developed with our colleagues at Survivor Alliance, and here at United Way Worldwide. It will offer an opportunity to survivors of trafficking in the United States, to be placed in anti-trafficking organizations and to become the leaders of the next generation of this work. So we're opening the applications today, we're looking for survivors, to join us in this fight. And that's been core to our work here at United Way as we work with impacted communities all around the world. One of the key tenants of our work has been to elevate and center the knowledge and expertise of survivors. That's how we're going to win this fight is when we bring everyone together, but particularly to empower and lift up survivors of trafficking. That's exactly what we need in order to see this horrific human rights abuse ended. So people can learn more if they visit our website at unitedway.org. I just want to mention the Pembroke fellowship is named after a dear colleague of righteous fighter in the fight against human trafficking. Her name is Deborah Pembroke, is a dear colleague and friend of ours who passed away last year. So the fellowship is named in her honor. And we've had an amazing time working with our colleagues at Survivor Alliance, who has been leading the fight, really pioneering this around the world, to help make sure that survivors of trafficking are the leaders and the voices we need for this field.",

Let me just give you a quick look at the market reaction U.S. stocks opening lower as anticipated, though Europe look at that back up there and managing to hold on to gains. Anna Stewart is back with more on this decision. We're yet to get to the Q&amp;A and oh, that's going to be lively. Something tells me what more did the statement say? Because it goes back to what you and I were saying earlier. There are other options here than using interest rates to handle financial stability and inflation remains the key it seems.",
