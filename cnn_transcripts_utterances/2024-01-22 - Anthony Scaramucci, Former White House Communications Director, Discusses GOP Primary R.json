So it seems to be working for him.Now obviously, they canceled the court today. But in general, that has been a good strategy for him. Then he hops a plane to New Hampshire and does a little bit of light campaigning. And obviously, he's well ahead, Boris, so he's probably right about this.",

So, the grievance party is such that Mr. Trump represents a very large group of angry people that are angry at the establishment.He once said that he could shoot people on Fifth Avenue. He could be convicted of guilt of rape, as an example, and those people are going to stay with him no matter what because he is the avatar of their anger. Somebody like Governor Haley, where she could have created a new market for herself -- there are 144 million people in the country that don't vote. She could have reached out to those people and tried to bring them into the Republican party but she didn't do that. The governor didn't do that. And so it's really his supporters versus the old guard of Republicans. And I think that's the big problem for the Republican Party right now.",

I think somebody has to answer for that. But assuming Mr. Trump doesn't have to answer to either of those two things, I think it's very likely he becomes the nominee. And then it's a re-do of 2020. And my prediction in that case is that the president, President Biden, will beat Donald Trump like he did in 2020. I don't see Trump growing his market either but I don't see people that did not vote for Trump last time voting for him this time. That will give a handy lead to President Biden.",

Then, back in 2020, before the pandemic or on the eve of the pandemic, they said that Trump was going to win. Neither one of those two things happened. But I think it is -- I think it is decided that his resurgence and the media story that is him, it is easy for an elitist to say, oh, it is going to be him. This way, if they are wrong, it is not a big deal. But if they are right, they can say I told you so. Those people are invariably wrong.

Their team seized Iranian-made weapons that were bound for Yemen. But during the mission, one of the SEALs fell into the water due to the eight-foot seas. And the other one jumped in to save him. After an exhaustive 10-day search, military officials announced that both are dead. In a statement, Biden said, \"These SEALs represented the very best of our country, pledging their lives to protect their fellow Americans. Our hearts go out to the family members, loved ones, friends and shipmates who are grieving for these two brave Americans.\" The Federal Aviation Administration is urging airlines to inspect door panels on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes.",

This time, the 737 900ER.And the reason is because, those door plugs, the same ones that we have been talking about for weeks. Because the 900ER, most of them use the same door plug design as the Max-9. Which is the plug that blew off the side of that flight taking off from Portland earlier this month, causing a dramatic emergency landing, that frightening scene in the sky, a flight flying through the air with a hole in the side of it. Since then, the Max-9 has been grounded. Inspectors have been looking at those airplanes. They have found some loose bolts inside the door plugs. But they have also been looking at other Boeing models. And of the FAA is saying, they look at the 900ER and there is some issue with the bolts that are inside the door plugs. We don't know what that issue is and we are waiting for more details. But it is enough that they are telling airlines they need to go back and make sure those plugs are secured on the planes. And this is raising more questions about the safety of Boeing aircraft. When it comes to the 900ER, there are more than 400 of them in operation in the U.S., for Alaska, United and Delta. The airline say they will not see major disruption when it comes to their service. This is not a formal grounding. It is a recommendation. But they are doing inspections. Now we are waiting on the Max-9. We don't know when it might be able to fly again. But just this week, we are expecting the NTSB is finally going to open the door, the door plug, I should say, that blew off inside of that flight, that was later found on the ground. They are going to be looking see, were there ever bolts inside of it? Were they securely fastened? Once they can get those answers, they can figure out where in the timeline a mistake might have been made. Was it with the supplier who built it? Was it with Boeing who assembled the airplane? Or even possibly with the airline operating it.",

I think they stopped making this model in 2019. And if it is a quality control issue that has recently slipped or if Boeing have changed something in final assembly or what has been done. So they need to pinpoint where this is coming about. Obviously, people who keep talking about how fortunate everyone was. This was a disaster without fatalities, the door coming off the plane. By doing all of these inspections, hopefully, another disaster can be avoided. Because if another thing like that happens, Boeing has got some tough flying ahead.
