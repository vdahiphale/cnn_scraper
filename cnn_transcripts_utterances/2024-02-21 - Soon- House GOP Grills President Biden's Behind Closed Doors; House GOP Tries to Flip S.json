And now for the first time, we are hearing from Republicans who are processing this -- you might say spinning this news.

He said this is coming from a highly credible, confidential human source.And now we know that that is not true, but it really underscores the challenges that Republicans face here and trying to build the case to impeach Joe Biden. A number of members, especially in the rank and file, especially from swing districts, simply believed that the case has not been made and that was before this indictment of this FBI informant shows you the hurdles they face as they hit -- face a critical moment in this more than yearlong investigation into the president with James Biden, the president's brother, here behind closed doors.

I have -- the first question to you really is, looking at this, Republicans have been using what is now debunked information as a critical part of this impeachment hearing against Biden. What do you make of the fact that they have now turned this on behalf of the FBI and said, hey, why didn't they know that this informant was a liar?

So, were this a legal matter, which it's not, this is -- impeachment is a political matter, if this were a case making its way to an intended prosecution, there's almost no way it would go forward at this point. It's almost impossible to salvage a successful prosecution after your primary informant is exposed as a fabricator.But, of course, this isn't -- that's not where we are. This is politics. So I suppose the Republicans feel like they have to take some position. I think there are legitimate questions to ask about reliance, about what the FBI thought about this source early on. We know that he has been official informant for them for as long as I think ten years now. He's received numerous admonitions along the way. He likely has had some record of success and corroborated reporting, but this one went completely off the rails. It seemed to me that the FBI was not, if you look back at the history of this, they were not really convinced about this reporting early on. They received it in 2020. They didn't act upon it in 2020. We also know that after receiving this reporting, the special prosecutor Weiss, was compelled to agree to a very favorable plea agreement for Hunter Joe Biden that did not include any allegations of corruption. So I think the bigger question to ask right now is why only after pronounced political pressure from people like James Comer and Chuck Grassley, did the special prosecutor do a complete 180 and begin to kind of treat this reporting is something that that needed to be dealt with investigatively.",

They made a filing to the court yesterday, basically saying that they had an agreement -- a plea agreement which they -- was favorable to them and that the prosecutor walked away from that agreement only when on the basis of this reporting, which we now know to be false, and they are saying so therefore, judge, you should require the prosecutors to live up to the agreement they formerly he entered into, and impose this plea agreement back on the parties.

Although we know that these cases are not linked, some are federal some are state, some are criminal, some are civil, but all of that with the goal of trying to argue that Democrats and President Joe Biden are trying to prevent him from becoming president. But look, I think, you know, we have heard from some of his critics, including Joe Biden, who attacked him for this last night.
