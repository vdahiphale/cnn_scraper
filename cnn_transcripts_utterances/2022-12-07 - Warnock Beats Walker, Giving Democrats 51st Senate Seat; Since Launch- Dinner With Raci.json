You had these college students showing up, registered voters in Georgia, some who didn't vote in the general election but were home for the Thanksgiving weekend, showing up in droves to vote for Senator Warnock. But also, it reignited this debate over voter access, over voter suppression, that is a deeply animating issue for Democratic voters. We've been talking about inflation.

But I was struck by this quote that was published in \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\" This is from an adviser to someone that tried to primary, that ran against Walker in the primary. He said that Herschel was, quote, \"like a plane crash into a trainwreck that rolled into a dumpster fire and an orphanage, then an animal shelter.

MONDAIRE JONES, (D-NY):  The black community sport of the senator was critical. By the way, there was voter suppression. We saw a recent example of that in an attempt by Republican officials in Georgia to cancel early voting on Saturday. And of course, every court to consider the matter rejected it. That early vote was important. It's why the senator emphasized it. And of course, black folks in particular were inspired by the Senator's candidacy. But it was a multiracial, multireligious coalition as the Senator mentioned in his victory speech last night. And I'll just tell you, as an African American, I share the view of many African American people I met with when I was stumping for the Senator down in Georgia myself, which is that folks were personally offended by Herschel Walker's candidacy. It is so clear that he is not qualified to serve in the United States Senate and that national Republicans chose him because they thought that his race would make him competitive with black voters.

And voters we saw in this runoff and throughout this entire election season decided that they were going to look at candidates, they were going to look at their characters, they're going to look at their qualifications, and they were going to vote on the candidates.

And those three weeks had been turbulent and that is an understatement. Trump announces his bid for the White House on November 15th and since then, let's look at what has happened.He sat down to dinner with disgraced rapper Kanye West and a holocaust denier and antisemite Nick Fuentes. House Democrats obtained six years of his federal tax returns. A day later, an appeals court, the 11th Circuit, denied him a special master review of those documents seized at his Mar-a-Lago home. And that same day, a federal judge ordered top White House lawyers to testify in a criminal grand jury investigation into the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And that brings us to this weekend when Trump took an oath to defend the Constitution. Remember when he did that becoming president? Well, this weekend, he called to terminate the Constitution. And then this week, a jury convicted his organization, the Trump Org on 17 counts, all counts of criminal tax fraud.",

Herschel Walker is one of the people who he treated as almost a mini-Donald Trump, somebody who had a history of personal misconduct allegations, specifically abuse. Trump predicted to me when I interviewed him last year that none of this was going to matter for Herschel Walker, that obviously it wasn't true.Other candidates who espoused Trump's lies about the 2020 election lost. Basically, voters in the midterms returned a verdict that they don't want a lot of Trumpian behavior in their candidates. And to your point, this kept a number of losses in other areas of his life. He is still the front-runner for the nomination. (AUDIO GAP) that voters are actively turning away from him in his base, but it's not an auspicious beginning to his third campaign, that's for sure.",

He still believes he's going to be the nominee, but there are many Republicans who are saying -- Scott Jennings said, I don't know, you know.

And that's just not what most Republicans are focused on.I will say, I think two things can be true at once, Don. I think Dave Urban is correct that Trump still remains the front-runner for the nomination, again, until voters show that they are actively seeking an alternative. And it's not just donors, and it's not just the chattering class, Trump is going to remain in a strong position. But he is more vulnerable than he has been in a very long time.
