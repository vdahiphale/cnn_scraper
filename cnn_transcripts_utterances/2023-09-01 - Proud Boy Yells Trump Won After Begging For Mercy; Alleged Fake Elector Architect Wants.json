But, first, he's the Proud Boy who triggered the breach on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, and the judge calls him the tip of the spear of that insurrection. Now, today, Dominic Pezzola received a decade behind bars. But inside that courtroom before learning his fate, he beg the judge for mercy, vowing that he was done with politics, and yet, moments later, after the sentence, he yelled, Trump won, on his way out of the courtroom. It's quite the moment, considering that if Trump is elected, he has already suggested that he will pardon some of these guys. It's also worth noting, Pezzola's wife called him a, quote, f'ing idiot, who got drunk, watched Fox News all day before the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And yet for Pezzola to then, once the judge didn't give him that, turn around and say, Trump won, it almost seems like, is this a game, a ploy to try to get a reprieve from these jail sentences? MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL: When we were conducting depositions and interviews of these Proud Boys, one of the things that we noticed was, I mean, they had unwavering support for the president. I mean, that's why they came to D.C. on January 6th. I think it's important to talk about the special counsel's indictment, where he talked about how President Trump exploited the violence, right? But the Proud Boys, they were the foot soldiers of that violence. They were the tip of the spear, as the judge said today, and as we described them on the committee. And so, look, it's hard to distinguish whether they actually feel remorse, but from our interactions with people who attended the Capitol on January 6th, including the Proud Boys, they have unwavering support.",

If I'm a prosecutor presenting evidence against Mr. Chesebro, right, it's going to be prejudicial no matter what it is, because it's evidence against him. It's unfairness here. And I don't know if his argument reaches the burden that he needs to reach because he put forth the fake elector scheme. And the fake elector scheme was only valid because -- or only valid in his mind because of the election fraud that Ms. Powell was going around the state of Georgia talking about. So, under this criminal enterprise, under this conspiracy, I'm not sure how he can make the argument that he'll be unfairly prejudiced by the evidence put forth against Ms. Powell in his case, and so I think he has an uphill battle before the court.",

Governor DeSantis and his wife greeted him when he arrived, when President Biden arrived, held a press conference alongside him, said that they don't agree all the time but that they would put that aside and work together.

I don't understand. I think in a lot of ways, because his persona challenged all these ideas about gender nonconformity and race and masculinity, that in a way, because he was so flamboyant, he was able to sort of get away with this stuff. He seemed as harmless in a way. I mean, you have to remember, too, Rock and Roll was looked at as a novelty, and he was sort of part of that novelty. The only problem was that he was also an artist and an incredibly influential one, too. And because of that flamboyance, I think, people then tended to not take him as seriously, both after his first initial wave of popularity and then later in his career.

And it's kind of ridiculous because when you hear that version, it couldn't be less Rock and Roll.And yet he persevered because, you know, he had these great songs and he was massively influential. And then, you're talking about Elvis covering Tutti Frutti and, you know, he took the Beatles to Hamburg, took them out on tour with them and they started covering his songs. But I think his real influence, I mean, how this affected him was that it made him very angry later in life. He never felt that he got his due. But he also realized that his influence on all these artists, you know, from Elvis and the Beatle on to, you know, Prince and Madonna and Michael Jackson and on and on, it kept going and going and going.
