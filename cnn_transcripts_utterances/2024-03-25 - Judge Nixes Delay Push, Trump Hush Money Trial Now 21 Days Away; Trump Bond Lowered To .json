A judge rejects his bid to delay his hush money trial and an appeals court gives him more time to post his civil fraud bond and cuts the bill by more than half.Also tonight, with suspects in custody and the death toll at 139, the latest in Friday's massacre outside Moscow, which Vladimir Putin blames on radical Islamists and without any evidence also points a finger at Ukraine. And we're learning about why federal agents may have raided mansions belonging to Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. When the day began, Donald Trump had hopes of delaying or completely derailing New York's hush money election interference case against him. He was also facing possible asset seizure and personal bankruptcy for failing to secure a half billion dollar bond in his civil fraud judgment. Well, tonight he is breathing easier on that front, but on the criminal side, not so much. Not after the kind of grilling that the judge, Juan Merchan, gave the former president's lawyers before setting a trial date for April 15th, just three weeks from now, which prompted this from the defendant.

He said, \"You just heard one set of facts and interpreted that as the People not doing anything. I heard that set of facts. I looked at the exhibits and to me it was the People went so far above and beyond what they were required to do that it is really, it is odd, that we are even here and that we have taken this time.\"   So frustrated that he even delayed the trial in the first place.

But this judge is treating it differently. And he referenced Todd Blanche's past work, which is obviously not something that you really want going into a trial as he's questioned your own history, not in the sense of what he's done. It's just he should know better. It was essentially what the judge was arguing. So in that sense, it did not go well for them. But also, they did not get any more of a delay here.
