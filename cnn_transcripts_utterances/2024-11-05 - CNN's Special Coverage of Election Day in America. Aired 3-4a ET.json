Kamala has delivered soaring prices and true economic anguish at home, war and chaos abroad, and a nation destroying invasion on our southern border, invasion of some of the greatest criminals in the world that are pouring into our country.

Bush; Lulu Garcia-Navarro, CNN contributor and \"New York Times\" journalist and podcast host; and our very own Mark Preston. Nice to see all of you dark and early, as we like to say, in this business. As we look at where we stand here, these expected, I would say, yet very different, starkly different closing messages from Trump and Harris. You know, Scott, I'm going to start with you. I know you were talking to some of your sources earlier who said their real goal was they hoped that the former president would stay on message tonight. He did open with that question of, are you better off than you were four years ago? And then there was a lot of weaving. Overall, is this a winning closing message? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SR. POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: I don't know, I mean, look, this is Trump. He speaks for two hours. Some of it's going to be what the campaign wants him to do, some of it's going to be what he wants to do. It's really no different than we've seen him all throughout this campaign, through his last campaign, through the campaign before that. It's his style. He's not a politician. You know, I don't know that anything about it is rehearsed. That to me is the real contrast between Trump and Harris. You get up there with this weaving method and you can get anything. With Harris, every single gesticulation, hand movement, you know, head nod. I mean, it is all rehearsed and carefully scripted, and with Trump, none of it really is. And to some people, Trump is more appealing because it feels authentic, and to some people Harris is more appealing because they just want somebody who's basically a politician who does what you would expect them to do. So we'll see what the algebra is on Tuesday night. I don't really know how to answer your question other than to say, I guess that was probably Donald Trump's last rally, so we won't have his rallies to kick around anymore after this 3 am panel here.",

That's what voters want. Americans want a leader who will, in her words, lift people up as opposed to trying to knock them down.And she didn't mention Donald Trump's name because she didn't have to. Donald Trump is making this very stark contrast for her as she is up there being positive, talking about unity, talking about a new generation of leadership. And then you have Donald Trump who sits up there for two hours. He looks a lot older. He looks tired. The only thing coming out of his mouth are insults. His messages are dark, dystopian, full of division. And frankly, the vice president's message of, we need to find a new way forward, turning the page on all of that darkness and that division, that negativity, I think exactly what Americans want to hear. And so, I think for what she needs to do in Pennsylvania and in all of the battleground states, this is exactly the right message. And I also think it shows the confident, cautious optimism of the campaign because, Erica, as you know if a campaign is confident in where they are in the race, they don't need to go negative. They can focus on the positivity, they can focus on their candidate, what their candidate will bring to American voters. And we know that when a campaign is more desperate, more worried about how they might not even have locked up their base, they have to go negative. They have to do the red meat, which is what we're seeing Trump do.",

But there was new polling out from NPR-Emeris, which showed Harris at 51 percent, Trump at 47 percent. There have been, and it's not the only one this week, right, to show a little bit of a shift. How much are you reading into this polling at the 11th hour?MARK PRESTON, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: You know, at this point, I think it's a little dangerous when you see these polls come in at the last minute and you see this sudden shift. And you see them move en masse. You have to wonder, are we seeing something here, or are we just seeing a course correction amongst those who do the methodology amongst all the polls? I think the bottom line is, Erica, we don't know what is going to happen. I think we all learned a big lesson back in 2016, for those of us old enough here on the panel. Remember, we certainly didn't learn our lesson after 2000, because we had our problems in 2016. But I do think you're going to see a very careful -- careful. The attention that the news media, that the impartial observers are going to pay to this election and to ensure that there isn't any kind of an early call on this election, I think is going to be critical. And I do think the next 24 hours are really going to be critical for the country. We don't know what's going to happen in this election. There's a good chance we're not going to know who the president-elect is going to be within the next three days, could be four days, could be five days, having said that we may know we may all have it wrong and somebody one of these candidates could perhaps like walk away with it kind of handily. So I think we all just need to just take a deep breath, take a step back and just let the voters have their day and just see how this plays out.",

We know that more women than men are registered voters.Typically, women turn out in larger numbers for elections as well. I was struck by some of this polling out of Iowa when we looked at not only women breaking for Harris, but the fact, Maria, that it was older women. Women over 65 plus 35 for Harris. CARDONA: You know, Erica, this is one of the things that I have been saying from the very beginning of this campaign, even when Biden was our candidate, that what clearly we didn't learn our lesson in 2022, even though in 2022 I also knew that this was not going to be a red way for Republicans, because what pollsters have not learned to take into consideration, they haven't learned how to ask this question, is a question about reproductive rights. And ever since the Dobbs decision, ever since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, Democrats have massively over performed in every single election that has happened since then. And the reason they have over performed is because of this energy and this mobilization amongst women and a lot of older women at that. The reason for that, Erica, and I hear this with people who are going door-to-door and women that I have been talking to across the battleground states, and they say it's this. They say, Maria, yes, the economy is important to me, but the economy is coming back, costs are coming down, but when I go into that ballot box and I think about the possibility that my daughter or granddaughter are going to be growing up in a country where they have less rights than I did. That is not something that is at all acceptable to me. And that is what we are seeing. I think that's what we saw in the Iowa poll. I'm not saying that Harris is going to win Iowa, but that trend, Erica, is what we are seeing across the country. You have Republican women, moderate women, who, you know, according to anecdotes, and I've talked to them too, are not telling their husbands that they're voting for Trump, that they're voting for Harris, and they're voting for Harris. Young women. We are seeing droves of young women coming out to the polls to vote for Harris because of the issue of reproductive rights. So you know Lulu is right, Mark's right, we don't really know what's going to happen but those trends have been alive and well since 2022 and I don't think that 2024 is going to be any different.",

Privately, what is the sense of what the difference would be between a Trump and a Harris presidency?THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Thanks so much for having me, Erica. It's great to be with you. Both Trump and Harris represent diametrically opposed visions for not only the future of the United States, but also the future of the world. With Kamala Harris, it very much is going to be continuity, status quo, pursuing many of the same policies of the Biden administration. For Donald Trump, it's a return to turbulence, chaos, mayhem on the international stage. I mean, Trump really has pursued this America first forum policy, which many have described as kind of a belligerent isolationism, very skeptical of international institutions, very skeptical of dealings with world leaders. And so I think throughout the West, many are hoping privately, as you said, that Kamala Harris will be elected, but publicly they're really staying mum.",

And Ron, since it's your first showing in the panel, I'm going to kick this off with you. As we look at the rhetoric, as we look at the tone, the tenor of what we've seen throughout the course of the campaign, but really in the last week, it does, Ron, set up this very clear and stark difference, both of them in many ways, trying to play to their base, as we noted, because the goal right now is to get everybody out to the polls.But there is this push from the Harris camp to perhaps bring more people in when it comes to Donald Trump's rhetoric and we know this right from the campaign they want him to stay more on message as Scott noted he's not necessarily known for that it happens you never know what you're going to get how damaging though could that be? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST AND SR. EDITOR, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Oh I think it's been very damaging. You know a canary in the coal mine all year for Democrats has been the retrospective job approval for Donald Trump has been rising. It's at many points in many polls. It's higher than it ever was when he was president. And the reason for that is that voters were primarily judging him through the lens of what they don't like about Joe Biden, primarily inflation and immigration. And all the things that Donald Trump did that he was president, when people were actually living through that economy, they now say it was better, that kept him from getting to 50 percent approval. The only president who never reached 50 percent approval. All of those things were fading in people's minds. What they were remembering was that gas and groceries were cheaper. Well, what Donald Trump has done over the last eight or nine days is in a distilled and unrelenting pile driver way, remind people of everything else that comes with electing him as president: Island of garbage. I will protect women whether they like it or not. RFK Jr. is going to have control of public health and women's health and yes, we might take fluoride out of the water and ban vaccines. Liz Cheney should face rifles. You know, Michelle Obama needs to be targeted. People should be shooting through the press. He has reminded voters, I think, in a very profound and ongoing way of everything that there's more that comes with electing him than the idea that gas and groceries, as I said, might be cheaper now you know there's a lot of discontent with the direction of the country that keeps him in the game no matter what. But that the way this campaign is ending I I've always felt that for the final days of the campaign the question is what is the question and you know Republicans at hope the question would be whether you are better off than you were four years ago as you noted but in many ways the question is are you willing to take the risk of putting him back in power again?

This is clearly not the way that the Trump campaign wanted to end this final push to the end. It's what sticks in people's mind. There are undecided voters, how do you persuade them? And he really hasn't done an effective job of selling himself. I mean, he's almost 80 years old, he looks tired. You know, we use the word weave, it's often rambling, frankly. And so there is this sense that is this the man that you want to leave the country, but at the same time, you know, the reason that it's so close is that people really do care about the economy, inflation, immigration. These have been the top polling issues in this country for quite some time. And we haven't only seen that here in the United States. In other countries, we've seen voters punish incumbents because of the economy. And so his strength, I think, cannot be underestimated. And he very well may win this election. It is a toss-up.

There's a whole slew of former Republicans who worked for Donald Trump, and I think this has been so powerful because, Erica, we're not talking about Joe Schmoes. We're talking about four-star decorated generals, one of them who used to be his chief of staff, his closest advisor who knew him best and was with him during the decision-making processes and so many important situations he has come out to say this man is dangerous. Americans, please do not re-elect him. Do not give him four more years in the Oval Office. He's the one who called him a fascist. Let's remember, it was not Kamala Harris. It was his former Chief of Staff, John Kelly. He's got other former advisors, General Milley, who are saying the same exact thing. So there is, it's not the majority by any means, but in an election that is so close and you have important voices, respected voices that are telling Americans just how dangerous another four years in the Oval Office Donald Trump will be, Republicans are responding to that.
