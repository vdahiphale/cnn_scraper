And this hearing comes as more than half of Senator Menendez's Democratic colleagues in the Senate are calling for him to resign. Now, he remains defiant and points to the fact that he has previously faced federal corruption charges if he was not convicted. He also points to the fact that the Justice Department has a pretty weak record of successfully prosecuting government officials in corruption cases. And, Kate, all of that is accurate. But what makes this case different, different than Menendez's previous case and different than those other corruption prosecutions, is the fact that, in this indictment, there's an allegation that he passed sensitive information to a foreign government. The allegation is that he passed along the information about the U.S. Embassy to the government of Egypt against U.S. interests. That is an incredibly serious accusation against a sitting U.S. senator and likely why you're seeing so many of his colleagues calling on him to resign, even though he has not yet gone through the judicial process. He's really putting his party here in a tough spot. They have, of course, criticized former President Trump for facing criminal charges for allegedly mishandling some of the country's most sensitive secrets and previous investigations into his foreign business dealings. So to now have one of their own facing this legal jeopardy, it's also really creating a political problem for his colleagues.",

Of course, we should note presumed innocent until proven guilty, but gold bars with serial numbers on them, it's really kind of mind-boggling evidence. But I think people know from experience in these cases that, if you can just survive and let the initial pressure kind of abate, and his job is something of a chit here, John. I -- he -- if he gives it up right away, he has much less leverage in negotiations, both on the political side and the legal side. So, for now, at least, I think he wants to retain it.

Let me get into it, basically, yesterday a New York judge saying that Trump and his two sons overinflated their assets in order to get loan. Some of those assets, of course, we know about the golf courses. We know about his hotels. We know about his homes. Let me give you a tangible example of what was in this court ruling. If you think about his triplex in Trump Tower here in New York City, according to this ruling, Trump has said that it's three times bigger in square footage than it actually is, overevaluating the estimation of it by $114 million to $207 million, according to this judge, who didn't mince words, and said to that a discrepancy of this order of magnitude -- magnified by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades can only be considered fraud. Now, what happens next? Well, part of this ruling, the judge basically canceled the business certificates of part of Trump Organization, in -- that is, defendants in this case. And, basically, that means there's commercial real estate here on Wall Street, also a family compound in Western New York, which will be dissolved. According to this judge, there will be a receiver put in place who will work out the dissolving of those properties. So this is a big blow to Trump who of course, has always talked about his wealth and the fact that he is a very rich man. And that's something he would say on the campaign trail as he was getting into politics. But, certainly, this is something he's not happy about. Let me read you what he said in reaction to this judge's ruling on TRUTH Social. It says: \"It is a great company that has been slandered and maligned by this politically motivated witch-hunt, is very unfair. And I will call for help from the highest courts in New York state or the federal system to intercede. This is not America.\" Now, this all coming just a week before the civil trial, which hits on other claims that were filed by the New York attorney general, gets started. But there, as you can imagine, John, are appeals in play right now from Trump, from his attorneys. So, one of them, we're expecting a ruling sometime this week, so to be determined if that civil case gets started, as it is expected to, on Monday -- John.",

As Brynn says, it is a sledgehammer to Trump and the entire organization in New York, including commercial properties on 40 Wall Street. And as of -- when that holds up, if it's affirmed, Trump Organization no longer exists and may not do business in New York. Now, there may be some kind of -- it's very complicated to dissolve a company. Maybe there's different kinds of corporate little twists and turns that leave him with something. But, basically, for him and his two sons, he -- they are as of -- out of business in the thing that matters most to them. It's a death penalty for the brand, which next only to his liberty is about the worst thing that can happen. So, appeals will run. But the finding is very strong, $2.2 billion of inflation over this period. The attorney general wants $250 million, but many other people (AUDIO GAP) a point, a receiver could wind up getting it. The money is just gone and distributed to others with no oversight by Trump as to where it goes. They have to appoint an independent person. It is the death penalty for the brand.",

As Brynn says, 30,000 feet versus -- 30,000 square meters versus 10,000, that's just a lie. Same thing with the valuations by factors of 200, not two. I think this case is very strong. And the only issue might be, should the penalty be different? But that's standard New York law, as I understand it.

I want to talk to you about what we're seeing play out here. The speaker of the House just this past hour or so was literally blaming everyone but himself and House Republicans for the looming shutdown. He was blaming the Senate. He was blaming the president. But it is Republicans who cannot agree on a bill or even a rule to bring a bill. Is McCarthy's argument one that anyone is going to buy? I will start with you, Laura? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, look, you laid it out pretty well there, Sara, which is that, back in May, Speaker McCarthy made a deal with the White House, with President Biden. So, when you ask the White House if the president is going to meet with McCarthy anytime soon, which McCarthy recently asked for with just a few days to go before the shutdown, the White House says, look, they had their meeting back in May, and they agreed to a bipartisan budget agreement. They agreed to spending levels, which is what the Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats are working with right now when they reach their agreement. So, the White House, Senate Republicans, and Senate Democrats are all in a line right now and in agreement with what they think should be passed. And in a divided government, the two parties have to come together. But it appears that Speaker McCarthy is trying to just simply appease to his right flank, to those hard-line members, and is more concerned about his speakership than potentially avoiding a government shutdown.",

BARRON-LOPEZ:  In the past, Sara, look, shutdowns are not good for the party that appears to drive Congress into a shutdown. Voters don't reward lawmakers for it. And, right now, based on voters that I have talked to, they are pointing the finger at House Republicans. I mean, right now, House Republicans can't even agree to pass basic appropriations bills. And that is a sign that they really don't have agreement on anything in terms of their ability to even fund the government for a short amount of time. But the impact is important, Sara.
