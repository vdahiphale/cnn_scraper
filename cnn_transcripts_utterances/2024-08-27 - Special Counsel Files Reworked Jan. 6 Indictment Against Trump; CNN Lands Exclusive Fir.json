      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Two major stories unfolding. Donald Trump unloading, this evening, after he was just indicted again, in the election interference case. Special Counsel, Jack Smith, keeping all four criminal charges, but reworking the indictment, after the Supreme Court's bombshell immunity ruling. Plus, Vice President Harris schedules her first in-depth interview, since vaulting to the top of the Democratic ticket. A joint interview with her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, right here on CNN. Details on the exclusive sit-down, voters have been waiting for. I'm Pamela Brown in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Straight from THE SOURCE tonight. The Supreme Court may have granted Donald Trump sweeping immunity protections, last month. But he is not off the hook, for allegedly attempting to overthrow the 2020 election. This 36-page superseding indictment, from Special Counsel, Jack Smith, is clearly evidence of that. The Special Counsel getting a new grand jury, to hand up the indictment, one that had not previously heard evidence, in this case. Smith's team charging the former President, with the exact same charges initially brought against him. Though, this indictment did have to be reworked, to comply with the ruling. Smith specifically makes reference to that. The Supreme Court ruled Trump can claim immunity from prosecution for some of his official actions while in office. So, prosecutors have now cut language, about Trump's interactions with government officials, and added language, to describe when he was acting as a candidate, and not President. And as you might imagine, Donald Trump is fuming about all of this, claiming it as an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election, while also falsely and facelessly claiming Vice President Harris is actively behind it. And he goes on to accuse her of weaponizing the system against her political opponent. Which she is not doing. Joining us now. CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig. And former Nixon White House Counsel, and CNN Contributor, John Dean. Elie, to start with you. What are the major differences between this indictment and the previous one? What has been removed and added?",

      "sentences": "So, Pam, a lot of what's in the new indictment is actually the same as what's in the first indictment. However, the new indictment, we call it, a superseding indictment, makes some crucial changes. So first of all, here's what's been removed from the first indictment.First of all, any allegation relating to Donald Trump's efforts to pressure the Justice Department. A central theme of the first indictment was that Trump leaned on DOJ, tried to get them to substantiate his false claims of voter fraud. That is out now. Second of all, some other Trump communications, with White House advisers. The Supreme Court had said those are probably immune. Jack Smith has now removed many of them from the case. And third, I found this really interesting. The first indictment refers to Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. The new indictment returned today actually does not call him that. All it says is he was a candidate for office. They're not trying to insult him. They're trying to shift the focus from things he did, as President, to things he did as a candidate, in his unofficial capacity. Now, a couple important things have been added to the case. So first of all, there is now explicit mention, in the indictment, that Donald Trump had no role certifying state elections, and he had no role in overseeing presidential electors, because a key part of the case that remains is this false electors scheme. And finally, the new indictment adds an allegation that congressional staffers took the physical paper electoral certificates out of the chamber on January 6. And that's a response to a separate Supreme Court ruling that said, there has to be some element of document fraud or document tampering, in order to be obstruction. So, I think Jack Smith is trying to now work within that ruling as well.",

In fact, if anything, given the immunity ruling, that's been strengthened, it can go through.Obviously, it's going to be litigated, at the district court level, which is the lowest court, before Judge Chutkan. And she's going to decide initially if this works, under the very vague, unclear standards set by the Supreme Court. And hopefully, the more explicit and detailed she is, the more likely it will survive, and make it back through the Supreme Court, because I'm sure Donald Trump will appeal whatever happens, in the next phase of the process.",

And Judge Chutkan has to sort that out. She can either hear from the lawyers, in written briefs, or she can hold a hearing, which might look like a mini trial, to decide what's in and what's out And as John said, from there, Donald Trump will have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals, the Intermediate Court of Appeals, and then potentially the Supreme Court.

And I suspect there's a very strong brief, showing that the judge, Judge Cannon, had very little basis, for tossing the case and dismissing the special prosecutor. There's a long history, in the Department of Justice, of attorney generals, appointing special prosecutors. She wants to demolish that. Indeed she would, if her ruling upheld, all Assistant U.S. attorneys would be out of work. So, it's a very striking situation down there.

Trump is already fundraising off of this. No surprise there. He's emailing, please, please give $10 to stand with Trump ASAP. During past indictments, of course, we saw Trump also fundraising. And really, a fundraising surge. Should the Harris campaign be concerned about that? ASHLEY ALLISON, FORMER NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR, BIDEN-HARRIS 2020, FORMER SENIOR POLICY ADVISER, OBAMA WHITE HOUSE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I don't think so. People who are supporting Donald Trump, unfortunately, even though he already has 34 felony convictions, are going to continue to give to his campaign. What I think the Harris campaign should do, though, is use this as a reminder that we are literally having a debate, about whether or not a president should be -- a person should be elected president, who tried to overthrow the election. And this indictment is a reminder, for those voters, who are independent, who are undecided, that if you don't want the ongoing chaos and mischievous behavior, likened to Donald Trump, then let's not go back to him. Let's move forward with me. So, I would use this as an opportunity to continue to draw the contrast.

What I think it does give the -- gives President Trump an opportunity to do is, perhaps maybe talk about the letter that was published yesterday, or sent to Jim Jordan, yesterday, from Mark Zuckerberg, where he says that he received pressure, to censor search terms during COVID, that the Biden-Harris administration kind of censored, maybe even in violation a lot of the First Amendment, and then was pressured to cover up, and not publish the Hunter Biden story.",

And, by all accounts, even our own Fareed Zakaria said that if his name wasn't Donald Trump, those counts wouldn't have been brought. I do think there's a great deal of lawfare being waged against this former President, and this campaign. There were suits initially to keep him off the ballot, in many states, 14th Amendment suits, which all failed. The suit in Georgia, the suits in New York, this suit. So, a lot of people just hear white noise. They see the legal system as an extension of the political system.

She has attempted to moderate somewhat. I understand why. But I think the question remains, why is she moderating? Is it because she's seen new data that suggests you need to change your position? Or is it because, after three and a half years of being Vice President, she realizes that being a United States Senator, and being Vice President, a heartbeat away from the presidency, drastically changes one's outlook on policy and governance, generally speaking?

We have seen him do that many times. I actually think -- I think he enjoys it, to be quite honest with you. But I will say. The Mayor said something I thought was interesting about the consistency of Vice President Harris' beliefs, in terms of her policy positions. Maybe on some fronts. But I do think voters are worried or maybe concerned about her positions on fracking, being against it, now being for it, some of her immigration stances, stances on law enforcement, stances on the economy.
