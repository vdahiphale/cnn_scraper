The president and first lady arrived in the Hamptons earlier today for two fundraisers with the goal to reassure his financial backers that he is up for this race and can still win in November. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz is here with more. So Arlette what was the president's private message to donors tonight.",

      "sentences": "Well Alisyn, President Biden has done -- held two fundraisers today in the Hamptons where he was really trying to reassure these donors that his candidacy is on track.Now according to the reporters who were in the room, the president acknowledged that he didn't have a great night on the debate stage, but neither did Trump. And he went on to say that he thinks voters are going to have a different reaction to the debate. Of course, we will be seeing in the days and the weeks to come how exactly voters are feeling about the president's performance. But there is anxiety within the Democratic Party and particularly with -- among some high dollar donors about whether President Biden has a viable path forward in this race. You see the president attending these fundraisers. He had another one yesterday here in New York city. He's about to travel to Red Bank, New Jersey for another event with Governor Phil Murphy. And his advisers behind the scenes have been fielding calls from anxious donors after this debate. Now one thing the Biden campaign has been trying to tout are some bright spots in the fundraising in the 48 hours around this debate. The Biden campaign earlier today had announced that they raised more than $27 million between Thursday and Friday. But there will be questions going forward about what his fundraising will look like down the road. At the same time this afternoon, top campaign officials, top officials at the Democratic National Committee held a call with DNC members, one that was described as a pretty standard call, but it was one where they acknowledged the president's poor debate performance and then tried to essentially rally the troops laying out what the DNC, the Democrats' organization looks like heading into this November elections. So President Biden, really at this moment is attempting to have some type of reset. You saw that yesterday in the campaign rally in North Carolina, where he came out with a much more fiery and in impassioned speech. You see that in these meetings or private meetings with these Democratic donors as he's trying to pitch them once again on his candidacy. But there will be questions still going forward about what comes next. You know, the campaign has been insistent that the president is remaining in this race, even among some Democratic anxiety. They say that he plans to debate Donald Trump if there is another matchup in September on the debate stage. And so far there have been no signs showing that the president is backing down from this race despite some of the anxiety within his own party.",

He knows that he is an underdog now. He knows he had a bad performance. He knows that he needs to spend the next hundred and something days proving to the American people that he can do the job for the next four years. And I think that he will do that. I would accept I would expect the polls to have a little dip in them and then he needs to bring them back up. This is -- this is just how campaigns seasons go. There's four months left, but the president knows that he has work to do to earn the trust of the American people.",

I applaud anybody going to (INAUDIBLE) his hometown.But what we saw the other night wasn't a bad night and I mentioned New Jersey because I want to talk about Frank Sinatra for a moment. I saw Frank Sinatra about four times in his career. And each time he got older and older. And what we would see with Sinatra towards the end of his career was one minute, \"Come Fly With Me\" was going great and a few songs later, he couldn't remember the words to \"My Way\". And this happened more and more as he got older. Joe Biden as an age where he ages faster in a job where you age faster than any other. So we can't just attribute to this one bad night for Joe Biden because this was what everybody was looking for. And that's a problem for Biden. The other thing I would say Alisyn is as somebody who spoke out very forcefully and very frequently against Donald Trump in 2016, I've noticed that a lot of the Democrats, especially on Capitol Hill on Friday, who repeatedly said, when would Paul Ryan speak out, when would John Boehner speak out. They always use that word. They were mum, they ran from cameras. They didn't have comments. They essentially acted like Republicans who said, I didn't see the tweets about Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, it cost me a lot of money he to say what I said about Donald Trump. No regrets. Democrats right now are hiding from what their true feelings are because they don't want to cross the king. And I get it, if you come for the king, your best get him, but they are not in a good situation right now, and their silence tells you that.",

So I just want to address that, that people are not running like they did from Trump. But I do think, you know, the president has to reaffirm to the American people that he is fit to do the job. and he needs to spend the next 130 days or 129 days doing that. He -- I mean, it was a bad night for him and he needs to prove that North Carolina was not an anomaly. That he didn't come out strong the next day. That that is who he is. And he mean, I would assume that the campaign knows that they need to be doing that. They are going to work very hard. You saw him today. He was -- he's going well yesterday. He's been at fundraisers today, so I just, you know, I do think there is work to do, but this is something that I think that Joe Biden is used to in his career of being the underdog and being able to prove to people that he will get back, will get up when kicked down.",

Short of a true health crisis about the only way he loses that slot is if he agrees to step aside.But even then the process of replacing him would be full of uncertainty. Democrats could work it out at their convention in August, the way political parties used to. Various names would be put forward and most likely the more than 3,900 delegates from across the country would discuss and debate and eventually decide on a new candidate. Almost all of them are currently pledged to Biden, by the way, and approved by his campaign. But what if they can't agree on a new choice? If it gets really nasty and grinds on, well then maybe the additional roughly 700 superdelegates, deep-seated party insiders and elected officials could be key to settling the matter. Normally, they can't vote on the first ballot for president if it would change the nominee, but they can vote on subsequent ballots. But that scenario raises questions too. Would voters who took part in primaries feel pushed aside and alienated from the party if a new nominee was chosen that way. Would a new choice be able to mount an effective campaign in the roughly ten weeks from the end of the convention until election day. For example, would Donald Trump agreed to debate a fresh face at that late date? And who would be the choice. There are several big names that could likely be considered, but not until the party decides how it feels about Vice President Kamala Harris. Plenty of Democratic voters and party leaders would see her as the natural heir to the nomination. And if she is not chosen, her disappointed supporters could also become a deep problem for the party in November. For now, Biden's advisers and top Democrats are pushing back on the whole idea of him dropping out. But that talk just keeps elbowing in, Alisyn. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This was, honestly, even bigger than January 6th and the aftermath.And I think that's for one very specific reason, Alisyn. A lot of Americans had tuned out of this election until this week. A lot of people didn't believe there was really going to be a rematch. They don't want to see these two elderly men running for office again. They want to see other candidates. So people hadn't really paid attention. And now, as of this week, they are. I'm doing - here's my very scientific backyard pool party analysis today, Alisyn. I had people come up to me at a kid's birthday party saying, \"Is Biden seriously going to stay in the race?\" This has now permeated beyond just \"The New York Times\" and \"The Atlantic,\" beyond just the political elites. This is now an everyday conversation for people who, I think, in some cases, didn't believe the rematch was really happening.",

But I actually think this debate has permeated the culture more than the debates in 2016 or in 2020. Because this was truly a game-changing debate. I mean, look, if you're in a battle between someone who lies really confidently versus someone who mostly tells the truth, but really incoherently, the confident liar is always going to win. And I think many millions of Americans, who don't want to see Trump re-elected, were yelling at their TVs wanting Biden to fight back harder, wanting to see an actual debate, an actual fight. They didn't get that. They came away disappointed. And it makes me wonder if there will be any more debates at all. But I have an idea, Alisyn. I brought this up as a joke on Thursday before the debate to the heads of one of the major networks. I said there should be a presidential fitness test on live TV this fall. And I was kidding.

No studio audiences to get in the way. And the muting of microphones actually worked. I'll tell you, Alisyn, there were executives at CNN that we're very worried about this. They didn't know how it was going to go with the microphones. But it actually fostered a real conversation. And for better or worse, we learned a lot about the candidates.
