      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead, U.S. President Joe Biden issues an official pardon for his son Hunter, despite earlier pledging not to do so. And the move is already sparking backlash from both sides of the aisle.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad taps his allies to send in reinforcements as rebel forces advance in Aleppo and beyond. And another night of unrest in Georgia as anger boils over at the government's decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union. Good to have you with us. Well, with his term in office winding down, U.S. President Joe Biden has delivered a bombshell announcement, doing something he vowed he would never do. He has issued a full and unconditional pardon for his son, Hunter. And now Republicans and Democrats are weighing in on both the immediate and long-term ramifications of the president's broken promise. A senior administration official says President Biden reached the decision just this weekend as he and his family were wrapping up their Thanksgiving holiday together in Massachusetts. The White House had still denied a pardon was a possibility as recently as last month. The president issued a statement explaining his reasoning, saying in part, quote, \"no reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son and that is wrong.\" Hunter Biden was convicted on three federal felony gun charges in June in a trial that exposed details of his drug abuse. He faced up to 25 years in prison for those crimes. He also pleaded guilty to nine charges and a federal tax case in September. He was due for sentencing in both cases later this month. He is the first immediate family member of a sitting U.S. president to be found guilty of a crime. Hunter Biden released his own statement on the pardon saying, in part, \"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction. I will never take the clemency I have been given today for and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.\" CNN's Evan Perez has more details on how the president reached his decision.",

Now, Hunter Biden will be covered under this pardon for anything that happened between 2014 and 2024. So the question remains whether Republicans in Congress and whether the incoming Trump administration will find new reasons to investigate Hunter Biden and the Biden family, as they have said they repeatedly would do.

For President Biden offering a pardon, I think the legal implications are zero.Presidents have very broad pardon power under the constitution.

There was the case where Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury and that deals with lying on a federal form to buy a gun. And then separately, there is a tax evasion case where Hunter Biden was pleading guilty. And I think when it comes to the gun case, that really is not typically brought as a standalone charge.And so I think we can say with a straight face that it's quite unusual to see that case brought against an individual, again, without other charges. Now, just because something is typically not done doesn't mean it's illegitimate. But when it comes to the tax evasion case, I think the claims of selective prosecution are not quite as strong here. So, you know, is it the case that if Hunter Biden were a Hunter Smith, then these cases would not have been brought? I think that is possible.

That includes Kash Patel, but also Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey.Now, according to my conversations with those working on the transition team, I'm told that Trump had long knew that he wanted to have Kash Patel in a big role in his second term, including some sort of role in national intelligence, or at the Department of Justice. But when it became clear that he was going to be a top contender for the FBI director, some people close to Donald Trump had some skepticism about that. They're worried that there would be too much controversy surrounding Patel particularly as it related to an upcoming and likely contentious Senate confirmation battle. However, behind the scenes, I'm told that others and those closest to Donald Trump, including his sons Eric Trump, as well as Donald Trump Jr. as well as his incoming deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, had really pushed Donald Trump to end up choosing Patel. They argue that he was likely the only person in their minds that they believed could really disrupt the Federal Bureau of Investigations as much as they believed Patel could, as well as root out the bias that Donald Trump believes has really permeated the bureau over recent years. Now, Donald Trump, I'm told, had interviewed both Andrew Bailey and Kash Patel at Mar-a-Lago in person earlier this month. However, I was also told that Donald Trump was not that impressed by Bailey. He thought that he lacked the personality traits to really be the type of legal pit bull that Donald Trump wants his FBI director to be. I'm going to read for you one quote from a Trump adviser who has been involved in some of these conversations. They said, quote, it came down to a matter of what Trump wants and what he was looking for in terms of an FBI director and Bailey didn't fit that mold. He didn't have the personality. Now, in addition, we've also heard many of Donald Trump's incoming cabinet picks but also top allies trying to defend Patel online as well as on television over the weekend. They argued that again, they believed that Patel was the only person that could reform the FBI and try and restore trust in the agency. Take a listen to what some senators said Sunday morning. REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Donald Trump campaigned on reforming the FBI and the Department of Justice, so I don't know why any of this is frankly surprising to people. SEN. BILL HAGERTY (R-TN):  There are serious problems at the FBI. The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change. And Kash Patel is just the type of person to do it. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX):  I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI.
