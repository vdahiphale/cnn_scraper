Mr. Trump's tone turns reverent and somber, prompting some supporters to bow their heads or close their eyes. Others raise open palms in the air or murmur as if in prayer. In this moment, Mr. Trump's audience is his congregation, and the former president their pastor as he delivers a roughly 15-minute finale that evokes an evangelical altar call, the emotional tradition that concludes some Christian services in which attendees come forward to commit to their savior.\"My panel is back. I'm going to set aside - I'm going to - hasn't - let's set aside the golden calf for a moment, Matt Gorman, but it - this is something that we are seeing increasingly on the campaign trail, but also just kind of in our zeitgeist in the way that the former president is reaching out to Christian voters.

President Biden, in a statement, said he was outraged and heartbroken by their deaths and implored Israel to do more to protect aid workers bringing much-needed food and assistance into Gaza. Joining us now is CNN's White House correspondent Arlette Saenz. Arlette, good morning to you. The president also says that Israel needs to do more to protect civilians.

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, the statement from the president really amounts to the sharpest - some of this sharpest language he's used throughout this entire conflict to criticize Israel's approach in Gaza. A senior administration official told CNN that the death of these Central Kitchen workers really raised the frustration level among President Biden and his top advisers to whole new levels. That was evidenced in the very first words that President Biden used in his statement yesterday, saying, \"I am outraged.\" A word that he has rarely used in this conflict.The president also warned Israel that they have not done enough to protect civilians in Gaza. He added, quote, \"this conflict has been one of the worst in recent memories in terms of how many aid workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians. Incidents like yesterdays simply should not happen.\" The White House also noted President Biden spoke by phone with the World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres, a celebrity chef based here in Washington, D.C., to express his condolences for the lives lost, including one dual U.S. Canadian citizen. But this episode really lays bare the tension points between President Biden and Israel at a time when the administration has increasingly warned Israel that they need to take greater care to protect civilians in their operations and also get more humanitarian aid into the enclave. One big question though is how this might impact the president's approach when he is thinking about how to handle Israel amid this conflict, at a time when he's also facing domestic pressures on that front here at home.",

This is what he says. Quote, \"we know Israelis. Israelis, in their heart of hearts, know that food is not a weapon of war. Israel is better than the way this war is being waged. It is better than blocking food and medicine to civilians. It is better than killing aid workers who had coordinated their movements with the Israel Defense Forces.\" There's a lot of nuance in that right there.

I mean we're not at the end of the story. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, Jose Andres is someone who is well-known in Washington, D.C., and this attack, this strike on these aid workers has resonated in a way that other incidents have not resonated, even though there have been more than 200 aid workers killed over the course of this war, and thousands of civilians killed. The fact that this is an effort to provide food for people who are starving, who are struggling, it's really resonated across the aisle. And I think that's part of the reason the White House feels the pressure to put more pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu, who, for the most part has not been publicly responsive to the pressure. But what we saw from the Israelis last night, including a videotape statement where they said they were sorry, where they said they were going to do an investigation. It's clear that they are feeling the pressure from the U.S., from the west, and from the White House that they're going to have to change to get any kind of continued support from the (INAUDIBLE).",

You remember he said, we overreacted after 9/11 and did things we came to regret.
