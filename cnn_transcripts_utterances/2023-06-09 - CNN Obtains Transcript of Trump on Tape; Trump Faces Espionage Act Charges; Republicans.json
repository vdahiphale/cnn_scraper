They should have done it, frankly, yesterday when they notified the former president knowing that he was going to go immediately to his social media platform and start telling the story of what the - about the -- what this investigation led by Jack Smith, the special counsel, has done. We know that they got a notification by email that this - that this summons had been delivered and that this indictment had been handed up and they started working the mechanics of when the former president is going to show up to Miami to make his first appearance before a magistrate.We know that Jim Trusty, the -- one of his attorneys who received this information, says that he doesn't know much more beyond just the outlines of the charges that he was told. So, it's possible it might be more than seven counts that the former president is facing. Here's Trusty talking last night on our air about what he knows. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM TRUSTY, DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: They basically break out from an Espionage Act charge, which is ludicrous under the facts of this case, and I can certainly explain it, and several obstruction-based-type charges and then false statement charges, which are actually, again, kind of a crazy stretch just from the facts as we know it. So, there's a lot to pick at eventually from the defense side, but that appears to be the charges and it appears to be something that will get off the ground on Tuesday. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Starting with that quote, saying, I could have declassified when I was president but I didn't, that is the exact opposite of what Donald Trump has been saying repeatedly in public. So, first of all, I think it ends the whole issue, did he, in fact, declassify. Second of all, prosecutors are going to say, folks, he's been lying to the public for months. Why do you think that is?

Not am I only - not only am I going to take this highly secret, confidential Defense Department document that apparently is talking about Iran, and I'm going to talk to who? Some reporters, some people who don't have national clearance, security clearance. And he acknowledges that. He acknowledges that. Why? Because he says, I'm off the record. He wants to make sure it never comes out. And you could be sure at a trial, prosecutors are going to play that up. I don't want this to get out. Please, keep it off the record.

But if there are not, you do not have to put all of your evidence in the indictment. I mean that would make indictments, in some instances, impossibly long.

So there are still a lot of details here that we simply don't know. We do know that the Trump team was bracing for this yesterday. They felt the indictment was likely. They were, of course, tracking the news coverage of this. They were so prepared, in fact, that they decided to have Donald Trump prerecord a video responding to the indictment before the team had even been informed that Trump was indicted. He maintained his innocence in that video. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: It's called election interference.
