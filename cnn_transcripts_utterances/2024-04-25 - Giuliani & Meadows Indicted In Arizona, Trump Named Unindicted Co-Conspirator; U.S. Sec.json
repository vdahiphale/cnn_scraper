You have those immunity arguments. His hush money trial resumes, and breaking overnight, a grand jury and Arizona handed up an indictment against a group of Trumps allies for their attempts to overturn he is 2020 election loss. A source familiar with the investigation tells CNN that the indictment includes several people connected to Trumps 2020 campaign. His former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. As well as members of the Arizona GOP whose certified themselves as alternate electors for Trump. The former president was not indicted, but as listed as an unindicted coconspirator Arizona attorney general, Kris Mayes, who led this investigation, spoke about the indictments yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRIS MAYES (D), ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden. Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency. Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Can you help us understand why -- you know, why were learning about this now, how this has unfolded in Arizona, and how it plays in to the bigger picture of all of the legal challenges around the 2020 election? MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6 INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL:  Right. Well, it's always nice when you can kind of zoom in and see how this was impacted on a state-by-state level. And I think its an interesting juxtaposition that we have here today. You mentioned Supreme Court here in this case, and that really got there from the federal January 6 case against the president that looked had a had a nationwide view and now were getting a glimpse into Arizona specifically, and its not different than really Georgia, or Michigan or any other states that have investigated the fake electors scheme. But it looks at overturning the lawful election as the attorney general just said. And in Arizona and trying to prevent the loss full transfer of power, specifically on Arizona legislator, the Arizona electors that were sent to put pressure on the vice president.",

This is truly, you mentioned it already at the top of the show is one of those historic moments history, and I don't say that lightly.This is really going to dictate whether we truly believe that everyone is accountable to the law. The former president is arguing that by allowing him to be prosecuted, its a moral threat to the presidency because he was performing as outer perimeter of his duties, citing the Nixon case, and that it will prevent presidents from feeling free to make decisions as best for the country if they're, if they're fearful of being prosecuted in the back-end. I tend to agree with the special counsel's argument that we are a nation of laws and everyone is accountable to those laws. And I want to really want to make the point that overturning a lawful election while sitting us president, I don't see a world with that can be considered part of the outer perimeter of the president's duties. And I expect that the government, were making that point today. All of the Supreme Court typically doesn't weight into facts. I expect those themes to be competing back-and-forth here today of the moral threat of being a president versus accountability under the law.",

There also was a meeting between Trump and the polish leader Duda that have been characterized as actually part of a push to convince him not to stand in the way of the aid package that was working its way through Congress here in Washington.And now, \"Politico\" on yours side of \"The Atlantic\", they operate here, but also in Europe has a pretty significant piece. They write this: the former reality TV star's return to power, they're talking about Trump, would not only be the biggest test and transatlantic relations and post-war history, it could pose an existential risk two European unity as tensions over how to work with the world's most powerful country, pull the continent apart on issues ranging from trade policy to the fight against climate change, to the defense of European territory.

And I think probably what this article is alluding to is the fact that having one clear, cohesive, common response from Europe, which is strong enough to counter the U.S. view, is going to be almost impossible because getting agreement within the E.U. and then tied to the fact you got the E.U. countries like U.K. to factor into that would it have enough power to counter or will it be individual countries working on their own against the U.S. view?

You see that hatched area we have overlaid on top of the orange coloring. That is the area that we've highlighted that has the greatest chance of EF2 tornadoes or greater, that means a minimum of 111-mile per hour winds potentially within this area as they see the greatest risk of tornadoes within that particular region. That doesn't mean a tornado can occur outside of that, but that's where they think the strongest tornadoes will occur.
