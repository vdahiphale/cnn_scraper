That means there won't be any progress on this issue and the holds that Senator Tuberville has put in, a number that as of last week officially tops 300 -- 301 to be exact. And we're waiting for an update on that number. A number that's expected to double to 600 by the end of the year. That remains in place. And the senior military leaders, two stars, three stars and four stars, largely remains paralyzed with these holds. Unable to move into their jobs and that has a cascading effect -- according to DOD officials.And they number of senior Pentagon officials and military officials have detailed how this affects the military from junior officers having to step in and do jobs for which they are not openly and completely experienced for or have the qualifications for. The questions about whether it affects the retention of junior officers. And we're heard this from, for example, General Charles Q. Brown, who is the nominee chosen to be the next chairman of the joint chiefs. From General Eric who's nominated to be the next Commandant of the Marine Corps. On talking about all talking about how this affects military readiness. How this has the potential to affect retention if this keeps playing out. And all indications right now are that it will continue doing so, and that appear s to be the issue. The Pentagon has tried to put some pressure on Tuberville. Seeing if it's possible for his Republican colleagues in the Senate to pressure him to give up on these holds and allow these nominations to move forward. But as we saw from that tweet, it's had little effect and Tuberville is not moving from his position. And that means, Brianna, there's an open question about how long he's going to keep this up. And it looks like quite a while now as even more and more officers are not only on hold but warning of the effects of this.",

They were seated in the very back of the plane near the galley, where the flight attendants work. In the middle section of the plane -- it's a wide- body airliner, so there's seats aisle, seats again. So they said that this passenger was so drunk to begin with, and then the flight crew continually served him drinks according to this lawsuit. And in fact, one of the flight attendants, according to this lawsuit, even joked as this passenger ordered a drink that only an alcoholic would order a drink before the flight took off.

This is an issue that Congress has been pushing aggressively. We know the current Supreme Court are the only members of the federal judiciary not covered by these standards.And this goes back to the controversial statements that we saw last week from Justice Samuel Alito to the editorial board in pages after a four-hour interview with the \"Wall Street Journal,\" where he said that voluntarily follows -- that he voluntarily follows disclosure statutes that apply to lower-court judges. But this is what really stood out to people in raised eyebrows. He went on to say that Congress did not create the Supreme Court, and I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court, period. Now Alito went on in this for hour interview to characterize a number of the justices. And here's how he described Chief Justice John Roberts. He said that he volunteers -- he said that John Roberts puts a high premium on consensus, that he rarely dissents. And this speaks to the reporting Joan is bringing us as to what Chief Justice John Roberts is hoping to achieve here. And thus far it doesn't look like he's getting there.
