I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Right now in Florida, Donald Trump is in a federal courthouse for hearing in the classified documents case. Coming up, we will discuss the former President's legal strategy. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden is on the campaign trail in key swing states across the upper Midwest, and Vice President Kamala Harris is set to make a historic visit to a Planned Parenthood clinic. We're going to have a live report from Wisconsin straight ahead. And as the security situation in Haiti continues to worsen, the U.S. is considering using the naval base at Guantanamo Bay to process Haitian migrants. Right now, Donald Trump is in a Florida courtroom where his attorneys are trying to get the classified documents case against him thrown out. Now, at issue here is whether as President he was entitled to keep the documents he wanted at his estate. Trump faces dozens of charges after prosecutors say that he took the sensitive materials to Mar-a-Lago, then enlisted the help of lawyers and aides to try to block the government's attempt to retrieve them. Now, he has pleaded not guilty. The hearing going on now is a critical one. It could decide whether this case will go to trial. Let's bring in former Federal Prosecutor Michael Zeldin on this. Michael, welcome. Always good to have you. First, let's just lay out, what is the case that Trump's lawyers are trying to make here?",

He also was saying that the Presidential Records Act, which designates certain types of information, is vague. He doesn't understand what a national security document is, and therefore the case should be thrown out because that statute on its face doesn't allow enough clarity for him to defend himself. I think both of those motions should fail, Rahel. But, you never know.Judge Cannon has made mistakes in this case in the past, and we'll have to wait and see sort of edge of our seat to see whether she gets the law correct this time around.",

So, it's a matter of first impression. But, I think the law on its face, when you read it, and it says, what is a presidential record and what is a personal record is quite clear. And what is a national defense document is quite clear. So, yes, it's new and that it's being applied for the first time. But, that's not going to make it less clear to the President and it should be something that the judge finds to be without merit.",

At any moment, the judge in the Georgia election interference case could rule on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from the case.On March 1, you might remember, Judge Scott McAfee said that he expected to decide Willis' fate within two weeks, and he is promising to stick to his timeline. Now, lawyers for Mr. Trump and his co- defendants accused Willis of financially benefiting from her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, by hiring him to be her special prosecutor. So, two big cases that we will continue to, of course, keep an eye on. In the meantime, it is also a historic day on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. US Vice President Kamala Harris set to stop at a Planned Parenthood clinic in just a few hours. It's believed to be the first visit by a sitting U.S. President or Vice President. Meantime, President Joe Biden is in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Let's get to CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who is traveling with the President, to give us a sense of what more we can expect. Jeff. JEFF ZELENY, CNN U.S. CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Rahel, President Biden, well, was here in Milwaukee yesterday, talking about his infrastructure plan. He'll be going to Michigan to do a similar thing today. This is really just continuing his lap, if you will, of battleground states in the post-State of the Union address week. He has hit nearly a half dozen battleground states. By the end of the month, he will hit all of the battleground states. The point, of course, the first order of business, is trying to shore up concerns among some Democrats about the fact that, yes, he is going to be the party's nominee, and then trying to excite them for the months to come. But, he is announcing specific infrastructure deals, like here in Milwaukee, for example, really taking that big bipartisan infrastructure law and reducing it to a granular level what this city and this state will see. In fact, Wisconsin as a key state has already received $6 billion in funding from the infrastructure law. So, the President clearly trying to use his accomplishments to sell his agenda and his bid for reelection. But, heading into Michigan this afternoon, of course, another key battleground state as well, he'll be going to Saginaw, Michigan. That is one of only 25 counties in America, across the whole country, that for the last four presidential elections has picked the correct one, Obama, Obama, Trump, and Biden. We call that a -- that's very interesting. It's a bellwether. So, he'll be going there this afternoon. But, really, this is all part of selling his message. Of course, as you said, Donald Trump is in a courtroom. His opponent, President Biden, is actually on the campaign trail. Rahel.",

Does it happen a little bit like he did during COVID, where at the end of every day, he would talk to the press and debrief them a little bit like that? But, as we know, with COVID, it kind of got off the rails. So, the key here is, as he does everything in the courtroom at the beginning of the day, at the end of the day, at the very least, can you still get a message out? That is what the voters want.",

Prime Minister Netanyahu has a governing coalition in Israel. That includes two very far right-wing members, Minister Smotrich and Minister Ben-Gvir, and they have made it very difficult for the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza, for the preservation of stability in the West Bank.And I think Leader Schumer in that speech was indicating that Prime Minister Netanyahu has a governing coalition whose vision doesn't align with Senator Schumer's vision for a path towards a two-state solution, for a path in which Israel both defends its civilian population against Hamas and protects the civilian population of Gaza. If that's roughly what his speech was about, then I think it is past time for us to be clear with our close and trusted ally Israel, that we have a real disagreement about the path forward between Israel and Palestine.",

As an ally in a democracy, whatever the result is of their elections, we should respect their free and fair elections. But, it may well result in Netanyahu no longer being the Prime Minister. He is significantly unpopular because many Israelis, in recent polls, have blamed him for the security failures of October 7. It has been Prime Minister Netanyahu's strategy for a long time to divide the Palestinian people between Gaza and West Bank, to weaken the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and to tolerate Hamas in Gaza, partly to avoid ever having to negotiate for a two- state solution. So, if I understand properly your question and the speech by LeaderSchumer that I didn't get to hear, I would understand why he might be saying it's time for new elections in Israel in order to make sure that the strategic direction of Israel aligns with its interests and values.",

They are -- the Chinese government is using and abusing a lot of the information that they are getting through this platform.And so, while this has to go through to -- and if it gets to a bill that gets to the President's desk, it is absolutely important for them to clarify.

This is a different facility all together. But, this is something that is being seriously discussed within the White House and within the administration, writ large in terms of whether they should expand the facility in anticipation of a potential mass exodus of Haitians, of course, given the situation on the ground there and the deteriorating conditions.There has been growing concern within the White House about Haitians leaving and heading to the shores of South Florida. We've already seen that before in 2022. There were a number of makeshift vessels that were landing in Florida, and these are vessels that hold more than 100 migrants for this dangerous and perilous days-long journey. And so, if that were to happen again, the administration is having to draw up contingency plans for what facilities are available to them to process these migrants and then repatriate them, either to Haiti or to a third country. Now, I have been told from the White House, the following, when I asked them about these plans, they said \"We are clear eyed that economic, political, and security instability are key drivers for migrants around the world. We are closely monitoring the situation and the routes frequently used by migrants to reach our borders and at this time, irregular migration flows through the Caribbean remain low.\" Again, what we're talking about here is maritime migration. That is people that are fleeing by sea to the United States. And so, this is a logistical challenge for the administration should they decide to expand the capacity. But also, the department that would be front and center on this, the Department of Homeland Security, is also running out of cash. They are waiting for additional funding, and without that, it requires a lot of logistical gymnastics really to get the personnel they need down there and also to make sure that everything is in place along with partners with the Defense Department and the State Department. But again, Rahel, above all else, these discussions are yet another sign of how concerned the administration is about what is happening in Haiti currently and what the aftermath of that might be.",
