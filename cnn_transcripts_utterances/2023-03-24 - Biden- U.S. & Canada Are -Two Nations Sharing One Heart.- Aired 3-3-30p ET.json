The President fired up there at the end, stressing the close relationship between Canada and the United States saying they are two countries sharing one heart.Among the biggest applause lines, the President talking about security specifically in the context of Ukraine, and saying these two nations are united in support of NATO to defend against any threat.",

We're going to bring that to you live.But first, let's go to CNN's Paula Newton, who's live in Ottawa for us. And Paula, the President seemed like he was having a fairly good time speaking to Parliament. We know that foreign policy is what he considers to be one of his greatest strengths. It's what he loves the most. What did you take away from his remarks?",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, he's certainly among friends there, Jessica, no doubt. And so he feels so comfortable in that hall. And just to remind everyone about his background, not just as vice president, but also as a senator, he knows these people, he knows this place. And he feels quite comfortable, especially when he's trying to deliver what he hopes will be a historic speech. And that's why you also heard him mentioned, President Kennedy, and what everything he hopes Canada and the United States will achieve going forward.Now, if you're observing this, he did point to, in fact, some deals. He actually preempted himself in the press conference, he flubbed it a little bit as saying that he applauded China - he meant to say he applauded Canada. He corrected himself and saying that there was a deal at the border for at least 15,000 migrants to be taken directly from the southern hemisphere into Canada. That's just one of the things we're going to hear from the press conference. But in this speech as well, he was really underscoring the unprecedented nature of the relationship between these two countries. But the fact that more than ever, you could have never imagined that, that when Joe Biden took office, that he'd be looking at Canada and saying, look, we know you can step up, you need to do more, you need to be more, and he's here to really solidify those thoughts. There are some irritants that he talked about. He brought up the Inflation Reduction Act and the fact that Canada got a carve out for EV vehicles made here in Canada in that bill. And that's just one of the things that doesn't sit well in Congress. This was as much a speech to political foes in Washington, who made me believe Canada's getting an easy ride on things to say, look, we need to bring this country along, because right after he talked about those EVs, he talked about the critical minerals that he hopes Canada will bring on side and actually mine on a more critical timetable going forward. Look, there were not so much a veiled shot of both Russia and China here when he's talking about shared security and how crucial the Arctic is to that shared security right now, again, looking to Canada to step up. But Jessica, a really historic speech here, the President is hoping to lay his marker down on what he hopes to do with Canada going forward and also a message to other allies, as he continues to try and line them up saying, look, we need to do hard things in his words, in order to counter the kind of aggressive influence from both Russia and China and even countries like Iran.",

      "sentences": "And notable Paula that he concluded his remarks talking about what he told to Chinese President Xi, that the United States and he said that Canada - he could say the same about Canada, what the United States and Canada are about and its possibilities.Notably you mentioned one of the points of friction and that is investment in NORAD. Something that came into question the capabilities of NORAD when that suspected Chinese spy balloon flew over that part of the Arctic and over Canada and over part of the United States. And I'm wondering, there were these allegations that China recently tried to influence elections in Canada. I don't think he mentioned that in the speech, but I'm sure that came up in their conversations.",
