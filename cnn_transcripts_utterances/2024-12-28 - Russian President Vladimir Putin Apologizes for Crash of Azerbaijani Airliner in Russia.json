      "sentences": "Good morning and thanks for joining me. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.We begin this morning with breaking news on that deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan. Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin is apologizing for what he calls a tragic incident following the crash of that Azerbaijani airliner that killed 38 people on Christmas Day. But the Kremlin leader is also stopping short of admitting responsibility for the disaster. This comes as a U.S. official tells CNN that Russian air defenses may have mistaken the commercial jet that crashed on Christmas Day with a Ukrainian drone. Today, Putin admitted that Russia's air defense systems were active when that flight attempted to land in Chechnya on Wednesday. All of this happening as we are also now hearing from one of the 29 people who emerged from that disaster alive. Let's go to CNN's Nada Bashir, who is covering this for us. Nada, good morning. What more are you learning here?",

And one of the key lines of inquiry that we have repeatedly heard now from U.S. officials and according to Reuters sources who are familiar with that ongoing investigation, is this question of Russia's air defense systems in the area, and, of course, nearby drone activity. It is understood that the crash occurred shortly after drone strikes, Ukrainian drone strikes hit parts of southern Russia.And as you mentioned, we have now had this update, latest information from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Again, not acknowledging responsibility and not admitting any sort of responsibility for that crash, but apologizing for the crash happening within Russian airspace, and crucially, noting that Russia's air defenses were active in this region at the time. So that will certainly raise some questions for investigators as they continue to assess the evidence at hand at this stage. But also, they will be looking at those eyewitness accounts. Remarkably, 29 people survived the crash, and we have had some firsthand testimonies, quite terrifying firsthand testimonies recounting those final moments before the plane crashed. Take a look.

Nada, thank you.Israeli forces have arrested dozens of health care staff, including a hospital director, after raiding the last major health facility in northern Gaza. Thats according to Gaza's ministry of health. The Israeli military surrounded the Kamal Adwan hospital on Friday as part of it's ongoing operations in the area. The World Health Organization says that the raid put the facility out of service, warning at least 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition remained inside. Now, Israel claims that Hamas is using the facility for it's operations. Multiple staff members also reported a massive fire at the hospital, describing extensive damage to emergency units and key departments. The IDF denying any connection to the fire and saying that it's troops are operating in the area of the hospital and not inside of it. Witnesses and staff say that the IDF ordered patients and medical workers to evacuate, despite there being nowhere else to go.

We came out at 7:30 a.m. and did not know what to do or where to go. They asked us to leave Kamal Adwan and head to Fakhoora. The way there, there is no road, just deep sand.

Eighty percent of humanitarian work around the world is due to conflict, 80 percent. And the numbers, as you say, are just staggering. Conflict touches every area of a child's life. But it's important that we bring it back to what this actually means. This means thousands of parents having to bury their children, having to say final goodbyes, millions of parents making that heartbreaking, impossible decision to uproot their family in search of safety.In terms of what can be done, it's choices. We cannot say we do not know what impact this has. A recent war child study found that 96 percent of children in Gaza feel that death is imminent, 49 percent feel that they want to die because of the conflict. So when parties to the conflict, grown men, are making decisions about how they, you know, their military strategies, how they wage these wars, they have to protect children. We're not asking for any new laws or any new conventions. We are asking that the grown men who are making these decisions leading to children suffering adhere to the laws that exist.",

And so that is the first thing we need to see. We need to see an end to this fighting. In Syria, a rare moment of hope after 12 -- more than 13 years, sorry, of conflict in Syria, we now see hopefully an end to the war, and families, the joy and optimism they have to be able to rebuild their lives.

This time, President-elect Trump is pleading the case, filing a legal brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the Supreme Court should delay a U.S. ban on the social media platform, which is set to take effect in just three weeks. Now, that's putting him at odds with President Biden's White House, which is arguing that TikTok's ties to China pose grave threats to national security.Let's bring in CNN's Alayna Treene, who is live for us in Florida.

      "sentences": "Thats right, he did. He's kind of changing his tune here, Rahel, from his previous administration's stance. On Friday, in this legal brief, he urged the Supreme Court to put a pause on this controversial ban on TikTok, arguing that such a delay in it's implementation would give his incoming administration an opportunity to try and come to some sort of resolution to save the app.Now, as you mentioned, this is related to a law that Congress approved earlier this year, Biden also signed it into law, that would effectively make sure that the ban was apt in the United States if it does not divest from it's Chinese owner, ByteDance. Now, that law is set to take effect on January 19th, just one day before Donald Trump is sworn into office. And that's really what Donald Trump's brief focused on, and arguing that he wants to be able to have a pause so that his administration one day later, after this ban is expected to take effect, would be able to try and work out some sort of negotiation. I'm going to read for you what he wrote in this brief. He said, quote, \"President-elect Trump urges the court to stay the statutes effective date to allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\" Now, to be clear here, Rahel, this puts him at odds with the Biden administration, which also filed it's own brief on Friday, warning, as you mentioned, of these grave national security concerns that TikTok poses, specifically citing Chinas influence through the app and on young kids throughout the United States. Now, to go back to Donald Trump's previous position on this, you mentioned he signed an executive order while he was in office in his first administration that would have effectively banned TikTok. [10:20:2] However, we've heard him really kind of say more positive things about the app in recent weeks. I want you to take a listen to some of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We'll take a look at TikTok. You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points. And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that. We did go on TikTok, and we had a great response. We had billions of views, billions and billions of views.

The real question before the Supreme Court that justices now have to weigh is whether or not the ban would violate First Amendment rights.

He's not weighing in on that. He's basically just saying to the justices, hey, guys, I'm coming into office. I want time to resolve this. So therefore, you should delay the implementation of this law.I mean, that's a pretty broad request, pretty bold request. I mean, there's lots of presidents who don't like laws that they inherit. And for the court to simply say, well, OK, he's coming in. He wants a chance to reconsider this, therefore, we're going to delay it or strike it down, I think that would be a pretty revealing moment in terms of how much deference this court majority is prepared to give him. So I kind of look at -- I mean, his request is unusual in that respect. But, you know, with Donald Trump, sometimes he's very transparent. I mean, he said he did better with young voters than he did in 2020. He thinks TikTok was a big part of the reason why.

And he can't just negotiate a deal, right. This is a statute. He would have to change the statute, convince Congress to change the statute in some way, get 60 votes in the Senate to change the statute in some way. So I would -- if the Supreme Court does this, as I said, I think it will be a very revealing marker of how much deference they are prepared to give him on the other issues that are steamrolling their way, like the coming attempt to end birthright citizenship, or what he does with mass deportation, and so forth.

And that creates benefits for the broader society. What Vivek Ramaswamy argued was different, though. What he argued was essentially, we need these people to come because Americans don't study hard enough in high school and college, and we venerate the jock and the homecoming queen and not the valedictorian. I'm just trying to imagine what would be happening on FOX this weekend if a Democrat had made that argument and said, we need more immigrants because Americans aren't up to the jobs they would fill. In the first term, Trump was very hostile to H1-B. I'm guessing there's going to be more of a compromise this time. But you still have a lot of voices on the other side of this debate, Rahel, led by Stephen Miller in the White House. And I doubt that Elon Musk and Ramaswamy are going to get everything they want here. But again, I suspect that they will get somewhat more of what they want than what we saw in Trump's first term.",

And what they found is mutations in this virus that may make it easier for the virus to infect human cells in the upper respiratory tract. The bird flu isn't very good at infecting people in our nose and throats. But with these mutations, possibly it could get better at that.Now, the good news is that the patient doesn't appear to have spread the virus to any other humans, and it doesn't look like the patient picked up these mutations from wherever the patient caught this virus in the wild. So it's thought that the patient was infected after having contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. And these mutations weren't seen in the birds. And so it really seems like these mutations are confined to this one patient. We have seen similar mutations to these before, also, in a severe case of H5N1, this one in a teenager in British Columbia, Canada. Again, in that scenario, it appears that these mutations happened in the patient and weren't spread to anybody else. So really the threat level would rise if we see human to human transmission of bird flu, and we have not seen that as of this point. Of course, health experts are worried when they see these mutations. It shows they are potentially possible. So they are watching this very closely. There have been a couple instances where we don't know the source of exposure. And then this one patient in Louisiana is the only one associated with backyard flocks. So this is something that the CDC is following very closely, but they say right now the risk to the public is low, especially because we haven't seen that human-to-human transmission.",

They're infected in their mammary glands, and the milk is getting infected. When you pasteurize the milk, the virus gets inactivated. But if you're drinking unpasteurized milk, that's how you can get exposed to it. So be careful. Do not drink unpasteurized milk.The second thing is, be careful with birds, with dead birds. Don't pick up a dead bird, don't start playing with it. If you work in a poultry farm, you know, protect yourself. Same thing for farm workers. So farm workers are at higher risk of exposure, both in poultry and in cattle farms. And testing needs to happen there. If you start developing any respiratory symptoms, you need to get tested. And now the good news is we have testing for COVID and for RSV and for influenza. We're seeing a big uptick nationwide of influenza. So right now, the biggest concern is Influenza A. So again, people need to get tested and people need to be treated. We have treatments available.",

But when it's swine, when it goes into humans, it's when we start seeing influenza. And the problem is this virus is continuously mutating. And it is what, you know, let's suppose somebody is infected with Influenza A, the influenza that we're normally seeing right now go up, and they get infected with this swine flu virus. The two viruses can mutate and the virus can then become more easily transmissible to others.So again, how easy it is to go, it's not very easy. It's still not able to do it very effectively because the virus has not adapted well to infect humans. But once we start seeing mutations that make it easier for the virus to infect humans, we all start getting concerned. And that's why this case in Louisiana is particularly concerning.",
