But it was those victim impact statements that the judge must consider -- and she did -- of what and how those lives have changed for the families of those four students. All right, I think we're going to look at that in a second. But, Brianna, the impact today of this sentence, 10 to 15 years, which means that, at the end of 10 years, they can go before a parole board, they can possibly get parole -- 15 years would be the maximum. But they both spoke and begged for mercy for the court. But it just didn't, I think stand, in the way of those victim impact statements.

The endgame in all this is to keep weapons out of the hands of people who hurt others or hurt themselves. And we tend to focus on local law enforcement, FBI and school (AUDIO GAP). Parents have a role in this. We tend to talk about it in terms of safe storage at home, but this family went way beyond that. They encouraged their son to have a gun. They were frivolous about his transgressions. And in the moment that they were in the office with him, with a piece of paper showing that he was fantasizing about killing people with a gun, they chose not to tell anybody that he had access to a weapon. And that's just unforgivable. And I think that just sets this apart from probably a lot of other cases that might be floating around out there. I think the right thing happened today.",

And so, over the course of two years, you see this evolution -- you can see it in the court filings -- of this boy, teenager, developing more and more radical viewpoints. And there's these messages that prosecutors point to specifically when things really reached a head. And that's when he was arrested over the weekend. One of these messages says Mercurio was telling a confidential source, the FBI source saying -- quote -- \"The plan is basically this, equip the weapons and storm the temple, kill as many people as possible before they inevitably disperse, scatter, then burn the temple to the ground, flee the scene, then move on to the next church, rinse and repeat for all 21-plus churches in the town until killed.\" That was on March 25 and 26, when Mercurio sent that message to the confidential FBI source. There was another one that says: \"I'm doing the weapons research now. Resources should not be hard to find. The weapons are something I will hide in my room and design them to be easy to conceal in a jacket.\" So, after seeing these messages from the confidential source, the FBI did secure a search warrant for his family home. They found many of these similar items, including a butane -- you know, fuel accelerants. They found guns. They found a machete. That led to the arrest, so, ultimately, a long saga, but two years in the making and really a foiled plot, as far as the FBI is concerned.",

And this law dates back to the Civil War, before Arizona was even a state. There has been a lot of confusion back and forth in Arizona on which state law applies here, because, right before Roe v. Wade was overturned, the state had instituted a 15-week abortion ban. So, there had been pauses to abortions in the state, and then resumption of that, and pause again, all in hopes that the state Supreme Court could offer some clarity here. And, today, this is what the court has said, that the state must adhere to this 123-year-old law banning near all abortions. Now, the text of that law says that there is also a punishment for providers of the abortion, between two and five years in prison.
