Our special coverage continues tonight of Hurricane Helene, a monster Category 4 storm that is now moments away from making landfall in Florida.At this moment, it is too late now for folks along the coast to evacuate. Officials warn that the winds and the storm surge will be catastrophic in some areas. The word that they are using is unsurvivable. Helene could be the strongest storm on record for the Big Bend region, and we are already starting to see A major surge in these cities. So, we have our anchors and our correspondents. They're fanned out as it is now hitting, and we have Chad Myers as well with the latest forecast in the CNN Weather Center. Let's go first to John Berman. He's out in Tallahassee in the so- called dead-on hit zone. John, what's happening where you are right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, the winds have really started to pick up, Abby, over the last half an hour, the rain really coming down here. You can see it pulling up all over the water here. And I think you can get a sense of these trees being to really lean over and blow. And that's the real concern here in Tallahassee. It is the wind.You know, Tallahassee has steam storms pass over, but never really was sustained hurricane force winds, the likes of which they are expecting here in just a few hours. Thousands and thousands of trees could come down, officials say, with hundreds and hundreds of road closures. Again, these will be hurricane force winds, maybe 100 miles per hour. In this relatively urban area, 200,000 people live here. All these live oaks line all the avenues and near their houses. That is what they're most concerned about. We're about 20 miles inland. So, when this storm makes landfall 20 miles south of here as a Category 4 storm, it will really only be the beginning for places like Tallahassee. They have moved people into shelters for mobile homes and lower lying areas here, evacuated some students from Florida State University housing into shelters. Public transportation has been closed for a long, long time. And this city closed down and awaiting this long, long night. The wind speeds here, I think, are approaching tropical storm force at this point. They've had gusts of 35 miles an hour or more, 45 would be tropical storm. That's certainly going to happen here, I think, over the next few hours, as this rain just continues to pour down. They've had more than six inches over the last day. Expecting, I think, another six inches, it will make for a very dangerous situation here overnight, Abby.",

But the difference is the number of people who live here, right? Taylor County, where this storm could make landfall, the whole county has 20,000 people. Tallahassee alone, which is in Leon County, has some 200,000. So, a lot more people here could be directly affected, even if down along the coast they may see the areas of greatest danger. But, Abby, I do think people are paying attention to the sense that maybe they didn't leave the city, but certainly at this point, they're at home and they're going to have to wait this out throughout the night.",

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, I'm going to be quite frank with you. You know, the fact that we're about 40 miles, 50 miles roughly west of where the most powerful part of Hurricane Helene is and we're feeling these types of winds, I'm worried about what it's going to look like in the morning at first light across the Big Bend area.We know how powerful this storm is and the most extreme part of the storm about to make landfall. I think it's important to put it into perspective for our viewers. Just from a meteorological standpoint, Hurricane Ian in 2022 came ashore with a central pressure of 941 millibars. Remember, a lower pressure means a stronger hurricane. Hurricane hunters now flying through the I have recorded reading sub 940 millibars. So, the storm could be coming on shore more powerful than Ian did when it came ashore just south of Fort Myers. So, there's this extreme wind warning and I kind of want to walk you through that because this is the National Weather Service reserves that wording and those warnings for only the most extreme events, and this is one of them. They ask people to treat it as if a tornado was approaching their household or their business, if they did not evacuate with an extreme wind warning. This is about, I hate to use that adjective over, but it is about as considerable, extreme and most dangerous part of this storm with, you know, these winds that will easily peel back the roofs of houses, obviously build up the storm surge in the very shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico that we've seen already setting records from Tampa Bay northward. This surge is going to come in with a vengeance because of the power of the wind that's pushing upon the tops of the ocean here. So, people need to be prepared to ride out, several days without power, if not longer. And, Abby, we know too that it's not just a coastal storm. We've been covering this for several days now, but we are very concerned about the copious amounts of rain that this will dump across the Southern Appalachians and to Central Georgia. And there are a lot of trees in this area, and it's not going to take much to topple them in this very, very saturated environment. It won't take much more rain to flood much of the southeast.

And we heard John Berman saying where he was in Tallahassee, that mostly the evacuation warnings were for, you know, manufactured homes, maybe mobile homes. Other people were asked to sort of shelter in place. Do you think that the infrastructure where you are can withstand the kinds of winds that you're expecting?",

And a lot of the infrastructure here does involve mobile homes that cannot hold up to 100 mile-per-hour- plus winds. You got to understand when we talk about Category 4 hurricanes and the Saffir-Simpson scale where we measure the destruction potential of a hurricane. They use the word catastrophic for a reason because that's the type of damage that you get with these extreme winds on the northeastern quadrant of those eye walls, the ones that are making landfall right now, the ones that the National Weather Service has reserved for this extreme wind warning.We're 50 miles or so west of those most extreme winds. And thank goodness we are, because we can continue to report for you with electricity. That's a miracle. But I am sure of it that the power numbers, the amount of number of people without power this evening is going to double, quadruple as the storm moves inland.

Because as far as I can tell there still is power here in Tallahassee and this would be one of the biggest population centers affected by this storm, so far. And the storm, the main part of the storm has not even passed over Tallahassee yet. We still are going to get the worst of it here with those trees coming down into the power lines and that could knock out power to thousands and thousands more. Just for reference, Hurricane Michael, a few years ago which passed well to the west of here, well to the west of Tallahassee, it knocked out power for about 90 percent of the customers in this city for several days and this is going to be a direct hit or a near direct hit on Tallahassee itself.

Where it gets into a problem situation is if it's out for several days, you know, a week or so, and it's just too early to tell that right now. Right now, it looks as if the center of the storm may move a little bit to the east of Tallahassee.
