But be in no doubt here at all, John, it is a deeply bleak picture for Ukraine on most of the front lines we've visited over two weeks.

And we're seeing this growing mostly among, I would say, the right flank, which is most likely to align with not just Trump but his kind of America First policy. And this is very intrinsic in kind of the way that the former administration handled global affairs by restricting foreign aid and being very skeptical of this. And we're seeing Trump comment more heavily on this. So I do think that there is a lot of ties that can be said, especially going into 2024. A lot of lawmakers are afraid -- Republicans are afraid to get on Trump's bad side.

He's also, of course, the White House and national security correspondent for The New York Times. David, it's great to have you as always.

DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, WHITE HOUSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  Great to be on with you. So, the hostage issue is being negotiated quietly as they've tried to turn on again the kind of deal that they had going several weeks ago, which resulted in the release of more than 100 hostages. More than they thought possible. Before Austin got to Qatar, there was a meeting in Poland just yesterday between the CIA Dir. Bill Burns and officials from Qatar as well, as they try to sort this out. And that's the channel that has been most active. Burns to David Barnea, who is the head of the Mossad. But it's not clear at this point that Hamas is willing to keep this going and there is some indication from U.S. officials that they didn't want to turn over more women and children for fear that they might discuss the conditions under which they were held or the treatment that they received, which suggests that there may have been more brutality along the way. It's a little bit of a black box right now about what they are actually discussing. But I would really focus on the Burns channel. He's been the sort of lead player on the hostage negotiations.",

That has to depend on where Nippon Steel plans, if at all, to be producing this steel. And every indication is they plan to keep producing it in the United States. But it would be a national security concern if it was going into the hands of an adversary. With the Japanese, I think there is less of a concern today. I am certain, though, that this will be reviewed by this very -- a little-known committee called the Committee on Investment in the United States that takes a look at all foreign investments in the U.S. and then would have to sign off on it. I think that's going to be a lot easier process than had it been, say, a Chinese firm.

Down by four with less than two minutes to play, he marches his team downfield on an 11- play, 92-yard drive that ended with this touchdown from the rookie Jaxon Smith-Njigba. That 29-yard strike gave Seattle their first lead of the game. The Eagles got the ball with 28 seconds left by the Seahawks' defense coming up really big. Julian Love -- look at his second interception of the fourth quarter, somehow managing to keep both feet in bounds to seal the stunning 20-17 win and keeping Seattle's playoffs hopes alive as well.
