And so, it is kind of difficult to see the daylight, but as far as concerns like Trump's personal involvement in this plan, there really has not been that much.It's not like he had a say in crafting this plan. And this was solely kind of these people, this kind of offset of Trump allies that created this plan. And so, as far as Trump creating it, there is a lot of daylight, but he is trying to distance himself quite heavily because of some controversial things that have happened with this. But it would be Heritage Foundation president saying, currently America is in the midst of a second revolutionary war -- or I mean, some of these stances on abortion within this plan go contrary to Trump's stance on abortion. And so, there is some daylight there and they're trying to separate that. And also, the thing that I reported yesterday with my colleague was that what really kind of made the Trump campaign upset was that this group of people were going around kind of promising cabinet and sub-cabinet level positions to certain people that they \"had no business there\" or offering these too.

So, certainly, there are a lot of people who want a more moderate strain of politics from the candidate and from the president-elect Masoud Pezeshkian.

So, that could be an uphill battle. But one of the things that voters appear to have told Pezeshkian by voting him into office is that they want better relations with countries, especially in the Middle Eastern region, to try and get some of those very crippling sanctions lifted off Iran's economy.

Both of them were really -- had low approval ratings because of a recession, a very deep recession. The problem for President Biden right now is that he is the reason that his poll numbers are so low. It's concerned about his ability to govern. It's not because we've had -- we are in a deep economic recession, or there is an unpopular war, he is the issue. And polls like the one you just described, the CNN poll, that indicates that for some Democrats, changing the person at the top of the ticket could help the team, could help the party. If these polls continue in this direction, particularly internal polls, polling by the Democrats, you -- we will see increasing pressure on the president to change his mind. Now, he did not leave himself a dignified out last night. He made it clear that only, as he said, God Almighty could encourage him or persuade him to leave the race. Nevertheless, if the polls continue in the same direction, and if it becomes clear that Vice President Harris has a much better chance of defeating Donald Trump, then the president, there will be more pressure on him, mainly behind the scenes, but also publicly, to change his mind before everything is set at the July convention,",

And being thankful, because, look, this is a historic run of job creation. If we go to the June numbers, 206,000 jobs created. That's a little bit less than May, but still incredibly strong. Also important, though, is 4.1 percent unemployment rate. But in a way, that is good news, because it offers the Fed some room to maneuver here in being convinced that the job market and inflation either are not too hot, which gives them some wiggle room to lower interest rates. I want you to listen now to Fed chair Jerome Powell. This was before this jobs report came out. But I want you to listen to him and what he says about how important these jobs numbers are. Listen.

As plastic enters the marine environment, it breaks down over the course of time, and so, when small organisms eat that, it starts with the next level of fish, all the way up to the top of the food chain, with sharks. The most commonly found item across the world by scuba divers is plastic fishing line. And that can create a tearing effect, it can create abrasions, where it moves and starts to hurt sensitive marine organisms such as corals, and animals can find themselves entangled. Once the debris has been safely removed underwater, we sort it, we record it, and then we report it to our database. Over the past 10 years of recording data, we've actually moved more than 2.3 million pieces of marine debris around the world. When divers remove this, they are not only making the marine life underwater safer, governments can use that information to create new policies that might prevent the spread of marine debris, especially plastics, in their local community. As scuba divers, we are ocean optimists. We should not feel discouraged by the immensity of everything that's going on. But rather, we can take one small action at a time, and we can make a big difference. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
