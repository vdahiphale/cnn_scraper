      "sentences": "It is a big day in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris spends the whole day there. Donald Trump makes two stops. This is a state that Joe Biden won by 80,000 votes in 2020. It is a state where right now the margins super close in the polls. The latest CNN Poll of Polls shows things completely tied.Now, here is a guide to watching the election returns in Pennsylvania. As I said, Joe Biden won four years ago but by a slim margin, 81,000 votes. In 2016, Donald Trump won but by an even slimmer margin, 44,000 votes. So if it looks like -- more like the Biden election county-by- county, that's good for Kamala Harris. If it looks more like 2016 county-by-county, it's good for Donald Trump. What do I mean in terms of the counties they're going today? Let's look at Lackawanna County. This is where Scranton is, the birthplace of Joe Biden. You can see Biden won Lackawanna County by eight points. Hillary Clinton won by less than four points. Again, the Biden margins may bring you victory in the state, the Clinton margins mean a Trump victory. Second stop for Harris today, Lehigh County. This is where Allentown is. Large Hispanic population. How much do the racist jokes about Puerto Rico impact the vote here? You can see Biden won by a little bit less than eight points. Clinton won but it was less than five points. Again, the Biden margins are what the Harris campaign wants. Reading, which is Berks County. Now this is a county that Donald Trump won the last two elections, but you can see the margins here -- eight points in 2020. In 2016, he won by 10 points. It is the Biden margins that bring victory. Quickly, we'll look at Allegheny County. That's where Pittsburgh is. Biden won by 20 points. Clinton won, but it was closer -- less than 17 points. The Biden margins are what you want. Now, to caveats to watching these county-country returns in terms of understanding where things are going. One of them -- it's a big caveat -- it's Philadelphia. Obviously, the biggest county. The big urban center. Joe Biden cleaned up there. But this is a bit of an anomaly. Biden actually did worse -- look at that -- 81 to 17. He did worse than Hillary Clinton did in terms of percent. So we don't know what Philadelphia is going to bring, and it may be a bit of an anomaly. The other thing in terms of trying to gauge how the night is going based on the returns from these counties -- let me go back to Lehigh County. That's where Allentown is, a county that Joe Biden won. If Kamala Harris wins there it might mean she's in good shape by these margins. But the question is what time of night are you looking -- you're trying to get a sense of how things are going? The polls close in Pennsylvania at 9:00. You can see right when they closed Biden had a lead in the vote count in 2020, but by about 11:00 the vote count started going in DT's favor. He goes ahead in terms of the amount of votes that have been counted and stays ahead in this county all the way until Thursday afternoon. And that is when Joe Biden went back on top in Lehigh County and stayed on top. And it was Saturday that CNN called Pennsylvania for Joe Biden and ended up calling the entire presidential race for him. So yes, Lehigh County something of a bellwether but a late breaking perhaps bellwether. So it's something to keep in mind as you're trying to gauge these returns as they're coming in Tuesday into Wednesday, Kate -- maybe even beyond.",

JONES:  Well, I'm just nervous all the time, so I don't feel good about nothing and I'm not going to feel good about nothing until it's over. I'm worried. Philadelphia is where we've got to run up a big margin. And -- but Philly overall has been trending down not in terms of going toward the Republicans, just people not getting out to vote. And so you've got people out there like Pastor Carl Day who has got a bunch of young men with him knocking on doors and trying to get people to come out. It's a bigger, tougher fight in Philly to get that vote count up than it has been in the past. That has me worried. The other thing that has me worried is that the Jewish vote in the suburban areas. Biden won the Jewish vote by 70 percent -- 70 to 30 -- last time. Some polls show Kamala at 50-50. That is 70,000 votes we bled away. That is the margin for victory.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, we don't know much about how the next few days are going to play out in the election, but one thing that does seem like a slam dunk is another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The market is pricing in almost a 100 percent chance of an interest rate cut -- a quarter-point cut from the Fed on Thursday. Now, this would be good news, of course, for consumers and everyone who is struggling to pay off credit card debt or thinking about financing the purchase of a car.And this, of course, comes after the Fed delivered its first rate cut since COVID back in September, and they went big with a 50 basis point rate cut. You see how rates are finally starting to move a little bit lower, although they are massively higher than they were just a few years ago. Now, you might be wondering whether or not Friday's weak jobs report might cause the Fed to go big again this week. But economists don't think so and that's because it does look like that weakness from the jobs report was mostly driven by worker strikes and those back-to-back hurricanes. Goldman Sachs told clients over the weekend that they're betting that the Fed will cut by a quarter of a point this week, do it again in December, and they're penciling in four more interest rate cuts next year. Now, what's interesting though and very unusual, of course, is that the Fed has to make this decision this week and they may not know who the next president is going to be nor what economic policies he or she will be enacting. And that, of course, is very important because it's easy to see how the outcome of this election could affect what the Fed does going forward. Because, of course, there's a lot of concerns about former President Trump's campaign proposals and how they could be inflationary or very inflationary. But the Fed, just like the rest of us, are going to have to wait and see how this election plays out and who is on control of Congress as well -- Sara.",

We have that inflation rate spiking to a four-decade high of nine percent even though a lot of that was driven by COVID and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.And Vice President Harris -- she's had to play defense trying to defend the administration's track record. The problem, of course, is that even though the rate of inflation has come down sharply, prices are still going up. Americans are paying so much more than they were just a few years ago. And all of this has fueled a real sense of economic anxiety that has helped to boost former President Trump's numbers. And I think that if Trump ends up winning, we're going to look back at inflation as one of the forces that sent him back to the White House -- Sara.",

We think that by 8:00 most of Georgia's results could be reported because they're preprocessing the mail-in ballots there. One hiccup in North Carolina is that a law has changed how fast they can count some of the early in-person voting. That could delay things a little bit. But the Secretary of State's office there says that they should have 98 percent of the votes counted in North Carolina on election night. As you move later in the evening -- some of the polls that close a little bit later -- Pennsylvania comes next. They could take a while just like they did four years ago. You'll remember it took four days. That was the state when it was ultimately projected that put Biden over the -- over the -- over the hump to become president. This year they're still not preprocessing those mail-in ballots until Election Day, so it could take a very long time. Fewer people we expect will vote by mail in Pennsylvania than four years ago, but they will still literally be taking -- they can't take ballots out of envelopes until Election Day. And Wisconsin also has that rule. As you go further West, later in the evening Arizona could speed things up from four years ago because they're preprocessing the mail- in ballots. But it's not clear exactly how many ballots will be dumped -- dropped off on Election Day. That could slow things down. So we really just don't know but hopefully, faster than four years ago.",

Vice President Harris may bring some continuity from the Biden administration, focusing in on alliances and trying to control China's access to high tech. Regardless, China will likely have to confront the issue of tariffs as U.S. lawmakers demand a level playing field in the global marketplace.
