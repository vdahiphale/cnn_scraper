Good to have you with us.Cement block by cement block, the arduous task of digging through and clearing out crumbled buildings in Turkiye and Syria is now in its 11th day. The number of lives lost now over 42,000. But there are glimmers of hope. Here, a 17-year-old girl pulled out alive more than 10 days after the quake struck. Her brother, found in the same room, did not survive. In a bittersweet rescue in Syria this week, an 8-year-old girl that saved the rest of her immediate family perished. In Turkiye, NATO chief, Jens Stoltenberg, pledged the alliance's support. Stoltenberg will visit the city of Iskenderun, where NATO plans to build a container city for those made homeless. Well, 11 days into this disaster, search and rescue crews have become physically and emotionally exhausted. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins us from one of the hardest hit areas of Turkiye. Good to have you with us, Jomana. So some 8,000 rescue teams from 74 countries assisting the local Turkish crews there. It's still quite incredible to see survivors being pulled from the rubble.",

Just toset the scene of where we are here, we are in the city of Antakya in Hatay province, one of the hardest hit areas by the earthquake. In Turkiye, we've spent the past couple of days here and it has been a constant stream of body after body being pulled from the rubble of different buildings. I mean, right here where we are standing right now, there are authorities have been called in to collect more bodies that have been pulled out from the rubble of a building nearby. And this is not stopping the search and rescue operations. We also spent a long time at one site yesterday, where a woman and two children were pulled from the rubble after spending more than 220 hours buried underneath that building. They survived and they were pulled out of that building. We also met families there, Lynda, who were looking for their loved ones, who they believe were still alive inside that building, holding onto the hope that they are alive. And we watch those rescue workers working through the night. They did not stop, trying their best to see if they can rescue any more people. We also, this week, met a team of American search and rescue volunteers, who made it all the way out to Turkiye, because they felt they had to be here and they had to help out as well. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Deep in the heart of Turkiye's disaster zone, these Americans are on a mission like no other they've known.

I can tell you, people here really do appreciate this. When we were out with the U.S. volunteers, we saw people coming up to them, thanking, them bringing them food, coffee, tea. They really are grateful for all the support they are getting from people around the world, because they do have their search and rescue teams. They have their emergency services. They are working around the clock. But it is not enough. As you heard there from the U.S. rescuer, we spoke to, said, even if they had 1 million people here, it is not enough. And this is exactly what we've been hearing, from all the people we have been speaking to, who have been searching for their loved ones. Some people saying it took a long time for them to get professional search and rescue at this site, where their families have been buried under the rubble. Some people saying that, perhaps, if they had been there earlier, that their loved ones could have been saved.

The allegation is that there are thousands or hundreds of Ukrainian children who were taken or given to camps in occupied Crimea and Russia proper. And those children remain there, in many cases, separated from their parents. Now those camps, according to the report, have indoctrination and, in some cases, military training. The most serious allegation is that some children, in, fact have been put up for adoption to Russian parents, the ultimate Russification, I guess, of those children. We spent time with a mother, desperately trying to get her child back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCKENZIE (voice-over):  Weeks ago, we first met Tetyana Vlaiko in Kyiv, in a shelter for displaced families.

But Tetyana and Lilia's story begins a year ago. Their hometown of Kherson fell quickly to advancing Russian troops. Within days, the occupiers began a campaign to Russify the population, often coercing thousands of parents like Tetyana to send their kids to the camps.

I want you to look at these images from Moscow today, released by the Kremlin. This is Vladimir Putin meeting with a presidential commissioner on children's rights, as they call it. Now he, in that video, is praising them for getting children out of Donetsk and Luhansk to safety and, in fact, to be adopted by Russian parents. The Russians have a very different outlook on this story. They say the allegations are absurd and they are just trying to keep people safe. But that particular individual in the video, the U.S. and the E.U. says, is, in fact, in a way a ringleader in terms of getting children away from their parents or out of Ukraine and Russifying them.

One of the things I asked Lukashenko in this press conference, I said I have just been to Ukraine. I certainly haven't seen much in the way of progress on the part of Russian forces there. It seems as though they are making very little progress. A lot of Russian soldiers are dying on the front lines and a lot of Ukrainian civilians are being killed.

Why do you support Ukraine, pumping (ph) it with weapons instead of sitting down to negotiate, as I suggest?

A group of men can be seen waiting earnestly for their temporary new homes. They quickly unload the helicopter, struggling against the whirr of the blades, which never stop.",

This is one of the hardest-hit areas of the quake zone.GUPTA (voice-over):  Off in the distance, a floating hospital, a near necessity after natural disasters like this. After all, as with most other buildings, the hospitals often don't survive either. These hospital ships provide immediate beds and operating rooms like this one, where 37-year-old Mehmet (ph) received an operation on his leg after falling two stories during the earthquake. Even a maternity ward, yes. Tragically, more than 40,000 people have died but there has also been new life here:  a beautiful baby girl. Another benefit, the captain tells me, unlike the field hospitals on firm ground, these hospital ships in the water are relatively protected from the numerous aftershocks that continuously devastated the land. For now, the ground is quiet but the skies are loud and that is good as this part of the world slowly, surely, finds its footing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Workers and unions are taking to the streets to protest a pension reform plan thatwould see the retirement age raised by two years to 64. Melissa Bell is standing by at a protest in Paris. Good to have you with us. The fifth nationwide protest so far on this issue. What is the turnout there like today? Is it enough to sway the government?",

The Metro stations in Paris are open. It's not quite the strength of the strike we saw in January. But this doesn't mean it's over. The unions are planning -- private sector, public sector -- all of the unions coming together to make sure that the whole country grinds to a halt. That's because of the controversy surrounding this bill, Lynda, to raise, as you said, the retirement age from 62 to 64. The government is determined to get it through. Friday will be the last day of parliamentary debate. It's unclear whether it's going to get a majority on it. It hopes it will. If it doesn't, it has a couple of different parliamentary mechanisms by which it can push this measure through. The strength of the protest on the street, it's 70 percent of the French public, who are now opposed to the raising of their retirement age. Perhaps more telling and that is the number of people in the country who are in favor of the general stoppage. That's six out of 10 of the French asked, who said they were in favor of the country grinding to (INAUDIBLE). That means no child care, no trains. And it gives you an idea of the strength of discontent that is out there. That is also something that the polls have shown.",

Within that, the right that the Frenchbenefited from, it included a retirement age that was 60. In fact, the last time we had this level of protests and strikes and ongoing anger in the streets was back in 2010, when Nicolas Sarkozy managed to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62. What a battle that was. This time, the unions feel that they can smell blood. Emmanuel Macron came in as this reform president. This was going to be one of his flagship reforms, one of the main ones he's announced when he first became president. Now in his second term, he's determined to push that through by the summer. But because he is essentially choosing to pick this fight in such a frontal way with the unions, they themselves smell blood. They haven't been this unified since 2010. They are determined that, even if and when the bill gets through Parliament they will keep the pressure up on the streets to force the government back to the negotiation table. Emmanuel Macron said no way; we will push this through come hell or high water and so it is that battle of wills between the unions and the strength of protesting on the street and the momentum of the strikes that they can keep going over the coming months and Emmanuel Macron's determination to push this reform through.",
