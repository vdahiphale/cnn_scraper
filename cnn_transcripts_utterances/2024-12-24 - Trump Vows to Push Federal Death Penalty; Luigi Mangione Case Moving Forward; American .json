Certainly, that's going to be a question raised by the defense, that there were reportings of the president-elect making comments about the death penalty being imposed on the client. That has to be vetted to that jury. The jury has to make an acknowledgement that, one, they did hear the comments and it doesn't impact their thinking at all and they can still sit and be a fair and impartial juror in that trial. And, secondly, maybe they didn't listen. They didn't hear that comment at all. But, either way, that comment could have some impact in that jury selection. And you're going to have to impanel jurors that are fair and impartial. And so comments from the president-elect that may impact their thinking, that's something that absolutely has to be vetted.

You can take a look at a moment at the long lines that we were seeing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport you can see right there, but that outage on one of the busiest travel days of the year sparked delays at airports really across the country.

      "sentences": "Well, just got new information about the cause from American Airlines.It says it's all hands on deck now to get things back to normal. We now know this was an outage of a system that is key to American getting flights boarded and on their way pushed back from the gate. The carrier says it has about 3,900 flights scheduled for today. Good news for the half-million people traveling on the airline, no major cascading effects yet. Here is the latest data from airline analytics firm Cirium, about half of all American flights departing from American's Charlotte hub, one of the biggest, departing late, 20 percent departing late from Miami, another big American hub, but no cancellations to report yet. So the real story right now is delays. American spokesperson Sarah Jantz tells me it's to be expected throughout the day, but today's airline schedule a fraction of what it was yesterday. Most of the travel rush has already happened. And American insists to me it does have the staff in place to get things back on track pretty quickly here. This outage started about 7:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, flights held on the ground by American for about an hour. American just said for the first time that this was an issue with a vendor. That network hardware feeds into what's called American's flight operations system. Without that, flights can essentially not be dispatched. Want to read you now the new statement from American. It says: \"A vendor technology issue briefly affected flights this morning. That issue has been resolved and flights have resumed. We sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience this morning.\" History has shown, Danny, that these airline technology issues can have a huge impact. In July, the CrowdStrike outage caused a meltdown for American Airlines. It canceled about five -- or sorry -- Delta Air Lines -- scratch that -- caused about 5,000 Delta flights to be canceled in total. And remember back to two years ago, pretty much right at this moment, Southwest holiday meltdown was just starting. It canceled 15,000 flights over about a week's time. The Department of Transportation's really turned up the heat on keeping airlines accountable. And outgoing Secretary Pete Buttigieg says that that Delta investigation is still ongoing, though airlines are pretty hopeful that the new Trump administration may be more sympathetic to them when it comes to snags like we saw today. Still more information to come from American here, Danny.",

Ford Motor Company says it is pitching in a million dollars for the inauguration fund, also supplying a small fleet of vehicles to help with transportation.Ford, of course, isn't alone. We told you about tech companies, including Meta and Amazon, making million-dollar contributions. CNN's Fredreka Schouten joining us now with more. So, it's not unusual, it's important to note, for companies to contribute to inaugurations. What feels, I think, a little bit different this time around is just how vocal they seem to be about it, almost another example of maybe kissing the rain to curry favor.

But you do see this time around a lot of companies, CEOs making the trek down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Donald Trump. You see them announcing donations at a fast clip. I mean, earlier today, GM confirmed to me that they too were going to donate a million dollars to the inauguration and also working on getting a fleet of vehicles. I think people understand that the stakes are really high. Donald Trump has made no mistake -- has been very, very clear, rather, about his interest in changing the way things are done in Washington. For instance, he's talked a lot about getting rid of subsidies for electronic -- electric vehicles. Now customers get about $7,500 per E.V., and he wants to do away with that. And these companies have invested a lot of money in that. By the same token, he's talked about slapping tariffs on Mexico and Canada. That's going to affect automotive supply chains. But you're seeing not just companies. You're seeing individual billionaires saying that they're going to stand up and donate. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has talked about a personal donation of a million dollars., Ken Griffin of Citadel hedge fund is also donating a million dollars. And so we are going to see, I think, a lot of money coming into this inauguration. The last time he was sworn in, he raised a record at the time. It was $107 million, or just slightly below that, far more than Joe Biden raised when he was inaugurated. That was about $62 million, $63 million. And you saw big companies step up to help him. But I really think that people are very interested in having his ear. And one of the things that's striking to me this time as well is that, the more you donate, the more access you're going to get at the festivities. Folks are going to be able to attend candlelight dinners if they donate at a high enough level, go to receptions with Cabinet members. So it's a real opportunity to get in on the ground and make sure that Donald Trump knows who you are and make sure that he knows about your issues, Erica. HILL:  It's interesting. In many ways, it's an extension of the campaign, right, because we see what happens with big donors certainly after someone is elected and the types of access they gather, even perhaps appointments. And now we see it here with what is looking to be a bit of a big cash cow when it comes to inaugurations. They're not cheap, but a lot of money. Fredreka, I appreciate it. Thank you.",
