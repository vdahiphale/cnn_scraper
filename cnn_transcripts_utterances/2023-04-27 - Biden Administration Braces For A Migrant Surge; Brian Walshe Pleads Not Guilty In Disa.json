But with no food, no water, with the dangerous conditions, many Americans are being forced to make life-or-death decision among violent fighting between the country's rival military groups. Jim?",

That means border authorities will no longer be able to expel certain migrants based on health grounds. Two Homeland Security officials say the number of migrants has already begun to climb in recent weeks, reaching 7,000 encounters between migrants and law enforcement a day. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us now. Priscilla, listen, the administration has been preparing for this for some time. They got some help from the courts, extending Title 42. The first question is, no more extensions, I assume, and then, two, where do administration plans stand?",

We should note, with this ending is something that started in March of 2020. We go back to decades-old protocols. Those are protocols that we have been using for a long time. But what happens is we're using them at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the western hemisphere. And that's really the challenge that the administration is facing, in addition to smugglers who spread misinformation. Take a listen to what Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said just this morning on this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So that's a concern in the term when this expires on May 11th.Now what the administration is doing, a number of things. They're opening regional processing centers in Columbia so migrants can apply to come to the U.S. and come lawfully. They are also setting up capacity for those who cross to try to process them, setting up a new asylum rule to try to largely bar migrants who have transited through other countries from seeking asylum in the United States. Some of these measures, Jim, they're controversial, even among Biden's allies. But it's a measure they have to take to try to stem the flow of migration and manage a situation that Mayorkas described as going to be challenging. And of course, Jim, as we usually say, and as the administration says, it is Congress that ultimately have to pass reforms to solve this.",

A couple of tornadoes, but it's the wind and hail that we saw yesterday, not as much today. We are not in that kind of situation. But look at this hail. This is part of -- this is sitting in the passenger seat of a car. This is how large the hail was falling out of the sky yesterday. Even closing the school district, because there was so much damage to their schools, with the hail and the wind and the rain and the roof damage and window damage, as well. So here's where we are right now. Did have a tornado warning not that long ago for Panama City. That was a waterspout moving onshore. Now we're down to just a severe thunderstorm warning, not seeing the rotation. Here's where we are expecting to see more in the way of severe weather today. Not the ramp-up that we saw yesterday, but it will certainly be around. You need to pay attention today, keep the radio on. Pets, people, and property. You need to watch out for that. That's the real problem. That's the problem we see when people are not paying attention to what a hailstorm or what a wind event can do out there. Here's where the rain will be over the next couple of days here across the Deep South. We'll take the rain, but we certainly do not need this severe weather with this -- Boris?",
