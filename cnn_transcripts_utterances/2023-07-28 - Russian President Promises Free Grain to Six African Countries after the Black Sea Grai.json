I'm Paula Newton, ahead right here on \"CNN Newsroom.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin welcoming African leaders to St. Petersburg as war rages in Ukraine. We'll look at how he's trying to win their support while easing their fears over lost grain shipments. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to CNN in response to the protests surrounding his controversial judicial reform plan. We'll have a live report as well from Tel Aviv. And Former U.S. President Trump now facing more charges in connection with classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Details on that and the latest person targeted in that investigation. Day two of Russia's summit with African leaders is due to get underway at this hour in St. Petersburg. Now, President Vladimir Putin is trying to ease the concerns of countries losing out on grain shipments now that Moscow has pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine. Now, he's promising free Russian food supplies for six countries. Mr. Putin says Russia is still a reliable source of food to Africa and a key partner in what he calls a new multipolar world. Meantime, a number of African leaders say they want to discuss their plans for ending the war in Ukraine. Now, we're getting word, in fact, as well, of an alleged Ukrainian drone attack near the Russian capital. The Russian Defense Ministry says one drone was shot down in the Moscow region overnight without causing damage or casualties. CNN cannot independently confirm that report. Meantime, the Ukrainian counteroffensive is keeping up the momentum. After kicking into higher gear in recent days, a new video shows Ukrainian troops rolling into a village in the Donetsk region on Thursday after fighting for it for weeks. And for the very first time, a Ukrainian military vehicle was recorded along Russian anti-tank obstacles known as Dragon's Teeth. You will see it there. Now, the footage from southern Ukraine shows the vehicle. It is getting stuck in a ditch. You see it right there. But it does suggest that Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian forces behind this line of defense. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is standing by live for us in London with all of that, but we want to begin with our senior international correspondent David McKenzie, who is in Johannesburg for us. And David, you'll be able to bring us this perspective that we need, really, from what African countries are dealing with here. I mean, Russia has sustained much criticism for breaking that grain deal. And yet these African leaders are still looking for more from Putin. What would that be? DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Paula, what they're looking for is assurances, different countries within the African continent, that the access to grain is not hampered by inflationary price pressure because of Russia pulling out of that deal. Now, Vladimir Putin has put a positive spin on this. He says he will give a substantial amount of grain for free to at least six African countries. When the U.N. secretary-general was asked about that at the U.N. in New York, he said that you know, a handful of donations, as he put it, wouldn't counteract the dramatic impact of Russia pulling out of this deal. Now, this deal was between Russia, Ukraine, brokered by Turkey and others to get grain out of Ukraine safely and onto the world markets. Putin, at this big Africa summit in St. Petersburg, has criticized the West, as he often does, for hypocrisy. He says that the grain was largely going to enrich, in his words, European companies, not African companies, but the impact on the price of grain is certainly being felt across the African continent and those leaders at that summit will want to get assurances from Putin. And look at this image here. This is Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, with a very warm greeting of the Russian president arriving at that summit. Now the relationship between South Africa and Russia has been under a microscope since the beginning of the conflict. Many Western diplomats have accused South Africa of saying they are not aligned, but acting as if they are supporting Russia. We investigated whether it's money that's behind this policy initiative. [03:05:05] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCKENZIE (voice-over): South Africa's policy on paper is non-alignment on the Ukraine wall. But its actions have deeply angered Western powers, consistently refusing to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the U.N. General Assembly. In February, hosting naval war games with Russia and China on the anniversary of the start of the war, a powerful propaganda moment for Putin. And the U.S. ambassador publicly rebuked the government and ruling ANC, claiming there was intelligence showing weapons and ammunition loaded on a sanctioned cargo ship bound for Russia in December. It's now subject of a government inquiry. REUBEN E. BRIGETY II, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH AFRICA: It's the observable gap between the rhetoric and the reality of a government's professed policy of non-alignment and neutrality. MCKENZIE (voice-over): The question is why? We've traveled to the remote Kalahari. In this desert soil, a high- lucrative manganese belt used in making steel and the United Manganese of Kalahari mines or UMK. First revealed by non-profit investigators at Amabungani, UMK has deep financial ties to this man Victor Wechselberg, a Russian oligarch linked to Vladimir Putin and to South Africa. Here he is in 2006 in Cape Town, The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Wechselberg in 2018 and again in 2022 for supporting Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, Spanish authorities and the FBI seized his $90 million superyacht Tango. Despite the sanctions, Wechselberg still holds an important interest in UMK, according to business records held in Cyprus. Another significant player, holding company Chancellor House, for years channeling funds to the ruling African National Congress. According to publicly available declarations, since 2021, UMK and Chancellor House combined have contributed at least $2.9 million to the financially struggling ANC. (on-camera): This is a highly lucrative operation and anti-corruption activists say that these alleged linkages pose serious questions. Is South Africa's policy towards Russia on the world stage influenced by money? Is it possible that foreign policy also has a link to corruption or at the very least to a conflict of interest?",

And I think that could absolutely have an impact upon, you know, how South Africa takes positions on certain policies.MCKENZIE (voice-over): Substantial investment, preferential trade policies, and critical foreign aid from the U.S. and European Union are crucial to South Africa, the world's most unequal country, dwarfing Russia's contribution in both trade and aid. STEVEN GRUZD, RUSSIA-AFRICA ANALYST, SAIIA: I think South Africa is playing a dangerous game here, and indeed sometimes politicians are putting the political party, the ANC before the needs of the citizens, because it just doesn't make sense to be so closely associated with Russia when the stakes are so high and there's so much at risk.

      "sentences": "I think very modest gains, Paula, is the best way to describe that. So far, of course, we're several months into this counteroffensive that was much delayed, much anticipated, and so far no major victories. And by that I mean that we have not seen Ukrainian forces truly break through Russian defensive positions and that's the key here. That's the aim here.And why is that Paula? Well, there's a couple of complications challenges here, of course, that Ukrainian forces face. First of all is just the length of the front line I mean you are talking about hundreds of miles of battlefield that run from the north of the country down to the Bakhmut the Donetsk region all the way to the south Which is of course the focus for Ukrainian forces around the Zaporizhia region to stretch out Ukrainian troops across all of that, all of those many, many miles is, as you can imagine, an extreme strain on the country's resources. You also, of course, have to remember air support. Russian forces have air support backing them, and some Ukrainian forces are describing some of these battlefields as hell-like, saying that they are being struck first by Russian artillery and then backed by Russian air power, by Russian helicopters dropping explosives on them. And then the other thing you have to remember of course is just as Ukraine has been preparing for this offensive for months, so has Russia. Ukraine's defense minister recently admitting of course that they are behind schedule, but saying look, Russia has been digging in its defensive positions for a long time now. I know you brought up that video just before we spoke of the dragon's teeth. So these are Russian defensive positions to the south of Zaporizhzhya, where you see a Russian -- a Ukrainian tank, rather, there trying to break through. It gets stuck in a ditch. What is significant about that is it appears to show that Ukrainian forces have been able to reach those defensive lines, but clearly not crossing them, not breaking them. And that's just in one small location, again, all along that huge battlefield. Well, how does this play out? First of all, you're going to see Ukraine's strategy shift, not just from the immediate front lines, but to areas outside of the bounds of those front lines, if you will. Increased drone attacks on Moscow, increased covert attacks on Russian-occupied regions like Crimea or near Crimea. You're also going to see Ukraine try to take out Russian supply lines. So take the city of Tamak, which is, again, a logistical hub for Russia near Crimea, Ukrainian forces have been pummeling that position for some time now, trying again to drain, to weaken Russian defensive positions. But Russia's response to that is quite similar. Also, the Kremlin trying to take out areas outside of the bounds of the battlefield. I know we have those images to show you of President Zelenskyy just a couple of days ago, or just about a day ago, in Odessa surveying the damage from a Russian strike on Odessa there, that's a cathedral that was hit, and you're gonna continue to see those types of attacks, not just all along the front lines, but also outside the bounds of these front lines as these two fighting forces try to weaken each other.",

Salma Abdelaziz for us in London, thanks so much.To Israel now, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is downplaying the country's new judicial reform law. That's what he calls a minor correction to the balance of power. But thousands of Israelis, they don't see it that way. Mass demonstrations returned to Tel Aviv on Thursday, one day after a new law went into effect that sharply undermines the country's Supreme Court. And the Prime Minister is promising more reforms to come. The Supreme Court declined to block the new law from taking effect but said it will review it in September. Now despite the protest, Israel's prime minister is defending the judicial changes he's pushed through. Mr. Netanyahu spoke earlier with CNN's Wolf Blitzer and insisted the new rules will bring balance back to Israel's system of government. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It will be hugely significant. And yes, Netanyahu has won this battle, but he hasn't yet won the war. That, I suppose, will be decided by the Supreme Court. As for the people who are opposed to this, those protests will continue. We're expecting more mass protests tomorrow evening as well.But of course, what happens now? We've got this review coming up in September. As of now, this new basic law on reasonableness that prevents the Supreme Court blocking appointments or decisions by government on the grounds of reasonableness, that is now law. It is now one of Israel's quasi-constitutional basic laws. And in terms of the review, I suppose there are a couple of things that could happen. First of all, it could say, no, this law is perfectly fine. And then that would probably take a bit of the wind out of the sails of some of those protesters you see there on the streets. However, it could, of course, strike down this law. Now, that is something it's never done. The Supreme Court in Israel has never before struck down one of Israel's quasi-constitutional basic laws. So that would be very interesting to see. And Netanyahu, in that interview with Wolf Blitzer, did not directly answer the question as to whether his government would abide by a Supreme Court ruling that would strike down this new reasonableness bill. And as to Netanyahu's points comparing it with the United States, of course, in the U.S., President Biden's appointments, his Cabinet appointments and ambassadors, things like that, have to be approved by the Senate. As for constitutional amendments, an amendment in the U.S., an amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or of two-thirds of the states, request one by convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three- fourths of the state legislatures or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. Netanyahu has effectively made a constitutional amendment with a simple majority, 64 seats out of 120. So it's kind of comparing apples with oranges a bit. But for now, all eyes will be on September and what the Supreme Court does. And then if it does strike down that law, what this government's response will be. Paula?",

So, for example, to most people who weren't kind of on the inside or very keen Israeli political watchers, this reasonableness concept really came to the fore earlier this year, when Netanyahu tried to appoint as minister Aryeh Derry. He heads up the religious Shas Party, which mainly represents Israeli Jews of Middle Eastern origin.Now, Aryeh Derry has been convicted three times, most recently of tax fraud. Netanyahu wanted to make him a minister, but the Supreme Court said no, that wasn't reasonable. It said this was due to his backlog of criminal convictions and his failure to retire from public life as he said he would when being sentenced in the tax fraud case. So the most immediate possibility of an impact of this law, and Netanyahu was asked about this and alluded to this and suggested that he would do this perhaps, is to reappoint Aryeh Derry as a minister because the Supreme Court would right now not be able to say you can't do that on the grounds of reasonableness.

And then were also hearing this statement from the French foreign minister who said that this is not a complete coup yet. In fact, the ousted president Mohamed Bazoum has spoken to President Emmanuel Macron of France on the phone. He's reachable, he's in good health. That's what the French foreign minister is saying. There has been calls internationally from the U.N., from the African Union, from France, from lots of other international bodies, the economic community of West African states for his release and a return to that civilian rule.

But of course, concerns are still high. We are still seeing strong winds, and that could lead to another devastating set of fires across the southern region. But in Sicily which was deeply impacted earlier this week. Those fires have largely been contained. Those who were evacuated, thousands of them, have been told they can return home. And the alert level has been downgraded. But as you mentioned, there are still calls for a state of emergency to be put in place in numerous regions across southern Italy, many of these regions still putting in those requests that are still under consideration, according to the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni. But of course, this is a reflection of what is happening across the Mediterranean in Greece. We are still seeing firefighters battling blazes across the country on the island of Rhodes, though it is largely impacting uninhabited forest areas. Those fires continue to rage on and of course that is impacting many residents there and tourists as well. Meanwhile in Corfu, we know that this is largely controlled now at this stage, but we are learning about the devastating impact this has had on Rhodes.

Every day since July 3rd has been hotter than the records set in 2016. And almost every month this year has been in the top five, the hottest on record. Real warning signs there.

Really good to have you on the show. You know what seems pretty clear is that North Korea has a lot to gain from this alliance but I think what is really a more interesting question is what about Russia? I mean these pictures that we've been seeing are so notable but with everything going on in Ukraine you actually have Shoigu front and center in North Korea. Why? ANTHONY RINNA, SR. EDITOR, SINO-NK: Well, excuse me. I think the biggest reason why is because what we have to remember about Russia, especially from a geographical position, is it's a very -- it's a vastly expansive country. It spans 11 time zones and Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula, you know, despite the fact that they know themselves are so geographically disparate, they are on opposite ends of the Russian landmass. And these, both of these points from a geopolitical perspective, they actually represent or constitute weak points for Russia. Russia's influence in Ukraine has always been a lot stronger, obviously, than it has been over the Korean Peninsula. But if you take Russian geography as a whole, Russia has obviously felt sort of boxed in or felt that its geopolitical space has been encroached on by NATO for, you know, at least during the Cold War and then especially thereafter. Whereas with the Korean Peninsula, Russia and the Soviet Union before that had always felt that way, you know, ever since the 1950, 1953 conflict with the stationing of U.S. forces in Korea and Japan. So the way I see it personally is I feel that by trying to shore up ties with North Korea, Russia's actually trying to secure both ends of its periphery, its eastern end and its western end. The war in Ukraine, of course, being a, you know, most unfortunate result of Russia's perception of encroachment or its perception of vulnerability in that regard. But then, you know, the Korean peninsula I think is something that we also can't, you know, we can't neglect, especially given the fact that North Korea, for its own reasons, has been, has just been unabashed, absolutely 100 percent supportive of Russia's full-scale invasion.",

But now both will have an anxious wait.New Zealand lost to the Philippines on Tuesday, and now the Aussies have lost to Nigeria, a stunning upset in Brisbane on Thursday. Australia have been struggling with injuries, Sam Kerr and others out for this game, but you still would have fancied them to see off one of the weaker teams in the world rankings. Emily van Egman putting the Matildas ahead in the first half injury time and they would have expected to carry that lead into the halftime team talk but they say you are at your most vulnerable when you've just scored and so it proved Nigeria equalized through Uchenna Kanu in the sixth minute of stoppage time and the Super Falcons kept it going after the break. Osinachi Ohale tracking the ball to throw her head at it for a 2-1 lead that was a brave header and the Aussies are reeling. The nine-time African champions had brought Barcelona's Asisat Oshoala off the bench just before that goal. She scored Nigeria's third of the night from a tight angle. Australia scored a late consolation, but they couldn't find an equalizer leaving Nigeria to celebrate a momentous win. The Super Falcons are now top of Group B.",

And everyone and the world has seen that today. Nigeria for love! Let (EXPLETIVE) go!",
