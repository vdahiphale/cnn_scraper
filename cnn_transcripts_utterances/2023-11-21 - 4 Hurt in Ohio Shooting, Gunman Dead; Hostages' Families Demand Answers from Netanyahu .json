But as one Israeli official cautioned me, you can still be 99 percent of the way there but then you're still 1 percent away from it happening. And it can all fall apart in that 1 percent as they try to hammer out the final details. Whether that's the number of hostages released, how they're released, how quickly they're released, how long of a pause in fighting in order to release a certain number of hostages. These are the details where we understand this keeps getting tied up and effectively not getting over the finish line. As we saw, a number of the families of the hostages met for the first time with the war cabinet at the defense ministry behind me here in Tel Aviv. They waited for hours for that meeting. It lasted several hours on its own. We spoke with one of the family members there. And he left early because he said there was no new information. And although it was certainly good to have a meeting, there was quite a bit of anger on the part of the families when they pressed the government, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on whether the release of the hostages was No. 1; and the answer they received was, it's not No. 1. It's at the same level of defeating Hamas. That's clearly not the answer they want. They want to hear that the government is doing and the war cabinet is doing whatever it can to make sure the main priority, the only priority is bringing home their loved ones.",

But then to apply it, in part, in this war -- and it's not to say, by the way -- I'm not trying to diminish the ugliness of war. You have numerous wars around the world. The war in Syria, for example, which killed almost half a billion people was not dubbed genocide. And so, genocide is a legal term.

And so I think, you know, they realize that they have been dealt a very difficult political hand here.This is an easier issue for Republicans, where you have voters who are basically broadly aligned within the coalition. But so it sort of makes sense to take the perspective that she has there. If they -- if they can't do anything here that -- that is going to please the broad political coalition, they might as well do what they think is the correct course.

But I mean, again, I think you know, the U.S. has limited ability to create the sort of situation on the ground that it wants there.I mean, you know, if Israel was truly a client state of the United States, there would not have been Netanyahu governments through the Obama administration. We didn't want Israel pursuing a set of various policies that it had there. And to the extent that Biden leans on Israel, the Israelis know that there will be an Republican administration sooner or later that will be reliably supportive of whatever it is that they want to do. And that reduces the extent to which they feel the need to move because the U.S. president says they need to. If there were a broad shift in U.S. politics that was bipartisan, it would be possible to put somewhat more pressure on Israel. But again, you know, this is -- this is not domestic politics. I feel like people sort of weirdly talk about this like we get to make the decisions here, and ultimately, this is a foreign war thousands of miles away, involving other -- involving other parties.",
