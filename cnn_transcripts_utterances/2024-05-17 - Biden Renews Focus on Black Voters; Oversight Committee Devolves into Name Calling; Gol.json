Sort of the drop-off, right?Look, you look at 2024, Biden still leads among black voters over Donald Trump's 69 percent in an average of polls. But look at this number for Donald Trump, 22 percent. Where was Donald Trump at this point four years ago in the polls? He was just 9 percent of the votes. So, he's seen more than a doubling in his support among African Americans. This margin, which was in the 70s just four years ago, look at where it is now, 69 minus 22. That puts it in the 40s. My goodness, gracious. If this held through the general election, and obviously we're still months away, this would be by far the best performance for a Republican candidate among black voters in a generation, two generations, probably since 1960 and Richard Nixon against John F. Kennedy. That's how long we're really talking about when we're looking at this margin here. This could be a truly historic margin. It's quite a troubling sign for the Biden campaigns, Sara.",

If you look among black voters age 50 and over, you see that Joe Biden has a very substantial lead here. Look at this, 82 percent to 8 percent. This lead is still in the 70s. This looks a lot like what we saw in the overall polling back in 2020. But look at voters under the age of 50. Look here. Donald Trump is pulling 25 percent of that vote. Joe Biden is at just 62 percent of this. This leads, Sara, this lead is just - is south of 40 percentage points. This is historic. This is what a lot of folks been talking about, that Joe Biden has a specific problem among younger black voters. And that is exactly what's showing up right here. And this is, I think a lot of the reason why you're going to see Biden focusing more on black voters, why you're seeing Jim Clyburn go out there. Don't be surprised if they go to more colleges. Because the fact of the matter is, older black voters still really much like Joe Biden. It's these younger black voters who very much are turning on him and being much more supportive of Donald Trump than they were four years ago.",

The sport in which I cover, the NFL, for years, the last decade or so, is very clear about what you can and can't say. There's always push back if you say something that they do not agree with. And while I know they feel as if they're distancing themselves, Harrison received what I call a slap on the wrist. They said it was in his private time. And so, for me, I'm really confused. And that is sarcasm. Help me understand how, and I'll just go there and say it, how Colin Kaepernick can't speak freely on his own time but Harrison can.And while he cloaked this entire speech with Catholicism and his love of Jesus, it felt very much like a construct that he said, most women had to abide by. And yet he started to attack the DEI. He leaned in on pride. I didn't understand the message of love and still criticizing and - but yet it's still OK. There are people saying what he said is not controversial at all. And I just disagree with that wholeheartedly. It's an insult.",

That is what you can do here in America. But he said this in front of men and women graduating after four hard years to try and ostensibly have a career. Do you think that he was trying to shame those, because he seemed to be talking directly to the women in the audience?",
