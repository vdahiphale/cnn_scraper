Sure.But above normal, where we are, where we should be at this time of year, temperatures are now for 82 percent of the population going to be above 90 for the next couple of days and, for many of you in the Northeast, for the next week. This will be the coldest day. If you think this is hot, this is the coolest day really for the next seven. Advisories are already here. Remember, heat is the biggest killer for U.S. fatalities from all the other things and really almost all the other things combined. So, temperatures will be warming up as we work into Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Everything needs more water. You need more water. The kids need more. The pets need more water outside, also the plants. My cilantro and my lettuce have just already said, call me in the fall, I'm done. We're not going to even grow in this stuff. This is how hot it's going to be for most of the country. New York City, you're going to be 92. But that's on Long Island and Manhattan. If you get a little bit farther to the West into New Jersey, that's going to be 98. St. Louis, you're already there, 98 with humidity. So it's going to feel like 105 degrees in some of these places. Yes, the heat is here. It's here for the next few days. But with that heat, the threat, as you talked about, the potential for even some tropical moisture, probably not a big spinning storm just yet. But, for you, Texas, there could be five to 10 inches of rainfall in places that have already seen a lot of rainfall this year south of San Antonio all the way down toward Houston. So, yes, we do have those advisories already in effect there for -- waiting for the rain to come. And we will see what happens in the Atlantic too because there is a little storm that could sneak into the Carolinas by the end of the week, likely not going to get a name, but it's too early to tell, Brianna.",

Every single vote he has to get across the finish line honestly tests his ability to remain the speaker. And we saw that just a couple of weeks ago. After he passed that package to provide billions in additional funding for Ukraine, his speakership was challenged by Marjorie Taylor Greene. A closeness to former President Trump is an important dynamic that he has to keep up in order to keep his own power on Capitol Hill. Obviously, the other dynamic at play here is that Donald Trump, whether or not he wins in November, if he wins, a big part of whether or not he's an effective president will be whether or not House Republicans maintain the majority in the House, whether or not the Senate Republicans can take back the majority in that chamber. That is part of the strategy session here, making sure everyone is on the same page, making sure that they have a winning and unifying message going into November, because, if former President Donald Trump wins the White House, but then Democrats take back the House and perhaps keep the Senate, that puts him in a position where a lot of his legislative goals just cannot happen -- Boris.",

We know that that intense fighting is ongoing between the Israeli military and Hamas. We heard from the Gaza media office, saying that they see no pause whatsoever, no tactical pause. They call it -- quote -- \"Israeli lies.\" But up until this point, humanitarian aid groups we have spoken to say they haven't seen a positive difference. They will always welcome any effort to try and get more aid in, but they haven't actually seen things change on the ground. And we have heard from the U.N.

There is still significant support certainly for the war that is ongoing at this point and Israel's stated goal of destroying Hamas. So, at this point I think what we're hearing from officials within the prime minister's office is that -- or from experts, I should say, is, this potentially stops the far right element of Netanyahu's coalition from taking up the gap, the vacuum that Benny Gantz left when he resigned within that war cabinet. So, by disbanding that war cabinet, Netanyahu doesn't have to agree or reject the far right's push to be part of the key military decisions on strategy in Gaza, something which, for example, the Biden administration would not support -- Boris.",

From, I think, their perspective, they're going to see a lot more direct confrontation, for example, that's going to come from Tel Aviv, come from the politicians when it comes to the situation on the ground. And perhaps they will get a little more clarity. We saw, for example, the other day that Netanyahu was not happy about this tactical pause that's taking place on the ground. So I think, from the Israeli soldier's perspective, they're just focused on the day-to-day right now. They're going to look to see who else he's getting this guidance from.

You go up to the north, it becomes more of an indirect fire war, where Hezbollah has the capability to fire rockets, air defense capability that they have in order to take down Israeli planes. I think -- I think, in some ways, the Iranians are dictating that situation. They're telling Hezbollah to roll it somewhat slow as they continue to develop their nuclear capability, as well as tactical capability, to potentially play the long game, so to speak.

Again, looking through the eyes of that soldier, they don't want that to happen. They want to be able to continue these military operations. If they withdraw 20,000 troops from Gaza, for example, it'd be very difficult to put them back six, eight months from now if they had to do that. So I don't think they want to -- quote -- \"mow right lawn\" this time. They're not stopping until they get a surrender from Hamas.

So I believe that's what they're going to have to do, get more help from, let's say, foreign services to capture some Hamas leaders that are not inside of Gaza as well. But they need to get some kind of tactical victory that they could show the world that it's moving forward and put some leverage on Hamas. Until they get that, I think Hamas has got tremendous longevity. For example, they haven't accepted peace deals in the past anyway. They're not going to all of a sudden accept this one right now.",
