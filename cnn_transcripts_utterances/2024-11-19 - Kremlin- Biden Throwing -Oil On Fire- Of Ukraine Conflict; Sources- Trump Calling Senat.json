We begin with breaking news out of Hong Kong where 45 pro- democracy figures have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years on subversion charges. It's a major blow to the city's political freedom since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security crackdown four years ago. Among those sentenced include legal scholar Benny Tai, who received the longest prison term of 10 years, and former student leader Joshua Wong, who will be jailed for over four and a half years. More than 300 people queued in the rain outside the court Tuesday morning to show their support for the defendants.Police maintained a massive presence there. CNN's Ivan Watson is following the developments for us and joins us now live from Hong Kong. Good to have you with us, Ivan. So 45 pro-democracy protesters ranging from journalists to lawmakers, part of this mass sentencing today. And some of these people were prosecuted back in 2021, many already having served some years, right?",

      "sentences": "That's right. The bulk of these defendants were detained back in a mass police raid in January of 2021 and have been behind bars since then going through the trial process, awaiting trial. And now today in this sentencing and all of them receiving prison time ranging from about four years to 10 years. The longest sentence we believe was handed down to Benny Tai, who the panel of three carefully selected judges appointed by the Hong Kong authorities. There was no jury in this trial.He received 10 years and was accused of being a mastermind in, quote, \"a conspiracy to commit subversion.\" That is what these people were convicted of. Now, the bulk of the so called Hong Kong 47, they pleaded guilty to the crime in hopes of reducing their sentences. There were 16 initially who pleaded not guilty. Two of those defendants were acquitted back in May, though the government is trying to appeal one of those acquittals. The remaining 14 also received jail sentences. As you pointed out, Joshua Wong, who was kind of a poster child, this youthful protest leader who has been a thorn in the authorities side really for years, he received more than four years in prison. And while leaving the courtroom was chanting I love Hong Kong as he was taken out of the courtroom. And as you pointed out, these were all defendants who had pretty much participated back in July of 2020 in an unofficial opposition primary election, running up onto what was supposed to be a citywide election for the city legislature and that primary is what the authorities here accused them of being, basically a scheme to try to subvert the city's authority. The critics of this, which now include the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong, they would argue that conducting a primary election is a normal activity in most democracies around the world. But the Hong Kong government and the law enforcement authorities here, and of course the Chinese government in Beijing, strongly disagree with that view. Lynda.",

And then finally, why give this permission with apparent restrictions that the Ukrainians are apparently only allowed to fire within the Kursk region where it was just reported that those 10,000 Russian troops are and thousand or so North Korean troops.

Now, it also may sound familiar, of course, Donald Trump in his first term used a national emergency declaration to unlock Pentagon funds for his border wall. Now, that faced numerous lawsuits, and it's possible that they may happen again. But sources tell me that this time a national emergency declaration would be used to use and shore up Pentagon resources and military assets again for detention spaces and also to follow through on those deportations.What they say is that this would not be to bring U.S. Military to arrest immigrants in the United States. Now, all of this, of course, is because they are trying to build deportation up to scale. And that also includes, according to sources, regional capability and looking at where they can expand detention facilities already in the United States. Now, in addition to all of this, sources say that other plans are underway that includes executive actions like bringing back remain in Mexico, revising asylum restrictions or, for example, making more immigrants eligible for removal.

So, it does raise questions. And for their part, Kensington and Buckingham Palace both say they don't comment on security matters. FOSTER (voice-over): The break-in, just days before King Charles and Queen Camilla's long flight to visit Australia and Samoa. The couple weren't at Windsor when the break-in took place. Incidents like this aren't new, and this one certainly not the most serious. In 2021, a man broke into Windsor Castle itself, wearing a mask and armed with this weapon, a crossbow.
