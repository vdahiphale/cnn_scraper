The war cabinet -- meeting for a second day to try to agree on aplan this is world leaders scramble to try to keep the conflict from turning into all-out war and emergencies Security Council session U.N. Security General Antonio Guterres urged Israel to exercise maximum restraint. Israel is weighing its next step after Iran attacked with hundreds of drones and missiles late on Saturday. The Israeli military says almost all of them were intercepted. Iran says the attack was a quote legitimate response after a deadly strike on its consulate in Syria, Tehran blames that on Israel. And also -- now telling CNN that Israel is delaying the first steps of its ground operation in the Southern Gaza City of Rafah meanwhile, while it considers how to respond to Iran -- Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward is live from Tel Aviv. And there are those around the region including the Jordanian Foreign Minister, who I spoke to earlier, who believe that Benjamin Netanyahu is to a degree and using this Iranian strike to distract from what is they say, ultimately, the most important issue here and that is finding a resolution in Gaza. Look, Clarissa, the U.S. President has conceded that this is a sovereign decision making process that the Israelis have now, deciding how they will respond. But they are being urged not least by Joe Biden, to exercise restraint. What are we hearing from our sources on the ground about what is likely to happen next?",

So that is absolutely a primary consideration. At the same time, Hezbollah has a lot of weaponry, including some weapons that it has not yet used in this conflict. And so I think there'll be balancing out the considerations of trying to hit an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah hard with, again, the voices and caution being urged of so many on the international stage. That one does not want to see this conflict escalate to a place where it really is no longer in the control of anyone in terms of where it goes. So I think they're also balancing out that this is a moment where Israel is enjoying that newfound relative goodwill, where the world's attention has been deflected away from Gaza, where the world's attention is really focused on Israel versus Iran, the international community versus Iran, how to respond to that.

That is why President Biden took time over the weekend to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone in the hours after this attack unfolded. And in that conversation, officials say that the president told Netanyahu that he should view the fact that they intercepted hundreds of drones and missiles with the assistance of the U.S. and other allies as a success. But the president in that phone call also said that going forward the U.S. would not participate in any counter strikes or offensive operation against Iran. That is critical at a time when the president is trying to prevent this from spreading into a wider conflict. Now, a U.S. official senior administration official said that Israel had made clear to the U.S. that they did not want to have a significant escalation between Israel and Iran. But the question is whether Netanyahu will heed any of President Biden's advice. One senior administration official said that in their phone call, the president told Netanyahu to think through what those next steps will be. Officials here at the White House have been stressing that any decision will be up to the Israeli war cabinet, as you've talked about, they're still meeting assessing what the next steps will be. But as the White House spokesperson, John Kirby said this morning, they're reviewing this initial operation to prevent any significant damage by the Iranians that this attack is a success. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, SPOKESMAN OF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: President believes that what happened Saturday night was an extraordinary military success, and that it proved Israel is not alone. And it proved that Israel has a military superiority can be proud of and that they ought to think about what that success is the message that that sends to Iran into the region itself. He's also been very clear, Kate, that we don't want a war with Iran. We don't seek to widen and broaden this conflict. We don't want to see things escalate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, the U.S. Secret Service put outa statement saying that they're not going to seek any special accommodations outside what would be normally required for the safety of the former president. But we have to put that in the context of Donald Trump in a couple of ways. First, as the most recent president, he has a lot of carryover threats from his time in office. And I think that goes into the threat calculus that both the Secret Service and the NYPD are putting towards the protective measures. Remember, Former Ambassador Bolton and O'Brien, have specific security measures that are around them, because of the Iranian threat that also applies to the former president. Second, as a presidential candidate, a president, a Former President Trump has a very loyal and dedicated base that will animate around him. You know, throughout the eight weeks of this trial, regardless of any circumstances, law enforcement is mindful of his supporters, and are worried about any type of clashes that could occur for those who may be protesting against them. And then final point, specific to New York, there are a lot of pro-Palestinian protests that are ongoing. Those protest groups are continuously trying to seek notable events such as this trial, to disrupt, to amplify their message. So as a former secret service agent over the course of the next eight weeks, here's what concerns me the time for eight weeks that we're going to have a protect -- that you're going to know where he starts his day, where he's going to spend a majority of his day and where he ends his day. That puts a very difficult strain on law enforcement, both the Secret Service and the NYPD to put forth a robust security plan that's constantly evolving, never complacent, because you know, right now, it is a challenge, but they're not taking anything to chance, as you can see from the images that we saw with the security plan that's been stood up.",

There are special hubs, obviously that have been activated for the security for these next eight weeks or so. There's a lot happening though, around the courthouse as well. It's not just about protecting the former president getting him safely from A to B, getting the jurors safely from A to B, it's all the activity, as you noted, in terms of protests and demonstrations, which also impacts people getting to their daily lives here in New York City.",

But their primary remit is to maintain civil order across New York City, all of the five boroughs, not only just this matter, so while we see a lot of resources that are being put towards this trial over the course of the next eight weeks from federal and state in city law enforcement, there is other priorities that they have to focus on. So you know, this is a taxing security program that again, as I said, will constantly evolve what you see today may not be what you see in eight weeks.

But now the question is how big should this response be? Will it potentially lead to a further escalation of this conflict between Israel and Iran? Or will it be a more measured response that aims to avoid further escalation? There's also the question of timing. And on that front, I'm told that Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, who also happens to be Netanyahu's chief political rival. He has been calling for a swifter response than what we have seen so far. The Israeli Prime Minister, in contrast, has been pumping the brakes so far on making a decision. And of course, on all of this, there are international pressures with multiple countries pressuring Israel to not deliver a forceful response to Iran to avoid further inflaming tensions in the region. And then, of course, there are political considerations as well, with the Israeli Prime Minister coming under pressure from his right flank to deliver a firm and kind of heavy military response to Iran. So all of this remains to be seen, it's unclear exactly when the war cabinet will make a decision. But at this hour that war cabinet meeting, the second in two days is still ongoing.",

And the Israeli military was actually set to begin dropping leaflets on Rafah today, I'm told in order to urge civilians to begin evacuating north in anticipation of a major ground offensive in Rafah, effectively the first stages of that ground defensive, but amid this Iranian attack, and as Israel considers its next steps, in response to that attack. I'm told that those evacuation notices are not being dropped today that plan has been delayed, and that it's not clear at this point when that evacuation order for Rafah and that subsequent ground offensive will actually take place.

Donald Trump is charged with 34 felony counts accused of falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Prosecutors say that the point of that they believe was influencing the 2016 election. The former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has pleaded not guilty. He lashed out on social media earlier this morning saying in part I want my voice back. This crooked judge has gagged me, unconstitutional.

They're immediately going to be you know, relieved of their duties, then what happens after that is they're going to be given 42 questions pertaining to this trial. Now, some of those questions include whether or not they attended a Trump rally, for example, where do they get their news? Are they affiliated with a fringe group like QAnon or the proud boys?

      "sentences": "Yeah -- I think there are a lot of facts out there they come to a different conclusion. I mean most of thepolling that we have seen over time when voters are confronted with the fact that how would they vote if Donald Trump was convicted of a criminal case? Sure that, you know, there's massive movement among Republican voters, independent voters, and it moves into a reading almost every poll and -- voters are confronted with that fact. So I do think these trials have the potential to seriously damage Trump. I will also say that on this point, that you know, he's a master showman. I agree with that. But what it's going to be forced into is a dialogue and the race is going to be shaped around, many of the things that voters don't like about Donald Trump. I think he's often his own worst enemy. And if he doesn't control himself and behave himself in the courtroom, I think this Trump has potential seriously damaging.",

I do want to just bring up here the polling question that was asked if Donald Trump was convicted 58percent of likely voters said it wouldn't matter. 29 percent said they'd be less likely to vote for him. 11 percent said they would be more likely to vote for him. Some other interesting polling that's come out in just the last couple of days is his latest New York Times polling and which shows a split race at this point. 46 percent for Donald Trump, 45 percent for Joe Biden, that is well within the margin of error, of course, to put this at a split race. How much do you think this change in polling because back in February, that same poll, late February, I believe, showed Donald Trump with a 5 point lead? Shermichael, how much do you think this new polling showing the race tightening is also impacting Donald Trump this morning?",

What are voters in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada, maybe even Pennsylvania if you want to throw that one in? What are those voters thinking? Because I think those are the states that the former president needs to win, Pennsylvania, he needs to perform competitively. And he saw that Quinnipiac poll where 58 percent of voters are saying, look, this doesn't really matter. And I'm not surprised by that, because I think most people already assumed Trump was either guilty or not guilty. I don't think you're going to find a whole host of people in the middle on this, Erica. And then once you throw in those sort of third party candidates, and some of those battleground states, you start looking at the math, and then you do see a path for the former president even if he's found guilty.",

This is aregion on tender hooks after Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel. You're looking at video that has emerged on Telegram purporting to show drones being launched from Iran as part of that attack. Israel says nearly all were intercepted but it has vowed to quote exact a price in return. Well, sources tell us that there has been heated debate inside the Israeli war cabinet over the size and scope of any response and the global community urging restraint hoping a line can be drawn under this flaring violence. The UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting just minutes from now. And we will of course be monitoring that UN crisis meeting for you at the top of the hour. Now let's take the temperature in one part of this region, a very important part a part that is already a flashpoint that is the Northern front of Israel as it is known Southern Lebanon. Ben Wedeman is live for us in Beirut. Ben, Iran insists its attack on Israel was legitimate. Israel, its war cabinet now pondering its decision arguing about its decision it seems. What is the prevailing view from around the Middle East about what might happen next?",

Nowthis was the real worry not it was sort of taken as granted and that after the April 1st Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, that Iran would respond. And it was clear from for instance, we heard from the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah that Iran would respond directly to the attack. And that's what it did. The question that has always been, what next? If Israel retaliates, then you could get into a cycle of strike and counter strike that has a real danger of escalating. And that's where the worry lies, is that you have a place like Lebanon, which is always on the brink when it comes to Israel since the beginning of the war in Gaza. We heard from a source close to Hezbollah that Hezbollah would stand back, have Iran do the response to the strike on the consulate in Damascus. But if it escalates after that, he warned then Hezbollah and the other militias and proxies affiliated with Iran could become directly involved, and would be compelled, in a sense because of their ties with Tehran to escalate the conflict, which would therefore open the door to a regional war. And so the fear is what is the next step? So everybody's very closely watching the second meeting of the Israeli war cabinet in less than 24 hours to find out what the decision is. Certainly the hopes is that the United States after President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu the other night, that Israel will be restrained and not take the path toward escalation Becky.",

But what we've seen as time has gone on the Israelis are striking deeper and deeper inside Lebanon. For instance, on Sunday, they struck in a town called Nabi Chit (ph) which is well away from the border with the Lebanese Syrian border. And the Israelis are always holding out the possibility that they will go further, they have made it clear. They want all Hezbollah fighters south of the Litani River to go north of it, but we're not seeing any indication from Hezbollah that they're willing to do that. And we've heard from well informed sources that the Israelis have made it clear if that doesn't happen soon they will enter South Lebanon in force, Becky.",
