Hillsborough is blessed with a great sheriff, somebody that's out there. He's working 24 hours a day trying to save people's lives. The most important thing we can do is save people's lives. So I'm here to make sure the federal resources are here. I spoke to the president yesterday. Talked about the fact that we need to make sure FEMA is fully funded, the SBA is fully funded, Department of Agriculture, HUD, all of them are funded, and they're a partner. It takes you as an individual. Takes local and state and federal to work together. So I'm here to make sure that we're going to do that. And I know the sheriff is going to do everything he can to keep everybody alive. But it takes you. Don't drive in standing water. Don't touch a downed power line. These people are -- they're touching these downed power lines. And we have heard stories of people cutting -- cutting power lines. I mean, that's -- I mean, it's crazy. Don't use a generator inside your house. Don't use a chain saw if you don't know how to use it. You got to keep yourself safe.

Kayla, what are we expecting to hear from the president and the vice president? Clearly, the president has been busy burning up the phone lines to lawmakers. KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Brianna, nearly every day, the president and the vice president have been briefed by their senior-most administration officials on the scope of the damage from Helene and now Milton and also the scale of relief efforts that will be needed and have already been deployed. Based on my conversations with some senior administration officials, here's some of the numbers to put behind some of those programs that Senator Scott was just saying will be needed to be re-upped. That Small Business Administration loan program that provides homeowners and businesses alike between $100,000 and $2 million to rebuild destroyed or damaged property and also replace things like cars, that program needs $1.6 billion, I'm told, and has already run out. And then there is rental assistance. It's provided through the Department of Housing and Urban Development for people who have been displaced from their homes and are expected to be for quite some time. I'm told that program needs roughly $5 billion. And then there is the Department of Agriculture. You just heard Senator Scott talking about those block grants. I'm told that the programs for food support for both the crops that have been destroyed, as well as the grocery distribution that's been upended, that that program needs somewhere in the ballpark of $10 billion. So there's quite a growing need for various programs, even beyond FEMA and the Department of Defense, which have been the tip of the spear for these recovery efforts. But that's why there's been some confusion, because you have the administration saying that FEMA and the Pentagon are OK for now, they can meet immediate needs, even as you have President Biden saying that Congress needs to come back and do something soon -- guys.",

Let's discuss the latest on Milton recovery with Craig Fugate. He's a former FEMA administrator who led the disaster relief agency for eight years under President Obama. He now runs Craig Fugate Consulting. Craig, thanks so much for being with us. Obviously, the Hillsborough County sheriff is urging residents to evacuate because floodwaters continue moving downstream. There's one river that's expected to crest above 25 feet.

And, again, this is a short-term chronic problem as people are trying to get back in. I expect that to begin improving over the next couple of days. But this is not unusual. We see this. This is something that, as much as you plan for until the storm hits and you know what you have had, it's -- you just can't get that get back in fast enough, given what people are trying to do.",

So a lot of this money that they're spending is actually going to be spent by the -- by either the Army Corps of Engineers or other contractors over the next several weeks.So they just got all that in place quickly to get that going. I'm more concerned, as you heard about, Small Business Administration, because that's a key part of the initial recovery. Florida does have a program called Operation Bootstrap, where they provide loans to begin that process for businesses to recover. But it's going to be really critical that SBA get funded, because, IT says small business, but it's also going to be a lot of the funding that homeowners could get to do repairs and rebuild, particularly those that don't have flood insurance or were underinsured then the storm hit.",

So I believe this is one of those instances where he just ended up speaking. But just to kind of reiterate what he's doing there, same thing that he's doing here, which is this fear-based messaging, whether it's on the economy, whether it's on immigration. And when you talk to people close to him, they point to recent poll numbers that show that this race with Kamala Harris is neck-and-neck. That indicates from these advisers that he's not going to change his messaging any time soon, that this is resonating with some voters out there. So despite the pushback that we have heard from the local officials in Aurora, from the local officials in Detroit, from local officials in Springfield, Ohio, there is no indication that Donald Trump is going to stop putting out this kind of misinformation, because voters are showing up in these polls And it shows the race is close and they believe that could help propel Donald Trump to the right White House in November.",
