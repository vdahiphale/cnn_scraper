According to local reports, dozens were arrested. Tens of thousands have gathered in Chicago to protest the Biden administration's support for Israel and the war in Gaza. CNN's Ryan Young has the latest from outside the Israeli consulate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So a lot of back and forth tonight with protesters and police. I want to give you the scene, though. You can see the officers who are stacked here ready in their riot gear, their helmets. They're on the right. Now, that's where protesters have been most of the night. They move them back this direction. Now, you can also see on the other side of the street, there's another group of officers who've all lined this street right here. They've created this barrier so that the protesters could not leave this boxed in intersection. The building they were all protesting is right over here. If you walk this way, you can see this building right here, Accenture Tower. That's where the Israeli consulate is. Some of those protesters obviously wanted to get inside, but that was stopped by the large police presence. Now, if you look over here, that's the last bit of group of protesters that's left. A small fraction of them took off in another direction, and there were bike officers who followed them as well. This has been intense, and I have to say that because there's been real pushing and shoving between protesters and police officers, and we believe at least one person was taken into custody. At some point, officers addressed the large group of protesters and asked them to leave the area. If you walk this direction, you can see the mess that has been left behind by some of the signs that were thrown out here. But this is really the intersection of where everything has been talking. So protesters like this one here have continued to stay in the street, get in the face of the officers yelling, and there's been back and forth. So far, it doesn't seem like there's been any injuries. Now, a counter-protesting group showed up about a half hour ago. They were on the other side of that large contingent of police officers. I'm going to ask my cameraman to raise his camera up just a little bit, and if you look in the distance, you can see that the officers have actually shut down that back side of the road as well. So this was a coordinated effort to make sure this entire intersection was protected, but at the same time, the intensity of this situation really, really got pushed into a corner at some point. As people started falling or running, that was shut down. It doesn't seem like anybody was injured at this point, but we continue to watch the action that's going on here in the streets.

GIFTAfter that, there were some reporting that privately a number of different Democrats didn't think that Trump actually represented this major threat to democracy, even if he certainly represented a challenge to one. But I do think that Harris realizes that this all can't be about Donald Trump. In large part, I think the election is a referendum on the former president, but she still has to offer a positive vision. That started a couple days ago whenever she gave a big economic address about policies that she hopes to enact if elected. And I think it continued here at the Democratic National Convention. And you're right, it's interesting. It's almost demoting Trump in some sense, not giving him sort of all the attention that he has gotten for the most part whenever Biden was the nominee.",

In 2008 and 2012, both Obamas spoke, both got rousing ovations, and both tried to draw this direct line between the kind of hope and change, yes we can themes, and the Kamala Harris campaign. The Obamas definitely got in some jabs, but mostly, again, they were kind of belittling the former president. I think mostly last evening was reminding Democrats what energy and enthusiasm for their candidate looked like, and that resonated because Harris has really rejuvenated the party that just a few weeks ago was feeling dejected and staring down what many thought was an almost certain loss.",

Democrats have, I think, falsely accused Trump of supporting a national abortion ban. I think he's kind of settled on, let the states decide.But I also think that there's some concern now that, you know, a lot of evangelical Christians and the pro-life movement are kind of not as enthusiastic about Trump as they once were. That was especially reinforced after the Republican platform came out, and it disappointed a lot of Republicans because they thought it was kind of watered down on the issue of abortion.

Yesterday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with a small group of hostage families. Now these are a particular group or a couple of groups that are actually fairly supportive of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his approach to the war, and he told them that he wouldn't be giving up control of the Netzarim, rather, of the Philadelphi Corridor. That's the border between Gaza and Egypt. He said it was of, you know, a strategic value to Israel, and that seems to be at a variance with the commitment that is given Secretary Blinken.

The one takeaway I guess you can have at the moment, that part of the push for the effort to get the ceasefire talks going again was to de- escalate tensions with Iran, and Iranian officials are now talking about a calibrated response to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, on their territory in Tehran just over two weeks ago.
