It's Thursday, September 21st, 5And today, we begin with what is really unthinkable here in Washington. Could Democrats step in to save Kevin McCarthy? Well, right now, the Democrats are talking about that as a possibility, although they certainly would have demands to make of their own were they step in to save him. Here is Michigan Democrat Dan Kildee. He said quote: If somehow Democrats are asked to be helpful, it's not just going to have to be out of the kindness of our hearts -- to put it mildly. There are just days to go until the September 30th deadline the end of next week. The House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is still holding out hope that he can do this with Republicans alone. Last night, he briefed his conference on a new plan to keep government open for another month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We are very close there. I feel a little bit more movement to go. We are in a good place where we are. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But listen to what Congressman McHenry had to say about this. You should listen to McHenry. He's a speaker in waiting. He really knows the game. Just listen to how he talked about.

This is something, you know, and I feel like we see this from time to time when these difficult situations pop-up. Certainly there was conversation about it when come McCarthy was trying to win the speaker's gavel in the first place. Where it pops up and says hey maybe Democrats could bill us out. The reality is that in many ways would be political suicide for Kevin McCarthy. I mean, this is really two very bad options for him at this point. What's McCarthy's new plan, what did he say, has them in a good place and is there any chance that this is different from yesterday? ANNIE GRAYER, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER:  Well, Kasie, good morning. I mean, the short answer is we'll see. Republicans met four hours behind closed doors last night and emerged with what they say is a new plan to keep government open for one more month. And this plan would have deeper spending cuts and provide more border security measures. But there's a math problem here. Only four Republicans can be against this measure. And there is as many as seven, Kasie, who've said that they are against. So with nine days until the government runs out of money, Kasie, this is not where Republicans thought they were going to be.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kasie, it's definitely being talked about. I mean, Democrats are looking around, realizing the same math that, you know, everybody is. That the government will run out of funding in nine days. And the question they are asking on their own caucus is do they want to let Republican infighting cause government shutdown.Now, the Democrats who do want to cut a deal with the Republicans want some of their own priorities reflected in whatever deal gets made to fund the government. You showed that SOT by Congressman Dan Kildee. You know, Democrats are going to come to the bargaining table. But they need some of their needs met. Now, Kasie, this is a very politically tricky question because if Democrats do cut a deal with Republicans. Then, Kevin McCarthy's speakership is really at risk. Members on the right have said that if McCarthy were to work with Republicans, they would try to move to oust him as speaker. Right now, these conversations about a bipartisan deal, Kasie, are happening at the member level. I should say that McCarthy and the top Democrat in the House, Hakeem Jeffries are not engaging in conversations at this point, because they know that the second they do, you really can't unravel that. You cannot pull it back. So the question is going to be, Kasie, are Democrats going to work with Republicans if Republicans cannot from the government on their own? And then, two, if Republicans try and move to oust McCarthy, will they be there to support him and keep him in his job?",

And, of course, there is always the kind of raw political calculationaround a shut down. Everybody fully expects Republicans would take the blame this. And should Democrats build him out of the political bind, there's going to be pressure on that as well. Any, let us change gears briefly because I want to look ahead to today. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is going to meet behind closed doors with several lawmakers. He is of course trying to convince them to keep helping him in his war against Russia.

The White House has been very clear that they want Congress to pass more Ukraine funding.But there's a split in Congress right now, specifically among Republicans. A number of Republicans don't want another set going towards Ukraine. So, really, this is going to be Zelenskyy meeting with smaller groups on the House and the Senate. This is not going to be a public speech like we have seen last time. And we're going to have to see what comes out of this conversations, Kasie, but really what today shows is just the divide in our government over what role our country should be playing in a war in Ukraine.",

Senator Tommy Tuberville has refused to drop the hold that he has on more than 300 military promotions from months. So, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reluctantly broke with Senate tradition and moved to vote on the three big promotions separately. Here's what both men had to say about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  It's not the path the vast majority of senators on either side of the aisle want to go. But Senator Tuberville is forcing us to confront his obstruction head on. SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL):  Finally came to a little bit of a conclusion. But it's about time. We should have done these a long time ago, but we're making progress. Again, I still have my holds. And we will continue to do that, and we might bring some more up ourselves, you know, through our petition that we are able to get down. But it's - I'm glad we're making some progress.

Our new CNN poll in New Hampshire has Trump leading with 39 percent, and Vivek Ramaswamy jumping into second place with 13 percent. It's a real dogfight for second place. That means Ron DeSantis, the man once thought to be Trump's chief rival has dropped to third place with just 10 percent in New Hampshire. Meanwhile in Iowa, a Fox poll shows that Trump is out front with 46 percent there. Here, DeSantis, according to this poll, still holding on to second with 15 percent but Nikki Haley in third with 11 percent. And in South Carolina, another Fox poll shows that Trump again at 46 percent. This is close to the national average. But this time, Haley, the state's former governor, comes in second at 18 percent. She's, of course, well known there. DeSantis lands in third again with 10 percent. All right. Just ahead here.

And, clearly, while it will aid Zelenskyy's message here saying that, clearly, the Russian aggression is very much still there, and this is something civilians are experiencing on a daily basis. You mentioned two people killed. That was in the south in Kherson. It was two men in a dormitory. And meanwhile in Kyiv, several injured, and one of them just a nine year old girl.This is demonstrating that these are not soldiers. These are civilians getting impacted. This is what Zelenskyy is trying to say in his message. Not only at the U.N. but also today to Biden and to lawmakers as well, that there is a brutality in this war, that civilians are still experiencing. And clearly, he wants more aid as a result. It has already been this new package promised by the White House. And that is mentioning things like anti-aircraft defense capabilities, precisely for this kind of shelling. It's kind of aerial attack to defend against it. Again, you mentioned energy infrastructure. That is another fear that as we go into as official target energy infrastructure, damaging not only areas that keep people warm, but the power grid, things like make life bearable in the winter months in Ukraine. All of this was what Ukraine is asking for from the United States, and clearly as he knows talks to the Republicans as well, the concern is that this aid is now up for debate.

And he's going to mention Ukraine there, had to big topic here between diplomats as well. And I think what's most interesting for me, or from our perspective, about Zelenskyy's visit to Washington, isn't the meeting with Biden, it's with meetings with Republicans because we know what it's like as a global states but he's a master of the craft. But he's throwing himself into domestic U.S. politics in Washington, and there's a concern that he might become a partisan figure to look closely associated with Biden. And therefore Republicans are going to start attacking Zelenskyy as the Biden type figure. So, if he can convince Republicans, he's also keen to work with them. I think that's going to really show how his mastery of this. Even our own polling is showing that more American Republicans are unfavorable to Zelenskyy than Democrats. So it's very sort of a -- it's a really tough chance for him to try to master American politics which you know better than anyone, Kasie, is a complex affair for a foreigner, especially.",

Ray Epps was part of a group who went through Capitol barriers that have been torn down. Conspiracy theories had claimed he was an undercover agent and this charge further undercuts that conspiracy theory. Sources tell CNN that election denier Kari Lake is planning to launch a Senate campaign. The Arizona Republican lost the 2022 race for governor, but insists that she actually won. Incumbent Senator Kyrsten Sinema hasn't said if she is running for reelection. And President Biden has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington later this year. They met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week. Relations between these two leaders have been strained for months over Israel's judicial reforms. That's judicial changes I would say. All right, now this. We're going to be talking so much about abortion politics throughout this upcoming election year, and how this issue gets talked about is going to be a critical piece of covering it and understanding why it is unfolding the way that it is. And to that point, I want to show you an ad. This is from Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear's reelection campaign. He is a Democrat obviously in a red state. This is a very striking new ad, abortion rights -- about abortion rights, and it squarely takes aim at Republican challenger Daniel Cameron's support for the states abortion ban, one that critics say is practically draconian.
