And you're right, airlines did a lot to address the operation. We don't have wide reports of disruptions across the system, although, of course, as the weather moves in, that always creates some challenges. But certainly that story should not be happening. What this woman has been dealing with is unacceptable. And we need to staff up and we also need to get the contracts done. Flight attendants and gate agents and ramp agents, everybody who's out there at the airports, they're skipping the holidays with their families to make sure that they can bring people together. And oftentimes they're doing so without the new contracts for themselves still really scraping to get by.",

It was these really long lines.This year, so far, as you just mentioned, knock on wood, we haven't seen those nationwide delays and cancellations at a really -- at a -- at a high pace like that yet. And hopefully it stays that way. Do you think this means that the measures, that the major carriers have taken to fix delay issues and how they kind of adapt when there are problems are working? Are we just getting lucky with weather? What -- how do we explain that it's OK so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, there's better planning mostly because the airline industry is 80 percent union. And what you're describing, hiring people inside in the infrastructure, building up that infrastructure, those were all demands by unions. So there have been improvements over the year, in addition to hiring more people on the front lines.And I have to say TSA has been doing a marvelous job too. The pay was increased there so it's easier to attract people to do the security lines as well. It all makes a difference. But the flight attendants are out there without having hadn't had raises for a very long time. You may have seen the Southwest pilots just got a 50 percent raise before that. The rest of the major pilot union contracts will be in the high 30s and 40s for pay increases. And flight attendants are still waiting for that. So we're pushing ahead, trying to get those increases and also trying to get paid for the time at work where we're working longer hours, but if we're not in the air, not getting paid. So this is an antiquated system that is a result from the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act that we were exempted from and contracts that were designed around the pilot contracts. But flight attendants are working during that boarding and de-planing and doing a lot more customer interfacing work. A lot more flights during the day too where we need to get paid. And these are the high demands in the contract negotiations. That needs to get resolved. Everything that the airlines have done internally is not going to last if we don't give these contracts done.",

But we haven't heard a lot this year about burnout from pilots and flight attendants and so many people that work within the aviation industry. Do you see any alleviation inside of that?

The child was traveling to visit his grandmother in Fort Myers, Florida, but was instead put on a flight to Orlando. The mistake was discovered when the correct flight arrived, but there was no child there. Spirit Airlines tell CNN they apologize to the family, but the grandmother just wants to know how that mix up happened. Also, the chances are one in two billion. An Alabama woman with the rare condition of having a double uterus has given birth to twin girls. Each baby grew in their own separate womb.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KELSEY HATCHER, MOTHER OF TWINS ROXI AND REBEL: Everybody got super emotional when Roxy was born because it was like we did it. Like we successfully did this. Lots of tears, lots of clapping. It was -- it was fun. But then the reality hit that, OK, well, we have another one we've got to take care of too. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But with many people wanting to indulge on Christmas cookies or other holiday treats, some weight loss drug users are reportedly considering skipping their doses. Is this a good idea? Well, Dr. Leana Wen is here to share her expertise. Dr. Wen, it's always good to see you. Thanks for being on with us on this Christmas. There are so many people who are using this drug and seeing positive effects from it. But we're curious if it is dangerous to posit for a holiday or an event or a vacation, something like that. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Look, I understand why some people may want to pause this drug because for many people, it does cause significant side effects. People often have gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sometimes constipation, stomach pain, things that may not go so well with vacations or Christmas or other holidays. The issue though is we have to understand obesity as a chronic condition. And these medications like semaglutide, which is Wegovy or Ozempic, we need to understand these the same way that we would medications for high blood pressure or diabetes or heart disease. And you wouldn't stop those other medications without getting your doctor's advice and recommendation. And I would advise people to please do that form for semaglutide and similar weight loss drugs as well. For some patients, it may be fine for them to skip a few doses. Maybe it's a good idea for them to start weaning off and reduce their doses as well. But for others, they could experience blood pressure spikes. They may have a recurrence or worsening of their diabetes that they were trying to control. And so this is really something that needs to be individualized and should be done in consultation with someone's individual physician.",

And obesity is something that is a chronic condition that has adverse health effects by itself, and also that it predisposes individuals to a whole variety of other negative health outcomes, including diabetes and heart disease, high blood pressure, et cetera.So I think it's really good that we have these medications now as an extra tool. But remember that these are medications that also need to be used together with lifestyle changes. So people still need to be eating a healthy diet. They still need to be getting exercise. Because, ultimately, the goal is better health for everyone coming into this New Year. Dr. Lena Wen, thanks so much. Merry Christmas, happy New Year. Great to see you.",
