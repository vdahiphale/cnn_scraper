And I'm really curious especially on the enthusiasm question, right? I mean we can put up and show people in this latest poll, 88 percent of Donald Trump supporters say that they were mildly or significantly enthusiastic about getting out to caucus. That number drops quickly, 62 percent for DeSantis, 39 percent for Haley. You can see it there.What does this tell you about what this cold is going to have in terms of an impact? KATHIE OBRADOVICH, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"IOWA CAPITAL DISPATCH\": Yes, I mean, you start off with a low level of enthusiasm among your supporters, and then you add minus 7 degrees and icy roads, that adds up to nothing good, especially for Nikki Haley. What's interesting to me behind those numbers is, Nikki Haley, half of her supporters are not even Republicans as they're - as they're headed into the caucus. They're independents and Democrats. So, that tells me that, you know, they're not really necessarily all that excited about Nikki Haley, but they don't want Donald Trump. And so they're taking the opportunity, the fact that the Democrats are not having a presidential preference vote tonight at the caucuses and they're going to try to, you know, support a candidate that they think would be less scary than Donald Trump.",

And, I mean, it's just kind of apocalyptic level stuff. I mean you wrote - there's been comparisons to the Civil War. Quote, \"some see a parallel in the clash of two Americas, not north and south now, but red and blue.\" I mean what -- what did you hear from voters on the trail about just how significant they view and how they're -- they're looking at this election, because it's really different than the times I've been here in the past. LISA LERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": It's really different. As, you know, everyone up here can say, normally you come out here and voters are talking about health care or taxes or, in recent years, abortion. This is an entirely new category of discussion. People are talking about fundamental tenets of democracy. They're worried that the American experiment is teetering. They're worried that the country is so divided that they're going to pull apart and we'll have some kind of civil war. I mean it really feels darker, it feels grimmer than, you know, anything I've ever seen in doing this. And that's a bipartisan sentiment. I mean clearly the parties view this completely differently, like a Trump reporter - a Trump voter views what has happened to the country. I mean, radically different. On a different planet, even. Different reality than what many Biden voters see. But they both have this shared, dark concern for really the core of the country.",
