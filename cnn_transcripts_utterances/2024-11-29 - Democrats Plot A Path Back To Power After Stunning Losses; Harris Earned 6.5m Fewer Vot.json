The story is a little more complicated in the swing states.Just look at this chart comparing the 2024 results to 2020. You see how Harris won more votes than Biden in four of the seven battlegrounds, the numbers in green, but even so, Trump's vote totals went up in all of them, and by far more than Harris's. Evan Roth Smith is a lead pollster for Blueprint 2024, a top Democratic polling form -- firm, and he's here to tell us all about his data from swing voters on Democrats and what they did wrong. Evan, thank you so much for joining me this afternoon. Based on your extensive analysis here of the electorate, what went wrong for Democrats?",

But the bigger picture of what Democrats were up against is just so awful.And so much of our polling has revealed how much voters were rebelling against the Democratic Party. You know, they viewed us as the most extreme version of ourselves, right? Swing voters across the country and in these swing states believe that Kamala Harris held positions that she wasn't even running on, right, that she wanted to decriminalize border crossings or defund the police or, you know, all sorts of cultural issues, right? They believe the Democratic -- the Democrats were an extreme party. And we also saw that swing voters believe that Democrats were the party of the establishment, right? Republicans were the party of elites. But at a moment where so many voters are upset with the status quo and upset and losing faith in so many American institutions, you'd rather be the party of the elites, right? A billionaire like Elon Musk does not present the threat to some of these swing voters that they see from, you know, failing institutions or institutions they don't trust anymore. Democrats were the party of that institution -- of those institutions.",

And, you know, the biggest divide within the Democratic Party is we have this debate over what just happened in this election and where we go next isn't really even an ideological divide.It's not between the moderate wing of the party and the left wing of the party or anything like that. It's about -- it's between people who are interested in winning elections and make that the mission of the Democratic Party. And people who are interested in lots of other things like, you know, driving subscriptions to their substack or creating a really good annual report for their donors because they, you know, get on TV doing advocacy, right? Those people aren't necessarily interested in the success of the Democratic Party as their primary motivator. And, you know, there are plenty of popular ideas within the Democratic Party that come from, you know, the economic populist left. There are plenty of very popular ideas that come from the moderate wing in the center. And if two people are sitting down at a table from those wings and saying, let's figure out how to win an election, they can get somewhere, right? We saw moments of that during this campaign. You know, the price gouging policy that Harris ran on for a while, but then backed off of came from the populist left. And it was enormously popular. But you have to be having honest, real conversations about, hey, where is the electorate? Who are the people within the electorate who are going to determine the outcome of this election? What do they think of the Democratic Party? What do they think we care about? And how do we convince them we're going to solve their problems?",

You said the Democrats were seen more as protecting the establishment than Republicans, according to your polling. So tell me, what is the root cause of that? Why do voters actually think that it's Democrats who are protecting the establishment?Because we are the party of the establishment. I mean, there is a realignment happening in the American electorate where Democrats, you know, are representing kind of different people than we thought we were. Our coalition looks a little different than we thought it did. And the Republican coalition is changing, too, right? It's more multiracial. The Republican coalition, it's less wealthy. The Democrats are getting whiter and wealthier in terms of our voter coalition. Now, again, you have to be respectful of reality, right? We have to operate within reality. OK, if that's our coalition, if that's the changing parameters of the American electorate, then how do we win within those parameters? And one of the things you see is, you know, you have to make -- you can't wish an electorate or coalition into existence that you don't have. And there are a lot of people who want us to be the party of certain things. But the Democratic Party isn't a vehicle for any particular ideology or any particular constituency. It's not a reactive force against Donald Trump. The mission of the Democratic Party is to go out and win elections.",
