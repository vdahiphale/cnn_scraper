He view that as more moderate position. The person who doesn't support that is Donald Trump. He actually very clearly does not want to be anywhere near a national abortion ban, because Democrats have gone after that issue and have run very successful campaigns on. So how do we deal with that issue?There are other things too. I mean, J.D. Vance is very anti Ukraine aide. This is of course, an animating issue in the Republican base right now. Trump has gotten very close to that position as well. That is going to be one of the things also that will give some Republicans in the more establishment part of the party some pause. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes. And the idea that Donald Trump wants to come into this convention as a uniter, this doesn't necessarily unite, A, the country and it doesn't necessarily unite of the Republican Party either. I've been talking to some Haley voters who in the end were sort of hoping last ditch, you know, hope that maybe the pick would be Haley maybe would even be Burgum, very upset that it is J.D. Vance. And one person I talked to who was in Arizona Haley voter. She called Vance, manipulative, a manipulative divider. They are not happy with this pick, I think it speaks to what Democrats are feeling, too. They feel like in -- in J.D. Vance, they have a big target. But we also know that oftentimes vice presidential picks don't necessarily matter in the end game. But Democrats are certainly hoping that in J.D. Vance, they can make a target that will turn off those suburban voters that are so --",

How Joe Biden has acquitted himself since Saturday, is just phenomenal. I mean, he has been the rock, the steady hand, he talked to Donald Trump, who he clearly doesn't have fondness for, because he -- Donald Trump was one of the victims that day. So he talked to talk to him -- talk to him as a victim. He has been making sure that there's going to be -- he talks to the American public and make sure the American public knew what it was that they were doing. He's led meetings in the Situation Room. That's the kind of thing that you want a president to do. And he finally -- the final point I'll make is he really made sure that we all understand that when you win, it matters that you still take care of the losers. Donald Trump lost that election. And Joe Biden is still taking care of him the same way as if he was one of the people who voted for him and making sure that his -- he and his family and this issue is being addressed.

But as a conservative, I look at that and I say, well, you saw what just happened to the former president a couple of days ago. That was abhorrent language.
