Okay, maybe it's not a photo of Antony Blinken. There it is. The U.S. government estimates that 16,000 Americans remain in Sudan, many who are dual citizens. We've also learned the number who want to leave the country is in the dozens. CNN's Oren Liebermann joins us now live from the Pentagon.

The question is, what can the U.S. do now for the American citizens who are there and how many want to get out. There is a big difference here. Though there are 16,000 or more U.S. citizens in the country, many of them dual nationals, the administration keeps saying it only has a signal from somewhere between dozens of hundreds or hundreds who are looking to leave the country in terms of what the U.S. is putting in place. The Pentagon said just a short time ago, there is 24/7 surveillance overhead from drones, as well as a Navy ship that is already off the coast of Sudan and another headed that way in terms of being able to get people different places or get the medical help should they get to Port Sudan. In terms of getting in again, right now that seems to be off the table. Here is National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, our colleague, Abby Phillip, sat down with the lawmakers yesterday. And one of them, Justin Jones, made clear they have asked for the President. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JUSTIN JONES (D-TN): I think that we need emergency response because we're facing a crisis situation. And that in states like ours, we need help from our national leaders, because we're in a state where the only action that our colleagues took in response to mass shooting in Nashville was to expel the two youngest black lawmakers and then to pass a law to protect gun manufacturers.

So there is a lot to be done on that front. And he is meeting with dignitaries in businesses in Japan, then he'll move on to South Korea before going to Israel and the United Kingdom as well.But the subtext to all this as well is that there is this presidential race that he is laying the groundwork for, and he really has not had an opportunity to step out onto the international stage yet. This is going to be - this is really his first chance to visit many of these countries. He's only ever gone to Israel as an elected official. And he tried to sort of tap into international issues a couple of weeks ago when he was asked about Ukraine. He received a lot of blowback for calling it a territorial dispute, had to walk that back and then sort of pivoted all over again. So this is his opportunity to sort of get some international exposure. However, he is - it's coming at a time when he is facing some significant headwinds back home. You mentioned that poll. That also comes just as Donald Trump last week unveiled a whole bunch of endorsements, including many from DeSantis' home state of Florida, where we saw 11 House Republicans now have endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2024 over Ron DeSantis. DeSantis has also been facing some criticism from Trump's allies as well as Democrats back home for his extensive travel. We've seen him all over the country lately, even as Florida faced a pretty big natural disaster. We had torrential rain in South Florida. There was flooding. There was a gas shortage and DeSantis has not talked about that very often, leading to one of Donald Trump's top allies, his son, Don Jr., to tweet this out last week. \"Fort Lauderdale is underwater and DeSantis is campaigning in Ohio right now instead of taking care of people in his state.\" So Boris, even as he is trying to turn the page a little bit by going to this other countries, there are still some questions back home as to his viability in the presidential race if he were to jump in.",

In that particular case, the Ninth Circuit here said that the board members' blocking of the parents comments did constitute government action, and then that violated the First Amendment. So that was one case. Then there's a second case out of Michigan involving the city manager of Port Huron, Michigan. He had a Facebook profile page that a resident in that city posted on repeatedly criticizing the COVID policies of that particular town. The city manager then blocked that user. Interestingly, this was a different outcome than the Ninth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit said that because the city manager was operating only in his personal capacity, he did not violate the First Amendment as it came to his government duties. So there's really a circuit split here. That's why the Supreme Court has taken up this case.",

They didn't end up deciding the case, because at the point where it came to them, Donald Trump was a former president, so they were able to say, okay, it's no longer applicable. It's moot.However, in that case, Justice Clarence Thomas talked a little bit about the fact that pretty soon the Supreme Court wouldn't be able to dodge this issue. He said that that case and likely others highlight: \"The principal legal difficulty that surrounds digital platforms - namely that applying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward.\" He continued to say, \"We will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms.\" So that's exactly what they'll take up next term. I mean, it begs this question, because it's a little bit of blurred lines. It's personal social media accounts that government officials are operating and they often post government related policy issues on those pages. So the question is: Are they acting in their personal capacity? Are they acting in their government capacity? It's something the Supreme Court will finally wade into starting in the fall.",
