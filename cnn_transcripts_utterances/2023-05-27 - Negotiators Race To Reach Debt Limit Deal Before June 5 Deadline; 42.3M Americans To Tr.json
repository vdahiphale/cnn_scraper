Is the optimism suggesting that they are very close, or is that optimism for the markets? Is that optimism for the camera? LAURA WEISS, TAX &amp; CEILING DEAL STILL \"HOURS OR DAYS AWAY\": Yes, so I think the optimism is suggesting that they are close. We are starting to hear things that could be part of this deal. So it does seem that they're nearing some kind of potential agreement. Of course, getting over the finish line is always a really difficult step. So there are no guarantees until there is a deal in hand and until it passes. But the optimism does seem real. It does seem to be backed up, and we've seen these negotiations, you know, pick up pace. We've seen more consistently from negotiators, from Speaker McCarthy talking about optimism or progress. You know, it does seem that they're hitting a different phase of these negotiations and they seem to be pretty nonstop.

It's -- he's probably going to lose a good chunk as you pointed out of Republicans from the farther right part of the conference.And so, you know, that is something he's going to have to balance in the speaker's race earlier this year. The conservative wing of the party really, you know, flex their muscle, gains some power. And so I think it's both the question of, you know, how many votes does he bring along, is he comfortable losing, but also, how upset are those Republicans, you know, how much will this affect his speakership? And that's something that I think we'll see playing out in the days ahead, and especially when House members return to Washington. BLACKWELL: Yes.

Now, officials say a man pictured here disturbed the calf after it was separated from its mother last week. The calf was trying to cross the river and the man was seen pushing that cafe up from the river and then onto a roadway. The calf was later seen walking up to other visitors and cars.Now, the National Park Service said in a statement that, quote, \"Park Rangers tried repeatedly to reunite the calf with the herd. These efforts failed. The calf was later killed by park staff because it was abandoned by the herd and causing a hazardous situation by approaching cars and people along the roadway\". Associate professor and extension wildlife specialist from Montana State University of Bozeman, Jared Beaver, joining me now. Thank you for your time, sir. So it looks like this man, who police are now looking for, may have been trying to help this calf cross the river, but clearly he did more harm than good. I mean, could the baby have survived if that man didn't intervene? DR. JARED BEAVER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY AT BOZEMAN: Yes, and it's really tough to say, you know, I'm not part of the National Park Service and I wasn't there for that particular incident, but, you know, generally, you know, human interference is never good. It usually does more harm than it does good and it's best in these situations to just let natural processes occur.",

And, you know, it's unfortunate, but there's a lot of reasons that an animal could reject. Its young, you know, that particular animal could be sick or injured., forcing that mom to make a difficult decision.The mom could be in poor health. We just had a really severe winter here in Montana. Other reasons is maybe there's just too many offspring in terms of what that animal -- that mom can support. And so there's really a lot of reasons why a mother could reject or abandon its young. And so it's really tough to tell, you know, just what the situation was here. It's just an unfortunate situation, but the real thing to take away and learn here is that we just have to let, you know, nature kind of take its course and, you know, from a person and a human perspective, we've just got to not interfere.",

And it did defend its actions in a statement by the National Park Service saying, quote, \"We made the choice. We did not\" -- \"We made the choice we did, not because we are lazy, uncaring, or inexpert in our understanding of bison biology. We made the choice we did because national parks preserve natural processes.\"Just the big picture here, though, I mean, what goes into a decision to euthanize an animal after this kind of exposure?",

There's a lot of nuance that goes on here.Disease transmission is a real concern here. You know, bison can carry brucellosis. That can affect other wildlife. It can get into livestock industry. So there's a lot of social and economic consequences that could come with that as well. And there's a lot of state and federal regulations in place that control what can and can't happen in terms of wildlife transport. And that can vary geographically, it can vary by species. And so, you know, the real takeaway here is it's very complicated and there's a lot to consider, and it quickly escalates beyond just an individual level concern.",
