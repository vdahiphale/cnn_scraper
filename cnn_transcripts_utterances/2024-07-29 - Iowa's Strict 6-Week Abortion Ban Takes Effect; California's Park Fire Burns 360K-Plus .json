Police say a 17-year-old suspect carried out the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed yoga event for children at a dance school near Liverpool. The suspect is under arrest. Police say the attack does not appear to be terror-related, but the motive at this point is unclear. Also, McDonald's is reporting today that it's getting hit hard by inflation. The fast-food chain reporting weaker-than-expected second- quarter earnings, marking the first drop in sales from McDonald's since 2020. With fewer customers eating out, McDonald's is trying to lure them back with more discounts like the $5 value meals that it launched last month. And Alma Powell, the widow of the late secretary of state and retired general, Colin Powell, has died. She was 86. The Powells were married for nearly 60 years. In what was believed to be Colin Powell's final interview in July of 2021, he told journalist, Bob Woodward, that his wife was the greatest person he'd ever known. She is survived by the couple's three children who called their mother the \"grounding force of our family.\" Boris?",

There's very steep terrain giving firefighters a little bit of difficulty when fighting these flames. But there are two things that have really helped over the weekend. One, better weather conditions and, two, more resources. We now have about 5,000 people here battling this fire. And what I was told was that they we're able to have this direct aggressive attack on those flames to bring up that containment number. Because, look, over the last couple of days, this fire truly exploded in size. These flames were very, very fast, not giving people a lot of time to evacuate.

That's one of the options. And also the international presence is very important to request, to have a transparence in this process. For example, the Carter Center, as well as other countries, they're requesting transparency in the results. They're requesting to post the ballots and to post the information on the Web site. So we'll see what's going to happen in a few hours. Another example of the importance also of the international support is that the United States is watching very closely what's happening in the election. Since 2015, the U.S. has had a lot of problems, diplomatic issues with Venezuela. During the Obama administration, they declared Venezuela a national threat to democracy, to the U.S. In 2017, the Biden -- 2017, they also gave some sanctions to specific members of the government. And in 2019, we gave huge economic sanctions to the country of Venezuela. So the U.S. plays a key role on these presidential elections. Back to you.",
