Just ahead,heavy fighting continues in north and south Gaza, where officials warn the humanitarian situation is close to collapse. We'll have a live report on that. Then, U.S. President Joe Biden urges Senate Republicans not to let Russia win, and to approve a crucial Ukraine aid. We'll have a first account report on how desperately Ukrainian soldiers need this U.S. support. Plus, we'll have some of the most fiery exchanges from last night's Republican presidential debate. Who tried the most to come out ahead and who was a no-show? Anyone has guessed. It's been two months to the day since the October 7th Hamas attack, and Israel's Military offensive is intensifying throughout Gaza. The southern city of Khan Younis appears to be the focus right now where the IDF says a top militant leader could be hiding underground. But, further south, this video shows the aftermath of a strike where civilians can be seen digging through the rubble. And we're also getting word of heavy gunfire in northern Gaza. All of this is only adding to a deepening humanitarian disaster. The World Food Program says everyone in Gaza is hungry. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins me now live from Jerusalem to talk about this. Ben, we've heard so many superlative humanitarian warnings, all of which have been borne out by the evidence. In practice, what does a humanitarian situation close to collapse mean for people in southern Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Well, it means for one thing. The health system is basically barely functioning. One hospital in Deir al-Balah in the central part of the Gaza Strip said today their -- the hospital is full. The morgues are full. And yesterday, they received, rather, in the last 24 hours, 114 bodies, which outnumbered the number of actual injured people. Now, what we're hearing is that, for instance, the World Food Program is saying that in the north of Gaza, 95 percent of the population has adopted what they're calling extreme consumption strategies to cope with food shortages. In other words, they're reducing the amount of food they're eating because there is no food available. So, they need to make their supply, and that percentage for the south is 82 percent. There are large incidences or percentages of the population who isbasically starving at this point. Only in the Rafah district in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is any aid getting through, and that is by all accounts completely inadequate. I think yesterday, 80 trucks went in with medicine, with some fuel, with food supplies. But, it's really inadequate for the needs of a place where a population -- 85 percent of the population of about 2.2 million has now been made homeless. So, they're living in -- many of them on the streets or in -- under tents made with thin plastic sheeting, without any sanitation, without any access to clean water, regular supply of food, medical care or any of the basics that many people take for granted. And Oxfam has put out a statement which I think very well sums up the situation. It says the Israeli Military onslaught in southern Gaza is causing destruction, danger and civilian terror and suffering. It's such a scale that makes any humanitarian response impossible across Gaza.",

The border authorities say they will -- it'll be open today for foreign nationals, including 63 that hold the U.S. citizenship, and other nationalities including the UK and Romania and Kazakhstan and Ukraine. We've already seen some dozens of them go through. We'll have final numbers later in the day. So, that's one aspect.Another is that there are more people, about a dozen injured, who have crossed over from the Gaza Strip into Egypt to be treated at Egyptian hospitals. I have been to the New Administrative Capital hospital here in Cairo where some of the premature babies that were transferred from the Al Shifa Hospital are being treated. More have come in the week and a half since that. But, the big problem remains aid and getting more aid into the Gaza Strip. The Rafah crossing is the only way to get in or out of the Gaza Strip that is not controlled by Israel. It's where this aid has been coming in. But, it is a tiny fraction. In fact, to put it bluntly, it will not move the needle when, as Ben said, more than 1.8 million people are estimated to have been displaced. And that is why for the first time you're seeing this call from the UN Secretary General, invoking Article 99 of the UN Charter for the first time, calling for humanitarian ceasefire, and referring to that situation in Gaza to the UN Security Council. A bit of a statement from the UN Secretary General is important to highlight. He says \"While delivery of supplies to Rafah continues, quantities are insufficient and have dropped since the pause came to an end. We are simply unable to reach those in need inside Gaza.\" The capacity of the United Nations and its humanitarian partners has been decimated by supply shortages, lack of fuel, interrupted communications, and growing insecurity. And this is not just from the UN. Every other aid organization operating within the Gaza Strip has been sending out alarm bells, saying a humanitarian catastrophe is about to unfold. The situation is appalling. There is no food. There is no water, and especially, there is no fuel. So, yesterday, Israel's war cabinet approved a minimal increase in the amount of fuel coming into the Gaza Strip. That is not going to move the needle again when there is just so much need across the street. Bianca.",

Israel's Ambassador to the UN called the Secretary General's move a new moral low, which was \"playing into Hamas' hands\", and demanded Guterres' resignation. Clare Sebastian is here with me.

There has been a lot of upset over some of the rhetoric that's been coming from the UN Secretary General, the conflict -- with the dispute between the UN and Israel escalated to such an extent last week, or even just a few days ago, that Israel revoked the visa of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Gaza.So, I think this is an escalation of that. Israel is very upset about that. The Foreign Minister even saying now that the tenure of Guterres is a danger to world peace. But, I think this is not just sort of exposed that, this invoking of Article 99, which by the way, hasn't been done, according to the UN, since 1971. It has exposed some of the criticism of the UN, whether or not it's essentially up to the job of what it was set up to do, which is to be a guarantor of peace and stability in the world. And some of that came out. It was a pretty sort of tense press briefing that the UN spokesperson gave yesterday. I want to play you a clip from that so you can see some of the questioning that they got. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, we've seen already that, because the U.S. is so far not in favor of a ceasefire, and they have veto power on the Security Council that these things have not got through the Security Council. So, I think this will certainly rumble on. The Secretary General the UN is likely, as the spokesperson said, to call a meeting this week where it'll be discussed.But, meanwhile, of course, the trigger point, the reason for invoking Article 99 and the fact that the UN thinks that its humanitarian efforts are now on the verge of paralysis, that will also not improve if the fighting goes on.",

Priscilla, what political pathways remain open at this stage to deliver more aid to Ukraine, and which is the most likely? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTERit out himself in his remarks just yesterday, and saying that he is open to significant policy changes on the border. Now, this is important because Senate Republicans have said that they want to see robust border policy changes to move forward any of this aid to Ukraine. And so, the President is signaling to those lawmakers that he is willing to do that. Now, sources tell me that the White House telegraphed to Senate negotiators last week what they were willing to give, and that included, for example, raising the credible fear standard for asylum seekers. That would essentially have the effect of weeding out those who do not have a credible claim. And then also, casting a wider net of undocumented immigrants who could be placed under a fast track deportation procedure, that effect being that more people, undocumented immigrants, could be deported more quickly. And so, those were some of the major concessions that the White House was willing to give. But, it is just not enough for Senate Republicans or for House Republicans who want to see even stricter border policy changes. And so, what this has boiled down to is this very delicate political issue for the White House now undermining his foreign policy agenda. Now, what the President and top White House officials have done is made clear to the American people that this isn't just about conflicts that are playing out abroad, but it speaks directly to the U.S. national security and the U.S. leadership on the world stage. As you heard there, the President saying that we can't let the Russian President Vladimir Putin win. And so, a top White House official just making that even clearer this morning. Take a listen.
