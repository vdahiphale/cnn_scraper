I'm Max Foster in London in for Becky Anderson.Ukraine's army commander pens an exclusive op-ed for CNN laying out a new vision for the war against Russia. Why he may not have the opportunity, though, to implement it? A massive gas explosion in Nairobi, what investigators are learning about the blast that's killed at least three. In the coming hours, President Biden will take part in a dignified transfer as the remains of three U.S. service members arrive back on American soil. And the U.S. migrant crisis expands well beyond the border. We'll explain the new incident involving the NYPD has had made New Yorkers pretty angry. In an exclusive op-ed for CNN, the embattled leader of Ukraine's army has laid out his strategy to win the war with Russia. Valerii Zaluzhnyi writes that Ukraine must be less dependent on foreign aid and focus more on technology. He says the number one priority must be the mastery of unmanned drones and other technologies to gain an advantage over Russia. He adds that the challenge is to create a completely new state system of technological rearmament. He says such a change could be achieved in five months. The general's op-ed make no reference to report some sources that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to fire him. Let's bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Kyiv. It's making a lot of impact, isn't it, this piece? Just explain what he's suggesting.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, you're absolutely right. It is having a huge impact. I know that herein Kyiv a lot of people that have been talking about and of course when we look online around the world, people have been taking note of it as well. And it certainly is I think quite a remarkable essay that was written by the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, especially for those of us, Max, who have been covering this war since it started almost two years ago, and we could really see how modern technology, which many people thought were simply consumer products when all this started, had become absolutely key on the battlefield and it seems as far as Valerii Zaluzhnyi is concerned could become something of a game changer that the Ukrainians are hoping for. Now, one of the things that all this is based upon is a realization by Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commanding general, that the Ukrainians are currently badly outmanned and outgunned and probably will continue to be outmanned and outgunned. One of the things as you've noted that he says is that the Ukrainians will probably have to deal with less aid coming from their partners as he put it as they deal with their own internal political issues, possibly speaking about some of the things that are currently going on in the United States, where of course continued military aid for the Ukrainians hangs in the balance. Now, in light of that, Valerii Zaluzhnyi writes that he believes the way to try and mitigate that to level the playing field or in this case the battlefield is to rely on modern technology, unmanned systems as he put it in the air, on land, and at sea as well. He thinks that on the one hand it will allow the Ukrainians to continue to strike the Russians and hurt them, but also to mitigate some of your own losses. I want to read one quote from Valerii Zaluzhnyi. This is quote, he says, \"Attack operations can have psychological objectives,\" as he put it, \"and here, technology boasts undoubted superiority over tradition. The remote control of these assets means fewer soldiers in harm's way, thus reducing the level of human losses.\" Of course, what he's referring to is the fact that, for instance, soldiers who operate drones away from enemy lines are less likely to be hurt or killed than soldiers who are sitting on the frontlines and possibly defending there. So Ukrainians, obviously, noting also the fact that they have far fewer soldiers on the front right now than the Russians do. He also urges for this transformation to take place as fast as possible. He says quote, \"In 2024,\" so obviously this year, \"we must focus our main efforts in these areas, introducing a new philosophy of training and warfare, which takes account of restrictions and assets and how they can be deployed and mastering new combat capabilities as soon as possible.\" So I think, on the one hand, he is saying that obviously the Ukrainians need to rely on more on these technologies, develop these technologies, but in general also integrate these technologies into their form of warfare -- Max.",

But this week, the social network, social media in Ukraine, went haywire with rumors and multiple anonymous sources in the government confirming that of Valerii Zaluzhnyi, in fact, was dismissed. Later it turned out that he wasn't. And so, you know, it's just a mess. You know how hysterical social networks could be, especially during war time. And Zaluzhnyi coming out with his positioning of what should be the way forward with limited resources, both human and financial, it's really a timing where it appears to many observers that he's trying to set the record straight and maybe push back a little bit, defend his position. But even if he has to go, it will be that he's going out with a very clear strategy.",

This is peculiar, too, because in fact there are no elections, you know, coming and elections have been postponed until after the war. So, you know, I'm not quite sure. And actually not just me many, many people are not quite sure what it is that's going on. Why are we even polling generals? But yes, there's something some political infighting. I mean, it's easy to explain what the fundamental reason for this is. As Ukraine is getting an (INAUDIBLE) and there are fewer resources and the international support is delayed, conflicts are inevitable. Disagreements about policy side inevitable.

That's going tobe a game changer, but it also going to raise the question of the civilian oversight of military during the war. That's a little bit in the background. Even people who support Zaluzhnyi, they worry that, you know, OK, maybe that's not the right timing for political ambition. Maybe post-war when people retire from the military and run and campaign as civilians, that's fine. But right now, a general who's going to push for that -- so you know, there's this undertone that we are a democracy and civilian oversight even during the war is more important. So, yes, it's a complex situation. It's fascinating. But on the substance, Zaluzhnyi is correct.

Cooking gas is very commonly used across not just Kenya but across East Africa, but this place was unlicensed and therefore illegal. The regulator here in Kenya says they applied for licenses in March, in June and in July, and they were denied all three times for safety reasons. They're too close to residential area and therefore in the event of a blast, like what happened last night, it would affect so many people that live around here because this is a densely populated area. And in fact, that is what happened. So the question for so many in this community is why was this allowed to be here so long even after the place is demolished at least twice, according to Petroleum Institute of East Africa. And the owner of this place was even convicted and jailed. Should have gone to jail for five years, only have the one-year sentence, and then came right back to doing it again.

The president often uses these types of meetings to talk about his own experience with grief discussing the death of his son, Beau Biden, who had served in Iraq but later died of brain cancer once he was back in the United States. Also, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff CQ Brown will also be on hand for the dignified transfer which is expected to take place around 1:30 this afternoon. This is the second time that President Biden has been attending a dignified transfer. You'll remember back in 2021, he was on hand when the remains of those 13 service members returned to the U.S. after those service members died in Afghanistan. So it certainly is a very grave, a very somber moment for President Biden as he is there in his role as commander in chief.",

Sohere is a city that has received over the last year-and-a-half what the mayor estimates to be 100 and migrants that the city has provided either shelter, food services to they believe that somewhere between 60,000 and 70,000 of them are still here and there are still some coming. But the flashpoint between the city and the federal government has been the mayor has said the federal government hasn't really given the city enough aid to really render all of this help. That of course then is underscored by this incident where the police were assaulted outside a shelter for migrants. Now, footnote here. The migrants who come to New York City and other cities, these are people in search of hope, in search of work, in search of new lives. But a very small percentage of them in New York have presented themselves as small cliques of criminal organizations. Among those suspects in the attack on the police are people who are suspected in multiple robberies, patterns of crimes, shoplifting organizations, and so on. One of the things that came up yesterday, Max, was New York City police detectives believe that the four who were released without bail may have boarded a bus headed for the Mexican border and police say there's not much they can do to stop that since they were released without bail and they're expected back in court on March 13th, which, if that's really them on that bus, is probably doubtful.",
