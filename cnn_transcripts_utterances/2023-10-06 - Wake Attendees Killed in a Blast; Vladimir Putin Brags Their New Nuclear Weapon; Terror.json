Ukraine is also reporting new strikes on -- strikes on its second-largest city, Kharkiv, which left nine people wounded.Now, all that's coming on the heels of one of Russia's most horrific attacks since the war began. Kyiv says a Russian missile hit the village of Hroza on Thursday, killing at least 51 people. It happened while the victims were holding a wake for a fallen Ukrainian soldier. Ukrainian prosecutors say there were absolutely no military targets in the area at the time.

This man, weeping in front of a body bag, too shaken to talk to us, we learned his name is Sergei and the deceased was his wife.As you can see, this building was completely annihilated when it was hit by the missile. The Ukrainians are saying that this was an Iskander missile launched by the Russians. That is a very heavy missile that is normally used to destroy large troop formations or even armored vehicles. And as you can see, it completely devastated this building right here. The Ukrainians say more than 50 people were killed. It's very difficult for them to identify some of the bodies because they are in such bad shape. They also say what was going on here was an event around a funeral and they say that the people who were attending that event were all local folks. There was chaos, the chief investigator tells us. There was a fire which was extinguished by firefighters. Of course, evacuation measures were taken to get people out of the rubble. Obviously, all of this is still very fresh and a lot of the search and rescue crews are still very much at work. We can see over there that some of the first responders are still busy sort of doing the forensics on the scene here, and also, still putting bodies into body bags. There's a lot of them laying around here and a lot of them being taken away by some of these crews here. One of the other things that we can see over there is that obviously this was some sort of recreational area. There still seems to be some sort of playground that was also heavily damaged when the missile hit. Ukraine's president visiting Spain pinning the blame on Russia. Tragically, because of this inhuman terrorist attack, 50 civilians were killed during a funeral. Russia does this every day in the Kharkiv region and only air defense can help. But that help will be too late for Sergei's wife and the others killed. The only thing he can do for her now is help the crews lift her body to be taken away. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Hroza, Ukraine.

A stunning new report from ABC News and the New York Times about Donald Trump and America's military and nuclear secrets.

That puts the country, and as the secretary said, it puts service members in harm's way when he's giving up capabilities.

It was in June that we saw Secretary of State Antony Blinken meet with Xi Jinping here in Beijing, where they talked about the need to have this relationship move forward and talked about a need for stability between the two nations. It was just last month in Malta that we saw China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, meet with National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. And then of course, we had high profile visits by members of President Biden's cabinet, such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. And you could infer that one of the points of all of these meetings is for the Chinese and for the Americans to find out where there are areas of common ground and where there are points of difference, such as Taiwan, some of the economic issues. All of this to create a starting point, a conversation forward if and when these two men meet. So, it's not necessarily an ambiguous meeting.

But what's really needed is a comprehensive approach, looking to support development in these counties, looking to create legal pathways for some of these people to come work. We know that Europe is in need of labor migrants, so how can we organize this better, so that people don't come irregularly, work informally, and then at risk of exploitation?",

Thank you for being here with us. Alright, we are just about three hours away from a highly anticipated announcement from Oslo. The Norwegian Nobel Committee is set to announce the recipient of the 2023 Peace Prize.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a favorite among odds makers for his efforts to end Russia's brutal invasion, but experts say his chances actually might be slim. Another possible contender is Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, he led protests against Vladimir Putin and Russian corruption before his arrest and imprisonment. Alright, still to come, fears about bed bugs are still going strong in France. Officials are set to meet to discuss the problem while transportation authorities say there is no need to panic.

But we should have no panic as well because every case which is signaled to our public transport operators are checked.BELL (voice-over): Officials and transport operators say that recent reports of sightings in public transport are unconfirmed. And yet the French government is holding meetings, and pest control services say they've seen a rise in the numbers in private homes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I have friends who've had them at theirs. So I know it can be a real ordeal to get rid of them. BELL (voice-over): According to France's public health body, 11 percent of French households have been infested in the past five years, but the overall rise is insignificant year to year. Part of the problem, the ick-factor involved. JOHANNA FITE, ANSES (through translator): There is an emerging phenomenon that we've been seeing an increase in infestations for about 20 years now.  It's happened gradually because there's no miracle product to combat bed bugs. Today, in these last few weeks, there's clearly been a media phenomenon, a psychosis created around bed bugs. BELL (voice-over): And the media interest says as much about Paris as it does about the bugs themselves. With Fashion Week on, as well as the Rugby World Cup, and soon the 2024 Summer Olympics, the issue is also one of image. Bed bugs are, after all, about as universal as it gets. But France now knows that it needs answers urgently. OLIVIER VERAN, FRENCH GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN (through translator): We need to give the French people an answer. Is there or isn't there a clear upsurge in bed bugs, since when and where? BELL (voice-over): Bed bugs are hard enough to see, let alone count, making the spotlight now shone all the more difficult to bear. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
