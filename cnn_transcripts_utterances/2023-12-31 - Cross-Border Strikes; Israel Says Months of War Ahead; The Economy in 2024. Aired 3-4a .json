Israel's prime minister says the war will continue on for months. In the midst of it all, displaced Palestinians struggle to find food and shelter. And the 2023 economy turned out better than most had reason to expect. But what could 2024 have in store? Moscow has fired the latest shot in a wave of cross border attacks and counterattacks between Russia and Ukraine. It came Sunday morning when Ukraine reported a Russian drone strike on its second largest city, Kharkiv. Several apartment buildings were hit hours before, Ukraine says Russian missiles pummeled the same city, wounding 26 people. Those strikes damaged residential buildings, hospitals, businesses and government offices. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Ukrainian strike on Belgorod, barely 20 miles from its border Saturday, is its deadliest known cross border attack of the war, according to Belgorod's governor.Putin dispatched its health minister and an emergency ministry team three months out from his upcoming re-election. The chaos dense his carefully created image of a war going well. It's unclear if this was Ukrainian revenge, and Ukrainian officials don't routinely comment about this type of attack. But the up-tempo does seem to speak to frustrations, fears even and a determination in Ukraine. The absent the financial support that they need from their allies, they can still land blows and thwart Putin's aggression. Russia's U.N. spokesperson called for an emergency U.N. Security Council session to censure Ukraine much as Russia was the previous night for their massive air assault. Russia's Defense Ministry says the attack will not go unpunished.

In a statement, the president saying, unless Congress takes urgent action in the New Year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs. We cannot let our allies and partners down. History will judge harshly those who fail to answer freedom's call. But, remember, this new funding for Ukraine is tied up in this debate back in Washington between Democrats and Republicans over immigration, over tightening the rules at the border. And it remains to be seen whether this new air assault will do anything to change the minds of skeptical Republicans who, at the end of the day, really just don't support new funding for Ukraine. They don't believe that it is in America's best interest. Just this last week, the White House said that it had approved the final amount of money that was left in the existing authorization, $250,000,000 in assistance to Ukraine, but essentially saying that that was the bottom of the barrel, that no new funding would be going forward unless it was passed by Congress. So, President Biden really hoping to use this moment to convince these lawmakers that that assistance is necessary going forward, and as he returns to Washington next week, that will certainly be at the top of his agenda as the war in Ukraine continues to rage on.

It said on Saturday that battles were continuing in the northern part of the enclave, while at the same time it was expanding its operations in the central and southern part of the Gaza Strip.At the same time, this means that many Palestinians are being displaced yet again. And what tends to happen is they seem to be gravitating towards Rafah, in the southern part of the Strip, which is becoming overcrowded, there is a scarcity of food. There are outbreaks of diarrhea, respiratory diseases and other diseases as well. And prices for basic goods, like flour and salt, are skyrocketing at the same time. Now, meanwhile, on Israel's border with Lebanon, there were around 15 launches fired from Hezbollah, this is the Iranian proxy in Southern Lebanon, towards Israeli territory. There was no report of damages or any fatalities, but Israel responded in kind. Now, 15, that is more than were launched towards Israel on Friday, when there were 10, but far fewer than the 50 that were launched towards Israel on Thursday. So, this war that isn't yet officially a war is still simmering. It's yet to boil over, but there are still concerns that at some point it might. Here in Tel Aviv, meanwhile, thousands of people gathered in Hostages Square to again put more pressure to keep up the pressure on the government to do all that it can to bring the 100-plus hostages still being held in Gaza after being abducted on October the 7th by Hamas and other groups, keep up the pressure on the government to bring all those hostages home. And almost opposite on the other side of the road at the Defense Ministry headquarters, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was holding a press conference. He said that he was determined to bring all those hostages home and fulfill the other key war objective of destroying Hamas, even if it takes months and even in the face of international pressure. He thanked the United States for the provision of weapons and for its support at the United Nations Security Council, but he said that the fighting would continue until its mission accomplished.

Recently, state media reported that North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un instructed the country's army, the weapons industry and others to accelerate war preparations in response to, quote, confrontation moves by the U.S. Some context, these remarks by Kim Jong-un come amid perceptions by North Korea of a strengthening alliance between the United States and South Korea, this as North Korea and Russia could possibly solidify their own relationship in the year ahead.

And while the Fed did raise rates pretty consistently through the year, it never really led to a downturn in the economy. Inflation is still stubbornly high and a problem for millions of American households, but it's continuing to recede towards the 2 percent target the Fed wants to see. And job growth has been solid over the past year, which has helped keep the unemployment rate below 4 percent, and markets, while the main indices, each closed out the year with double-digit percentage point gains. Joining me now is Ryan Patel, a senior fellow at the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University. So good to see you again. So, what to make of the year that passed? I mean, many thought that the fight against inflation would lead to a recession, but that didn't happen. Why did so many experts get so many things wrong?",

And consumer spending actually -- didn't decrease very much either. And so I think that kind of shocked with some of the numbers, but obviously we're still not out of the woods. But, definitely, when you talk about 2023 and double digit growth for the market, that is not something that many would predict and turns out to be a good year for those on the market.

But what does that mean when you had interest rates that's so high this whole year, you're going to start feeling that next year.And so when those that are having bankruptcies, companies being acquired more, some stability of those balance sheets are not there, we may see some of that from the banking sector.

And I think that also lets -- layoffs hasn't stopped either in certain places, even though unemployment is low. And so that kind of provides an uneasiness. I think what people really want to be really safe in these things is maybe less geopolitical tensions, a little more understanding of what the future lays out toward, and a little more security, I think, is the word. And I think that starts with trust and I think also means that consumers and people who are employers feel that, that they can start spending more capital, and seeing that.

That just means in 2025, you look up the ramp-up period. I think that's what I'm looking at, is how can you ramp up by 2025 to get into a higher growth perspective? So, next year, it would be a win for the markets to get anywhere from 8 percent to 10 percent growth. I mean, that's a win in any year, but especially next year, even though this year it was more. And so for me, I think that when I look at the next year, do I think it's going to be smooth sailings, absolutely not. I think we're going to see something similar we see this year. And I think the reason why I say that tensions geopolitically aren't going anywhere. I also think China is a big factor in this next year and how their economy does and, geopolitically, where they fit in this, all this on top of all the things we've seen this year thus far. So, when you throw all that in there, Kim, you're going to see a little bit of a roller coaster. But I think at the end of the day, when you think of the resiliency and see what happened this year, you would hope trade and many other governments get involved will provide some stability, as you and I mentioned, what we need to have a good year that sets up for 2025.",

Lessons were learned with each attempt, and valuable data was gathered to refine designs, though there's still widespread speculation that Artemis 3 will be delayed.But it's not just lunar landers going up. SpaceX sent satellites into space in rapid fire succession in 2023, launching, on average, once every four days. And in 2024, it's aiming even higher, shooting for launches 12 times per month. The goal is to expand its Starlink internet system and blanket the globe with high speed Wi-Fi.",

This year, though, authorities will certainly be operating with a heightened sense of alert.According to a security analysis obtained by CNN, a collection of law enforcement agencies at the local, state and federal level, including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, certainly the NYPD, saying that in light of the Israel-Hamas conflict, that's actually created a so-called heightened threat environment, specifically, U.S. intelligence officials are growing increasingly concerned about the threat posed by these difficult to predict lone wolf attacks. These are the very simple, unsophisticated attacks, very similar to what we saw play out New Year's Eve last year, which is when an individual that would later be described by law enforcement officials as a homegrown violent extremist actually attacked law enforcement personnel at one of those checkpoints in place, which is one of the reasons why they are increasing those security measures this year, according to the NYPD.
