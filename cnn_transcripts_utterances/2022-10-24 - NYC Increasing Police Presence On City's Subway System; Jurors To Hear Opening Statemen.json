A man can be seen pushing another man onto the subway tracks before running away. Luckily, the victim was not struck by a train but he was injured. The NYPD is still looking for the suspect. In response to recent incidents like this, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced the city would increase police presence on the subway and provide additional resources to the homeless and mentally ill. Adams told CNN's Chris Wallace that it's difficult to bridge the gap between the perception and reality of how safe the city is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS, (D) NEW YORK CITY:  We have an average of less than six crimes a day on the subway system with 3.5 million riders. But if you write your story based on the narrative that you're going to look at the worst of those six crimes and put it on the front pages of your paper every day, people are going to start to feel what David Patterson just stated. So I have to deal with those six crimes a day -- felony crimes -- and the perception of fear. CHRIS WALLACE, CNN ANCHOR, \"WHO'S TALKING TO CHRIS WALLACE?\":  You're saying that the crime problem in this city is more perception than reality?",

We're still having an average of six felonies a day with 3.5 million riders and now, 3.8 million riders if you look at the last couple of weeks.So that tells us a couple of things. Number one, the system is coming back. Number two, per capita -- per rider, the crime has actually increased. But what's jarring people is which crimes, and it's the stories about people being pushed in front of a train. It's the stories of the stabbings. It's when you look at the overall major crimes -- the seven felonies -- they're up by 40 percent. You have 1,800 incidents.

That's what you can do on the street -- it's geographical. The subway isn't a community. You can't use community policing. It's the system that binds communities together all over -- all over the city. So, concentrating there is very complicated policing. The key has probably always been fare evasion. The robbers generally don't pay to get on the system. Mentally ill people often don't pay to get on the system. Homeless people don't pay to get on the system. So, controlling fare evasion is a tool that they used for years to reduce crime until prosecutors said we're not going to prosecute that as an arrest. Write a ticket.

And now he is going to plead guilty, we understand, with no plea agreement, to all 24 counts.He was 15 years old. It was virtually almost a year ago that this happened. He was charged as an adult, though -- terrorism causing death, four counts of premeditated murder, assault with intent to commit murder, and the possession of a gun during the commission of a felony. Now, there is no question that he had mental issues because that has come out in evidence in his parents' trial. But I want to show you the drawing that he made at school. It was evidence in his parents' preliminary hearing. And this happened very shortly before this mass killing ensued. You will see, first of all, there's a drawing of a handgun. His parents had just given him a gun as an early Christmas present -- a semiautomatic. Underneath that he wrote \"The thoughts won't stop. Help me.\" And then there's a person that appears to be shot. They are bleeding. There is also a laughing emoji. Then there is a drawing of a bullet and he has written: \"Blood everywhere.\" And then finally, \"My life is useless. The world is dead.\" So, he is going to be in court today. Of course, the judge is going to have to ask him if this is freely and voluntarily given. His parents have been charged with involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors believe that they caused the killings by their gross negligence and their lack of duty toward the community and their son. There is a hearing on Friday because the prosecutor in his parents' case wants to include experts to show a pathway to violence that these parents created that pathway through. The prosecution will have evidence of alcohol use, marijuana use, and multiple affairs. The defense is fighting it very hard that constitutionally, it is prejudicial.
