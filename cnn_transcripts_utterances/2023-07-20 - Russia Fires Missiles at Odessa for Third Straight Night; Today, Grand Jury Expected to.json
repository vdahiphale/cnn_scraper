And we do believe one other witness is going to be going into the grand jury today. So, the grand jury has a little bit more work to do confidentially. The decision may already have been made at the Justice Department to bring a charge, an indictment through the grand jury against Donald Trump for actions related to January 6th and the 2020 election. Very likely, I say that because Trump gets that target letter. That's not something the Justice Department does lightly at all. And so now we wait. The grand jury could return an indictment really at any time that they're being convened, but their proceedings are quite secret. And on the Trump side of things, there really is a scramble happening right now to figure out what's going on. This lawyer, John Lauro, did come in to work on the January 6th side of the case. Kaitlan Collins was able to break that news last night. But John Lauro has already been involved around Donald Trump and the legal proceedings with him previously. He's been at work in Florida. He's based out of New York. He's been representing attorneys who are privy to some of the things that have become part of the cases against Trump, specifically that documents case in Florida.

It seems he will not. So, they are wrapping it up. That's clear enough. There are some loose ends. That seems also clear. So, I don't know exactly what dates the grand jury meets. Katelyn probably does. But it seems that they are finishing their work this week.

A lot of attention is focused on the false electoral slate, and given the witnesses that have been in front of the grand jury, that seems likely.But the statute that you mentioned, which is an unusual one, it was enacted shortly after the civil war, but it has been used particularly in the election fraud context and the context of violence that is used in order to deprive people of the constitutional right to vote. We don't know if that's exactly what this means, if that's exactly the scaffolding here for that particular statutory claim. It could be also depriving members of Congress of their privilege essentially of casting their votes. So, we don't really know, but it's all of a piece, and it seems that this is a statute that could actually capture a lot of the various schemes leading up to January 6th and that encompass January 6th as well.",

They have hundreds of state troopers that are now assigned to work on the border and he is essentially complaining about what they are doing to the migrants, how they are treating the migrants.And one of the things that he talks about in a memo that he writes to his bosses is that there's this razor wiring that they've put all across the water to try and prevent migrants from coming to land. And that razor wiring is actually causing a lot of destruction and harm to the people that are crossing. And what we have found that is that in some of the photos that were released, you could see there the injuries on this one individual across his stomach. He was caught in the razor wiring. They had to actually cut him out and bring him to land. The other thing what's going on is that because of the way they have placed the razor wiring, which is sort of on the more shallow end of the water, people are going to the deeper end to try and get to land, and they are drowning. And so there were five people who died during the week that this particular trooper was working the operation. But it's so stunning and really just unprecedented to see a state trooper complaining to his bosses about what they are doing on the border. But he's not the only one. We're told there have been several other complaints. They're complaining that they're not giving water to the migrants. The Department of Public Safety says that's not happening. We don't have that kind of a policy. But we know it's happening because I spoke to someone who was in a meeting where they were told don't give the migrants water.

Legacy admissions have come under increased scrutiny since the high court's decision because the practice usually gives preferential treatments to applicants who are the children of alumni, which also tends to favor white and wealthy candidates.Now, the private school, Wesleyan University in Connecticut, now joins an array of prestigious schools that have ended that practice, including MIT, Amherst, Johns Hopkins and Carnegie Mellon. And joining us now is the president of Wesleyan University, Michael Roth. President Roth, thank you very much for joining us. For years, activists have been calling for this step to end legacy admissions and even that playing field. Polls also show that a majority of the public just doesn't support this practice. I wonder, why did it take so long for your school to get there?",
