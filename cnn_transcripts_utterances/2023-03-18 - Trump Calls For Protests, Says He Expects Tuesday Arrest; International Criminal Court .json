      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Reid. Jim Acosta is off.Former President Donald Trump is calling on supporters to protest. He claims he expects to be indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on Tuesday. On his Truth Social page today the former president urged supporters to, quote, \"take back our nation,\" ahead of what he says is his expected arrest days from now. He went on to say, \"They're killing our nation as we sit back and watch. We must save America and protest.\" But he appears to be speculating. The prosecutors are wrapping up the investigation into hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels. We have learned that there is at least one witness still expected to testify on Monday. Sources tell my colleague Kristin Holmes and I that Trump's legal team has gotten no word from the Manhattan DA's office of any timing of a potential indictment. If he is indicted, though, the Trump defense team would be notified and then likely negotiate any surrender and an initial court appearance. Now another source says the former president has been pushing his team to get the base riled up over the idea of a possible indictment because he believes it would help him politically. We're covering all angles of this story from the Manhattan criminal courthouse where Trump could possibly be indicted, to Washington, D.C., where the political fallout from any arrest could impact the 2020 race for the White House. All right. Katelyn Polantz, our senior crime and justice reporter, is here with me. Katelyn, I want to start with you. What we know right now is that the former president's legal team has not been notified of any indictment. We know there's at least one more witness expected to go before the grand jury on Monday. So it appears he's speculating, but we also know in the past few weeks this investigation has suddenly heated up. Remind us what's going on in this case. Where are we?",

That is most evident because Trump was invited to testify to the grand jury, declined to. He's the person that's clearly targeted here. That doesn't happen under New York law until the very end.Of course, there is another grand jury witness. Your reporting is -- that person is coming in tomorrow, but it does look like we are headed to the point in time where the grand jury would be asked to approve the indictment. Now at this time, we don't know when that indictment will be approved and we also don't know what exactly would be in the charges. Trump doesn't either and his spokespeople are admitting that, but this is the type of case that actually is going to sound familiar to a lot of people because we've been talking about it now for several years. Michael Cohen previously admitted in federal court to campaign finance violations that are very much in line with what's being investigated here, these payments to Stormy Daniels back in the 2016 campaign. Now this is a state case so it's about state law, not federal, but at the time it was shocking that Donald Trump was named as individual one in that case. This would be an unprecedented scenario just like that if the grand jury does return this indictment.",

But this is a little bit different in that it is something that the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutors had looked at.They decided not to charge him. The Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, took this over after Cy Vance, his predecessor also didn't bring the case. And so this really has been one of those cases that the facts are there, it's had quite an arc as an investigation. It's gone up and down, will they, won't they, is not the same thing as January 6th that it's like a train that has moved ahead at a steady clip. The House bringing in witnesses. Federal investigators bringing in witnesses. The Georgia grand jury action. This is a much more up and down thing, and so what happens with this case, a lot of people, a lot of the lawyers that I've talked to are wondering, OK, if they bring this, can they win it if it goes to trial?

Then in 2018 when Donald Trump was president, that's when the feds picked it up, the Southern District of New York. But they could not indict Donald Trump at the time because he was the sitting president.The next important moment in the timeline is January of 2021. That's when Donald Trump left office and as I've reported, the Southern District of New York had a series of meetings at that point deciding, should we charge him with this criminally or not? We know the decision there was no. And then as Katelyn just said, there was about a year or so after that when Cy Vance was the Manhattan D.A. He did not charge this. And now here we are 6 1/2 to seven years later, and Alvin Bragg has made the decision to charge this. I think it's a fair point.

And as you and I have talked about, there's such a difference between Manhattan, where it doesn't appear that they have any new evidence or new witnesses, though they might, we could learn about that in the future.But down in Georgia, for example, there even though there are the same questions about locally elected prosecutors, there appears to be so much evidence. So, again, outstanding question, why now? Maybe the district attorney will answer that sometime soon. But even if they bring an indictment, how likely is it that that would go to trial?

In order to plead guilty, he'd have to go into court and say, yes, I committed a crime. How likely is it to result in a conviction, that'll depend of course on the strength of the evidence and the witnesses.Based on what we know, though, Paula, I think it's an absolute mistake to say this is some sort of slam dunk or smoking gun. We know there are checks, we know that the hush money was paid. But it's important to understand, paying hush money is not a crime. And it would not be a crime here. The crime is in how Donald Trump's people, his campaign logged that payment. If they falsely claimed it was attorney's fees, which they did, that could be a crime. But you have to tie that to Donald Trump himself directly, and really as far as we know, the only person who directly does that is Michael Cohen, who has all sorts of credibility issues.",

I think on the one hand Michael Cohen certainly had access to what was happening. He was right in the middle of this. He will be able to tell the jury what in his testimony exactly happened blow by blow and there's an argument that ever since he pled guilty he has come clean and he has been truthful.On the other hand, the cross examination of him is going to be blistering. You can count on Donald Trump's lawyers, if we ever get to this moment, cross examining Michael Cohen on the fact that he's been convicted of perjury, he's been convicted of financial fraud and tax fraud, having nothing to do with Donald Trump. That he has previously said that these payments were perfectly legal and had nothing to do with the campaign. And the fact, Paula, that Michael Cohen, with every fiber in his being, despises Donald Trump. He can't open his mouth without disparaging Donald Trump personally. We can argue about whether that's justified or not but it absolutely means that he's not going to be an impartial witness. So he's going to be a dynamic witness.

But I think the response from the Trump team, and people can decide what's more persuasive, is the reason he was lying there is the same reason he made the hush money payments in the first place, to try to avoid personal humiliation to himself and his family.And if that's the reason, why made a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, that's not going to be a campaign finance crime because then it would not count as a campaign donation.

It found that his cause of death was cardiovascular disease that was made worse because of a physical altercation that he had.

It did classify his death as a homicide, but this is an important note, too, in that report that it is, quote, \"not meant to definitively indicate criminal intent.\" Now back to that jailhouse video, Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney, is calling the video alarming. The family attorneys for Freeman's parents, they're claiming that the Shelby County Jail has a serious lack of mental health resources for the inmates there. And this is what Freeman's own mother had to say. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's one of the most dangerous jobs that police respond to, other than being shot at and car stops. And because the thing is, you are a rational police officer trying to deal with someone who is irrational for some unknown reason, and so you are trying to play this tug of war where you're trying to get them to see reason and they are just, you know, flipping out. It could be maybe they were on drugs, alcohol, or drugs and alcohol or suffering from a mental illness, maybe not on medication. They're completely amped up. I've had emotionally disturbed people who were half my size who had the strength of 10 people. So it's very dangerous. You're going into a lot of question marks, a lot of unknowns. And ultimately, the objective is to get that person to a mental health facility, to a hospital, right, so they can be emotionally and psychologically evaluated as well as medically evaluated.

Thirteen other states have enacted blanket abortion bans that include abortion medication. But Wyoming's move comes as a federal judge in Texas is set to rule in a case that could rescind federal approval of the widely used abortion drug. This week, we got our first indication of how that Amarillo-based federal judge may rule. During four hours of arguments, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk indicated that he is seriously considering rolling back the FDA's approval of that medication and may target regulatory changes that made abortion medication more accessible. Joining me now is Caroline Kitchener, who is reporting on this for \"The Washington Post. Caroline, thank you for joining us. You were in that Texas courtroom. And like the rest of us, you've been focused on those proceedings and the Wyoming ban. Did this ban in Wyoming on Friday, did it surprise you based on all of your reporting? CAROLINE KITCHENER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Not at all, Paula. I mean, I think what's really clear here is that abortion pills are posing a challenge to these abortion bans that a lot of people on the anti-abortion side just weren't ready for. It's a real difference from the last time that abortion was illegal across much of this country, before Roe v. Wade. Now there are pills. They're very easy to distribute. They're easy to send in the mail. And a lot of people on the anti-abortion side are just scrambling to try to figure out, how do we deal with this? How can we crack down on this effectively?

He did ask, you know, clarifying questions of both sides. But it became clearer and clearer as the hearing was going on, he was seriously considering the arguments that the anti-abortion groups were making. Arguments that Mifepristone is unsafe, arguments that the approval process was rushed. We know Mifepristone has been on the market for 22 years, approved by the FDA. It is very safe. Leading medical organizations widely agree. So the fact that he really seemed to be seriously entertaining these arguments I think is extremely significant.",
