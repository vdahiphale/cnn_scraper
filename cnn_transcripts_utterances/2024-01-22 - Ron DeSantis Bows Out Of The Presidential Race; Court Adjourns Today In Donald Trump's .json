It's the question on everyone's mind. Can she pull it off? What new polling says about Nikki Haley's chances. Also ahead this hour. Under pressure -- leaders around the world are urging the Israeli Prime Minister to make a deal while Benjamin Netanyahu is digging in his heels. And then later this hour -- shocking scenes. Storm Isha has stormed through Ireland and the United Kingdom with another storm on its heels -- where it's going and how long it will last. Welcome everyone, I'm Isa Soares live from London where it is 5 o'clock. Zain and Bianna are off today. Well head to toe -- head to head and toe to toe and no folds barred. The fight for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination has come down to a duel and it's likely the last chance for Nikki Haley to prove she has what it takes to successfully challenge Donald Trump. Less than 24 hours from now, voters will cast their ballots in New Hampshire where according to a new poll, Trump remains the dominant front- runner. But the dynamics have changed, maybe, some say even dramatically after Ron DeSantis announced he's bowing out of the race on Sunday. The Florida Governor wasted no time endorsing the former President but in turn thanked him for his support. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the judge sent that juror home and told him to take a COVID test. So, as the judge is explaining this, he gives the option to both sides of whether they want to continue and move forward today. Today, we expected E. Jean Carroll to rest her case and then go over to Trump's side. Well, Carroll's team said they were prepared to move forward with just eight jurors. Trump's side said they didn't want to. And Trump's attorney said that she had been exposed to COVID because she had dinner with her parents three days ago, and now one of them has tested positive. She, however, did take a COVID test this morning and tested negative. So, there was a discussion about this, the judge saying, because Trump's side had asked for a day, given the jurors' illness that at this point was unclear what it was, he would give them that day. But, you know, he also said it was not clear when they would start up again. He said the plan was for tomorrow. He was going to have all the jurors take COVID tests and report back to them. He also asked the parties to take COVID tests. And he said that he wanted evidence of their COVID tests that the court would be collecting. So, really trying to keep a tight eye and a tight rein on this issue. But you know, after Trump's attorney had raised the issue of a journey today, Trump was sitting beside her. He leaned over and whispered to her. She's not wearing a mask. And then she stood up and told the judge, actually, my client just reminded me that the New Hampshire primary is tomorrow, and so he does not want -- he wants to testify in this case, but he needs to be in New Hampshire. The judge saying he was not going to rule on that, telling Trump's lawyer that the circumstances may turn out that she gets her way, but he said they may not. So it's really not clear at this point of whether we'll be back in court tomorrow. I think a lot of that will turn on the COVID test of the jurors. Isa.",

At home, as you can see there, more than a dozen family members of hostages stormed parliament earlier Monday, demanding their loved ones' freedom. Prime Minister Netanyahu has outright rejected Hamas conditions, but without elaborating, he told families he has an initiative to secure the hostages' release. Meanwhile, Mr. Netanyahu faces growing international criticism after doubling down on his rejection of a potential two-state solution. A day after, you remember, a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden about Gaza's future. The Prime Minister posted on social media that Israel's security needs to be incompatible with Palestinian statehood.

That, the Israeli prime minister said, is untenable and would basically, you know, demean the sacrifices of Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the beginning of this war but he is also facing pressure. Protests were outside the Knesset today, not related to the hostages, but just people calling for elections. And we have seen that drumbeat of calls for elections starting to pick up, especially over the last week. We saw Gadi Eisenkot, the former Chief of Staff of the Israeli military, who is also now a member of the war cabinet, a close ally of Benny Gantz, saying that he believes there need to be elections in Israel within the next few months. And talking about s lack of trust in this government and certainly that lack of trust is something that is widely felt amid the failures of October 7th, amid Netanyahu's refusal to take responsibility for those failures and amid the fact that this war is still going on, that Hamas is still firing rockets from Gaza despite the fact that this ground offensive has now been underway for nearly three months now.",

Well, they've got it consolidated and at a very early point. The problem is, Trump is the closest thing to incumbent that we've had among someone who isn't the incumbent President. And that's helped him a lot in addition to the fact that he's beloved by the base. Now, Haley has done well and she's positioned herself nicely for New Hampshire. I don't know about beyond New Hampshire, but for New Hampshire, she fits the profile of the kind of candidate the Granite State has supported many times. What's interesting about New Hampshire is not just that the undeclared, the independents who don't identify with Democrats or Republicans can vote in that primary, it's that there are considerably more of those undeclared independents than there are either Democrats or Republicans. So, if those independents decide to get off the sidelines and come into that primary, which they can do as long as they're registered, then there could be a surprise there. But what I'm saying is, Haley winning would be a surprise or even coming really close.",

And she has become, in the last several days, more critical of Trump, even goes so far as questioning his mental fitness after he compared her to Nancy Pelosi. Will this be enough? Will this work in motivating what you were talking about, those undecided voters? Or was she left this attack too late in order to close that gap, you think, Larry?",

The base of the party, the registered Republicans who are going to be voting, they're going to be for Trump. It's just a question of what the margin is and probably it will be a very substantial margin. So, it all comes down to the number of independents or undeclared voters in New Hampshire that decide to vote. And you know, we'll see. New Hampshire has pulled surprises. If you ask me which primary or caucus in America would be most inclined to pull a surprise, I would say probably Iowa and New Hampshire. Well, Iowa didn't pull a surprise, but New Hampshire is a very different state than Iowa so it's worth paying attention to. And yesterday, of course, we saw Ron DeSantis dropping out of the race and pretty quickly he endorsed Donald Trump after trashing him for weeks.

And you see it every time one of these candidates who said thatTrump is the worst thing to ever happen to the United States, they drop out and then they endorse him within, you know, two hours. I think, basically, what we're seeing in the data already is that most of DeSantis' voters or these would-be voters, six, eight percent in New Hampshire, are moving to Trump. Now, Haley is getting a couple of additional percentage points. So, that might help her to come closer to Trump. But basically, I think that move has helped Trump, and DeSantis made sure of that, not just by endorsing Trump before the primary, but also by taking shots at Nikki Haley, which he did in his withdrawal speech.",

And one of them, after telling me this, went around the corner and gave a TV interview praising Donald Trump and saying he would support him. So, you see, it's fear. They fear what Trump can do. They fear Trump's base because Trump's base, they're the people who show up in their primaries so they can get re-nominated for Congress, for governor, for Senate. That's what they're afraid of.
