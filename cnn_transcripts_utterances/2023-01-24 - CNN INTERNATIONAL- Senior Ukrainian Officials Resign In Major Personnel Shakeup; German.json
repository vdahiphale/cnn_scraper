      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, a raft of resignations from top Ukrainian officials in what appears to be a shakeup in President Zelenskyy's government. Details in just a moment.California's in a state of shock after back-to-back mass shootings. We're live in Half Moon Bay. And a chilling account of a young woman in China as she warned that she could banish then she did. Beginning with a major shakeup of personnel in Ukraine's government. Several top officials have resigned or have been dismissed, some amid allegations of corruption. One adviser says the moves show President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in tune with society. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister is amongst those who have stepped down. The ministry posted his resignation letter online, calling claims against him unfounded and baseless. Zelenskyy's deputy chief of staff has also resigned. He didn't say why. Meanwhile, Germany confirms it has received a Polish request to export Leopard two tanks and says the possible approval will happen within necessary urgency. We'll have more on that in just a moment, but our Fred Pleitgen is joining us first with the developments within the government. And how are you reading this, Fred?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, to us it almost seems like there's a big purge going on here in the Zelenskyy administration and in the general spheres of government, not just here in Kyiv, Max, but certainly in other regions in Ukraine as well.And you're absolutely right. You had that one official who was taken into custody for alleged embezzlement from the Ministry of Development in the regions earlier this week or late last week. And certainly, that seems to have setoff this really wide motion of resignations and of sackings that's been going on. It's really quite interesting to see because there's a lot of deputy ministers among them. Like, for instance, the Deputy Defense Minister. You have the deputy head of the presidential administration, who was a wildly very popular figure here in Ukraine and certainly someone who was also very present. Just a couple of days ago, when we were at that building attack in Dnipro, where a whole building was blown away by a Russian rocket, he was the person the central government sent out there to really raise morale and to show his face there. So certainly, someone who is very prominent also here in Ukrainian politics, very prominent also, of course, in Ukraine's effort to defend against Russia. And I want to read you some of the regional governments where the Cabinet has decided on their dismissal or approved their dismissal. You have Zaporizhzhia right now, one of the frontline places. Kherson, of course, recently taken back by the Ukrainians part of that province, however, still in the hands of the Russians. Dnipropetrovsk, that's where the city of Dnipro is. That's really one of those central districts that's so important here to Ukraine and certainly a lot of the federal funds also go to that place as well. So we do see that this is a pretty wide shake up, it seems. And, you know, you were talking about that presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak who said this shows that President Zelenskyy is listening to the people, is in tune of the people. One of the other things that he said is he said that government officials need to understand that right now, in these difficult times, all of them have a job to do and they need to concentrate on those jobs and only on those jobs. So it seems as though that is a very clear message that the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is sending. And it's really unclear whether or not what we're seeing right now is the end of it or whether or not this could continue and that there could be more resignations, but certainly a large turnover in the past couple of hours, in the past couple of days within the power structure here in Ukraine and certainly within the Ukrainian government as well, Max.",

During a joint press conference with the NATO secretary general earlier, Germany's new defense minister said a decision will come very soon, but he also called the decision on whether to supply the tanks purely political. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us now. And these words from Russia, I mean, they are concerning to people in Berlin.

If we get a coalition of partners willing to go ahead with it, we'll do it without that approval from Germany.A lot happening here, but the bottom line is for Ukraine, this should have happened yesterday. They don't want this red tape, they don't want this bureaucracy. They consider it a waste of time and they say they need those tanks on the front line to fight this Russian counter offensive coming right now.",

I mean, they were stuck in these queues forever. They had, you know, special login codes that didn't work. And suddenly, on the resale market, these tickets that they were in line for were selling for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars, and they missed their moment. So I think what you will see today, Max, is a public shaming of this company.
