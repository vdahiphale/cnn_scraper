Today and Hiroshima, Biden was peppered with questions about the looming us default, something that wasn't really supposed to be on the agenda for these G7 meetings.Biden's already cut his trip short so we can get back to hopefully finalizing a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Leaders in Washington have about two weeks to avert a potential economic disaster. Today, lawmakers on both sides finally expressed some optimism about a deal. Let's take you now live to Japan with CNN's Marc Stewart. And Mark, this debt ceiling fight has become a focus of the questions President Biden is receiving something he probably did not look forward to. MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris, those questions are for good reason, because I cannot stress enough. If the U.S. has a debt ceiling default, not only would it likely put the U.S. economy into recession, it could create global financial shockwaves. And that's very relevant for members of the G7 not only for their own individual economies, but also for the collective task at hand for the G7 policy decisions, positions relating to the war in Ukraine, the impact of Russia as well as the growth and dominance of China. At the heart of these discussions, money is a big part of it. And that is why these G7 nations care so much about what's happening in the United States. As far as the President, he is getting questions about it in these early hours leading up to the G7. But he's not overly anxious to talk about it. Take a listen to this exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The question will be how far or how strict those caps will ultimately be. Also ways to ease the permitting process for energy projects. Those are among the issues that are on the table here. But even if they were to get a deal, they got to sell to the broader House and Senate Democratic and Republican caucuses that will be no easy task to try to go through all the processes and passes before potential default as early as June 1st, Boris.

We've been engaging for a good couple of months over a year now maybe with Oracle, who is our trusted technology partner on a program you may have heard about called Project Texas. And what Project Texas is, is a regime by which us user data will be stored on - by an American company in the cloud. That's something that's already happening.

But look, just to remind our viewers here of what prosecutors laid out in these court filings yesterday.Apparently, according to prosecutors, Jack Teixeira was warned several times. Three times beginning in September of 2022 to stop looking at classified information that really had nothing to do with his activities and his job duties on a day-to-day basis. In September, he was actually caught by his superiors taking detailed notes of classified information and actually stuffing them in his pockets. He was then asked whether he was going to shred that document. But that's significant, of course, because the notes that he took on this classified intelligence were eventually what he then went on to post online. Now, in October, just one month later, he was, again, in a classified briefing, attended a classified briefing at the Air National Guard there in Massachusetts. And he was asking very detailed and probing questions about classified intelligence that, again, had really nothing to do with his day-to-day job as an IT person for the Air National Guard there. And he was actually given a cease-and-desist order by his superiors to stop dealing in that kind of classified information. We'll fast forward to January, and yet again, he was caught by his superiors looking at a classified intelligence system that again did not comport with his day-to-day duties as an IT person for the Air National Guard there. So a lot of red flags here that the U.S. is investigating now that was part of, of course, this investigation into why this access to classified information was not curtailed. And we should note that prosecutors say he was well aware of the fact that he was doing something he was not supposed to do when it comes to classified intelligence, posting it on a social media platform where he boasted to the other users on that platform that the information was not public, a friend kind of responding there on the platform that he should continue to leak that sensitive military information for their amusement, Jim.",
