All right, new this morning, the U.S. is about to file criminal charges against hackers supported by Iran accused of stealing some internal documents from the Trump campaign and hacking into e-mails of one of Trump's allies, Roger Stone.

You'll recall in 2016, the Russians did something similar and it took many months for the U.S.   government to respond. There's a lot of hesitation and trepidation about what going public with the allegations would do in terms of affect the election.Now, what we're seeing from the FBI and the Justice Department is an aggressive attempt to sort of blunt the impact of this Iranian operation to, you know, recall the Iranians, according to CNN's reporting, they hacked Roger Stone, the long-time confidant of Donald Trump, and then used access to his e-mail account to try to target the Trump campaign. And this was in June. So, this is a really quick turnaround for the Justice Department and national security case because they're trying to warn the American public about these attempts to meddle in the election. And like I said, it's night and day from what we saw in 2016, in terms  of response to the Russian activity, John. BERMAN:  I'm sure Hillary Clinton could tell you, it's like night and day from their response to 2016. Sean Lyngaas, thank you so much for that. Kate?",

Congressman, thank you so much for coming in. So, the Justice Department expected to announce criminal charges against Iranian-backed hackers.Other charges have already been announced against people working for Russian state media accused of secretly trying to amplify right-wing American influencers, outside influence -- attempts it -- outside influence on U.S. elections, bad, no question. How effective are these influence and disinformation campaigns? What are you seeing? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  Yes, Kate, that's one of our challenges, right? It's really hard to tell how effective these things are, especially, you know, we're in a polarized situation where it seems like, you know, just shy of half Americans are completely dug in on one side, half on the other. But of course, that means that the races, the presidential race and other races get won on the margin. They get won on the margin and at least, at the presidential and a couple of, you know, locations with tens of thousands of people. So, of course, you know, they could have a real effect. And Kate, it's important to remember that, you know, people are sort of conflating the Russians with the Chinese and the Iranians. They are the active players in election interference. Two things to remember, number one, when we say election interference, we're not talking about messing with the voting machines or the tabulations. We're talking about manipulating social media in particular, but media in general, to try to promote misinformation, disinformation, propaganda that serves the interests of one of those states. And in that, second thing I would say is, in that, Russia is really the major league header. You know, we do see Iran, we do see China operating, but in very different ways than the Russians.",

Let's make sure that we are constantly naming and shaming those, the Russians, RT, those other propaganda fonts that are out there trying to influence our elections from abroad.I understand the counter-argument. We obviously want to be very careful about protecting sources and methods that we use to gather Intelligence or national security information. We've got to be careful about that -- absolutely. But one of the things that troubles me is that we're going to -- we're going to see more. I know because of my perch on the Intelligence Committee that we're going to see more examples of in particular Russian meddling in our information ecosystem. And I think it's really important that Americans see that for the comprehensive effort that it is. And -- and here's the key point. You know, the federal government is not going to fix this problem. We can name and shame the actors, but Americans need to, again, sort of sit back and say, you know, when I'm scrolling through -- doom-scrolling through some of the social media feed, and I'm feeling enraged when I'm convinced that the other side is not the opposition, but that they are traitors and un-American who is manipulating me. And that's why I think it's really important for Americans to know that the information they see -- look, it may be First Amendment protected political speech, it may also be something that the Kremlin desperately wants you to believe.",
