      "sentences": "I want to talk a little bit about where the candidates are going and why. And to do that I'm going to use the 2020 election map. Of course, President Biden won the last election.Today, Tim Walz and Barack Obama are going to Wisconsin. Wisconsin is one of the closest battleground states over the last few elections. Joe Biden won it -- if I can draw with yellow there -- by 20,000 votes in 2020. In 2016, Donald Trump won it by about the same margin, 22,000 votes. So you can see just how close it's become. And I want to talk about where they're going in Dane County today, Obama and Walz. They're going to Dane County, right there. Dane County is where Madison is. The University of Wisconsin Madison -- a lot of students. It's the capital. Government workers. College-educated population. That has become the sweet spot for Democrats in this election. You can see Joe Biden won Dane County big. He won 216 -- 260,000 votes, a margin of 181,000 votes. Now, in 2016, remember, Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin, but she won Dane County by a lot. However, it was 145,000 votes. That's a difference by my math of about 37,000 votes there. Remember that number 37,000 because remember what I told you about how close the election was in Wisconsin? Joe Biden won by 20,000. There was a 37,000-vote difference in Dane County alone. It's enough to explain how he won Wisconsin while Hillary Clinton lost. I want to go back to Dane County for one second just to show you how it's changed over the years. Again, 260,000 votes -- Joe Biden won -- the Democrats won in 2020. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won 217,000 votes. In 2012, Barack Obama won 216,000 votes. And in 2008, an election that Obama won by a lot in Wisconsin, 205,000 votes. So you can see how every four years Democrats have been growing their vote in Dane County increasingly becoming one of the most important counties in one of the most important states in this election -- Sara.",

Of course, Donald Trump has laid out what I think is a very moderate and longstanding position in the Republican Party on abortion. He supports the three exceptions: race, incest, and life of the mother. He's for some reasonable limits. He's a strong supporter of IVF.

A truck runs a red light and smashes into another vehicle. I mean, smashes. The man in the vehicle that was hit is in critical condition. Police are searching for four teenagers they say caused the crash and fled the scene. So a woman in Australia got stuck upside-down between two rocks for seven hours all because she lost her phone. She dropped it and was trying to get it back when she fell into a 10-foot crevice -- or is that crevasse? When rescuers were finally able to get her out, she had only some scratches and bruises. The phone is still between the rocks. This reminds me of sort of like every other day in my car when I drop my phone in between -- I've had to chew off my arm to get the phone at one point, Kate.",

You just heard the reporting there from our Katie Bo Lillis that therewas this -- what appears to be an intentional leak, not a hack, of highly classified intelligence documents describing how Israel is preparing for a retaliatory strike on Iran. You are a ranking member on this committee. What can you tell us about this? Is there any new information you can share about how they determined this looks like it's an intentional leak? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY) (via Webex by Cisco):  I don't think I have any new information, but I think that the FBI and others are doing the kind of investigation to find out how and who leaked this information. I think that's very serious, and I want this investigation conducted, and whoever did leak it should be brought to justice.",

I know that everyone is looking and waiting, it seems to me, that waiting to see what happens in this election that takes place in November.But look, it's -- the world is a better place with Sinwar gone. And what we need right now is those hostages, including the American hostages, to be released. Hamas need to release them. And what -- you know, I still think what caused the war is something that should bring us all together to have peace. What caused the war, in my estimation, was the fact that Saudi Arabia and others in the region were negotiating peace with Israel and negotiating the Israel -- and stating Israel's right to exist. That's all changed what had been taking place over the last 75 years. So what we need is all of -- you know, working -- and it has been proven to me when we saw the attack by Iran on Israel that the Saudi Arabians, the Jordanians, the Egyptians have been working together to stop the attack by Iran. So we need to work together with those in the region so that we make sure that Hamas does not exist, and it becomes clear to anyone who rises in leadership in Palestine -- in Gaza or as far as for the Palestinians that they do not follow the ways of Sinwar. That's not good for the Palestinian people. And that they have a leader that moves along with Saudi Arabians and others saying and understanding Israel's right to exist. That being said, Israel also, and we have to find a way. And I think this is the message that Sec. Blinken is going to -- going to give also. There is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. There must be ways that Israel has to make sure that food and water, and electricity getting in. The humanitarian concerns are grave and deep and we must have unity around the world to make sure that people -- innocent people will not suffer.",
