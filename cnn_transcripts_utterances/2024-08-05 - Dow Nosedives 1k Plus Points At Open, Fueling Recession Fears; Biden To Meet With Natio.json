Around the world, stock markets are tumbling as investors confront a sobering concern, as the U.S. economy suddenly slowing much faster than expected. Plus, we're in the final hours of the so called deep stakes. Who will Kamala Harris choose as her running mate? The list of contenders, we're told has been narrowed down to three, with an online announcement possibly coming at any moment. And an alarming spike in tensions in the Middle East.Israel is bracing for new strikes from Iran and its proxies. A few hours from now, President Biden will convene his national security team at the White House, amid growing fears that the region is racing toward a wider conflict. We do start though on Wall Street, where stocks open down more than 1,000 points this morning, following Friday's dismal jobs report. The fears of a slowing U.S. economy have sent shock waves through global markets and stoke fears of a recession back here in the U.S. Joining me now, CNN business editor-at-large, Richard Quest and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Richard, let me go to you first. What's going on here? Is this just folks venting their frustrations at the Fed here in the U.S.? What do you think?",

Rate rises from just about zero to 5.5 percent, and that's taken its toll, and it's taken this long, if you will, to work through the full effects into the economy. And now people are realizing the market investors that things are slowing down, possibly faster than the Fed had anticipated. And as a result, and -- and you see this, Jim through the unemployment numbers, inflation, the hard work on inflation has been done, but the other side of that side -- scale is that unemployment is going up.This was entirely predictable at one level. If you will, this is the Fed's medicine working. We can argue and debate whether it's taken longer than we first thought. The monetary lag of nine to 15, 18, months, but this is what you get. If you have so much interest rate increases in a short period of time, it will take its toll. And crucially, the market, in a sense, is now seeing it. It was already hyped up and doesn't like what it sees.",

But at the same time, you don't want to restoke inflation because of this dual mandate.

Where do you want your overshoot to be? Do you want it to be on the downside or on the upside? Well, my guess is now they're starting to get a little bit more concerned about Main Street than Wall Street, because they also don't want to be seen to be bailing out the market. Greenspan did it. Bernanke did it up to a point. They don't want to be seen to be knee jerk bailing out, because the markets had a few tough days when Main Street needs the help, then they'll give it.",

Really appreciate the time.In the meantime, tomorrow, Vice President Kamala Harris and her soon to be known running mate are expected to launch a mammoth battleground campaign blitz covering seven swing states in nearly 5,000 miles in just five days. But first she faces the most consequential decision of her campaign, who will be that running mate? At this hour, source of South CNN, there are three front runners, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. And CNN's Jeff Zeleny has all the details for us, unless Jeff it has narrowed down even further in the last minute or two. What's the latest? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: A lot of Democrats believe it has narrowed down even further. And if that thinking is to be believed, and we've covered a lot of these, so the choice is Vice President Harris's, no one else's. But there is a considerable thinking this morning that it is between the two governors, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota and Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Of course, the list was wider just a few days ago. But if you look at those two governors, they have been at the center of a lot of this. And one thing I am told that the Vice President is looking for is chemistry, core values and competence. An advisor told me over the weekend, the three C's, and I said, well, what are the three C's? But chemistry, I think, is first and foremost among them. Look, she knows what it's like to be vice president, because she is vice president at the Naval Observatory, of course. And just four years ago this week, Joe Biden called her and said, we're going to have a partnership. Only she knows if he lived up to that bargain. It seems like it from the outside, but that's what I'm told she is really trying to pick someone here with chemistry and someone who shares her values.",

For example, they -- they kind of throw the kitchen sink all at once that last attack took place in April. They threw multiple different weapons platforms, but the U.S. and -- and Israel forces were able to knock them down. If they decide to stagger those attacks, if they continue to come from the north and Lebanon, for example, from Syrian proxies in Syria, coming from Iran over the horizon, and then also from the Houthis in the south, you have a four channel way that they can attack inside of Israel. They could also take their proxies and say, look, you focus on American defense platforms, and go after American ships that are in the Mediterranean and in the Persian Gulf that are protecting the skyways there as well. And -- and they could complicate that. So Israel has taken advantage of the fact that Israel's enemies have not been creative, and I think they're hoping that that will be the same case this time.",

Wants a national abortion ban with no exception for rape or incest, says America needs a Caesar. I think any of our candidates would -- would come off as, one, showing his extremism, showing what a bad decision it was by Donald Trump, who's older and potentially couldn't make it through another term, and J.D. Vance would become President of the United States.I think any of our candidates would -- would do very well. You have to play offense, because he -- he tries to say, well, I never said that. And like we've seen the videos of him saying these kind of things that I just mentioned, and he'll say, I didn't say that, very Trumpy. But our -- our candidates are very skilled, very talented. They'll hold his feet to the fire. They'll play offense. But I think mostly, Jim, what we have to do is provide that aspirational message of how we can move on from the toxic politics, the chaos, the destabilizing effects of Trump, we want to move on. And you may not agree with everything Kamala Harris stands for or her vice president, but my goodness gracious, don't we want to move on. Have a conversation, start healing. And I think our VP candidate against J.D. Vance, will get that message out. Americans want aspiration. We want to move on. We want to do great things. We want to do big things. Kamala has already tapped into that, and I think her VP, whoever she picks, will be able to ride that wave with her.",

Man, I think -- I think Kamala Harris is living rent free and Donald Trump's head right now. And that's a terrible thing as a candidate, as an athlete, as a performer, if you're not focused on the moment that you're in, and you're -- you're rattling around in your head with a lot of negative thoughts, you know, you're not going to do very well.And that's what you're seeing come out on -- on Truth Social, his comments that we started this interview about the -- the economies, Kamala Harris's fault. And my goodness, gracious, if it's over 100 degrees in Columbus, Ohio, it's going to be Kamala Harris's fault. So people are ready for that. I hope she keeps pressing him on the debate, though, because it really illustrates his -- his insecurities, deep, deep insecurity that he has, generally speaking, and it tries to cover it with bravado, but he's a deeply insecure guy. And I think you need to keep pressing that button. And I think she will, and she'll do humor, class, elegance, like she always does. And I think this is going to be a good election for -- for weeding out the toxic politics we've been dealing with since the Vietnam era.",
