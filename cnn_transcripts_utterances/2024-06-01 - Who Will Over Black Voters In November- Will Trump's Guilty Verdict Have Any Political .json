And in a two way race, Biden had 63 percent support with Trump getting 23. If these numbers were to hold up by Election Day, Trump would have the highest level of black support for any Republican presidential candidate in the last 60 years. From a national scale, a Pew Research poll finds Trump polling 18 percent of support from black voters, which is a dramatic shift from 2020 when Trump received only 8 percent of the black vote against Biden, that itself was a slight uptick from the 6 percent he received against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Similarly, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found a 12 percent drop in the number of black Americans saying they are certain they will vote in this election cycle. The drop in voter turnout is even sharper among young black voters who mostly disapprove of Biden's job performance. To mobilize support among this critical voting bloc, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a rally in Philadelphia this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So I can't speak for all black people. But personally, I don't agree Donald Trump is not a political prisoner. He's not someone who, you know, died unjustly at the hands of the police. He's a privilege former president who broke the law, and he got held accountable for it. And that's the way it should be.

When I was speaking back in January, you know, somebody asked me at Fox, actually, if the border was going to be an issue in November, the reason I said yes was because of the conversations that I've been having with, you know, activists in Chicago with, you know, people in neighborhoods in New York. So my rhetoric comes from the people. And that's what happened in the movie Bulworth, his rhetoric was coming from the people, these elected officials, you know, need to sit down and have more conversations with individuals.

He's fighting for himself. That's what how he should frame this. I don't think he should dwell on this one. One point on sentencing, Michael, you know, sentencing is scheduled for July 11. One of the reasons that Trump is raising all this money is he's raised the specter of being thrown in jail and being a political prisoner, and so on. My guess is, and I don't know, I'm not a lawyer you are, I think it's highly unlikely that he's going to get sentenced to prison, in this conviction. And if the sentence is something less than that, if it's probation, for example, I suspect that his argument will lose some of its efficacy, even with the bass kind of takes some of the wind out of the thing. So I -- you know, as we both said, I just don't know how this is all going to play out. But I do think the thing to watch is how the two candidates deal with it. Does Trump continue to fulminate in the kind of irrational way he did yesterday? He won't be a very good candidate, if that's the case.

I loved the independent thinking.Hey, put the social media up while Elie is still here. I may need to lean on him for the response. What do we have? The form is just the jury vote. It does not have to have all the details and testimony. Those are in the court records and transcript. Like it or not that is the law. Mike, I totally disagree. It puts Trump at a disadvantage.

Here are the reasons for her verdict. You just check a box.But I've done cases like this where there are subcomponents to the charge. I used to do racketeering cases. And you have to prove a certain number of racketeering acts. And we would ask the jury in the form, which of these racketeering acts do you find proven unanimously or not, A, so that the jury will be able to tell us specifically how they made their finding, B, so the defendant has noticed, and C, so we're covered on appeal? And now this is going to be an appeal issue that frankly prosecutors could have avoided if they just said, hey, jury, tell us the specific one of those three menu options which you chose.",
