It comes from Semafor, the new digital media startup.And so joining us now is Ben Smith, the site's editor in chief, who was formerly of \"BuzzFeed,\" \"Politico\" and the influential media column at \"The New York Times.\" Now that we've made it through your resume, this reporting is really interesting because this is something that is constantly being talked about on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are asked about it almost every day. We've talked to many of them about it here on the show. But it seems to fit with the Biden campaign ethos, which was basically, in two words, ignore Twitter. And now they seem to be ignoring Twitter's new owner. BEN SMITH, CO-FOUNDER AND EDITOR IN CHIEF, SEMAFOR: Yes. And thanks for having me on. Thanks for pointing out that I cannot hold a job. The - yes, I mean I think what's so interesting is right now I think a lot of Democrats are very freaked out that Elon Musk, you know, the richest man in the world, buys this powerful platform for speech and just -- he's immediately tweeting all sorts of just kind of far-right jokes and in-jokes, theories. And the White House doesn't -- I think just isn't that focused on it. I mean Biden became president in part by telling his staff, ignore Twitter. Twitter represents not the right but Twitter represents the left of his party. You know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gets all the retweets. Joe Biden doesn't. And I think one of the reasons he won his primary was by realizing that there were many, many voters who were, you know, less online, older, less educated, more diverse than the group of people on Twitter, and that those were the people who would vote for him. And so I think he's just as happy to have Twitter turn into something else and for the - for Democrats to ignore it.",
