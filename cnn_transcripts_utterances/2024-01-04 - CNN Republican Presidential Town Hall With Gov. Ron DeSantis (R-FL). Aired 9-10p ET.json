      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to Iowa, where the first contest of the 2024 presidential race is now just 11 days away.We are live at Grand View University for a special night of back-to- back CNN town halls. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And, tonight, two of the leading Republican candidates are here, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Governor and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. They will take questions from Iowa voters, setting the stage for their first one-on-one presidential debate live on CNN here in Iowa next week. We're giving both candidates opportunities to make their closing arguments to Iowans as they battle against one another and against the front-runner in this race, former President Donald Trump. First up tonight, Governor Ron DeSantis, who is aiming for a strong showing in Iowa with the support of the state's governor, Kim Reynolds. He will answer questions directly from Iowans on the issues that will help determine who wins the Republican nomination, and I will have some questions of my own. In the audience here with me tonight are voters who say that they plan to participate in the Iowa Republican caucuses, both registered Republicans and voters who plan to register as Republicans. To find tonight's questioners, we cast a wide net, soliciting help from various organizations, including business groups, farm associations, parent groups, young professional organizations, religious groups and also conservative advocacy organizations. Guests of the DeSantis campaign and Grand View University are also here in the audience tonight, but they won't be asking any questions. We have asked everyone here to be respectful to each other and to Governor DeSantis, so voters in the room and you at home have a chance to hear from the candidate himself. Now, please welcome Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thank you. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)",

It's great folks there.To have these kids go back the first day after Christmas break, this is a tragedy to lose a sixth grader. My wife and I, we have a first grader, a kindergarten and a preschooler. And so when you send your kids to school, you want to be focused on the academics and the activities. The physical safety should not be an issue with our schools. And parents need to have confidence in that. So, I think what we will do is support efforts like I did in Florida. When I became governor, it was on the heels of the worst school shooting that we had had in the history of the state. And I was charged with implementing reforms to be able to provide security for schools. So, we have done everything, but, like, school resource officers, help with hardening, but also help identify students that are exhibiting really problematic behavior. One of the tragedies that came out of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas back in Florida was that, before people even had identified who did it, most of the people in that community already knew who did it, because there were so many warning signs. We're getting more information about what happened in Perry, but it seems like this -- this student had some serious, serious problems. We do things like behavioral threat assessment to take this seriously, so that there can be an intervention, if they're committing criminal acts, to hold them accountable. And if they have mental health problems, you have got to deal with it.",

Has he gone to all 99 counties?  Heck, has he even gone to nine counties?  That's not the way to do it.So voters get to make the decision.  Don't let the media pick the candidate.  Let voters decide.  And this is a long process.  I've put in a lot of time in Iowa because I think doing 99 counties is the way it's done here.  People want to be able to ask you questions.  They want to be able to shake your hand.  So I've done it because that's what Iowans expect, to do the full Grassley. We're going to be doing a lot of stuff in the subsequent states. You've got to win a massive amount of delegates.  And we're going to be in a situation where we're going to be competing.  And it's going to be a long, arduous process. But Iowa starts it off.

You had a red wave in Iowa and Florida because Governor Reynolds led and because I led.  And we won historic victories.  The rest of the Republicans in the Senate and House crashed and burned.Donald Trump's candidates, hand-picked candidates, lost because the Democrats have a playbook that they can run.  It was effective in 2018.  It was effective in 2020, '21, '22, and even this year in 2023. So don't repeat that. The Democrats want Trump to be the candidate.  They are going to talk about all the legal stuff, January 6th.  That will be what the election will be about.  You don't want it to be a referendum on Trump and the past.  You want it to be a referendum on Biden's failures, on our positive vision for this country. I offer that.  And, oh, by the way, you need somebody that can serve two terms.  You're going to go in there as a lame duck president, even if you could get elected?  I don't think that that's how it works there.  We need a change agent in Washington.  We need somebody that's going to go in there, actually unwind the bureaucracy, which Trump promised to do and didn't do. We need a president that's going to stop the border invasion by building a wall, which Trump promised to do but didn't do.  We also need somebody that's going to be willing to deport illegal aliens. Donald Trump said he would in 2016.  He'd have the largest deportation in history.  He deported less than Barack Obama did in Obama's first term. I will actually get the job done.  And I will hold the Mexican drug cartels accountable for the carnage that they are causing in this country.  They are killing tens of thousands of our fellow Americans. When I'm president, we're going to designate them as foreign terrorist organizations.  Donald Trump had an opportunity to do that.  He didn't do it.  I will. (APPLAUSE)",

I'm the only one running for president that actually served overseas, in a war, in the Iraq campaign. They didn't dress. They didn't wear uniforms. You had to positively identify. People would have hostile actions, hostile intent. And then you would be able to engage. So, it's going to be the same type of thing. It's not going to be -- and it's anything like we do even domestically, when a police officer would engage. So it's not going to be done the way the media saying it's going to be done. But I will tell you this, I've been down there. The cartel will cut holes in the actual border wall and they will come through with fentanyl. So, my question to you and other critics who don't say, how many fentanyl deaths are enough? Are we just supposed to sit here and let this happen? I think the president not only has a right, I think you have a responsibility to fight back against these people. I am sick and tired of seeing the carnage in this country. And in my travels through Iowa, I've met Angel Parents, people that have lost kids to fentanyl overdose. And a lot of times, these are not drug addicts. These are may be a college student that is stressed out during exams so they buy a pill thinking it's going to help 'em get through the night. And it turns it's laced with fentanyl. That could be enough to poison that student to death. And so, this is shattering families. It's shattering communities. The people in D.C., they just shrug their shoulder. They could care less about what's going on. Well, I care about this. I care about defending American communities and American families. And so, yes, they have killed more Americans than all the terrorist groups in this -- in this world combined over the last five years. When is enough enough? (APPLAUSE)",

That creates an anchor in the society so that you then can't deport the illegal aliens who came in. It's an incentive to come illegally. That was not the intention of that. So, yes, we oppose -- we support American citizens, obviously. But when people are coming illegally, they do not have a birthright at that point.

Not only should we appreciate veterans, but also a lot of the spouses that have served. Veterans have carried a big load. It's a family effort, and we owe debt of gratitude to a lot of people.A couple of things we do. One, we need to get interest rates down. The reason why we have high interest rates is because government has borrowed, printed, and spent ungodly sums of money starting in March of 2020. Both parties are responsible for it, and that has driven the interest rates up. Right now, the average price home, your monthly mortgage payment is twice as much as it would have been five years ago if you had a mortgage on the average price home. Now, some of it is home prices have gone up, but a lot of it is because of the interest rates. The other thing we got to do, we need more housing supply in this country. I actually signed legislation in Florida to greenlight projects, particularly for workforce housing, because you have a situation where in some parts of the country, if you're a police officer or teacher or a nurse, you can't afford to live in the community where you work. So we can expect cops to have to commute an hour and a half just to go to some of these areas, and then you have rural communities where there's a deficit of housing as well. So, lower interest rates and more housing supply. But if we don't solve this issue and it's housing as part of it and buying a home. But I think there's larger issues about people, young people that are working hard, doing everything right are falling behind. It's almost cost prohibitive to raise kids in this economy. That's taking the American dream away. We got to restore the American dream. And it starts with getting this fiscal house in order. In Florida, I've been governor. We've actually paid down 25 percent of our state's debt. I've cut taxes every year. Our economy is ranked number one of all 50 states by CNBC. We lead the nation in net in migration. Income growth is top of the charts, number one in education. So we've shown how it's done. And we need to bring that same level of success to the United States of America.",

And what I would want is I just -- I think I would eliminate the IRS, have a single rate and just do like a flat tax. I think that would be the ideal tax system to be able to do take away the distortions.And what happens is Florida is a good example of this. We have low tax and we cut taxes, and yet we attract more investment and our economic base expands. So I run these big budget surpluses where we're paying down debt by lowering rates. I think you look at some of the other states that are high tax states, they tax, they cause businesses to flee and individuals to flee. Then they go back to the well and they tax more. And it's like a vicious cycle. So, low rates, broad base, ultimately is the best and most conducive to economic growth.",

Now, you have a difference of opinion in this primary, because Donald Trump has said that pro-life protections, even at the state level, are a -- quote -- \"terrible thing.\" And he said that in relation to bills like what Iowa did, the heartbeat bill. Now, this is a guy that was at the March for Life in January of 2020. And he said that all life was a gift from God. He said the unborn was made in the image of God. He said that there should be protections. That's what he was saying when he was president at the March for Life. Now he's saying it's a terrible, terrible thing. So, how do you reconcile those two views? Did he flip-flop? Did he not believe it at the time? But then, to go even further, he actually has said, elevate this issue to the federal government. What he wants to do is find a time. I think he floated like 18 or 20 weeks. Have that be the limit, but then override any protections that states have done that are more than that.

Kennedy said people can look back on their life with a great deal of satisfaction saying, I served in the United States Navy. And so this is something that I think is very important.

And I've been able to see that firsthand traveling to all 99 counties in Iowa.  I've also been able to see it in my home state of Florida.  I mean, some people that aren't from Florida, you know, you think South Beach or you think the attractions in -- in Orlando or you think, if you're in the Midwest, a lot of these places, themselves which are great areas. But, you know, we have a lot of rural counties in our -- our state.  I was the first governor to do public events in all 67 Florida counties. There were people that had never seen a governor before in some of our rural counties.  We've worked to do rural broadband, infrastructure, things that are really, really significant. So, a couple of things.  One, I understand the importance of agriculture for our country.  It's not just an economic issue, food security is a national security issue.  And I think we're more secure and better when we have family farms that are viable and that can pass that down from generation to generation.  I don't want everything to be massive corporations. We need to eliminate the death tax on these family farms so that they can pass it down without getting taxed. (APPLAUSE)",

There's a puddle on your property and that's waters of the United States.  EPA can come in and have federal jurisdiction.  No way.  That is not right.But that use of bureaucracy benefits the entrenched big companies at the expense of the smaller companies.  So I think part of the answer for rural America is small business and the emphasis on that.  And I think that's the backbone of whether our economy is going to succeed or not. You know, you've got these guys on Wall Street, Silicon Valley, you know, that's fine.  But if we don't have these small businesses in these local communities that are able to succeed, we're not going to have the American dream.",

So, I think on the policy, you're going to see -- you're going to see differences.I'll tell you this, though, you know, we had a hurricane hit, category 5 Hurricane Ian in southwest Florida.  Some of you know because some of you have been down there.  And it devastated southwest Florida.  It knocked out a bridge to Pine Island.  It knocked out the causeway going to Sanibel.  We had millions and millions of people without power. Now we had a great response.  We had everyone lined up, quickest power restoration in history, search and rescue, all these things.  You know, a Democrat in the White House with the media who would love to do it, you know, he could have tried to politicize it.  And I'll give him credit, he didn't try to politicize it. I think when you have situations where there is national tragedies or disasters, trying to politicize it doesn't work.  You've got to put the people first.  And I will notice, with respect to the media, the media -- the national media, they were down there, they -- they wanted to make it an issue politically. I mean, I was running for re-election.  That's what they wanted to do. When they're asking and people are saying, oh, my gosh, they -- they had all these rescues, all the power went on in record time.  We even rebuilt the bridge to Pine Island.  People said it was going to take six months.  We took control of it at the state level.  We rebuilt it in three days.  Once they saw -- the national media saw, that things were going well and that people were appreciative of the response, you couldn't find national media outlets in Florida if you had a search warrant.  They did not have a story.  Their story was to try to create conflict and to try to -- try to demean the response.  So, that's just the reality. But I will say this, you know, the White House under Biden, they worked with us to put the people first.  And as president, when we have these national disasters, I don't care if it's a Republican governor like Kim Reynolds, who I'm very close with, or a liberal governor like Newsom, who I've got some differences with, when you have these situations, leaders got to lead and you've got to put politics aside.

      "sentences": "Well, thank you, Deanna.I think this is a huge issue, and this is an issue that in every corner of Iowa, people are asking about. I mean, this is not just something where a few people are talking about it because we've seen this issue all across the country. We're going to do a couple of things. One, we're going to support efforts like we did in Florida to provide more mental health resources in our schools. You know, sometimes there's a stigma about seeking help. My wife, the first lady of Florida, has launched a program to focus more on resiliency, and it's something that athletes, famous people have gotten behind and talked about, and it's created I think a lot of positive feedback with that. One thing we're not going to allow, though, in the schools or we shouldn't allow is the politicization of mental health or to try to use mental health to advance an agenda. And unfortunately, you see examples of this. There's like woke ideology in some of this. Can we please not try to politicize everything in this country? So I think for the youth, I think it's important. The other thing I think is really important, we need to do a better job for our veterans. We have 22 suicides a day still with veterans. And as somebody who served post-9/11, we didn't have a draft. You put a huge burden on a very small percentage of this country. People did multiple deployments -- Marines, Army, Special Forces. That is not normal to be deploying that much. You are going to come back. People are going to have invisible wounds of war. We do good about seeing if somebody has a physical wound. We haven't done as well about those invisible wounds. So, how do you deal with it? The V.A. ultimately is not going to be able to solve this problem by itself. It's too big a bureaucracy. It's too cumbersome. I'm going to fire a lot of people in the V.A. I'm going to have accountability. They need to do a better job for the veterans. But we're going to do like we did in Florida, where we're going to take a model that my wife started with respect to welfare benefits. We're going to apply to veterans benefits, something like a care portal. A veteran goes in. Maybe they have post-traumatic stress. Okay, the V.A. can do what they want. But they put that in this portal, we're going to invite veterans groups, charities, churches, businesses, individual volunteers, people that want to help the veterans. It's going to go out. Guess what you're going to see? You're going to see these folks come. They're going offer very quick help. Sometimes, it's mental health services where we have veterans clinics around this country. I've got charities in Florida that train service dogs to be able to help veterans who have symptoms of post-traumatic stress. You know what? The suicide rate goes down. Maybe it's something as simple as somebody that lives in the neighborhood that's part of this portal, they say that this veteran is having a tough time, maybe they just go to his home and say, you know what? I just want to see if you're okay. Can I take you out to lunch? That can be something. Just the fact that you show you care, that can be enough to avoid a suicide right there. But the bureaucracy is not going to save us. We need to use the V.A. as a conduit for all these other great resources, because in every part of Iowa and in every part of Florida, and I think most parts of this United States, people value the service of these veterans, and they want to help. We just got to link the veteran to all the services that can be utilized and all the resources that are out there. (APPLAUSE)",
