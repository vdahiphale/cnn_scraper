The White House says they're concerned about some 100 Palestinians reportedly killed in this joint Israeli operation.

And so, Israel's biggest concern is how do they protect the Israeli people from this ever happening again? Biden needs to understand that if he expects Israel to listen to them. Instead, he's lecturing them. That's not the way you're going to get Israel to listen. You have to look at what Israel's top agenda is -- it's to protect the Israeli people. Biden has to show that what he's asking them to do will protect the Israeli people, and he should want that for them. Instead, he's so focused on the people in Gaza, yet he hasn't gone to any of the regional friends to say, why aren't you doing anything to get Hamas to stand down? Why aren't you doing anything to get Iran to stop? Let's not forget, Iran is at the center of all of this. Why has Joe Biden not put sanctions back down on Iran fully? He's yet to do that.

HALEY: Well, what I'm saying -- well, I said from the very beginning when there were 14 candidates on the stage, that any one of the 14 would be better than Joe Biden. Right now, you see what's happening with Joe Biden. I think for the good of the country, the Democrats need to find a new candidate. They know that. Everybody knows that. And I think there's a time -- I don't think that Joe Biden is going to end up being the nominee.

Trump has spent $50 million in campaign donations on his personal legal fees? That is not the -- that is not what you need to win an election.

But Jake, as a senior administration official, bluntly put it, those estimated some 1.3 million people that are in that area, they simply have nowhere to go and there's a lot of skepticism about this idea that Benjamin Netanyahu has put forth about evacuating all of those people in that area before making a ground incursion. Just in terms of whether that is even physically feasible, that's something that U.S. officials have serious concerns about an in terms of that hostage operation overnight that successfully rescued two hostages in Rafah, the Biden administration is deeply concerned about the reports of some hundred Palestinians that were killed as a part of that operation. The high stakes for the civilians that are in that area in Gaza and particularly as a part of this operation, has been deeply worrisome to this administration as well. Now, it was interesting, Jake, when the king of Jordan actually got to the White House, a reporter shouted at the president, President Biden, is Bibi, is Netanyahu taking your advice?
