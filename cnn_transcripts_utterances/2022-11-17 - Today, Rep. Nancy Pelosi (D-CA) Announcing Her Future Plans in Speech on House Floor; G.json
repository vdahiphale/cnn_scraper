She did not attend that meeting.So, members walking out of here didn't have any idea about what ultimately she will decide to do. In fact, she just walked into the Capitol as well. She was asked questions about what she plans to say, how she plans to address it. She wouldn't answer any questions. So, everybody is in a bit of a holding pattern until she ultimately decides. But if she were to step aside, the ramifications will be significant. She, of course, is someone who has been the central figure in her caucus for the past two decades. She is someone who has led this caucus through the majority and the minority. And if she were to step aside, it would prompt a leadership scramble to replace her in a leadership election scheduled for November 30th. There have been some members within the Democratic caucus who have called for some change. She has faced some pressure from folks who have said that it is time for a generational change, time for new members. In fact, several years ago, she agreed that this will be the last Congress leading this -- her caucus. But she's not firmly shut the door on that issue. But talking to a congressman, like Congressman Seth Moulton, he suggested it is time for a new chapter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is still uncertain whether Pelosi's current number two, Steny Hoyer, might do, whether he might to try to run for that position as well.And then there are a number of other positions down the line, from minority whip to the number three, all the way down, and there are a lot of members who are looking to advance their own political careers. So, this is going to play out -- so that is why there is so much attention being paid to not just what Nancy Pelosi might decide to do in the impact there and but the impact down the line. And when I talked, asked Hakeem Jeffries about all of this just moments ago, he declined to comment, said he hadn't spoken to the speaker about her decision.",

In fact, just this morning, two Republicans, incoming Republican Chairmen Jim Jordan and James Comer laid out their investigative plans to go after the Biden family, specifically Hunter Biden himself. This, of course, has been something that Republicans have targeted for some time. They said that they have talked to whistleblowers, they have done an investigation and they say they have uncovered evidence contending, in their view, that President Biden is a national security risk. They say that they have a whole slew of evidence that they plan to pursue over the next two years, showing just how central investigations will be to the new incoming Republican majority.Now, the White House and also Hunter Biden's team, of course, have pushed back and said that there is nothing there. But that is an issue that will certainly play out here. And there is also going to be some pushback among some Republicans that this may not be the way they should deal with their new majority and narrow majority. One Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, told me yesterday that they should focus on the issue of inflation instead, saying that -- he's saying said that there are a lot of high priorities. And, frankly, looking into the president's son doesn't strike me as one of the big priorities we ought to be focused on. He said there are some in the base who want to fight and others who want to deal with some other issues. He wants to deal with other issues. So, there will be debate within the Republican Party about what to pursue but no debate about this. They have subpoena power, they will in January and they plan to use it, including over the president's son in those foreign business dealings. Guys?",

And the point of it is to be on the same page because they know those inquiries are coming and they've had to make hires to that effect. In fact, they've brought in Special Counsel Richard Sauber, White House Counsel Spokes Ian Sams and Senior Adviser Anita Dunn. The investigations they're expecting on, southern border, Secretary Mayorkas, Hunter Biden, withdrawal of Afghanistan, the DOJ investigations into the Trump administration, all of this is expected to be targets of Republicans. And so, internally, they have had to brace for that within this administration. A DHS official tells me that they have been holding frequent meetings to prepare, expecting border patrol to come especially under the microscope given what is happening at border and a small group of officials at the State Department have been preparing for those inquiries about the withdrawal from Afghanistan. So, again, we're hearing from Republicans on this and this week, in fact, with Secretary Mayorkas, Republican Clay Higgins told him, we expect to see you in January. So, that tells us where we're heading in the next term.",

Priscilla Alvarez, thanks so much.Joining us now to discuss what is coming next, Margaret Talev, CNN Political Analyst and Managing Editor for Axios and CNN Political Director David Chalian. Good to have you both. David, folks used to talk about divided government is what the American people want, it is good for Washington. We are in a different time, though, are we not? I mean, is there any realistic expectation that divided government here might produce bipartisan legislation, cooperation between Republican-controlled house and a Democratic- controlled Senate on, I mean, even simple things, right, like getting a budget passed and keeping the federal government open?",

I mean, if indeed the government is to be funded, if indeed the debt ceiling is to be raised, by nature, with a Republican House and a Democratic Senate, that is going to have to be, in some aspect, bipartisan.But, Jim, it is interesting, you talk about how divided government in the past may have been seen decades ago as a way to actually produce bipartisan solutions. We just came through two years of full Democratic control and it actually produced some of the more bipartisan results we've seen from Congress in quite a long time. So, perhaps these things are shaking up a little bit. I think the big question is if indeed Kevin McCarthy does amass the 218 votes on the floor in January to become speaker, which I do not think is 100 percent assured outcome just yet, but if it is, Kevin McCarthy, does he believe -- is his posture of positioning the Republicans in the majority one that indicates he believes setting up success in '24 for the Republican presidential nominee, for expanding their majority, is something that requires some bipartisan solutions, or does he believe setting that up for success requires pure blockade of all Biden administration attempts to get anything done? I think the answer to that will sort of dictate the path forward here for the next two years.",

I think this is not Nancy Pelosi's intent at all. She's a strong ally of Joe Biden. But I do think it is possible. You're looking at a potential 2024 race where the two frontrunners from the start for each party would be around 80. And I think that question about generational leadership, there is a lot of upward pressure inside of the Republican Party too for Donald Trump to move out the way and let another generation who didn't have their hands on January 6 and aren't in their eighth decade take another, you know -- take the mantle.
