If the Biden Trump rematch could simply not be how this was going to go down in low and behold, they were right. And here we are today and I think you saw on display here why it was that Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate.He clearly -- the folksy charm was on display. You could really see how the crowd lit up, especially at his jabs at the Trump-Vance ticket. He and Harris both had to call him the crowd doubt a little bit when they started to chant \"lock him up\". Clearly, there were energized guys by the idea that Donald Trump is a convicted felon. Tim Walz went there and cracked a joke about the rumors that J.D. Vance inappropriately related to a couch, which I think caught a lot of eyes, raised a lot eyebrows, but in a campaign that's focused on Gen Z and trying to figure out how to break through a very difficult media environment, I think you saw why Walz is somebody that she chose. I also think you saw why it's Walz and not Shapiro. I mean, Shapiro clearly much more comfortable being number one. Walz seemed pretty comfortable being here as her number two in a way that seemed to lift her up, underscore the message she was making while not overshadowing her in any way. TAPPER: It's very interesting, Audie Cornish, right off the bat.

We maybe should think of it a little differently, like the Z is for zeitgeist, and this is a pair of people right now, this is a campaign that is seizing on culture, humor to make its voice. And usually can names leave that up to \"SNL\", right? They don't take that on themselves. He made jokes, right?
