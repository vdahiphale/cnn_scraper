His brother-in-law and their eldest child were killed their home on October 7th. Omri, thank you for being with us. We can't imagine what you and your family are dealing with right now. Can you talk to us -- as we're listening to President Biden say that there is a hostage deal that is going to happen and, obviously, all of this is tenuous. What do you want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do to get your family members back? What are you asking of the Israeli government?",

Essential leadership positions, like the commander and deputy commander of the Fifth Fleet are all unfilled. So is the role of defense attache to Israel. Here, in the next hour, Senators hope to push through a rules change that would allow them to bypass Tuberville, who says he's been blocking nominations to protest the Pentagon's abortion travel policy.

We're going to vote on all of them at once. Many of their families are going to be there with us in the hearing room. We know that this is, as you pointed out, holding up national security. The head of CYBERCOM, the head of the air command in the Pacific, right when Kim Jong-Un went and met with Vladimir Putin. You have a viewpoint of the fleet in the Mideast, the commander there held up. This is absolutely ridiculous and enough is enough.

And then in the future, other military appointments just for this Congress. So we can bulk them together. And by the way, this isn't unique, Brianna. There have been all kinds of exceptions, temporary and long-term, to these rules. Including exceptions to allow people to be confirmed in groups. That's what this is about. And we have literally bulked together votes before. And voted yes or no. No one is forcing Tommy Tuberville to vote yes on these valiant military appointments. I don't know why he would vote no. He is playing politics with them. No one is forcing him to vote yes. We just want to vote. Because we know, when we have a vote on all these together, we're going to be able to get them through.",

First of all, we know there are some Republican Senators, like Susan Collins, who are with us on reproductive freedom.That aside, the point is, this is not even about paying for abortions. This is actually just military policy. If you're in a state that you can't get a certain medical procedure, it allows these women servicemembers to go to a state that does allow for it and pay for their transit. That's what they do for any other medical procedure. And they are not going to exempt this one per Defense Department policy, as General Austin has stated. That's all this is about. So Tuberville is way, way out there. When you think about how people have been voting, for instance, in state states like Kentucky for Governor Beshear or the vote we just saw in Ohio, a straight-up vote in a red state when it came to abortion, we know he's off on that. But this is actually so about our military. It is about our chain of command and him holding them hostage for his own political beliefs. And I believe Republicans, who may not be with the public on this issue, still believe in our chain of command and eventually will release the military promotions and these fine military servicemembers that are just literally in limbo. They have their families waiting to move. They have spouses who have left their jobs, waiting for that are promotion because no one has had the gall to do something like this and hold up 350 military members. And by the way, if we voted on each one individually, there would be 115 business days. We would have a government shutdown. We wouldn't be able to do all the work. So with all the drama you're covering, and rightfully so, over in the House today, the Senate has to act together on passing our appropriations bills, you are going to -- and I appreciate you spending time on this because this is its own set of drama and involves one guy. What we are saying today, at least the Democrats on the committee, enough is enough. We're headed to the floor.",

I have spoken with some veterans and those in the military community. I'm talking about moderates, not conservatives, people who are in favor of abortion rights, women included, who say why not just change this policy? There are not that many people using it. It's creating a huge divide. What do you say to that?",

So I'll start with that.But the second thing is that no one has ever done this before, Brianna. So if we set this precedent, anyone could hold up hundreds of military promotions over something that they don't like. If you don't like a certain war policy, you're going to hold them all up. And we have learned, especially from things like Vietnam, you can have disagreements about war, but you don't take it out on the warriors on the front line, which is what Tuberville is doing with his disagreements over this policy. So our position today goes beyond even the issue of reproductive freedom, way beyond. This is about our very military chain of command and the ability of the Senate to allow our military to do its job, when you have China saber rattling, when you have what's going on in the Mideast, when you have Russia in an all-out invasion of Ukraine. And our duty is to stand with not just Ukraine but our NATO allies. That's what's at stake here. The security and credibility of the United States of America on the world stage.",
