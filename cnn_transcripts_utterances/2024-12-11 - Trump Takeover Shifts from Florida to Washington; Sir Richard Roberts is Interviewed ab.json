We are learning that RFK Jr.. is headed to Capitol Hill next week to begin meetings with senators to try and shore up support for his nomination to be the next secretary of Health and Human Services. His nomination facing a lot of questions. His selection to head up the country's sprawling public health agency that oversees 13 different departments, controversial.And in a rare move ahead of all of this, more than 75 Nobel Prize winners have banded together, now urging senators to oppose RFK's nomination. The group writing in a letter to senators this in part, \"placing Mr. Kennedy in charge of the department would put the public's health in jeopardy and undermine America's global leadership in health sciences.\" Joining me right now is one of the Nobel laureates who helped draft that letter, Sir Richard Roberts, a biochemist who won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sir. Richard, thank you for coming in. How did this letter come about? What made you decide to speak up in a way that we really haven't seen in recent memory?",

If he wants to get some accurate information, perhaps he should consult with the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine and see what they have to say. I just don't think it's appropriate for a politician to try to use these anti-establishment rules or whatever the arguments against the current establishment is a good way of making good policy going forward.

Now, I know that economists and fed officials and business reporters sometimes like to look at the rate of inflation. But our viewers, they care about the level of prices, how much everyone is spending. And it's true, I mean, life has just gotten so much more expensive, right? Supermarket, insurance, all of it has gone up.

So, in the United States, and it's different in other countries, but in the United States, if you're buying raw milk cheese or unpasteurized milk cheese in the United States, it has to have been aged for at least 60 days before you can purchase it. And the thinking is that during that 60 days many of the pathogens that we talk about E.Coli, listeria, salmonella, they will sort of be aged out. In addition to that, there's certain ingredients that are added to raw milk cheese, certain salts, certain acids, which also do a pretty good job of taking care of any potential pathogens.So, the answer is, yes, you can buy unpasteurized cheese in the United States, but it does have pretty strict regulatory framework around it. I actually attended a raw cheese festival in Italy, a place called Bra, Italy, where it did not need to be aged like that. They did not need to add acids and salts, and people came from all over believing that that truly raw milk cheese offered some health benefits. Can't get that in the United States, though, John.",
