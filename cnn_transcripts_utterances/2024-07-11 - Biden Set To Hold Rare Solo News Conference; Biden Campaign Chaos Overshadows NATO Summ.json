Now, the market is bifurcated in a way as you're seeing a second or two.We've got the Dow, which is up slightly, but the NASDAQ sharply lower as the gentleman hits the gavel -- one -- oh dear, that wasn't much of a gavel. That's hardly going to get us off to a roaring start, is it? But it is NVIDIA, it's Amazon, it is tech stocks like Tesla that are all lower. The NASDAQ is off. Those are the markets, the events that you and I will chew over the next hour. President Biden is about to give what could be the most important news conference of his life as calls grow for him to drop his re-election bid. A landmark moment in the fight against inflation. Prices in the US are falling for the first time times since the pandemic. And Delta Air Lines says the Olympics will cost the airline a hundred million dollars as travelers avoid the Paris crowds. Well, I am in New York on Thursday, July the 11th. I'm Richard Quest. I mean, business. Good evening. President Biden is just roughly two hours away from giving one of the most important news conferences of his career. He will speak after a busy day of meetings with NATO allies in Washington and he is proving or has to prove that his shaky debate performance, and his whole halting interview so far are not the norm. Fellow Democrats will be watching. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Minority Leader, says they stand firmly behind the president's agenda. However, Speaker Jeffries was less emphatic about their support for his candidacy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We have engaged in a process of talking to each other. Those conversations have been candid, comprehensive, and clear- eyed and they continue. Until that process has concluded, I am not going to address what any outside stakeholders may have to say about this matter. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In other words, it is exactly what he has said he was going to try to avoid doing is what he has done today. Look at the president's agenda. Early this morning, he left for the Convention Center where the Summit is taking place and participated in working sessions throughout the day. He also met President Zelenskyy of Ukraine to announce new military aid for Kyiv, he used notes in that meeting. And later in this hour, he is going to hold another meeting on the war in Ukraine. Kayla Tausche is in Washington. You know, I saw him sitting there with President Zelenskyy with his notes, and I saw him sort of shuffling from one chair to the next and we've still got everybody saying he is sharp, he is acute.

Thank you so much.Now, in the United States, prices have fallen on a monthly basis for the first time since the pandemic. The CPI declined a tenth of a percent from May to June. It takes the annual rate to three percent, still above the Fed's but it is much better than it was. Headline inflation dragged down while we had airfares fell some five percent, and energy, which fell two percent, and then of course you had fruit, which was down a good half a percent. Julia Chatterley, an orange, an apple or a tangerine. We forget had the airline ticket. Julia Chatterley, so the inflation is down, it is still above target, but much better then where it was. Is this grist to the Fed cutting September? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": It is. And I was going to say to you, it needs more fanfare, but obviously you are way ahead of me there. We are not talking about price rises slowing, we are actually talking about prices coming down for the first time since the pandemic. So I think this is a great big green tick for the February and they will certainly be honing in and looking at that September meeting as the possibility now, and that's what the market has been saying as well. So we've got a rate meeting happening in July, but no one expects anything to happen there. This is good news in the data -- shelter, housing, rent was also much lower in this, which is I think something else that the Federal Reserve has been watching, but no ways about it, Richard, I think this is a certain greenlight for the Federal Reserve to be able to do something in September.

People are less confident about quitting their jobs and going to look for somewhere else. So you can see signs of softening in the market. Now, I don't want to get ahead of myself because in a few weeks' time, we could get confirmation of a significantly stronger second quarter than we saw actually in the first quarter. And you and I both know that we are heading into earnings season. We've got some of the big banks reporting tomorrow.

This is an incredibly resilient stock market given what we've seen in terms of speed of rate increases, I think overall, they have hit the sweet spot actually with the rate increases that they've done and holding steady and not doing what people wanted them to do with cutting rates.

English is not his first tongue, but both of the men were speaking in a very, very scripted way, I think, a large part of that is because of the sensitivity of what both men say on this subject. And I just want to highlight one thing that President Zelenskyy said to President Biden and that was about lifting the restrictions on Ukrainian soldiers, and was a very pointed remark towards President Biden essentially saying unshackle us. Because right now, the US has very specific restrictions on how Ukraine uses their weapons inside of Russia. They are not allowed to use them however they like and Ukraine is asking for permission to use every kind of US weapon wherever they like inside Russia, the US has not granted that. But Richard, just before President Biden has this press conference that we are all waiting for, including everybody here at this Summit, President Zelenskyy will also be giving him his own press conference. I guarantee you that within the first few questions, of course, he will be asked what that meeting was like with President Biden, whether he has faith in President Biden to continue leading this alliance and what his fate may be in November, because as President Zelenskyy said two nights ago, everybody is watching the November elections -- Richard.",
