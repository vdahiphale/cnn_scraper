      "sentences": "... on what could be a very, very positive day for Israel and for Gaza.I think, as with all positive news in the past, the prime minister has this tendency of wanting to deliver it himself, not so much with the negative news. So I think that we will have to wait for that kind of a press conference and for official Israeli acknowledgement that it is indeed a DNA match. The DNA is based on the fact that Yahya Sinwar was a convicted terrorist and spent quite many years in Israeli prison. And, as such, Israeli security forces have his dentals and DNA. And it hasn't been made official yet, but I hear that there's very, very strong confidence in the DNA indeed being a match. But we will wait for the official notice. I think that this could be a very important strategic moment. It may not immediately symbolize or signify an end to the war, but I think that two things are possible from here. One, the chances, I think, of a hostage deal or of a safe return of at least some, hopefully all of the 101 Israeli hostages, I think that rises and elevates because, based on the information I know, Yahya Sinwar, first of all, he stood between a deal and the hostages being brought back home. Now that he may be out of the picture, that could be a good step forward. And then the second very interesting thing that will happen now is, will Hamas be able to scramble and regroup and who, if Hamas is out -- if Sinwar is out of the picture, will take his position? Will it be his brother Mohammed Sinwar, or will it be one of the low-level military commanders that are left and have not yet been eliminated by the IDF? That's probably a big question. And, of course, how well can Israel, the U.S. and regional powers leverage this moment in order to end the fighting and turn the page?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jonathan, you bring up so many good points. I mean, I guess one of the questions I have -- and it's based on the experience of the U.S. taking out Osama bin Laden and how al Qaeda had a very difficult time. It was not able to reconstitute itself ultimately after the killing of bin Laden.Has Hamas essentially been crippled in the same way or in a similar way, do you think?",

      "sentences": "Before the war, Hamas was a very decentralized organization that had a lot of, I would say, operational flexibility, in the sense that it didn't have one center of gravity that you could strike and take out the organization.But as the war went on and more and more military and political leaders of Hamas were killed by Israel in part of the fighting, everything kind of got centralized around Yahya Sinwar. The political overseas leadership of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh and others, one was eliminated and others have become less significant. And that concentrated almost all of the executive and political power with Yahya Sinwar. And that's a dangerous thing for a terrorist organization to do because, if and when he is taken out, which he eventually would be, then that leaves a very big void. And now there's a challenge for Hamas and for all of the terrorist organizations in Gaza, but specifically Hamas, how to deal with it and what kind of succession they can put in place. Communications are very difficult. Command-and-control is very limited. They do not have freedom of movement above the ground. And underground, it's difficult to do these things, especially when there's Israeli troops above and below ground hunting for them.",

What we're hearing from a variety of officials and experts is that it is looking very likely that that in fact is the case, and we're just awaiting an official announcement from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on all of this. But let's go to some more experts on this, former CIA officer Bob Baer and CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger.

What's your sense of it? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Well, it could well be. Look, Jim, as you and I have discussed before, we have been in an odd position for a year with Sinwar, which is there have been these negotiations under way in which the United States through -- operating through others in the Arab world have been basically sending out proposals to Sinwar and waiting to see his reaction, while they have been helping the Israelis try to figure out where Sinwar was, so the Israelis could kill him. And so that has sort of never worked, as you could understand.",

It sounds as though there were Israeli forces doing sort of routine patrol in that area and happened upon this.We don't have the full ticktock. But talking to John Miller in the previous hour, it sounds as though Sinwar was essentially basically living in the shadows, in the tunnel network in Gaza and so on, trying to avoid capture, and it may have just been a stroke of luck here.",

This is how they hit the initial targets. So they have a target matrix which he could have wandered into, which is tunnels. And any indication, whether it's cell phone calls or whatever, and they give it a try. Their intelligence is not perfect, but it's a lot better than it's been in previous conflicts in Gaza. So they pretty well know where the tunnels are. And they have also captured Palestinians who describe Sinwar's movements. And maybe they got lucky this time.",

I mean, there's been some optimism expressed on this program earlier that that's the case, but might that not be the case? SANGERSame thing for ISIS, which has cropped back up in many different forms. This might well cripple Hamas, but, remember, it's not as if we're back at October 7. I mean, in the interim time, Israel has conducted a pretty massive bombing that has killed 40,000 or so Palestinians in Gaza. A good number of those were fighters, but many were not. And that probably created a new class of future terrorists, as these things usually do. That was certainly our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
