Hezbollah has built an arsenal - an arsenal of thousands of missiles, some of them long rage with the capability of reaching Tel Aviv.They have enough if they were to fire enough in numbers they could conceivably overwhelm Israel's missile defenses and get some through, much like you saw Hezbollah with their rockets coming from Gaza. They fire enough in a concentrated period of time, you can get some through. The concern is Hezbollah would do the same in the north, and their missiles, frankly, longer range, higher capability, greater - greater danger -",

Now, as the Israeli ground operation intensifies, President Biden is reiterating his call for a pause in fighting in hopes of allowing more hostages, who have now been held for 27 days by Hamas, to be released. This happened, Biden's latest remark, happened in a closed-door fundraiser just yesterday where he was confronted by a rabbi sitting in the crowd who urged the president to, quote, \"call for a ceasefire now.\"Let's get over to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. She's at the White House for us. And, Priscilla, Biden's comment at this closed-door fundraiser and being confronted by this person at this closed-door fundraiser, it really does kind of show and lay bare the tough dynamics at play for the Biden administration in this.",

The White - the president's comments were in line with what the White House has publicly urged, which is a humanitarian pause for the release of hostages that are held by Hamas in Gaza.But what was noticeable about it was the setting. This happened at a campaign fundraiser in Minneapolis yesterday evening. And in that confrontation, the protester saying they were a rabbi and calling on the president to call for a ceasefire. The president acknowledging it and saying, quote, \"I think we need a pause. A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.\" Now, again, this speaks to how delicate this conflict is and the heightened emotions behind it, particularly as we see more images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis there, again underscoring how difficult politically this is to navigate for the president and the public push here by the White House for a humanitarian pause. Now, again, the president has addressed this before, including in a press conference last week, and suggested that he has raised it with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well. But so far it appears that Israel has rejected the idea of a humanitarian pause. So, all of this coming together in this moment just yesterday again where the president was confronted in pretty close range with a protester who was calling for this ceasefire, as we have seen those calls grow rampantly across the country.

Yesterday it became clear that fellow Republicans had had enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): No matter whether you believe it or not, Senator Tuberville, this is doing great damage to our military. I don't say that lightly. I've been trying to work with you for nine months. SEN. TODD YOUNG (R-IN): To undermine the safety and security of the American people during this perilous time just doesn't make any sense to me. SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): But if each senator felt empowered to hold up all promotions in our military unless we got our way on one of those issues, why our military would grind to a halt.

That dramatic four-hour confrontation on the Senate floor where we saw Republicans stand up and object to his blockade. And then we saw the senator stand up on his own and block one by one each of the proposed nominees. It led to some dramatic moments. And here's how the senator responded in the moment last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL): I have to respectfully disagree with my colleagues about the effect of my hold on readiness. My hold is not affecting readiness. But I will keep my hold in place until the Pentagon follows the law or the Democrats change the law.

And that's why you're seeing Republicans, members of his own party, standing up and saying, do not do this anymore. We have to get these people through.Now, notably, Tuberville is -- the whole intention behind this bill, Kate, is because he has an objection to an unrelated policy at the Pentagon that went into effect February of this year that expanded access and support for service members and their families who are intending to get an abortion. So, many Republicans not against that policy per say but they're against now what Tuberville is doing in his approach, in his strategy of holding up an unrelated nominations for an unrelated policies against.

You're in the House, not the Senate, but you are a former Marine pilot, former naval commander. I am curious if you agree with Senate veterans Lindsey Graham and Joni Ernst, that this is compromising safety and readiness? REP. RICH MCCORMICK (R-GA): I - well, it is, but there's two sides to this story. First of all, it can be simply fixed if they do follow the law, if the secretary of defense decides to go with what Congress has already passed, that we don't - we don't use federal funds for abortion. So, I understand Tuberville's point. I also understand the necessity to have the right people in place for the right time. Our commandant right now is in the hospital for the Marine Corps. We don't have a good plan in place for leadership. So, I am very concerned about the leadership side. I can kind of see both sides of this argument. There's more than one way to solve this.

I remember, in Vietnam, if you study history, whenever we started to win, they would sue (ph) for peace, and then they would use that time to reinforce, to re-entrench and make it more difficult for the next round, because they're not done. Hamas (ph) is not going to all of sudden say, oh, let's - let's give all the hostages and then we'll be peaceful. Let's face it, as soon as Hamas lays down their arms there will be peace. If Israel lays down their arms, they would be destroyed instantly. They would be annihilated from the fact of the earth. The fact is that Hamas uses children to shield their weapons and Israel is using weapons to shield their children. There is a big difference in what's going on here.Now, I feel very sorry for the Palestinian people. They have been used and abused. It's a small fraction of people who are violent and evil.

I'm not in favor of strengthening the IRS, which I think has because biased and misused. It's been weaponized. But I would love to see something come out of it, such as HR-2, which is a very popular, bipartisan, of actually controlling our border right now. You see Democrats and Republicans want to see that done. That's a good leverage point to get something like that done. That would have been my preference.

Also including, as you just mentioned, a student being arrested on federal charges, accused of making online posts threatening to kill and injure Jewish people on campus.Now, in response to all of this, the university president outlined a few things they say they're going to do to try and help anti-Semitic threats on campus, including responding rapidly and forcefully to threats, focusing on anti-Semitism and diversity programing, anti- Semitism experts to speak on campus and new policies to prevent doxing, which is, of course, disseminate private identifying information of people online.
