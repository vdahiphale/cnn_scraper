Milton continues to be a dangerous category five hurricane, expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds along Florida's gulf coast. Practically all of Central Florida remains under a hurricane warning with landfall expected as early as tonight, with evacuation orders clogging Florida's major interstates, a new problem growing fuel outages as of late last night, 21 percent of gas stations in Florida are out of gas. This storm coming right on the heels of Hurricane Helene that brought record storm surge flooding to the Tampa area where debris from that storm now poses a whole new threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is very visible on our satellite. We are less than 24 hours away from a devastating economic andsocietal storm that I wish we could say that we've never seen the likes of decades, but unfortunately happened two weeks ago with Hurricanes Helene, adding just misery to the pain that we've already experienced across Florida. The storm has 160 mile per hour winds, because it has maintained a strength overnight. They have increased the winds at landfall, which are still believed to occur late tonight into early Thursday morning, but you can see explicitly a category four as it makes its final approach into the west central coastline of Florida. What we've been watching so closely with a magnitude and strength of a storm like this, is the wobbles, comparing them to where that center of the storm is with the forecast track, it is so imperative and I want to show you that this map, there's the eye. There's the forecast track, the center, of course, being the cone of uncertainty. But notice how the eye is jogging a little bit to the east, that has downstream implications on who receives that front right quadrant. The most powerful part of the storm with the most intense storm surge and the most its intense winds, even though there will be intense wins on the northern side of the storm as well. This is one computer model, the European model. This still indicates a St. Pete Tampa Bay landfall again early Thursday morning. This is just one computer model, so were still looking for that windshield wiper effect. We will bubble up and down as is common with these types of storms. But one thing's for sure, catastrophic winds will not be contained to just the coastline. We will experience hurricane force winds from the coast, the gulf coast, all the way to the Atlantic coast we have seen the radar poppy and I already from Key West, and there have been tornado warnings in Miami-Dade in advance of this storm, that is continuing as we speak. Storm surge, the forecast here has not gotten any better, Kasie. This will inundate homes and it will inundate businesses.",

There are eye-opening new details this morning about the prickly relationship between these two leaders. In a new book from journalist Bob Woodward called \"War\", it's out next week, Woodward writes that Biden's anger toward Netanyahu boiled over in the spring of this year when the president concluded the Israeli prime minister's interest was not actually in defeating Hamas, but in protecting himself politically. According to Woodward, Biden told advisers, quote, that's son of a bleep, Bibi Netanyahu, he's a bad guy. He's a bad effing guy. All right. Let's go live to London and bring in CNN's Max Foster. Max, good morning to you. This book is full of revelations. So there's this Netanyahu question. What we're also learning in this book by Bob Woodward about Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and one of the things that's really stood out is that Trump reportedly gave Putin COVID tests -- test machines back in 2020 when those were apparently -- were incredibly difficult to access, right? He sent them for Putin's personal use, and they also report that -- Woodward also reports that Trump has spoken on the phone to Vladimir Putin multiple times since he left the White House.

She didn't talk about some of these policies that just had a different emphasis the perhaps you've seen in the Biden campaign, she's talking a lot more about the sandwich generation.

She has -- there has been a different emphasis, but you didn't hear that. You just heard what she said there. And perhaps they don't want to upset the base.
