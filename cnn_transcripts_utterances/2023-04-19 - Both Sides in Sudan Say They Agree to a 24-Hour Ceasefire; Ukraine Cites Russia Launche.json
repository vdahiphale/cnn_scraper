We have the very latest for you. Then Russia launches a barrage of airstrikes at Ukraine as the battle in the east rages on. We are live for you on the ground. Plus, \"Fox News\" agrees a record settlement with Dominion. We'll look at what this means for the broadcaster as it faces even more legal trouble. We start, though in Sudan, a powerful militia and the country's armed forces agreeing to another temporary ceasefire that went into effect just in fact, two hours ago. A previous ceasefire brokered by Washington was called on Tuesday. The hope, of course, was to evacuate people living in Khartoum, the capital, and foreigners who have found themselves trapped. But that ceasefire didn't hold. Well, gunfire explosions and fighter jets were heard across Khartoum with reports of gunmen storming the homes of those working for the United Nations and other international organizations. Both sides then blaming each other for the failure of Tuesday's ceasefire, and dragging, of course, the country further into chaos. Our Larry Madowo breaks it all down for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Smoke billows and plummet- Khartoum sky as residents woke up to another day of heavy artillery and bombardment. In the wake of the escalating conflict, RSF leader Hemetti is, according to multiple sources, commanding his forces from one of Khartoum's busiest residential areas, prompting the Sudanese army to accuse the RSF of using civilians as human shields. What were once bustling with cars and people, since Saturday, Khartoum streets have been left deserted with some residents hiding in their homes and fearing for their safety. Just like Hadeel Mohamed, who says since the fighting broke out, she's been housebound and thinks forces might break in to steal supplies.",

And we were actually in the Bakhmut area yesterday, looking at the air defenses in the area, and they are dealing with basically equipment from the 1970s. So, they are very eager to get better weapons. In fact, today was announced that a German-supplied Patriot anti-missile battery had arrived in country. This is something the Ukrainians have been asking for, for a very long time, now whether it will make a difference in the battle for Bakhmut, it's not altogether clear. We don't know how much of that city the Ukrainians still control. But it does appear that they are trying to hold on to it as much as possible because, as the deputy Defense Minister referred to, today, they claim, the Ukrainians claim that for every one dead Ukrainian, there are   several dead Russians. However, neither side nor neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians ever published. casualty figures, so we'll just have to take her at her word. But there's no question that the Russians are trying at this point as their Winter offensive comes to an end to achieve some sort of significant victory, and that would be the capture of Bakhmut.

Well, a newinvestigation has found evidence that Russia is operating an apparent fleet of spy ships in Nordic waters. The public broadcaster of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland analyzed Intelligence sources, radio communications as well as other data. And they say that some 50 Russian vessels have been carrying out spy operations over the past decade, seeking out sites for potential sabotage, such as underwater cables and wind farms. The Kremlin denies the accusations, calling them baseless.

People familiar with the matter spoke to myself and our colleague Oliver Darcy and broke down what happened behind the scenes. Last week, Dominion notified \"Fox News\" that some of its first witnesses on the stand were going to be Rupert Murdoch; the owner of \"Fox Corporation\", and Tucker Carlson, one of the most prominent hosts on \"Fox News\". Those are huge names. After that, there were some talks among the lead trial attorneys over the weekend, but they were according to a source incredibly far apart. The talks did not go anywhere. But late Sunday night, they did jointly agree to bring in a mediator, a professional arbitrator who knows how to get deals like this done. They call this man Jeffrey Roscoe, he picked up from a cruise. He was literally on a river cruise from Bucharest to Budapest over in Europe. He got the call, he took the assignment, the group's notified the judge, and the judge late Sunday night agreed to give a one day delay to the start of the trial. That was Monday. All day Monday. The people familiar with this matter tell us that there were feverish talks back and forth phone calls, shuttle diplomacy, Zoom conferences to try to get an agreement. But there was no deal going into Tuesday, which was yesterday, the start of opening statements expected in the end of jury selection. Everyone was expecting this thing to go to trial. There was no deal in hand, Isa. They seated the jury, they swore in the jury and they went to lunch. And we are told that during that lunch break yesterday, that's when things really intensified, the final details of the deal were agreed to, everything was signed, the \"I\"s were dotted, the \"T\"s were crossed.",

So this would -- we expect be his last term and certainly, as we've seen in the past, this will be about the time when he would begin to signal who would succeed him, and it's not clear yet.

And if they do, that means that it will be status quo. Women will be able to obtain the abortion pill as usual. No restrictions will go into effect. And this appeals process will continue to play out. This is what DOJ and the FDA is pushing for here. However, if the Supreme Court does not extend the pause that they have already instituted, a number of really impactful restrictions on the abortion pill would take effect. So first, only women up to seven weeks pregnant would be able to obtain the pill. It's currently up to 10 weeks pregnant. But if these restrictions take hold, that time period would drop down to seven weeks. Second, women would have to see their doctors in person multiple times and then obtain the pill in person. That's different from the way things stand now, where women can get a prescription, often via telehealth visit with their doctor, over the computer, over phone and then receive the pill via mail. So now they have to do it all in person. So the FDA, in their court filings, they've really warned the court that there could be this mass confusion and chaos if these restrictions are allowed to take effect, mostly because they'll have to completely rebrand the way that this pill is marketed. It's something that can't be done overnight, they say. And production on the pill would really have to be delayed because of these requirements. So there is a lot from FDA, doctors, patients, all bracing for the Supreme Court here. If they don't step in to extend this stay, it could be a lot of changes in the way this abortion pill is administered.
