Not everybody wanted him to become president or even mayor of Moscow, but his ideas about what another Russia could look like. You know, a Russia without Putin or Russia without a lot of corruption and a system that is built on that corruption. I think that's the thing that resonates, and the Kremlin will have a very difficult time controlling any of that.",

Arlette Saenz over at the White House. Matthew Chance in London. Joe Dougherty, CNN's former Moscow bureau chief. And Arlette, we heard the president say a lot of things just a few moments ago, he reassured NATO allies that if Russia were to attack any NATO country, that the United States would respond forcefully to defend any NATO country that is attacked by Russia. He said that was going to be in response to what Donald Trump said recently where he said, if NATO countries aren't spending enough money on common defense, that Russia can do whatever they want.

I mean, this outrage, this criticism and condemnation expressed by President Biden, what we're -- it's obviously shared by many people around the world, but also many people inside Russia. But I think what we're waiting for now is to see what reaction thereis on the streets of Russia. In the past, Navalny was able to bring tens of thousands of Russians out in protests as part of his anti- corruption campaign. Will we see the same sort of mass protests now that he's dead, or appears to be dead? Obviously, we're waiting confirmation of that now. All will this be yet another sign to the Russian opposition that protest will not be tolerated and that will have a chilling effect on dissent and on criticism of the Kremlin?

Isaac, how did Manchin explained his decision? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Jim, he has been very critical of Republicans and Democrats alike for a long time now. And he gave a speech in West Virginia this morning, and torched both but clearly, he was upset by what happened with the immigration and border deal, saying that he felt like Joe Biden was responsible for the situation at the border. But Donald Trump is 10 times more guilty for not letting Republicans fix it. He was very disappointed, he said in his Republican colleagues. And so, I think this goes to where Manchin is on this. He's always felt like Joe Biden is a good man, a compassionate man, he's a decent man, he's told me, but that he's gotten too liberal. But he has said he loves his country too much to let Donald Trump be president again. And that seems to be what drove him to this decision.",
