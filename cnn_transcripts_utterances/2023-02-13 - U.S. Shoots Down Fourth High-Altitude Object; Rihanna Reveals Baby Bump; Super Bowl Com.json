He serves as the director of operations and was deputy commander of the Alaska region. Good morning to you. Thank you so much. We appreciate you joining us here on CNN THIS MORNING. I'm sure this is a very business guys right now. NORAD says that the - says that the takedown of the Chinese spy balloon was likely the first time that NORAD has taken what they call kinetic action against an airborne object over the U.S. airspace. There has been a total of four objects shot down now. So, what is going on? What are your concerns? Please explain to us. MAJOR GENERAL SCOTT CLANCY (RET.), FORMER DEPUTY COMMANDER, ALASKAN NORAD REGION: Well, I think you're seeing the confluence of two things. The first thing is what General Veneer (ph), my old commander, referred to as intelligence gaps that existed with our systems of detection across North America. As he said in his briefing after the initial shootdown of the Chinese attributed balloon, that they have since closed those gaps. And it's been referred to as to adjusting the filters on those systems. I think there's maybe a little bit more to that. But what it does is it allows these systems to be seen more often. The second thing, and this is just conjecture from my perspective, I think you're also seeing the confluence of distinctive activity by our adversaries to test our systems. And I think it's the confluence of both of those things that were producing these number of events.",

And I - I think that General VanHerck's (ph) prudence with respect to attribution of these last three is well sounded, especially when we think of the tension that already exist and the relations between China and the United States, particularly, but let's just say China and the western world over the Straits of Taiwan, over its economic dealings, over its flouting of the international laws. Canada has been demarshed (ph) by them in the past for a number of things. So, his prudence in - in making sure that we can recover the objects before attribution is smart. But what I'm saying is it -- it smells to me, as the guy who was directed to conduct operations to defend North America, I'd be very suspicious and I'd be on high alert to make sure that all of our adversaries are being countered.",

It's not just where they were. It's not just the critical infrastructure or defense infrastructure, nuclear fields that they flew over. It's also the type of sensors that they had onboard. And then, finally, what you're really trying to ascertain is, what was the overall intent of the doing this with these devices at this time? It looks to me to be a concerted effort because you have any more than one object. Then it looks like a coordinated effort.And it might not be over even the infrastructure that you fly over. You might fly over infrastructure, attempting to see inside of our networks or command and control system, the reactions, so that you can play out those reactions for the future.",

I -- think of a radar screen that is full of little dots and squiggies (ph) all over that screen. And a human is trying to interpret all of those radar contacts. It becomes difficult.If your primary threat is from aircraft that travel at hundreds of miles an hour, then you're going to adjust the gain or filter to weed out all of birds, environmentals, and, as such, you would weed out also balloons that are low - of low speeds, at which - at which point in time you're not going to see those targets. Now, the second thing is that the radar system that we have in NORAD have -- you know, they're very old now and we've been lax in modernizing the NORAD infrastructure to be able to deal with this. If you apply data management systems, machine learning and AI on the back end of existing radars, then instead of a human trying to interpret those things, machines are able to bring that data out and interpret them for us so that we can be more effective. I think you're seeing both of these things happen.",
