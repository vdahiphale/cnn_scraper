Now CNN's Evan Perez is outside the federal court and Fort Pierce in Florida. Kristen Holmes is also in West Palm Beach. Evan, first to you, how long have they been inside?

      "sentences": "Yes. There's a lot of smoke here, John. But the former president has been in the courthouse now for about two hours. He's probably going to be in there. We anticipate another couple of hours. And what this hearing is, is going on behind closed doors. It is a closed door hearing because it has to do with some of the classified documents, some of the classified information that is at issue in this case. The -- some of the documents that prosecutors are trying to withhold from some of the defendants in this case is of course not only Donald Trump, but also his co-defendants. Walt Nauta, Carlos de Oliveira, their legal teams are also in there.And the argument is over this, there are documents that are classified, that the government says are so classified and are so sensitive, that they're only providing summaries of some of those documents. And so what they're arguing, what the lawyers are arguing for the former president, they're arguing that anything that they want access to that they believe will be key and be useful to the former president's defense, they should be able to get access to. And again, this is a federal courthouse where there is a skiff, which is a specially designed room where you are allowed to store classified documents, of course, the contrast with the -- some of the conditions in which classified documents were being stored at Mar-a-Lago. That's, of course, part of what's going on here today. Now, again, we're expecting that after the former president and his legal team are allowed a couple of hours to talk to the judge and make their arguments. Later this afternoon, the government and Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team will be able to make their case as to why there should be continued some of these restrictions on these documents that, again, could be an issue in this trial. The trial is set to go in May. But at this point, we do not know whether that date holds at this point, John.",

I do want to ask you a question about what the arguments are today that Donald Trump's defense team is making in front of this judge in this classified documents case. Norm, do you got me?I think we're having a bit -- we're going to take a quick break. Norm Eisen, it looks like Max Headroom right now because we're having a little technical issue.

Unlike a regular trial, when you have a trial like this one for Donald Trump's legit possession of classified information at Mar- a-Lago, the defendants don't get every piece of paper. Yes, Donald Trump and the other defendants will get information that's helpful and necessary. But the government can hold back certain documents, redact others, substitute names with John Doe, and have the judge make other changes where you balance national security with the right of every defendant to have a fair trial.And you go through that sometimes document by document. And that is what is happening in court. Both sides will talk, as we say ex parte by themselves with the judge, and then the judge, Judge Cannon, will make some decisions.",

It's the latest in a series of decisions that she has made that have caused observers to question whether she's biased in favor of the former president. Remember, this is the same judge who was reversed twice by the 11th Circuit during the investigation of the Mar-a-Lago documents when she tried to stop the government from using the documents they had obtained at Mar-a-Lago with their search warrant.And when she tried to appoint a special master to oversee review of the documents, the extremely conservative 11th Circuit that oversees, they said, no, that's illegal. And I think she's crossed that line again, by exposing these witnesses to harm. We'll see whether DOJ appeals that or even tries to get her removed from the case.",

It was a coordinated ground and air operation they say in Rafah, which is in southern Gaza. Sixty-year-old Fernando Simon Marman and 70-year-old Louis Har, wept, as they reunited with their families at an Israeli hospital just a short time ago. During the operation, the city was under heavy fire from Israeli forces. The IDF confirmed that they conducted a series of strikes. The Ministry of Health in Hamas-ran Gaza, told CNN that nearly 100 people were killed. Now CNN has not independently verified those numbers. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv with the very latest on this rescue, Jeremy, which is something we really haven't seen much up.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, John. This is only the second time that the Israeli military has successfully rescued hostages inside of Gaza since the beginning of this war, but it was the result of lengthy planning, a very complex and daring operation carried out overnight by Israeli Special Forces. We're told that these two men Louis Har, 70 years old, and 60-year-old Fernando Marman, were rescued when Israeli Special Forces breached a residential building in the heart of Rafah at about 1And just hours later, they were finally able to reunite with their families inside a hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Both of the men described as very thin but in good medical condition. But after that rescue, after those special forces enter that building, in fact, one minute after we're told that the Israeli Air Force launched a barrage of strikes on other parts of Rafah, effectively as a way to try and divert Hamas fighters from this rescue operation. But the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Hamas-controlled Gaza say that nearly 100 people were killed in these strikes and hospital officials in the area describing hospitals as overwhelmed and many of the casualties coming in being women and children as well. So very clear the impact of this operation and also providing a glimpse of what may come soon as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to move forward with an offensive on that southernmost city of Gaza, which has become a refuge for 1.4 million displaced Palestinians in Gaza, many of them displaced from northern parts of Gaza. The Israeli prime minister saying that they will -- that they are drafting plans right now to try and evacuate some of that civilian population, but much of that still remaining up in the air, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of fear in that city. But at this hour, John, we also have -- now have two Israeli hostages rescued and finally reunited with their loved ones after 128 days of captivity. John?",

And I think you've also got to put land aside in Israel, you've got to set up the refugee camps to bring these people out temporarily. Understand that Hamas doesn't want this to happen. This whole operation has been designed by Hamas to force Israel to kill civilians, to bring the world's opprobrium on Israel for conducting a war of self-defense against Hamas. It's been very cleverly done. It's been reinforced by Iran, and us and media networks around the world, including into the United States. But this was the Hamas design.Now Israel has come to the crucial point here, they're going to have to bite the bullet, set up the refugee access out or egress out of Gaza, set up some camps, the United States and Europe should be helping in this right now. This is what should have happened in the beginning, John. We should have evacuated all of Gaza, figured out who lives there, monitor the communication, put biometrics on people. So you know who they are, you could have gotten Hamas. It would have taken several months, but this has taken several months, it would have cost $100 billion, this is going to cost $100 billion or more before it's finished. So, you know, my critique of this is that the global powers, including the United States, didn't try hard enough to resolve this problem in the beginning. But seen from the Israeli perspective, this is a battle for survival. They simply cannot will get Hamas to remain in Gaza. They've got to either destroy it, or get it out of there. They can't live next to it. So got to work this.",

They're much closer to the problem in Ukraine than Donald Trump has ever been. And they know what's going on there. This is a war of extinction against a nation of 40 million people to destroy the culture of the language, the history, and anybody who's associated with resistance to Russian occupation.So you could have 10 million people killed, if Russia comes in there. Trump just is all about himself. He makes shocking statements. Maybe he wouldn't actually do this. Maybe it's just for theater. But he shouldn't do such things. And we know from his previous administration that he actually was working to disassemble NATO. So I put a lot of credence in what he says. It's not just a shock statement, although it is that.
