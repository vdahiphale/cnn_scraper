Welcome and we're so glad you could join us here on CNN This Morning.The United States launching a daring rescue operation to evacuate Americans from war-torn Sudan, that's where we begin today. The Pentagon says Special Forces swooped in to the capital, Khartoum, in Chinook helicopters to pick up U.S. embassy staff and their families. We're told U.S. troops were on the ground for less than an hour and the rescue mission was fast and clean. Take a look. This is a photo of Secretary of State Antony Blinken watching the tense operation unfold. He says all U.S. personnel in Sudan were safely evacuated. The U.S. and other nations have been scrambling to evacuate their citizens as fighting rages between two rival military factions. Around 16,000 Americans are estimated to be living in the country, many of them dual citizens. Straight to CNN's Senior International Correspondent Mr. Sam Kiley live for us in Djibouti, where the rescue operation was launched.

But like he noted, he can only afford to lose four Republican members. And this is huge gamble for this speaker because he is trying to make the point to the White House that Republicans are united. So, he has to go to the floor and show that that is the fact. They also made the case that this is the week they are going to vote. So, you can expect, Kaitlan, that if there is a delay, that that also sends a signal to the White House that Republicans are not backing the speaker's plan. So, over the next couple of days, things to watch, conservatives are asking for some small changes to be made to this legislation. Leadership has given them the message that this bill is what it is. And that if they make any changes that satisfy the right flank of the conference, they could sacrifice and lose some of those votes from the moderate wing.

Among Democrats, 51 percent say, the president should not run for a second term. And that really mirrors the findings of other recent polls showing lukewarm support for Biden's re-election bid.

The other good thing here, Don, is that these bird strikes very rarely end in injuries, maybe 0.1 percent over the lasts 30 years have caused an injury to a passenger or a pilot.

The first one, as you noted, is to the treasury inspector general seeking an investigation of former Trump Aide Garrett Ziegler. Now, Hunter Biden's legal team alleges that Ziegler has obtained and posted suspicious activity reports known as SARS. They point to the fact that on a podcast late last year, Ziegler claimed to have an insider, JPMorgan, who is helping him obtain this. Biden's legal team describes this as a conspiracy to illegally post these records. Now, we have reached out to an attorney for Ziegler. We're told by a source familiar with Hunter Biden's legal strategy that he has been a top focus for them in this more aggressive approach. They've also filed a lawsuit against Ziegler, alleging that he was harassing members of Biden's team.

There's a racial homeownership gap and low income and first time homebuyers, these federals rules, these rules are meant to make it a little bit easier for them to buy a home.So, these mortgage fees are changing May 1st. This is calls the low level price adjustment matrix. It is mind-numbing. Basically, there're upfront fees for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They will change. They relate to credit scores and down payment amounts, and in some cases, and this is getting a lot of attention online, higher credit score borrowers may pay a little more on these upfront fees. Lower credit score borrowers will pay a little bit less. Now, overall, it does not make sense to try to have a lower credit score. I mean, that's not -- you're going to pay more if you have lower credit score. This is trying to narrow that gap between the higher credit score borrowers and lower credit score borrowers.",
