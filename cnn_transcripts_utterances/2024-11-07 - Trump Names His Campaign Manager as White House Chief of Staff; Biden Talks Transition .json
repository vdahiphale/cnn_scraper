Stand by for details on what that may mean for his administration.Also tonight, President Biden promises the American people there will be a peaceful transition of power in Washington. Behind the scenes, Democrats are casting blame on the president for the Trump victory, fuming that he didn't step aside sooner. And the cliffhanger up on Capitol Hill right now. We're awaiting the results of key races that will determine control of the House of Representatives. Democrats clinging to hope they can flip the chamber while Republicans say they're confident they'll hold on to the majority. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And we begin with the breaking news on the Trump transition and the president-elect's announcement of his new White House chief of staff. CNN's M.J. Lee is standing by at the White House. But, first, let's go to CNN anchor Kaitlin Collins. She's in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kaitlan, what are you learning about Trump's decision to pick Susie Wiles as his incoming White House chief of staff?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, it's a significant decision for a significant role. Obviously, the chief of staff in any White House is one of the most important decisions that you see a president make. We reported last night that Trump was expected to make some of those first decisions within hours, and here is his first big one as Susie Wiles, as his chief of staff.Of course, chief of staff is a tough role for anyone, but certainly in the Trump White House in his first term, it proved to be one of the most difficult positions. He ultimately had four chiefs of staff serve in that role, starting from Reince Priebus and ending, of course, with Mark Meadows in that position as Trump left office. Susie Wiles, though, for people who don't know her and may not know her, because she is not a Trump face that you see out on T.V., she actually was on stage with him the other night when he was giving his victory speech after being declared the winner at about 2:00 in the morning. He calls her up to the microphone. She declined to speak and instead turned to her campaign co-chair, Chris LaCivita to take the mic. She is not someone who is often very much in a public-facing role. But while she gets a lot of credit behind the scenes for navigating the Trump dynamics, which, of course, is a very difficult position in terms of not only working with him, but also the environment that he operates in that can often be quite chaotic. She is someone who lasted during his entire campaign. That is not something that we've seen in his last two runs for the White House. And she's really been around him, Wolf, in his past runs but also in a real capacity ever since he left the White House. She's effectively been a chief of staff kind of role since then. And so I should note, Steve Contorno reported earlier that she was very clearly the top choice for this role. She did make clear she had some conditions of her own, including having some sway over who has access to the president and to the Oval Office. That is something that has famously caught up and tripped up other Trump chiefs of staff in the past when it was kind of this freewheeling situation, something we saw General John Kelly try to deal with when he became the chief of staff back during his first term. And so this is a significant role for Susie Wiles. She is, of course, the daughter of the late broadcasting legend, Pat Summerall. She is someone who has been in Trump's orbit, who knows him well, and has been seen as a stabilizing force. And now she is getting the tip from the president to take this as his first major staffing pick that he has announced since winning the election, Wolf.",

Vance said a few weeks before the election may be even more important than the vice presidential role who jump is going to pick as his next attorney general. Of course, he famously was upset with the previous two picks he had in Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr and the actions they took at the Department of Justice. Often, he thought that they should be doing more of what he wanted them to do. And now he's deciding and deciding carefully who he is going to nominate for that position this time around.There are several names under consideration, I should note, but one of them tonight, we're learning, is the Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey. He is someone who has been running in that position since 2022. [18:05:00] He was just actually elected on Tuesday night to his first full term as the attorney general there in that state. And we are learning tonight that he's under consideration for that role. Whether he ultimately gets the nod is something that remains to be seen. He is someone who often appears on Fox News. He sued the Biden administration over the student loan forgiveness program, and so he's certainly aligned with Donald Trump. But I should note, Wolf, I'm here in Palm Beach, it is very much a Hunger Games kind of style situation that you're seeing playing out right now, where everyone who is interested in getting a job in a second Trump term is either down here trying to get in touch with people down here. So, it remains to be seen who ultimately gets picked for those positions, Wolf.",

Eastern, for her show, The Source. We will be watching. Let's go over to M.J. Lee right now over at the White House with the latest on the outgoing administration. M.J., President Biden spoke publicly about the transition of power. His finger pointing over the Democrats' defeat clearly intensifies. What's the latest? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Wolf. You know, over the years, we have heard President Biden use this line when he has discussed Donald Trump, and that line is, you can't love your country only when you win, clearly a reference to the fact that Donald Trump would not accept his defeat back in 2020. But earlier today, when the president spoke here at the White House in the Rose Garden and used that line, he was directing it not at Donald Trump this time, but the millions of Americans across the country that he said he understands are feeling disappointed and frustrated by the results of the election this week. But he said, look, we are in a democracy. And when there is a free and fair election, you have to accept those results no matter what those hard feelings might be. This is more of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. I also hope we can lay the rest of the question about the integrity of the American electoral system. It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And over the last few days, we have spoken with numerous Democrats who are fully blaming President Biden for what happened this week, believing that none of this would have happened if he had actually stepped aside and decided not to seek a second term, the idea being that had there been a full competitive Democratic primary, the strongest nominee would have been chosen. That may have been Vice President Kamala Harris, it may have not been, but that campaign would have run its course. They would have had a chance to set up a robust campaign, which obviously the vice president didn't get a chance to do.And I will tell you, as a part of our reporting, part of the anger that is being directed at the president and some of his closest advisers is this idea that whenever Democrats over the last few years raised any concerns about his health, his stamina, that those were really quickly shot down and were not tolerated inside the Biden White House and those close to him. For example, this is what one senior Harris campaign official told me. They said, the lack of a competitive process for a replacement that he didn't allow for that to happen, people are still angry about the shunning that they took for speaking out earlier about him. So, Wolf, as this soul searching process is just beginning for Democrats, the president's role in all of this is clearly going to be a big part. Wolf?",

I think Trump made the best decision for himself, you know, the best decision for the party and for the country. Susie knows how to execute, and that's the most important thing that President Trump wants. He doesn't want a lot of people talking. He wants people who will execute. And she knows how to execute as well. She knows that she has tremendous amount of relationships here in Washington, D.C. She has the trust of the president. She has the trust of campaign staff. A lot of us would walk through fire for her. And we're excited she has it. And I do like to point out, you know, she's a woman.

He is not just speaking about new arrivals. He's talking also about people who've been in this country for the past 20, 30, 40 years.To do that seismically, to have to, you know, have law enforcement that are correlating at the federal level as well as in the states and cities across this country, that does require a significant amount of money.

However, in the Senate, it still requires 60 votes on some things, and Republicans will not have 60 votes.But I think the finger pointing and the soul searching that is underway right now in the Democratic Party, it's not unique to Democrats. It happened in Republicans over the years. I'm thinking back to when Barack Obama was reelected in 2012 and Republicans were talking about, we need to do an autopsy and figure out really how to rebuild the party. Parties get rebuilt on personalities and people we may not even be thinking about now. But for the short-term, Democrats will have to make a decision if they're going to be part of the resistance or some may find, you know, some need to cooperate on some things. I think Senator Schumer has already said we'll work in a bipartisan way on some things.

The Democrats are known as the party of the elites, which is the reason they lost many Hispanic male voters, for example. And this is -- you know, this is a huge issue for them. It wasn't a message problem or a messenger problem, per se. They have a problem with voters in this country.

Because if you're going to say that the Democrats were not the party of the working class or have abandoned them, which I've heard several working class people say, then I question how or why there is no connection between all of the union and workers rights that were granted during the Biden-Harris administration.Why when you have a president who is fighting for a living wage, fighting for higher minimum wage, why when you have somebody who is -- as of today, there was an announcement about SNAP benefits being expanded for people who are on college campuses because a lot of them can't afford to eat. When I see things like that, and you're talking about individuals who are literally working tirelessly, the Democrats in the House as well as President Biden and Kamala Harris, to ensure that individuals every day can feed their families and they have the policies to prove it, and people who are beneficiaries of said policies are still arguing, even though the Trump administration previously and Trump have largely only done one thing.

This is how it has normally gone.So, I think President Biden is very clear, wants to send a signal, that the office of the presidency is larger than any one man and it's a rare moment in history when, of course, Donald Trump is coming back. And we do not know -- this is kind of the living version of the letter that presidents usually write for one another and leave it in the desk of the Resolute Desk. Very few people know what it's like to be president, obviously. So, look, I think President Biden will have -- he's sending a signal that this is what American democracy is.

That does seem to be the lowest common denominator when you look at, you know, the wealthy industrialized nations of the world. You know, of course, this related to a breakdown of the supply chains, and that's what caused the inflation. And then there was a lot of money spent, but on a bipartisan basis to try to revive the economy here. But I think the Republicans did blame us for inflation wrongly so. And, in fact, America now has the lowest inflation rate of the G7 countries. And we have a record low unemployment rate. And of course, the stock market, which is the other thing the Republicans used to talk about, has been soaring and is at record high. So, in fact, as the economist said the other day, the American economy under Biden Harris has been the envy of the world.
