If you'd have told me five minutes before if this was going to produce a tornado, I would have said no.So, basically, as soon as it developed it's on the ground coming into town and the first thing that I really remember is just seeing that mobile home park on the northwest corner of town, the first thing that the tornado really hit when it was on the ground, and just mobile home after mobile home after mobile home just destroyed and then on fire on top of that.",

It was very rapid. So, I doubt that most residents, unless they maybe were watching the news or something like that, really had any time.

They'll need that in order to get access to the evidence in his classified documents case. This comes after the judge overseeing the case, Aileen Cannon, she issued her first order in the case telling Trump's lawyers that they had to request the clearance by today and report back to her by next Tuesday. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now. So, Evan, how long could the clearance process take?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, the Justice Department is going to expedite these security clearances. It can take a period of months to approve one of these things, but we're told that it can happen. At least a preliminary security clearance can be done in just a few weeks.And so that's going to be one of the first things that you can expect. There's going to be a little bit of contention between the two teams, between the prosecution, Jack Smith, the special counsel's legal team, and the former president's lawyers because they want to get started. They want to start taking a look at the evidence that the Justice Department says could prove their case. And, of course, they can't do that because these are classified documents. They cannot look at some of these documents until they get that approval. We know that Todd Blanche and Chris Kise, of course, have already presented themselves as lawyers who are going to be with this case through appeal. So, they have already put in their request for security clearances, according to sources who spoke to Kaitlan Collins. We also know, though, Rahel, that the former president is still working to hire additional lawyers. He's not finalized his legal team that is going to be working on this longer term. So, we expect that those people are going to have to get into the pipeline. Now, one thing that we are not likely to see anytime soon is this list of witnesses that the Justice Department was ordered by a judge, by the magistrate that oversaw the arraignment. They need to provide a list of witnesses to the former president's lawyers of who he is not allowed to talk to about this case. And so that is something that we know the Justice Department now has to provide to the Trump lawyers. We're not likely to see that publicly. But for the Trump legal team, it's a huge deal because it gives them a little bit of an idea of who the prosecution believes are going to be their witnesses in this case. So, that's, of course, longer term when we get to a trial. Rahel?",

They have to send their bill over to the U.S. Senate and they're going to have to find a way forward, because over in the Senate, you're going to need 60 votes to pass anything. That means a number of Democrats are going to have to be backing it, not to mention the majority leader, Chuck Schumer, is going to decide what actually comes to the Senate floor.

The first is, of course, our military and intelligence communities who are doing stuff you and I aren't doing, risking their lives, being sent abroad to deliver information that they should have every expectation that a president or former president of the United States, let alone anyone with national security clearance, will keep clear, will keep private. The second is our enemies. They know the basics of what our national security apparatus information looks like. It's in a bathroom of a former president. And so they should have all the confidence in the world that they can get it, have access to it and not rely on our intelligence assessments. And then the third, and this is really important, is our allies. Whether it's Five Eyes, whether it's NATO, it doesn't matter. They have an expectation.
