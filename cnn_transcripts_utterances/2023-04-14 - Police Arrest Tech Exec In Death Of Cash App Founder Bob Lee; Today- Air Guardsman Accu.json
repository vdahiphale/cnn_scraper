But now those cops are speaking out about the dramatic rescue. CNN's Amara Walker has the incredible story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLICE OFFICER 1:  (inaudible). POLICE OFFICER 2:  (inaudible). AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In the back passenger seat of the sinking car is a 3-year-old boy trapped in his car seat. ORLANDO BORRON, FATHER OF 3-YEAR-OLD (through translator):  I felt like I was dying, not so much for me but for the child. I've lived a little but he had just turned three. A. WALKER (voice-over):  The father, Orlando Borron, says he lost control of his car trying to avoid an oncoming vehicle and then crashed into a canal. Even as police arrived, he refused to leave his son's side. SGT. EDWARD WEBSTER, MIAMI-DADE POLICE:  That's what I saw when I got there. It was the father trying to hold on to his child, saying he can't get the kid out of the water. A. WALKER (voice-over):  When Miami-Dade police officers responded to the scene, Officer Emmanuel Walton immediately dove into the murky waters multiple times, each time coming up empty-handed. OFFICER JULIAN REYES, MIAMI-DADE POLICE:  Every time he would actually come out and he wouldn't come out with the baby it did worry us. A. WALKER (voice-over):  Minutes later, Officer Walton somehow located and freed the boy. OFFICE EMMANUEL WALKER III, MIAMI-DADE POLICE:  Eventually, I felt the baby seat -- the car seat -- and I pulled it as hard as I could because I couldn't figure out where the seat belt was or anything of that nature. Luckily, it broke off and the child was able to pop up to the top of the car. A. WALKER (voice-over):  Extricating little Christopher from his car seat was only half the challenge.
