And this is key because in July, the Supreme Court ruled Trump cannot be prosecuted for official actions.And in this filing prosecutors write, \"At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private one. He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office.\" Now, this filing also includes some never before seen evidence. Prosecutors argue that things like conversations with Vice President Mike Pence or then chief-of-staff Mark Meadows, could all be used in their case.

LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR, \"LAURA COATES LIVE\": Well, whatever pushback they offer is going to pale in comparison to the role of what White House Counsel is. White House counsel is not the private attorney of Donald Trump or any particular president. It's for the office of the presidency. They're concerned with what's happening in the current administration and in the prospective administrations. Why? They want to preserve things like what would be the conversations, presidential privileges, and the like, things that would go to the very heart and core mission of the office? And so, if you exclude that particular person and say, I want my personal attorney instead, you really undermine your ability in the future to say, no, no, no. I was asking because I'm the president of the United States. Yet and still, they'll likely say, well, counsel was counseling perhaps Donald Trump was not essentially knowledgeable about the distinction, he had an attorney present that's what he was trying to do and could then later go back to White House counsel. What we see in this filing though, does not suggest that they will be able to have a successful argument. This comes down to one very basic thing and Jeff is right, that its vague, but either you were acting as somebody in pursuit of an office or you were in office holder. If you are an office holder you have to abide by the parameters of the office and you cannot have these frolicking detours into personal behavior.",

I mean, the then president tweeting about Mike Pence which Mike Pence in danger. Was that not an official act of the president? NANCY GERTNER, FORMER FEDERAL JUDGE: Well, first of all, I think I disagree with Jeff because I think the Pence accusations here, the Pence data, I think is new and that's the difference between what we saw with respect to the January 6 committee and now. So, what Jack Smith is trying to do is show that Pence was not -- Pence and Trump were not acting in any official capacity because there was no official capacity beyond certifying -- a ministerial just counting the votes and nothing more. I also want to follow up what Laura Coates said, which I think is very telling, which is that in many of the conversations with Pence, it was not just -- excluding the White House counsel, but it was also campaign workers were in many of these conversations. It was clear then or it should be clear to a jury that what Pence was again, acting as an office holder -- as office seeker rather than office holder. Smith goes into great detail about how the Constitution expressly limits the sitting president and the sitting vice president's role in the electoral counting process, so, that someone can't continue their authority beyond the time that their term runs out. So, both the constitutional line as well as an evidentiary line and evidence line here that what Pence was doing in these conversations with Trump were not official. They were campaign discussions.",

The president is allowed to do both his official duties and of course to campaign. So, I think it helps him somewhat to try to draw this line, but since the main character in the drama is not covered by the Hatch Act, it's not quite as helpful as he wants.",

The contemporaneous notes written close in time are very important. It also shows you that there was manipulation that they're arguing was trying to happen there.

I'll just go to 2024 Republican primaries. Let's look in the rearview mirror first. This has helped Trump in the past. Ask Nikki Haley, ask Ron DeSantis. Remember when Trump was indicted on fraud charges in New York or when some of these federal cases came down, the political reaction was, and even some of the Republican reaction was this will hurt him. Instead, we got this, we got this. It helped him with the Republican base. It helped him raise money, and it helped a rally around Trump movement because a lot of Republican voters agreed with that. They're after, me, the deep state is out to get me, Joe Biden is orchestrating all of this. That's the rearview mirror. It helped him and it helped him enormously. Here's the question and Jamal just made the key point. So, let's just use battleground Pennsylvania, the most critical of the battleground states. Will it help Trump in all these red rural counties where his base is strong? Most likely. He'll probably raise some more small dollar donor donations and rally, here they come, and that is critical in a close race to turn out your base, anything that can motivate them. Attacks on immigrants, attacks on the prosecutors, anything to motivate your base helps. My question is what about down here in the Philadelphia suburbs where you've seen our pieces, Anderson.

How is Vice President Harris performing with young voters compared to how President Biden did in 2020?KING (on camera):  Some numbers, Anderson, to help with that question. Number one, just look at this choice for president. I want to stretch this out a little bit, excuse me for turning my back. This is our recent New York Times-CNN poll. It shows Donald Trump and the vice president tied -- tied among voters aged 18 to 29. Joe Biden carried that group by 24 points in 2020 in the exit polls. Being on the ground, remember, when you poll a smaller subgroup in a poll, there's a bigger margin of error. I can't quite believe it's a tie from being on the ground several times in Michigan, but there's no question, the vice president is doing better than President Biden was doing earlier this year, when a lot of young voters didn't want him to be the candidate anymore. But she's not doing as well as he did back in 2020. There's no doubt about that. Absolutely no doubt about it. Let me get that to move the other way. Here's one of the things about it. The disaffection over the Israel-Hamas crisis, their anger at the administration about this, among all Michigan voters in that poll, 67 percent said they're almost certain to vote. Only 55 percent of this year younger group said that. Young people, generally more activist, your first election, your second election, in most cases, a little not sure they're going to vote. That's part of this, 'eh'. And a lot of that 'eh' comes from the Israel-Hamas conflict.",
