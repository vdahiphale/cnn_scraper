CNN's Alex Marquardt has that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The explosion rocked northern Gaza and lit up the night sky, another angle appearing to show according to a CNN analysis, a rocket fired from inside Gaza, it explodes in the air, and seconds later, a blast is seen at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. CNN has not determined definitively that the rocket and the explosion are related. But in Tel Aviv today, President Joe Biden said US intelligence matches Israel's version of what happened. BIDEN: Based on the information we've seen to date, it appears as a result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. MARQUARDT (voice over): Biden didn't name the group, but Israel says it's Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Hamas and linked to Iran. The American assessment, less than 24 hours after the deadly strike was based on what the White House now says is intelligence, missile activity, and open source video and images of the incident the statement adding that some Palestinian militants in Gaza themselves believe it was carried out by Islamic Jihad.",

We also understand that some special operations support is being devoted to the region. One US military official who spoke with our colleague, Katie Bo Lillis called this a major shift and says there's a lot of focus on this from across the intelligence community. It remains to be seen, Anderson how these new intelligence assets can help try to figure out what Hamas may be planning, what they're doing, as they have these hostages, and as they brace for what Israel may do in terms of an incursion into Gaza.

When that happens and you see it now on the screen, when that rocket stops, that one's a hit, that one is a hit probably by Iron Dome missile.But when you see the other one right before this explosion, it appears like the rocket motor burns out. That tells me there was a failure in the rocket. When that happens, when it is a mile off of the launch site and the Israelis provided what looks to me like a radar, a Q-36 tracking of a rocket launcher, which they use to use the Iron Dome, it appears that that rocket just stopped in the air or flamed out and then dropped. And when it hit the ground, the explosion you see is much bigger. That one right there is much bigger than a normal rocket explosion, it had to do with a fireball that came after it. And when you look at the cars in the parking lot, you see some cars that are burned, others that are untouched, just feet away. So all of these indicators without actually doing a crater analysis on the scene and you have to be on the scene to do that, and also seen, you know, you pick up pieces, fragments of the rocket that hit, you can't be 100 percent certain. But I've got to tell you, the evidence we have so far seems to indicate what the Israelis are saying.

He said it was about half an hour with the Egyptian president, and that was where he agreed to allow about 20 -- up to 20 was the president's phrasing -- humanitarian trucks into Gaza. That is significant, because they've been at the Rafah Crossing, unable to actually get across and get to the people who desperately need it. So they certainly felt like they made some progress on that front. I think the question is, when does it actually happen? Does that act -- do we actually see those trucks cross the Rafah Crossing?

Ben, while speaking reporters aboard Air Force One, as Kaitlan was just mentioning, the President Biden flatly denied a \"Times of Israel\" report.

It focuses on air power. And certainly we've seen in the past, going back to the 1980s, the United States has become involved in Lebanon, using its air power, using its sea power. So that doesn't necessarily negate American involvement in a potential shooting war here in Lebanon. Obviously, Hezbollah is not in a position to counter the military strength of the United States. What we're seeing until now on the border with Israel is that every day for instance, today, six separate strikes, these are not strikes on civilian targets. These are very focused on military targets. Now, are they just trying to sort of tick the participation box saying that we helped Hamas during its war in Gaza? Or is this in preparation for something else? It's not at all clear, but it sent jitters throughout Lebanon. For instance, the UK has said, if any British nationals who are in Lebanon, they should book a flight out now because flights might not be available for much longer. So there is worry that Lebanon and Hezbollah of course could become more deeply involved in this war. And if that happens, there's the very real possibility that the United States could become directly involved in a Middle East war, perhaps not with troops on the ground, but with its airpower -- Anderson.",

We'll wait to see what the actual request looks like.And right now, I mean, there's no end in sight to what's happening on Capitol Hill. And so I think the White House has kind of mocked it at times, made fun of it, but now it's becoming a real issue for them because they cannot elect anyone. They have not picked anyone. And what he's going to be talking about tomorrow night is not just what's happening here in Israel, but also making the argument for more funding for Ukraine.

What we've built up is a very disturbing picture of just how highly organized and planned these Hamas raids were and of course, how much detailed intelligence and information the Palestinian Militant Group had collected on the Israeli communities that they targeted. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (voice-over): CNN has gathered chilling new insights and details on the Hamas assault inside Israel, including disturbing video taken by the attackers themselves as they rampaged through Israeli homes killing on sight, and then being killed. Searches of their dead bodies revealing a trove of highly specific Hamas battle plans, including these detailed maps now shared with CNN by the Israeli government, showing communities near Gaza like Kfar Aza targeted by the attackers. These were the terrifying scenes inside as the masked gunmen recorded themselves moving freely through the gardens of Israeli homes. Code red, code red, the Israeli loud speaker blares in Hebrew punctuating the sporadic gunfire. After the attack, Israeli first responders saw bullet holes and blood stains in room after room, in what looks like a coldly methodical killing spree. But while hundreds of Israelis were killed, some Israeli communities managed to repel the Hamas gunmen and save lives. A Kibbutz Mefalsim, also near Gaza, residents pushed back a Hamas attack and found documents on the bodies of the militants they killed with disturbing, highly accurate intelligence on their homes, including precise numbers of armed guards there, regional defense force, at least 20 residents, one document reads, and ten soldiers.",

It is a dark turn. Even for a group seen here parading before the attacks, that's come to symbolize the uncompromising face of Palestinian resistance and violence against Israel. Israeli officials say a document referencing ISIS and Al-Qaeda, which CNN has not been able to authenticate, was found on one Hamas gunman killed during this attack on Kibbutz Be'eri. The document given to CNN by a senior Israeli government official praises jihad against Jews and crusaders. Israeli officials say that's evidence Hamas is increasingly influenced by global jihadi ideology, an assessment many experts have dismissed. But in the wake of the unprecedented brutality of these attacks, U.S. officials tell CNN the Hamas threat may now be reassessed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Israeli response being late, being inadequate, was nonetheless enough to stop them, was nonetheless enough to stop the bigger tragedy, even though the tragedy we have is big enough.There will be fierce fighting in the Gaza Strip. We know that. But Israel has a strong enough army to do it. It tells us that we have to fight here and we don't have any choice. I've said this several times this week, there is no choice. I would like, Anderson, to speak a minute about what happened yesterday in the hospital. The hospital -- first of all, was proven, even though not everybody believes it, that it wasn't an Israeli attack. It was a jihad missile. But look at the hospital. We are talking about the parking lot. The parking lot is, like, 50-car parking lot. How did they get 500 people to die there at eight in the evening? So -- and again, I told you yesterday and Ehud Barak just said it to you in an interview, they have done this in the past. Terror groups use our humanity against us. They use the fact that we are very concerned about human lives, which are of the unattached civilians, and they use it against us. They've done this in the past; they will do this in the future.

But, she wanted to help other people when gunmen attacked the kibbutz where she was. Amit Mann is her name. She left the safety of her apartment. She went toward danger, and she gave her life to help others. In the process, she documented those final moments of life with photos and messages with her sisters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COOPER (voice-over): When Hamas gunmen arrived at the entrance of the Be'eri Kibbutz around 7:00 a.m. Saturday morning, they waited for a car to arrive and open the gate. Then they executed the people inside. A 22-year-old medic, Amit Mann, was already in the clinic. She had run there when rocket sirens first sounded at 6:30 a.m. She can have stayed in her apartment's safe room, but wanted to help in case anyone was wounded. For the next seven hours, Hamas gunmen roamed the grounds, burning homes, breaking into houses, hunting residents, slaughtering more than 120 men, women, and children.
