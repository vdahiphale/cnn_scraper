And this is now the top of the hour, 6:00 P.M. here in Washington, D.C. And happening now, breaking news, the U.S. military strikes more than 85 targets in Iraq and Syria, retaliating against Iran-backed militants, hours after the bodies of fallen American soldiers arrived back in the United States. President Joe Biden now warning that the U.S. response is just beginning. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. And breaking news this hour, President Joe Biden and the United States military making good on their vow to strike back after three American soldiers were killed in Jordan. The White House revealing moments ago that strikes on three facilities and in Iraq and four in Syria were successful. Our correspondents are standing by as our live coverage continues. Right now, let's get straight to Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. So, Natasha, what more are we learning about these strikes?",

      "sentences": "We are getting some additional information just in from the White House National Security Council as well as a senior official at the Pentagon Joint Chiefs. And we are told that the reason why there was kind of a delay here in conducting these 85 different strikes across these facilities, these seven different facilities in Iraq and Syria is because, essentially, they were waiting for good weather to present itself. And that window kind of opened today and it all came together so that they would avoid, of course, unnecessary casualties, according to the military official who's just briefing reporters here.Now, it is still unclear just whether there were any deaths that resulted from these strikes but what we did hear from General Sims, that senior military official, is that the U.S. does believe that they, quote, hit correctly what they meant to hit. Essentially they are very confident that they managed to degrade and destroy the facilities that they were aiming at. Now, according to U.S. officials including National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby, the U.S. did inform the Iraqi government beforehand, before they carried out these strikes inside Iraq. That had been a particular sore spot for the Iraqis that the U.S. had previously not consulted with them before carrying out strikes against Iran-backed militias inside the country, prompting them to actually call for the U.S. to remove its forces from the country and so we are learning that they did provide that heads up. And in these targeting of these facilities, they also encountered secondary explosions that was consistent with these facilities, of course, housing ammunition supplies as well as other weapons supplies. So, they are confident that these facilities were linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, particularly the Quds Force, which is one of the most extreme elements of Iran's military wing. And so this is a very significant escalation, of course, because it is the first time we have seen the U.S. strike Iran, Iraq and Syria simultaneously and target these Quds Force facilities. It remains to be seen how Iran is going to react to this. However, as we have been reporting throughout the week, it does remain unlikely at this point that the U.S. is going to strike any targets directly inside Iran, Alex.",

      "sentences": "Alex, you know, for the last several days since this tragic death of the American service people, we've seen nothing but telegraphing by all sides, by the United States and Iran, that they do not want a full-scale direct confrontation with each other. And so this seems to be, for the moment anyway, the way to get the message and the action against the actual militias that are believed to have targeted these soldiers and to have killed them.So, I think, you know, it reminds me a little bit of all the years I was in Iraq watching waves and waves of bombers from the United States trying to control Sam Hussein and whenever he stepped outside his rules and regulations, outside U.N. resolutions, that these are messages that are sent. It's not necessarily a direct war, but they have to send this very, very strong message. The Quds Force, of course, of the Revolutionary Guards, is the extraterritorial force, in other words, the force that does operations around the world, not inside Iran. And it is the one that backs and organizes all these militias. So, I think it's, you know, important for the United States to send that message. Also, it's been telegraphed, a little bit of reporting, and as you've heard, the various spokespeople who have come out, including the president tonight, to say this is just the beginning, reporting that suggests that this will happen over a prolonged period, over, you know, several, potentially several weeks, and on several different levels, not just military. So, I think there's an unfolding array of response that we might see trying to take this situation it had and, again, try to impose some kind of deterrence in this situation. But I think we shouldn't forget also that this is not just happening in a vacuum. This is happening as the October 7th war, since the slaughter in Israel and the counteroffensive by Israel. This is what has started all these Iranian proxies around Israel to start, you know, getting involved. So, it's not just in a vacuum. And, certainly, reporting that I've been able to do suggests that, you know, there's negotiations going on right now. How are these strikes going to affect negotiations to get hostages back, to get some kind of truce or whatever? But whatever happens, the idea that you're going to defeat Iran or its proxies on your own seems not to be, you know, consistent with experience in the past. And Iran clearly is saying that it wants at least a say in how this resolves in the Middle East, because it is the only one who can turn off its proxies, which are the only ones that are threatening Israel, right, Hezbollah, Syria, Iraq, and in Hamas, and the Houthis as well. So, the bigger picture in order to resolve this once and for all is to have some kind of negotiation also with Saudi Arabia and all the other states, but that has some kind of buy-in from Iran so that it calls its proxies off for the future and forever.",

First, want to ask your reaction to President Biden launching these retaliatory airstrikes on these Iran-linked targets not in Iran, but in Iraq and Syria. SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-UK):  I think the president thread the needle in terms of showing the commitment of the United States to retaliating against those who might dare to injure American troops abroad. I think the size of the attack that 80-plus targets using the bombers was a clear indication of our military might and our commitment to that. But also, he thread the needle by making sure that we did not escalate this into a full blown war, first by telegraphing and letting folks know that we don't want to war, but then also by attacking sites that are in Iraq and in Syria, not attacking Tehran, some of my colleagues have very carelessly called for. I thought that this was a good first step and we'll wait to see what else he has in store for these folks who dare to attack U.S. troops.",

The Houthis, in particular, have really stepped forward and are trying to win the support of other terrorist groups as well.I think that it is certainly linked, but at the same time, Iran has the ability to control these groups, and they need to call these groups back. I think the Hamas was allowed to do what it was doing because Israel and Saudi Arabia were very close to signing an agreement, and it's not in Iran's best interest, as far as their leadership is concerned, to see greater peace in the Middle East. But, again, we have to send a message that you need to pull folks back. I mean, I think the Iranians, for example, were quite surprised when some of these forces use ballistic missiles, and you saw that they put an end to that already. So, they have the ability to control these groups. They, after all, have been funding them for decades.

We've gotten a couple more details, Senator, that these strikes lasted around 30 minutes, just 30 minutes, this is according to the White House.

And they determined, according to the weather, that it was Friday. White House Spokesman John Kirby just told reporters this wasn't just a messaging exercise, this was about degrading these groups' capabilities. But the U.S., as you just put so well, has been trying to degrade these capabilities for weeks and weeks now. And I think this really just begs the question, will these strikes be different, and how will they be different? You know, the reality is that even though, as Natasha just said, the White House is eager to say right now that these strikes were successful, as far as they can tell, that they have gone really well, we won't know for a while what kind of degradation of these capabilities actually took place because of these strikes. And also, I think a big factor clearly is going to be what is to come in the coming days. The White House is making very clear that this is just the beginning, this is just day one, and there will be other strikes. They're obviously very reticent to lay out in any way when those might come, in what form these strikes might come. But I think we are just in the beginning of this, and we're just going to not know for a while the answer to the question of whether or not these strikes are going to have a different effect, and at least being a little more successful in serving as a deterrence this time around.",

It looks like this strike was -- these strikes were really oriented on going after the infrastructure, the locations, possibly facilitators associated with this, and was designed by its scope and scale to have as big of an immediate impact as it could possibly have.

You know, the language that we're using about, well, we worry about escalation with regard to Iran. Think about, Alex, what they're doing. They're the ones who are escalating, right? They're the ones who are killing Americans. They're the ones who are unleashing the Houthis to fire on American warships. They're the ones who killed -- their proxies killed American soldiers last week. So, the escalation is occurring. What we need to do, in my view, is re-establish deterrence. You do that by making it painful for their leadership, direct pain, like killing their Quds Force leadership, like President Trump did with Soleimani, but also, really importantly, undertaking these non-kinetic actions. And I guarantee you, our military would be very supportive of that. You know, a lot of times on these issues when they say let's re- establish deterrence, everybody goes to the Pentagon. All right, guys, go after them. But there're many other tools we have that will help re-establish deterrence. I'll give you one other. The Iranian people right now, millions of Iranian citizens hate their leadership, right? They have had these ayatollahs, this theocracy imposed on proud people. We should be doing so much more to help the Iranian people with their struggles against a dictatorship that they actually hate. And these are all kinds of different tools that I think can bring pressure on the regime.",

The Abraham Accords was an initiative that was really positive in the region, every country in the region was supportive, even the Saudis were supportive, with one exception, Iran. So, that's another strength that we have with regards to the Middle East right now. Our Israeli allies, of course, but our Gulf Arab allies, all really despise the Iranian regime. That's another element of American comparative advantage relative to them. But bringing all of those elements to bear on Iran, I think, is the real critical thing.

So, what he decided to do, if you remember, was pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal to the extent that it then collapsed. Now, that was an arms control deal. There were plenty of things wrong with it. It wasn't a complete, you know, overarching political and all the other bits, but it was an arms control deal on the nuclear matter, and it actually worked. Since President Trump brought the United States out, Iran has been enriching a pace and is much, much, much closer, very close, if it wants, to the nuclear weapon that the United States, Israel and all the others didn't want it to happen. That's one thing. Then President Trump thought that maximum pressure would beat Iran, and it didn't. So, the problem is that these are tried and tested, but didn't work methods. And there is just a huge political crisis in that region that has to be really solved. And don't forget right now, whatever people think in the United States, in the Middle East, in the Arab and Muslim world, they look at the war in Gaza, frankly, as Biden's war as well. So, yes, they're trying to get the peace and negotiations and get normalization, but this is the crux of it. This is the crux of it.",

The United States now making good on its vow to retaliate and seek revenge for Sunday's deadly drone strike on a U.S. military base in Jordan that left three American service members dead. Joining me now is the chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee, Democratic senator of Virginia, Mark Warner. Senator Warner, thank you so much for coming in. We just spoke with your colleague from Alaska, Senator Dan Sullivan, who said that the U.S. needs to be much more forceful that the Biden administration needs to take further steps against Iran directly. And he talked specifically about sinking Iranian ships in the Red Sea. What do you make of those sort of more hawkish comments that we've heard from some of your Republican colleagues? SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA):  First of all, this is a beginning of a process. There are seven sites here, 85 separate locations and the president's indicated that there will be more to come. And let's see the damage and remember, there are Iranian forces not only inside Iran, but around the region. I do like to remind my colleagues that I remember a meeting with President Trump where he indicated at that point that he was going to strike Iran itself. He thought better of it and decided a time and place where he could affect the most damage without breaking into full-fledged war with Iran, and it was literally six months later before we took out General Soleimani, a bad guy who was the head of the Iranian Quds Force.",

They stood up to the Saudis and the Emiratis for multiple years in their civil war, but what they're doing in the Red Sea, and frankly, we have 11- nation coalition striking back against the Houthis, British participated in our strike backs. But I think we need to ratchet that up. So you can't look around the region. But I would also add because the other thing that I'm frankly obsessed about is this border in Ukraine deal.

U.S. officials have said they believe Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for the attack on Sunday, which killed the three American service members in Jordan.Now Kataib Hezbollah is one of a few groups that are under an umbrella organization called the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, which actually operate in both Iraq and Syria, and who are backed by Iran with weapons, money, and training. Now, Kataib Hezbollah is considered the most powerful of those groups. In a surprise move earlier this week, Kataib Hezbollah announced it was suspending its military operations against U.S. forces in the region and tried to distance Iran from the attack that killed the Americans. That's clearly, that was a sign of nervousness over possible U.S. retaliation, which, of course, is going on right now. Now, overall, in the Middle East, Iran supports several proxy groups, but Tehran's control over these groups really varies, Alex. Iran's closest ally is the broader Hezbollah organization. That's based over here in Lebanon. Iran supports Hamas in Gaza, and the Houthis in Yemen. Now as for how much control Iran has over them experts believe Iran has the most opposed to influence with the broader Hezbollah group in Lebanon. Those smaller groups in Iraq and Syria, they seem to operate a little more independently of Iran. And the Houthis down here in Yemen, well, they are seen as a real wildcard, a group that Iran has the least amount of control over. And, in fact, Iran's leadership has reportedly been concerned in recent weeks over all the attacks that the Houthis have launched on commercial shipping in the region, in the Red Sea here and elsewhere -- Alex.",
