What he knows, what he may be able to testify to in this June trial -- if this trial goes forward.I would suspect though, that prosecutors are going to be looking for a ball and if they are going to try to make a case against Hannah Gutierrez Reed, he may have information that could help them make a more successful case and get a conviction against her.

That's next to Sudan.And this is the U.S.'s only permanent military base on the African continent that'll include aircraft that would bring in enough ground personnel to secure an embassy. So far, that is not a plan, but it's just contingency planning in case it becomes necessary. Just yesterday a U.S. deputy assistant secretary for African affairs, told congressional employees that the situation was too volatile to evacuate people. But this is a fast-changing situation. So far, there's been at least three attempts at a ceasefire in Sudan that have all fallen apart. You see smoke. Smoldering in parts of Khartoum, the capital. And these two warring generals involved in the power struggle can't agree on when to pause fighting, even for humanitarian reasons. Now I want to show you a map of Sudan to see exactly where it sits. This is a really volatile part of Africa, but there are some key diplomatic voices, really influential parts of the region, such as Egypt, which is neighboring Sudan as well as across the other side. The UAE and Saudi Arabia and there are Sudanese people who expect them to do more to employ these two warring generals to agree to the cease fire that the U.N. is asking for. And a short while ago the African Union asking for at least one week so that people can celebrate the holiday of Eid. Listen to this Sudanese political analyst. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
