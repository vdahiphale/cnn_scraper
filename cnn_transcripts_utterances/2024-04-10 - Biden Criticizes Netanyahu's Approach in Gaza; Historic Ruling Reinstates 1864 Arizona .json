So these things, so essentially it's an intensification of the hydrological cycle. And so, yeah, we are seeing more severe flooding.

And really, nothing underscores how important water is than when there is, when there are water crises. Because water crises very much become food crises because water is so fundamental to growing food. So a climate problem becomes a water problem, becomes a food problem.

      "sentences": "Shots fired!(GUNFIRE) JIMENEZ (voice-over): Reed goes down. Then three final gunshots, 96 in total, according to investigators. A gun was later recovered from the front seat of Reed's car. Porscha Banks had just been on the phone with her brother in the minutes before it all happened. Then she turned on a police scanner at her shop. PORSCHA BANKS, DEXTER REED'S SISTER: We're listening to the police talking, like saying, \"Shots fired.\" But I can hear all the shots from the scanner. I got to hear so many shots, so many shots, so many shots. But didn't know that it was my brother. So then to know, later on that night that those shots that I heard, and then the ambulance going past my shop was my brother, was the most heartbreaking thing that I could have ever felt in my life. JIMENEZ (voice-over): One of the family's attorneys argues this never should have happened in the first place. ANDREW M. STROTH, ATTORNEY FOR DEXTER REED'S FAMILY: There was a weapon recovered in his car. However, it started with an unconstitutional, pretextual, and unnecessary stop of Dexter Reed, and that's what precipitated the entire incident. JIMENEZ (voice-over): And questions remain over why tactical officers initiated a traffic stop for a supposed seat belt violation. As part of a brief statement, Chicago Police says this incident is still under investigation, but the stop is where it all began. ROOSEVELT R. BANKS III, UNCLE OF DEXTER REED: If you don't stop my nephew, he'll be alive today. JIMENEZ (voice-over): Reed's uncle sitting alongside his father. R. BANKS: When this happened to my nephew, I hope the police can understand that this is the same pain that they feel when an officer is killed in the line of duty. JIMENEZ (voice-over): It's a pain that manifests in memories and pain that manifests in despair.",

We saw the tech company Microsoft announce it would invest 2.9 billion U.S. dollars over two years, focusing on its cloud and A.I. development in Japan, making this Microsoft's largest investment in Japan in the 46 years it's been operational in the country.Now, this investment would also help open its first Microsoft research Asia lab in Tokyo and further cybersecurity collaboration with the Japanese government. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Now, on Wednesday, according to a senior U.S. government official I spoke with, we can expect Kishida and Biden to announce a joint defense council which would explore further military exports. We've already seen Japan agree to send U.S.-designed Patriot missiles to the United States that were made in Japan. So this would be an expansion of such efforts.",

So according to the experts I've spoken with, this would be much easier to coordinate military operations in real time. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
