Harris has been doing some intense prep at her hotel in Pittsburgh and taking breaks to get out and meet people in the battleground states. New CNN polling shows the two candidates are running neck and neck in several key battleground states. The campaigns hope the debate will help them win over some undecided voters ahead of the November election. And Donald Trump has spent his Saturday campaigning in another battleground state. He gave a lengthy speech at a rally in Wisconsin where he talked about the economy and called for a change to the 25th Amendment. It was a line clearly aimed at by President Kamala Harris.

      "sentences": "Well, Donald Trump spoke for nearly two hours on Saturday in Mosinee, Wisconsin. And this is a key battleground state. There is a reason that Donald Trump has been coming to Wisconsin so often. That's because Donald Trump's campaign views it as being a key part of their pathway to achieving 270 electoral votes come November.Now, look, they actually recognize it's perhaps even more important now that Kamala Harris is at the top of the Democratic ticket. Prior to Joe Biden ending his campaign, Trump's senior advisors had told me they were very confident about their chances here. But now recent polling, including CNN's own polling released last week, shows that Harris has actually made up a lot of in this state. She is currently polling a little bit better than Donald Trump here, although it was incredibly close. You're going to be seeing a lot more of him in Wisconsin in the next two months. But a big focus of Donald Trump's speech on Saturday was about the economy. Now, we know that this is the most important issue for most voters across the country, but it's also an issue where Donald Trump is polling better than the Vice President. And so you're going to hear a lot more about that as well on Tuesday when he faces off with Harris on the debate stage. And one other thing I think is very notable to point out is that he made some news on Saturday. He said for the first time that he would look into modifying the 25th Amendment if elected. Take a listen to what he said. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And finally, I will support modifying the 25th Amendment to make clear that if a vice president lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president of the United States, if you do that with a cover up of the president of the United States, it's grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office.",

Gonzalez had been under an arrest mandate since earlier last week for charges related to terrorism and conspiracy in relation to his role as a political candidate in the contested presidential election on July 28. He had been in hiding since early on in August when the authoritarian president Nicolas Maduro publicly asked and demanded for his arrest. Maduro was declared the winner of the Venezuelan presidential election on July 28 by the country's electoral authorities, which are widely seen as stacked with Maduro's allies, and they didn't provide any proof. Gonzalez and his opposition had instead published tens of thousands of electoral tallies, claiming that they had won an uncontestable win and demanding a clean and democratic transition of power. In the last few weeks, there has been an escalation of protest on behalf of the opposition and hard-fisted repression from Maduro's government, where at least 24 people have been killed and more than 2,400 have been arrested. Gonzalez's move to Spain, when his daughter and two of his grandchildren reside, marks the beginning of a new chapter in Venezuela.

And they've also called for an independent investigation saying that an investigation by Israel, which Israel says it will undertake and which the United States has asked Israel to undertake, would not be sufficient.You also noted that we've heard from the governor of Nablus saying that an autopsy concluded that Eygi was killed by an Israeli sniper's bullet to the head and that we can't independently confirm that. There's obviously anger also from the International Solidarity Movement, the pro-Palestinian NGO for which Eygi was volunteering. They have also laid the blame at Israel saying that forces were something like 200 meters away from them and that one of their members spotted a sniper on the roof. There's also been comments from President Erdogan of Turkey. Eygi, although she is a U.S. citizen, is of Turkish descent. President Erdogan, who over the last few weeks has been likening Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip to those of the Nazis, accused Israel of heinously murdering Eygi. Now, the IDF, for its part, is taking a more cautious approach than perhaps it has in the past. I'm reminded of the killing of the Al Jazeera Correspondent, Shireen Abu Akleh, a couple of years ago. Israel initially denied that it was responsible, blamed militant groups and then eventually accepted responsibility. On this occasion, the IDF, as you say, is saying that it responded with fire towards a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them. It's worth noting that the International Solidarity Movement saying that none of its activists were throwing rocks or stones towards Israeli forces. The IDF continuing saying that it's looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. So, for now, the IDF neither accepting responsibility nor denying that it was responsible for this killing. And that's a situation we'd expect to have clarified in the coming hours and days. Kim?",

Now, I paraphrase here, but he referred to how 90% of the text appeared to be agreed of some sort of ceasefire deal, but pointed out that the remaining 10% was always going to be the hardest bit. He said that they hoped they would be able to put some sort of more detailed proposal forward in the coming days. No precise time frame there, but also said how there needed to be, quote, \"political will\" on both sides for progress to happen there. But really, the room he was in, pausing for a moment of applause, to acknowledge what was referred to as his extraordinary personal effort over the past days. But also key on the agenda as well, the Ukraine war, one of two conflicts that dominated much of what they said. And they took the opportunity, both the British and American intelligence heads, to, well, essentially endorse, to pay compliment to, initially, what seemed to be a reckless bid by Ukraine to invade Russia's border areas. Hear what they said.",

But also, too, exactly what Russia's allies are indeed giving it. And they were asked about the possibility that China might decide, despite at this point mostly providing what's referred to as dual-use, non-real military equipment, that China might decide to cross the line and perhaps provide direct munitions and weapons to the Russians.
