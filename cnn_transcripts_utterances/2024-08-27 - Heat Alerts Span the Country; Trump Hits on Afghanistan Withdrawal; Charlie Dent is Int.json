And there was several reports of wind and hail. In fact over 120 reports with this swath of thunderstorms that moved across the upper Midwest. There were a few hail reports along the East Coast as well. So, today's severe weather threat extends across Wisconsin and Michigan and then moves to the mid-Atlantic for the day. Tomorrow, a slight risk of large hail, damaging winds. Can't rule out a tornado as well. This is what happens with the atmosphere gets too hot, right? And we have heat warnings and heat advisories in effect for over 75 million Americans, stretching from the East Coast through parts of the Midwest, including Chicago. It'll feel like 109 today if you step outside, factor in the humidity. Grand Rapids, my hometown, also feeling the heat today. But this is dangerous heat. You need to do the precautions that we talk about this time of year because this is just downright dangerous. Kasie.",

So, you did have Joe Biden having to move quickly. He has admitted to there being some faulty intelligence in terms of needing to get more troops out quickly, ensuring that a lot of those who were working on our behalf were also brought home safely. That has been said. But let's not forget that Donald Trump set this whole thing in motion and now wants to hide his hand. On top of that, it is hard for me to accept someone criticizing any military - any military move who also makes fun of POWs, who also talks about those who have been disabled who have fought for our country, who is also someone who does not and had himself avoided military service by being wealthy and privileged.
