The migrants spend the night, in a long orderly line, in the shadow of the barbed wire-covered border wall. Here, they wait to be called in, by Border Patrol agents.

They are returning people, under Title 42. But you don't see any strong images of people going back. If you recall, in 2014, Secretary Jeh Johnson, under President Obama, did the right thing. He treated people with respect, dignity and compassion. But, at the end of the day, he showed images of people being returned. Because, right now, we don't see any images of people going back. We just see the images are playing on your screen, right now, of people coming in. So, it opens up the pipeline for more people to come.

They know that would be a capability that would counter any long-range strike capability that the Russians have. And what I'm talking about there is they have been launching multiple salvos, of missiles and rockets, from long-range bombers that are outside the area of operations. So, they know that these Patriot systems, not only have a greater altitude, to strike targets, in the air, but a longer range. They can not only hit incoming missiles, with different types of ammunition, but they can also hit these long-range bombers. So, it causes the Russians to go further out.

Anderson, we're facing a situation, right now, in warfare. I'm going to simplify what Will just said. Warfare is made up of constant shifting, between offense and defense. Forces are either in the attack or the defense. Russia's attempting to go back on the attack. They haven't been able to do it. They've been on the defense, for about two months, while they've been hitting Ukrainian civilians, with rockets. But they want to go back and regain territory for a variety of reasons.

While overseas, I witnessed the dangers that radicalization of beliefs can have, on people, in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sadly, since coming to Congress, I've watched how Republicans and Democrats have weaponized fear, in much the same way. We all swore an oath, in this very chamber, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, not a political party, and not a single man. To my Democratic colleagues, you must too bear the burden of our failures. Many of you have asked me, \"Where are all the good Republicans?\" Over the past two years, Democratic leadership had the opportunity to stand above the fray. Instead, they poured millions of dollars, into the campaigns of MAGA Republicans. If you keep stoking the fire, you can't point the fingers, when our great experiment goes up in flames. Unfortunately, we now live in a world, where lies trump truth, where democracy is being challenged by authoritarianism. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That includes voting against a rules package, if it contains some of the most hardline demands that these critics are seeking, and also threatening to team up with Democrats, work across the aisle, to elect a Speaker, if the GOP can't decide.
