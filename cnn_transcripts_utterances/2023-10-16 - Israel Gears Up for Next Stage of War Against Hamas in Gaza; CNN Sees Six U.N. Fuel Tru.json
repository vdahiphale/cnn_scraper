You can see smoke rising over that part of the region.Now, if you look at Gaza, this is where the airstrikes have been taking place. But here, down to the Rafah crossing, an extreme southern border between Gaza and Egypt, our cameraman has seen critical aid now crossing from Egypt into Gaza, six U.N. fuel trucks entering at that border. That's a major development. Southern Gaza is also where Israel has told more than 1 million Palestinians to move from Northern Gaza into Southern Gaza. This is where Israel says they will be safer, Kate.",

They now believe 199 people are being held hostage by Hamas and Gaza. They've also said over the weekend that some may have been killed in transit, if you will, during the trip from Israel into Gaza.

The Secretary of State here for the second time in just a week as Israel prepares for a potential ground war with Gaza and as this war rages on. What can you tell us, Jeremy, about the plans here, what Secretary Blinken is doing back here, again, why it was so important for him to show up in this country a second time in such a short amount of time?",

Now, what role Iran has played in this attack still remains unclear. Here is the very latest on that from President Biden last night to 60 Minutes.

Because the evidence isn't there yet, that isn't on the table right now. But there are U.S. officials I've talked to who are concerned about a couple of Iran-related scenarios. One of them is if there is an attack in the north from Hezbollah, that is, in some way, Iran-supported. And, you know, we're at the moment right now where the Israelis have been so taken by surprise by the attack nine days ago in the south that they're sort of, you know, on a hair trigger for anything that would happen in the north and could well overreact. And it's a little bit like the way Americans were concerned after 9/11, that there would be follow-on attacks. That's why the warning to Iran had been so strong.",

And, of course, Secretary Blinken's stepfather was a Holocaust survivor, a point that he's made at several points along the way. They've all noted that this is the greatest loss of life for Israel in a single incident since the Holocaust. And, of course, Israel's formation was all built out of preventing a Holocaust from ever happening again.On the other hand, if you listen carefully to President Biden and to Secretary Blinken, you've heard two other things. You've heard President Biden say they shouldn't seek to occupy the Gaza. That is to say, before you go in, think how you're going to get out and how the Gaza would be governed in the absence of Hamas. And that's a really hard problem that I don't think the Israelis have the time or bandwidth to go deal with right now, but is going to come there successful. And the second thing is Secretary Blinken saying how you do this is important, because he knows the narrative will change as soon as we see images of Palestinian civilians getting bombed or killed in this invasion and that's going to happen.",

What are the parameters of what these U.S. forces will be doing? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, that really depends on a lot of factors, John. Good morning to you. The basic idea is that they are going to be able to project American force wherever they're directed to do so. So, what does that actually mean concretely? It could be anything from helping with humanitarian operations all the way to ensuring that no other power gets involved in the conflict between Hamas and Israel. So, that would involve flying combat air patrols, for example, off the Israeli and Gaza coast. It could involve taking a look and seeing what kinds of intelligence activities are going on in the Lebanon-Israel- Gaza area. So, all of these things are part of some of the missions that these aircraft carrier groups could do, but they are very much part of the power projection effort that the U.S. has at its disposal.",

They would go in, they would take out Hamas, they would hopefully free the hostages.And, of course, all of these things are somewhat idealized scenarios. They're kind of the planners look at this. Whenever you get into a combat situation, all of those plans don't quite go out the window, but they're certainly modified by the way in which the enemy or the adversary reacts. So, in this particular case, it could be a very tough slog through a very difficult urban terrain that we've discussed before, you know, narrow alleyways, you know, an intense area with lots of tunnels and buildings that have been damaged but can also serve as lookout posts for ambushes and things like that. So, it's going to be a very difficult terrain if the Israelis do go in there. But what President Biden is basically telling them, do what you need to do, but then get out. And that might be easier said than done, but it's certainly good advice based on some of the other things that have happened in Israel's past and also, frankly, in America's past.",

And what the Israeli authorities are doing, John, is they're telling people to move out of that border zone because right now it's more dangerous than it usually is. And so for protective purposes, they're moving people out of there and they're hoping that it will subside because that's what they really have to worry about when it comes to a possible two-front war.",
