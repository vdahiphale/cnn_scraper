      "sentences": "It really is fascinating, Jim. As you know, Musk's PAC has been doing this daily lottery in battleground states where all you have to do to enter is sign a petition in support of the First and Second Amendment, but it is only open to register voters. And there have been questions about whether this is sort of an illegal inducement to encourage people to register to vote.Now, last week, Musk received a warning from the Justice Department that this could violate federal law. He ignored that warning and continued doing this lottery. And this is the first legal challenge that has been filed against this controversial program. And here this has been filed by the Philadelphia district attorney. It's a civil suit alleging that Musk is violating consumer protection laws. Now, Musk has insisted that he is not here trying to induce anyone to register to vote. Most legal experts, Jim, say this falls really in a gray area. There have been a lot of lawsuits over the years about what exactly it means to induce someone to register to vote or to vote. It's found that you can, for example, give someone a ride to the polls, but you can't give them a cash or booze. So, here, it's unclear how this will proceed in terms of the legality. But of course, politically, we know this is likely going to devolve into a messaging war between a progressive district attorney and one of Trump's top surrogates was almost firing back against the Justice Department last week. And I would expect a similar response to the civil lawsuit as well.",

      "sentences": "I have not seen that response to this lawsuit. But in the past, again, they have insisted that they are not inducing anyone to vote or to register to vote. So, though lottery is only open to those who are registered to vote. And of course, they are focusing on battleground states. And I will say half of the $9 million that Musk has given away, half of that, has gone to voters in the State of Pennsylvania, and we all know that Pennsylvania is really arguably the most significant state in the Electoral College right now, really essential for Vice President Harris if she wants to win the Electoral College.So, it'll be really interesting to see what the courts do with this civil suit, because again, it falls in this gray area, but there's also sort of this proxy war between the Trump camp and progressive politicians at play here as well.",

There's no place to breathe here.Listen, I've been in this game for a long time. I saw commercials against me during the last week of many of my campaigns and I decided to vote against me.

I suppose one of the things we don't know is what sliver of those voters might be voting against the former president. Is that possible? And are you seeing that dynamic at play in North Carolina?

And vice versa, there are also some Democrats that are unsatisfied.The biggest issue I have is we've got to make sure -- I'm a group with the right count here in North Carolina. We need to educate our voters on how the voting system works in North Carolina. So, regardless of who wins, there's support of the process and the results of that process. And there's no types of violence out on our street. That's my major concern. And we've done some things in North Carolina, including voter I.D. now, including paper ballots, including no electronic connection to Dominion voting machines. We're trying to restore the confidence. So, regardless of the outcome of the election, people go. OK. The process worked.",

The Democratic Elections Board has tried to keep third-parties off the ballot, you know, things of that nature. OK. That's all legal. That's politics. What we've got to make sure is that we communicate that the early voting process works, the mail-in voting process works, voter I.D. works, that's my major concern because I think our constitution is stronger than any of this rhetoric.",
