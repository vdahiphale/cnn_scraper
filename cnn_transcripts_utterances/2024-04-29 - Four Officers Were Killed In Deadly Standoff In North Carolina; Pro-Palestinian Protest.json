But local police chief says that as officers approached the suspect's home, someone began shooting with a high-powered rifle. Officers killed a suspect.

Yeah, if you talk about something like weapons, it's fairly easy to say if universities' money can go into a company that makes weapons that are being used in Gaza right now, fairly easy for them to say, we see your complaint here. But what about other things like technology, computer science, public health, transportation, space, energy and renewables, all of which are in trade in some fashion with Israel? For example, what if you said we as a university are invested in computer science? We do Cloud storage and cloud storage that's used by public health. Suddenly, everyone says that's great. But what if that same Cloud storage is also used by a weapons company or by a military firm? That's why this gets so tricky so soon to figure out what this is being used for. And it's also complicated, as you know, Laura, because so much investing these days is done by funds that include a lot of different hedge funds and mutual funds.

So, I had been invited by some students to stop by the encampment, which I did. Then I was asked to please try to de-escalate the situation with the administration. And I went to talk to one of the assistant chancellors who was there, along with some of the select board members who were also there from St. Louis. We went, we tried, we didn't succeed. And within an hour or two, it's not just that we got arrested, we got assaulted. We were assaulted with bikes used as weapons and really brutalized and beat up and, you know, and then thrown to the ground, arms, you know, handcuffed behind our backs with the zip ties, and then walked over. So, in that film you showed at the start, that was the very end of a process that was extremely brutalizing and violent. And I would point out that these tactics that are being used by the police have actually been imported from the Israeli Defense Forces, which we now call the Israeli Occupation Forces, who've been undertaking these training programs in most of states, at least many states, and certainly in Georgia, in Louisiana, in Texas.

There's the fear of an emergency. But there is no danger here. The danger is being imported along with the police. These are riot police which are creating a riot. The protests themselves and the encampments, I've been to many of them. They've been extremely peaceful. They've been educational. They have been, you know, extremely calm and community building.

It was only with the advent of the Zionists, who felt like this land belonged to them, that the violence came. And many Jews left, as well as Christians and Palestinians, with the entry of the Zionists. This is a very difficult topic for people of Jewish background to come to terms with.

Yeah, there's a bullet in him. Now, let's figure out if you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, they haven't even nailed down after over two years the cause of death. Was he hit by a car or was he beaten? And they said there's all kinds of dog bite marks on his -- up and down the arms and all kinds of different defensive wounds. It's nothing like being hit by a car. And that's why -- I hate to say this.

He insists Biden is still the man to beat in 2024. Just to tell you who I'm talking about, it's Professor Allan Lichtman, who has correctly predicted nine of the last 10 elections. And the one he got wrong, 2000. He argues he actually got right since Al Gore beat George W. Bush in the popular vote. So, if not the polls, what's he using as his barometer? Well, Lichtman says we should follow his 13 keys to the White House. Now, they're all listed here for you, and they include things like incumbency and third-party candidates, the state of the economy and, of course, social unrest. Now, if six or more go against the party in the White House, its candidate will lose. Fewer than six, its candidate will win. So where do things stand right now? Let's bring in Alan Lichtman to talk all about it. Thank you so much for being here. Listen, you have not made your official prediction yet. I see the keys.
