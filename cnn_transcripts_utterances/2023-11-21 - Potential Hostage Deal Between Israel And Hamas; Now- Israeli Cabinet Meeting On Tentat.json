That could be several hours still, we're told, before a decision is finally reached.But the terms of that deal are pretty clear. It would involve the release of at least 50 Israeli hostages from a Gaza by the Palestinian group, Hamas, over a period of between four and five days. So there'd be about 10 people every day being released. In the meantime, Israel would pause its conflict, pause its hostilities there and allow for that hostage release to take place. The Israelis have said they'd be open to the possibility of a further pause as well, as long as Hamas was open to the possibility of releasing more hostages. Also in exchange from the Israeli side, that would be a release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, women and children. And remember, it's women and children among the hostages that are being negotiated for right now. And there would also be potentially a much greater increase in humanitarian aid that allowed to go into the Gaza Strip from Rafa, from the Egyptian side. And so, this is the deal that's on the table right now. As I say, it's still being debated. The expectation is that it will be green-lighted by the Israeli government. Once it is, of course, there's still a grace period of 24 hours to allow people to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court. That's a legal period of 24 hours that has to be put in place before this deal can become operational. So the deal is being debated tonight, we're still some way off before we could see the first hostages released in this batch.",

Particularly here, right in the middle of Tel Aviv, there's a sort of daily -- these families and the supporters of those families as well that come here, you know, to make sure it's a big priority for the Israeli government, put pressure on the Israeli government to take as much action as they possibly can to get those people released.There are mixed feelings here tonight, because even though obviously, there's some excitement that some people could be released very soon, a lot of people will be still remaining hostages. At the end of this process, this is phase of it. Earlier, I spoke to, a very tragic story actually, one mother who's already lost her 16-year-old son. He was killed by Hamas on October 7th. And then her 13-year-old daughter was abducted, and is a hostage now. And she's optimistic, amazingly, that at least her daughter could not be released. Take a listen.

      "sentences": "Well, I think to Matthew's point, to date, it's been really difficult for negotiators to really bed down what both sides were prepared to concede to, because in the end there are demands from both sides. And the Israelis some weeks ago said they had two objectives. It was to dismantle and get rid of both the political and military assets of Hamas. And then, of course, get all the hostages released.On that first effort, to really degrade the Hamas assets on the ground in Gaza, the Israelis needed time to get in on the ground and get embedded within Northern Gaza and get that operation ongoing and to establish themselves. And that appears to be to a certain extent what the Israelis wanted to do before they conceded to any of the parameters of this deal, to really establish themselves on the ground for what it's worth. So from the Israeli side, I think the perspective is, we are now closer to one of our objectives, which is the dismantling of Hamas probably by no means finished. But certainly, you know, having a go at dismantling Hamas and its assets. On the Hamas side, there were two or three things that the group were looking for. One was an exchange of hostages felt held in Israel, for Palestinians, women and teenagers held in Israeli prisons. And the details of this deal, as far as multiple sources have told us, is that that will now be on a three to one ratio. For every one hostage released in this deal, there'll be three released from Israeli prisons. So if there are 50, released in this next four days, then there'll be 150 release on the Palestinian side. They also wanted to see a pause in hostilities for a significant period of time, looks as if they've got four days. And that pause in hostilities is a pause in the Israeli ground operations and the flying of surveillance drones over Gaza. That will stop for periods of these days. And that suits Hamas who want to, they say, get out and find where these other hostages are. But also some could argue would allow them to reorganize themselves. That might be the argument and certainly is a criticism from someone the right wing of the or in Israel. They also wanted to ensure that there was aid and fuel coming in through the border. And they've certainly got the parameters of this deal. 300 trucks a day access into Gaza from Israel. So I think over the weeks, the shape of these parameters and the demands on both sides had become easier to deal with, with the -- for the mediators who just needed, they've said for weeks now, a period of calm. So that is why I think we've got to where we are today, this proposal. Let me just close with this. This proposal was delivered to the Israelis by the cadres the wee hours of this morning. It is now after midnight and they are just waiting to get the green light from the Israelis as far as the category of mediators are concerned. And diplomatic sources I've spoken to say Hamas has already signed off on this deal.",

      "sentences": "Well, Pam, as you know President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu have had many, many conversations since October 7th. And that's not including the trip that President Biden made to Israel to show his support to the people of Israel. And in every single one of those conversations, basically, we are told, the issue of securing the release of these hostages has come up.And it was very interesting the comments that the Prime Minister made when he was speaking to his cabinet. He said in part, \"In the last few days, I talked with our friends, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, I asked for his intervention in order to prove the outline that is presented to you. And it was indeed improved so that it would include more hostages and less prices. These talks bore fruit, President Biden got involved, and I thank him for that.\" Netanyahu basically confirming that the US did play a helpful role in trying to get more hostages out as a part of this potential agreement. But we also know, Pam, that the US has been urging, both in private and in public, urging Israel to accept a multiday pause. This is something that the Israelis had shown a real resistance to. You'll recall, even just last weekend, Prime Minister Netanyahu in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, basically saying a multiday pause he sees as a short ceasefire and that he wasn't OK with it. So the fact that this is where we are with this potential deal really goes to show you the distance that Israel has traveled, and what concessions are willing to make in order to get these hostages out. BROWN: Yes, that's important context for sure. So, Matthew, as you pointed out, the Israeli government is set to vote on this proposal at any moment now.

But you also have to, as I think I mentioned earlier, factor in the legal requirements for a 24 hour period of grace, which will allow people in Israel to appeal this decision in the Supreme Court. That pertains particularly to the decision to, you know, through the agreement to release Palestinian prisoners. The way it's been explained to me is that any Israeli who has been affected by the sort of reason that those Palestinians were detained in the first place, has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court for them not to be released.Now, it's understood that the chances of the Supreme Court intervening to prevent this deal going ahead, you know, given what's at stake are pretty low. But nevertheless, it's a sort of legal hoop that has to be jumped through before this deal if it is passed tonight by the by the cabinet of Israel, before it can fully go into force. So we're looking at, you know, if it's in a couple of hours tonight, it'll be 24 hours from then before we're likely to see the first hostages, the first prisoner exchanges take place.",

      "sentences": "That's right. So in this recent spate of attacks that have been ongoing since October 17th, pretty much daily by these Iran-backed groups, they have largely been using rockets and drones and kind of smaller equipment to target these bases. But in yesterday's attack on Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq, they actually used a close range ballistic missile, according to the Pentagon. And that is a really significant escalation because these missiles, they can travel greater distances, they have larger warheads. And all around can cause greater damage to these bases and pose a greater risk of injury to U.S. service members.And so despite the U.S.'s efforts to try to deter these attacks by these Iran-backed back groups, they have launched attacks three times on. You have Iranian facilities in Syria being used for weapons storage, and training facilities, for example, the Iran-backed groups continue to launch these attacks, pretty much almost daily. The number now stands since October 17th, at over 60 attacks on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria. And the U.S. did retaliate yet again, against this U.S., this Iran- backed strike on this base in Iraq, just yesterday, targeting a vehicle that the U.S. says was carrying some of these militants, and that strike did ultimately kill several of those attackers in that vehicle. But still, the question remains, you know, how sustainable is this U.S. approach, because while the U.S. is trying to deter these groups, trying to communicate to Iran that they expect the Iranians to rein in these proxy forces, clearly at these Iran-backed militias, they are not deterred.

Because Harrison Floyd has made a number of inflammatory comments on social media, things attacking potential witnesses, obviously for this case in Georgia, including people who helped certify the election in 2020.So one of the things that Fani Willis was saying is that it was clear that these were things that Harrison Floyd should not be doing and that the judge needed to essentially cut -- bring it down on him because of that, listen to her arguments today in court.

She usually has district attorney, other prosecutors doing this. And what it really does, you know, it gives us a little bit of a window into how we might see her arguing when this case finally does go to trial, it's sometime in the coming months.But one of the things that I think you can take away from this is you can see the judge having a lot of reluctance to revoke bail, again, defendants have a right to defend themselves. They have a right to criticize their prosecution. They have first amendment rights. And I think that's what you're seeing from this judge. A lot like what you saw yesterday, right? You and I were talking about this yesterday with the appeals court. You know, they were definitely troubled by some of the things that the former President Trump says on social media, and they believe that obviously, there's some limits. But as you can see, they're also very, very conscious about the rights of defendants to defend themselves and to speak out publicly. So I think you're going to see a new order from this judge, which will define what Harrison Floyd sought to say.",

Allowing these defendants to defend themselves and criticize the prosecution, but also as Fani Willis claims, you know, Harrison Floyd, in this case, he violated the terms of his agreement.

And so that is going to create a thorny free speech or First Amendment question. In any case, you've also got this other problem where there's another defendant in this case, who keeps speaking publicly and getting away with it.Now, certainly, Donald Trump's statements often are in the context of other legal proceedings, not this one. But he's certainly made statements that were as inflammatory if not more so than what Harrison Floyd did, and then blocking Harrison Floyd up for the same conduct of the former president that he's gotten away with. We just have created an odd situation. And I don't -- and I think courts are going to continue to struggle with this, as long as the former president is still defendant.",

So they can't take too long to decide. But I'm not necessarily surprised that it hasn't come down in a day. I mean, just to follow up a bit, you know, and pick up where Elliot left off as well as it relates to both the Georgia case and the federal case.I think the overall issue that all of these different judges, whether at the state level or at the federal level are really going to have to be careful about and what they're probably struggling with is they have to make sure any rule that they come up with in the context of a particular individual or particular defendant has to be applied equitably. So whatever rule in the Georgia case, the judge decides to draw the line at for Mr. Floyd. The judge then also has to be prepared to draw that exact same line for the former president. And it's similar to the issue with the federal case as well, any of the defendants who, in the federal case, the former president, or the Georgia case, the multiple defendants, any of these defendants who engage in social media who speak publicly, which is many of them, have to be -- the law has to be applied to them equally, when it comes to what they're going to be allowed to say in the context of defending themselves in the court of public opinion.",
