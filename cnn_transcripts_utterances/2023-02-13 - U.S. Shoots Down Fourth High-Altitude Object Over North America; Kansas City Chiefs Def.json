U.S. fighter jets being scrambled and shooting down three mysterious flying objects in just the last three days alone. The White House and Pentagon are now facing growing pressure to answer just basic but burning questions. What are these objects? Who sent them? They were all different shapes and sizes, according to officials. They were flying at different altitudes.We're told that the latest object was shaped like an octagon and shot down over Michigan near Lake Huron. It was flying 20,000 feet up, much lower than the objects that were shot down over Alaska and Canada on Friday and Saturday respectively. It was at a lower than the cruising altitude of a commercial airliner. The suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. was 60,000 feet in the air for comparison. It's a lot higher than the other objects we've been seeing in recent days. But lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are demanding more details from the White House, including the Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  We prefer them to be trigger happy than to be permissive. But we're going to have to see whether or not this just the administration trying to change headlines. What we're seeing here is a number of announcements by the administration without any real information being given to Congress. This could be because they don't have any information.

We spoke with some Pentagon officials on the phone last night and they put it pretty blatantly when they said, one of them, that they believe that this is the first time that U.S. Northern Command has used kinetic action, the military, to take down an airborne object in U.S. airspace. So, this is unprecedented. They're trying still to figure out a lot of the questions that lawmakers have answers to.Now, over the weekend, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, and they spoke after that object was downed over Canada. They both authorized the downing of that object. What they focused on was the need for recovery, to better understand the origin and the purpose of that object. But as you noted just out of the front there, there were three objects that were downed over the course of three days. On Friday, there was an object downed over U.S. coastal waters around Alaska, then the one over Canada on Saturday, on Sunday, another object downed by U.S. fighter jets over Lake Huron. Now, there is no clear connection to any of these and that Chinese spy balloon that was downed off the coast of South Carolina just last weekend, but the recovery efforts here are what U.S. officials are really looking at to try and learn more about where these objects came from, what they were doing in U.S. airspace. And we heard last night from the commander of Northern Command, however, that recovery efforts for that object that was down over the coastal waters around Alaska hasn't begun because the teams are still working to locate that object.",

And, in fact, when NORAD took down that balloon on Saturday, or what has been described now as a balloon, I think it was the first time that NORAD had actually fired in a real live situation, not training, in North American airspace, which gets to the point of how unusual this is.But this is a big distinction between the first balloon, the one that clearly came from China, and the three that we've seen now. For the first one, the U.S. actually tracked it as it was leaving Hainan Island in China and saw it go up over the Aleutians and then, of course, warned the presidents and they made the decision, right or wrong, to track it across the United States. These other three, there's no indication right now that they came from China. They're small size suggests they may have been much more local. We don't know if they were foreign powers balloons at all. And so that tells you that we've sort of got two separate issues going on here. The first is how well we actually track these as they come into U.S. airspace and understand what the sensitivity of our sensors are. Clearly, that sensitivity has been turned up in recent times the way you might turn up a magnetic reader in an airport. And then the second is what are the conditions under which you shoot them down. And it's not clear right now that these posed -- the latest balloons posed a major threat other than to commercial air traffic.",

But China has said that the U.S. has illegally flown balloons into China's sovereign airspace without Beijing's consent for more than ten times in 2022. We spy on China. They spy on us.

It's looking to get an advantage on our side. Whether they're spy balloons really remains to be seen because we have the kind of technology that could read literally somebody's nametag in a fox hole down from space, if we had to do that. So, again, it's important that we're in high altitude. It's important that we're in that space. And we're going to use it to our advantage.",

They dig and dig with their bare hands and whatever they can find, desperately trying to reach their loved ones. It's too late for rescues now. They just want to bury their dead.Mohammed is searching for relatives, expressionless and numb, he tells us 21 of them, including children. Life here feels like one endless cycle of loss and grief. Most have been displaced time and time again by more than a decade of war. They're now homeless once again. We were sleeping under the trees but it was so cold, we came here, Ansultan (ph) tells us. She begs the international community to send them shelters. We just want a tent, she says. I wish we had died with everyone else so we don't go through this, she tells us. We survived only to live this misery and agony. They have nowhere left to run. Millions are trapped in Idlib. It's the last rebel-held territory in Syria. Mohammed says that she and her family fled Aleppo province and came here. She says they escaped the fighter jets and the airstrikes and she says we came here and the earthquake followed us. She says, death follows Syrians everywhere. 700 people lived in this flattened residential complex, only a handful survived. Young men from nearby villages came running to help get people out, she tells us, but what can they do? They tried digging. We heard people screaming get us out, get us out, then they went quiet. They all died. Two days later, they pulled a little boy and girl. Their dead bodies were still warm. Others made it after hours of this painstaking rescue. Little Ahmed (ph) was pulled out alive. The White Helmets, heroes of Syria's war, did all they can to save as many as they can. They urge an appeal for international support.",

And I can tell you from what you've seen in that piece, that aid couldn't get there soon enough. But many Syrians will tell that this is just too little too late. And a U.N. official who is at the border, senior official, saying that the Syrian people have the right to feel abandoned, that we have failed the people of Syria once again and that this failure must be corrected as soon as possible, Don.",
