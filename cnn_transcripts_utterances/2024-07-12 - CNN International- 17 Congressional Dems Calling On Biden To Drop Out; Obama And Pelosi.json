I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Straight ahead, a growing number of Democrats are calling for Joe Biden to step aside. But, the U.S. President for now is clear he will keep fighting for reelection. Then, Alec Baldwin's tense trial resumes in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and we're expected to hear the testimony of the armorer of the film \"Rust\". We're live outside the courtroom. Plus, after seven months of pre-wedding celebrations, the son of Asia's richest man is finally tying the knot in lavish style. We'll have the latest as the main event gets underway. All right. After a news conference that was neither a rousing success nor an unmitigated disaster, Democrats are left wondering today what to do about Joe Biden. For growing number of congressional Democrats, the answer is to call for him to end his reelection campaign. There are now 17 elected Democrats publicly urging him to step aside as the nominee. Prominent Representative Jim Himes joined that list a short time after Biden's Q&amp;A session with reporters. Biden's high-stakes news conference showcased his ability to speak expansively about the economy, foreign affairs, but it also included one notable flub, which came right after a verbal stumble earlier in the day.

While more Democrats are publicly calling for Biden to step aside, the conversation happening in private may be more significant. CNN has learned that Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have been talking about Biden's chances and they're both concerned, but neither is sure what to do next. Democrats say Pelosi and Obama are among the very few people who have the kind of relationship with Biden that would allow them to have a truly candid, rather, conversation with the President. CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere joining me right now. Good to see you, Isaac. All right. So, they're having conversations. Maybe that's not so unusual. It seems like they would have regular conversations. But, what do we know about the content of the conversation between Pelosi and Obama? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, they're both concerned. They both expressed their concerns to other people. But, they've talked about their concerns about Biden's electability with each other and what to do about it. This is part of an effort among a lot of leading Democrats to figure out, how do you get to whatever next is? As Lauren was saying just a moment ago, there is an expectation that there will be more Democrats who will be coming out and saying that they think Biden should leave the race. But, there are also still Democrats who are saying that they think Biden should stay in the race. The one thing that I agree on is that they would love to move past this conversation, whether it's going to be Joe Biden or it will be another person who steps in, likely in that case, it's Kamala Harris. The feeling is that they need some sort of push to get past this. And they look to Barack Obama, given his long and complicated relationship with Joe Biden, and Nancy Pelosi, given her own long personal and political relationship with Joe Biden over many years, to be the ones who at this point maybe have the ability to either steer Joe Biden out of the race or to say to other people, OK, we're sticking with Biden.

And that's no surprise, because they know that -- these leaders know that they might have to deal with a completely different President, Donald Trump perhaps, come early next year. So, it's not something they would do anyway. And they do worry about having a Republican President because they know that that could be more isolationist, not so good for NATO, or all of those issues that we've been talking about. Who had the most sort of one-on-one time with President Biden this time? That was the new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He was in for a 45-minute meeting. It ran a little long, almost an hour, according to Starmer.And what Starmer said, when he was asked by a British journalist about the competency and capability of President Biden, he said, look, this was a guy who was on top of all the details that we went through on foreign -- all the foreign policy details. And Keir Starmer said, we went through them at speed. I mean, this was, like he said, this was a short space of time that we had in relative terms. And he wanted, Keir Starmer wanted to make the most of it. So, they got through a lot, and his readout was Biden has got it, and that's what we heard from President Macron too, the French leader, of course, he came out with the same evaluation. Biden was on top of it. This was a complex NATO summit, getting everyone through it, getting all the things delivered, they wanted to deliver out of it. That as managed in person with the leaders by President Biden, and that they're giving them a tick in the box, as they say, behind closed doors. Of course, there are concerns, but we don't expect to hear them publicly from them.",

So, they will be continuing there. And look, two sources told my colleague Alex Marquardt that there is some progress being made. But, there are still some tough issues to resolve. What those issues are, specifically, is not clear.The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is blaming Hamas for putting demands on the table that contradict the plan that is already being discussed. Netanyahu himself, though, of course, has been accused of moving the goalposts, because over the weekend, you'll remember that Hamas said that it was willing to forego one of its main demands, and that is that any ceasefire that's agreed to would be a permanent one. They said that they'll forego that provided that a permanent ceasefire is at least discussed in the first phase of the ceasefire and hostage exchange process. But then, the Prime Minister came out and made quite clear that he would not agree to anything that did not allow Israel to continue on afterwards. The President was asked about this yesterday. He gave that clip that you played there, saying that they have a chance, not really giving much indication as to how close they are. And I should also just point out quickly, Fredricka, that he said specifically, the President said specifically that Hamas is losing popularity inside the West Bank. But, it is worth noting that the most recent polling data that we have shows that their popularity is actually increasing in the West Bank since the October 7 terror attack. In fact, half of the people inside the West Bank said that, were elections to be held there today, they would vote for Hamas that's twice the number that there was before the war. Fredricka.",

I think that the bar for this President has become so high that for many Democratic lawmakers, he will never be able to clear that bar. But, here I think is the most important thing to take into consideration, and I think what Senator Coons was getting at, and frankly, what President Biden was getting at as well. There are millions and millions of grassroots voters out there, Fred, who are absolutely supporting this President, no matter what, as long as he is in the race. And the President has made it very clear that he is in this race. He is not going anywhere. And as long as that is the case, these millions of grassroots voters, includes black voters, Latino voters, women voters, women who are so concerned about the future of their reproductive rights, immigrant voters who are so concerned that under another Trump presidency, their families will be ripped apart, black voters who know that another four years of President Trump will be absolutely catastrophic for their communities, they are absolutely 100 percent behind President Biden, and they do not appreciate lawmakers who are so ready to discount the 14 million votes that voted for him, the voters who voted for him, because they're calling him to step aside. So, that is what the party is facing. And what President Biden said last night is very true. It's the voters that count. And right now, they are, for the most, part behind him.

Acclaimed attorney Gloria Allred has been in court throughout the trial. I talked to her yesterday. And she said that, according to the family, this case goes far beyond one incident. It actually has global implications for the movie industry. She said people who work on film sets shouldn't fear for their life. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Police say a man suspected of killing three women in the town of Bushey in the east of England has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Kyle Clifford was found by British police Wednesday after an overnight manhunt. The victims were the wife and two adult daughters of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt. Police responded to the Hunt home Tuesday night and found the women with serious injuries. They say all three died a short time later at the scene. Let's go now live to London, and CNN's Nada Bashir. Did we learn anything more about the circumstances, how all of this happened, the motivation and if the suspect knew these women?",

We'd heard from British police yesterday, saying the suspect was in a London hospital in a serious condition, and because of that, they hadn't been able to carry out that full questioning process. Now, of course, new developments, police confirming that a man has been arrested in connection with this triple murder. And of course, this is an ongoing investigation. But, there have been many questions around the possible motives and the relationship between the suspect and the three victims, Carol, Louise and Hannah Hunt, who were all, as you mentioned, found badly wounded at the scene by emergency services, and of course later died as a result of their injuries.Now, we know, of course, that a crossbow is believed to have been involved and used in this incident. Police have suggested that perhaps other weapons may have also been used. We know, of course, that also tributes have been pouring in for the three victims. And there have been a lot of questions around the possible relationship between the suspect and the three victims. Police have previously said that they believe the suspect was known to the family. And British media outlets have been reporting that there may have been a past romantic relationship between the youngest of the victims, 25-year-old Louise Hunt, and the suspect. In fact, Louise had posted recently on social media, sharing a post which praised women who leave toxic relationships, women who are brave enough to leave toxic relationships, and questions around the possible romantic relationship between the two in the past. But, certainly, a lot of concern about the safety of women in this country, as we continue to see violence against women rising. But, as I mentioned, tributes have been pouring in from across the country. John Hunt, of course, was a BBC sports commentator, a well-known sporting commentator. The BBC itself has expressed its condolences. We've been hearing from numerous sporting figures across the country sharing their condolences, and of course, the British Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, who expressed her shock just yesterday around the deaths of these three women.",

These migrants in Bogota are doing just that, working with a foundation that provides free classes and counseling to vulnerable Venezuelans and Colombians alike.
