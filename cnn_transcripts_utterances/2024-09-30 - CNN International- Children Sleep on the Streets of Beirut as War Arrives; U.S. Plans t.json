Israeli strikes hitwithin Beirut city limits for the first time since this current campaign began. The bombardment of the Lebanese capital continuing in the wake of Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah's assassination. it's 04:00 p.m. there. It's also 04:00 p.m. here in Tel Aviv, in Israel. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching \"Connect the World\". Also coming up over the next two hours on this show, the U.S. prepares to send military reinforcements to this region, as regional players await a possible Iranian response. States across the U.S. dealing with the impact of Hurricane Helene President Biden expected to speak next hour. Well, we start with chaotic scenes just hours ago on the streets of Beirut. Israel striking within the Lebanese capital city limits on Monday morning for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war broke out nearly a year ago. It comes as Israel says it's also striking Hezbollah strongholds in eastern and southern Lebanon. Meantime, Lebanon's Health Ministry says attacks on Sunday alone killed more than 100 people and wounded more than 350 others. All this as Israel signals again to a potential ground invasion and Hezbollah vows to fight on. Well, CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has been in Beirut in the past few days, witnessing firsthand as attacks in the city have increased, both in number and in intensity. And she joins me now, Jomana, what further detail do you have on today's strikes and the wider impact on the Lebanese population since this current campaign began.",

As we saw, that's where it killed the Leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, and other top commanders. It says it's also going after their weapons storage facilities. But again, Becky, as with every war, it is the civilians in places like the southern suburbs of Beirut, one of the most densely populated, or was one of the most densely populated parts of the country, who are the ones who bear the brunt of war. And when the Israeli military began those intense strikes on Friday night, we went out to the streets, and we saw that mass exodus of the residents of the southern suburbs. People were out on the streets, women carrying their little children, people carrying whatever they could grab as they tried to run and search for safety. And we went back out on the streets of Beirut, Becky, days later, and what we saw is that so many people are still out on the streets with nowhere to go. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over): War has arrived to Beirut, and this is what it's done to so many of its children, exhausted and homeless. They now sleep on the streets and parks like this one, most here fled the densely populated southern suburbs where Israel's rained down bombs on Hezbollah targets. But like every war, it is the innocent who paid the heaviest price. Abeer's home was hit in one of the strikes. She grabbed her little girl and ran and they've been out here since.",

It is, of course, concerning to U.S. officials, but they still don't know whether they are going to conduct such an attack, or when, or what it would even look like, but just in case, they are preparing for all possible contingencies. That is why the Pentagon has further reinforced its positions in the Middle East, particularly when it comes to air capabilities. Now, in a statement last night, the Pentagon said that they are going to be bolstering their air support capabilities in the region. Essentially, what that means is that they're going to be sending additional fighter aircraft to the Middle East. There are already squadrons of F-15s, F-16s, F-22s, 18s.

The United States will continue to work with our partners in the region and around the world, to advance a diplomatic resolution that provides real security to Israel, to Lebanon, and allows citizens on both sides of the border to return to their homes.

The United States remains committed to urgently driving these efforts forward. Now, turning to the subject of this ministerial, 10 years ago, the United States mobilized a global coalition to confront ISIS, or Daesh, a nihilistic terror group that, over the course of a few months, had occupied territory comprising a third of both Iraq and Syria, which it used to conduct a horrific campaign of violence and brutality.

We say that because of the completely disproportionate impact this has had on child casualties versus all the other wars where UNICEF is on the front lines. So, 30 or 40 children killed every single day. Now you've got the vast majority of 2 million people crammed into around 10 percent of the Gaza Strip. So, all the things we warned about, all the things the bombardments from the sky, the denials, the restrictions, the delays are put upon aid means we've got disease on the ground and the hospitals, as you rightly show, I still walk in hospitals. I've been to that hospital of those four girls were killed. I'm still walking across hospital floors with children with amputations in a place where there is no chance for prosthetics. I sat with a little boy, Becky, who is six years old and had fourth degree burns. I didn't know there was such a thing as fourth degree burns and he has no skin, left skin graft.

It does seem, though, that this could, this message is not heard by that leadership. I mean, we've seen, when you see a major hostage release that happened during a humanitarian pause in November. We haven't got close to that since then. So, if we want those things for civilians, aid to flow, children to stop being bombed in their beds.
