So she met with black elected faith and community leaders last night at a restaurant in Raleigh. She told them that the nation could see its first HBCU graduate as president in her. She, of course, is a graduate of Howard University. She also packed up supplies during that stop as, of course, some parts of the state is still reeling from the impact of the hurricane. Today, she will speak at a church, give remarks, as well as meet with Black farmers here in the state of North Carolina. And that's just the beginning, Manu. This week, she has a very aggressive campaign schedule after North Carolina, she'll head to Erie, Pennsylvania, then Detroit with another targeted event aimed at reaching black voters, where she'll be in conversation with Charlamagne Tha God. She's in Philadelphia on Wednesday, then she goes to Wisconsin, Michigan, and then she ends its the week in Michigan, and Atlanta.

And so, you know, I think that's why we've been seeing her do a lot more interviews, getting out there, trying to shake it up a bit, but there are a lot of Democrats would like to go to see more -- to see more of that from her, you know, and definitely sort of putting people at ease rather than being this candidate that mainly is appearing in front of people at rallies.",

That came out this morning from \"The Times\"/Sienna poll. She is 54, 36.Yeah, that sounds like a significant amount. She's winning by a lot, but Biden won 65 percent of Latino voters in 2020.

At this particular hour, if you believe the polling, Donald Trump is going to put up the best performance with Black voters since Richard Nixon back in 1960, not '68 since 1960. That's 64 years ago, among Hispanic voters, Donald Trump is going to put up the best performance for Republicans since 2004 and George W. Bush, the question ultimately is, is that enough to offset the strength that Kamala Harris has with white voters with a college degree? At this particular moment, she has the strongest margin with them than any Democrat going back since recorded history with polling, I guess since 1948, 1952, whenever you want put it. But I think that's the interesting thing about this campaign.

So how are House Republicans addressing what both sides agree is our biggest vulnerability?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOE KENT (R-WA): I 100 percent support Roe versus Wade being overturned. I would move to have a national ban on abortions.

This is the Pennsylvania margin by party registration in that poll. What you see here is that Kamala Harris -- I'm going to come over to your side of the screen, Manu -- is doing better among Democrats, a 77-point lead, than Donald Trump is among Republicans, a 74-point advantage. She's also doing better with those who are not registered with a party or with another party. But this nugget is key because even though Republicans have closed that registration gap, they haven't closed it completely.

But let's -- we're looking at the battleground states. Let's take this out nationally, all right? This is party registration, but let's look at party identification. Party registration, of course, you're actually registered with a party. Party ID when you say, I feel like a Democrat today, I feel like a Republican today. They're correlated, but they're not exactly the same. But I think it gets at the trend that's going on here, Manu. All right, so party ID nationally, you go to October, November of 2016, Democrats had a three-point advantage. You go four years ago Democrats had a six-point avenge.
