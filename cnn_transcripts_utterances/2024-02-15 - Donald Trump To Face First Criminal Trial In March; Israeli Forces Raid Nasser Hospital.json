      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Isa Soares. Tonight, Donald Trump willface his first criminal trial in March. That decision coming from a New York court today. And another case happening right now here in Atlanta, Georgia. We'll break it down for you. Also, ahead, the IDF carries out a raid at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis after laying siege to the facility for days. Plus, a key NATO defense meeting happening in Brussels to discuss what's coming next for Ukraine's war effort. We'll have an interview with Canada's Defense Minister later in the program. Well, right now, we're tracking developments in two major legal cases linked to former President Donald Trump. In New York, a judge has rejected Trump's bid to delay his hush money criminal trial, ruling that the jury  selection will begin March 25th as originally planned. Prosecutors allege that Trump was involved in a scheme to cover up payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The former president spoke outside the courtroom, calling the accusations politically-motivated. And here in Atlanta, Georgia, attorneys representing the former U.S. president and his co-defendants in the 2020  election interference case are trying to have the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis disqualified. They claimed that she financially benefited from an improper relationship with Nathan Wade, who is the special prosecutor she hired to lead the case. Wade was grilled on the stand today. Well, trial attorney Misty Marris joins us now for more on these cases. Good to have you with us, Misty. MISTY MARRIS, TRIAL ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL ANALYST:  Thank you for having me.",

      "sentences": "So, I want to start with the New York case because Donald Trump did turn up to that case, he was hoping to have that dismissed, butinstead, the Manhattan District attorney set the date, March 25th, next month. Take us through the merits of that case, because Donald Trump says even if he's guilty, it doesn't matter.",

      "sentences": "Right, absolutely. So, this case will be the first to go to trial with a really expedited schedule of March 25th. As you said, vehementlyargued by his attorney that, that should be pushed back for the purpose of preparing. It's scheduled to be a six-week trial. So, the basis of this case is that he made a payment to Stormy Daniels, relating to an alleged romantic relationship, and that payment, the prosecutors say was a violation of campaign finance fraud, because the payment itself is fine. A nondisclosure agreement, that is legal. However, they say it was for the benefit of his campaign that he was trying to silence her, and therefore, it related to his campaign. And that he tried to cover that up by paying his attorney at the time, Michael Cohen, these surreptitious payments that were really under the table. Now, Trump says everything was on the up and up. This was all about just paying legal fees. And there was no violation. This was simply a run of the mill, NDA, that is illegal document, an illegal contract entered into. So, those are the two competing viewpoints. The way that it's being used in this particular case interestingly enough is a novel case of first impression. So, these types of charges falsifying business records, which is the charge -- charges that Donald Trump is facing, can either be charged as a misdemeanor in New York or a felony. These are felony charges, so, this is going to be a trail-blazing type-case about whether or not this particular factual scenario can be charged as a felony in New York. So, it's a novel legal question.",

So, basically, there's a couple of questions relating to Nathan Wade that the defense, the attorneysfor Trump and his co-defendants want to dig into. One, it is truthfulness. That's why you hear him, the attorney going after prior foreign statements. The other is the timeline of this relationship with Fani Willis, as well as how it came to be that he was retained as a special prosecutor. Those are critical areas for this case. And they're using a lot of information from his divorce proceeding, from his wife in order to establish both of those factors. Because the ultimate question is, did Fani Willis benefit from the money and from retaining her boyfriend to prosecute this case? That's the overall picture. This is so important because it relates to the testimony of someone named Terrence Bradley(ph). Terrence Bradley(ph) is a former law partner of Nathan Wade. He also represented Nathan Wade in his divorce proceeding. Terrence(ph) was thought to be a star witness for the Trump team and for the defendants who took the stand on Monday, this is Terrence Bradley(ph), and I said, I cannot provide any testimony. I contacted the State Bar Association, it's all protected by attorney- client privilege, so I can't testify. That was a big problem for the defendants in this case, with Trump and that team. Now, you can hear this line of questioning. This is chipping away at that privilege, and Nathan Wade on the stand right now had said, not every conversation that he had with Mr. Bradley(ph) was privileged. So, this speaks to two things. Terrence Bradley(ph) can speak to his relationship and the timeline with Fani Willis as well as the circumstances under which Nathan Wade was retained for that position as special prosecutors. So, he is thought to be a star witness, and based on this testimony that we just heard, it's likely that he will be called to the stand again to testify with whatever outside of those parameters of the privilege exists. This is really critical to the case. This is a big moment in this hearing.",

Then,his qualifications don't match that, which would be thought of as being the correct qualifications for a person in this position in one of the most high-profile cases in the country. The argument is that Fani Willis selected him not based on his qualifications, but because of their personal relationship. So, all of that is going to be really important, and a lot of that really is going to relate to his testimony, but not only that, her testimony as well, to the extent it is established that there was a benefit derived from his appointment as a -- as the special prosecutor in this case to Fani Willis. It is likely if that can be established, it is likely that she will be disqualified from moving forward and handling. He will definitely be disqualified. She will also be disqualified from handling this case, and that would also be this particular prosecutor's office. So, the next step would be for another prosecutor's office in Georgia to take this case up. So, it's really high stakes. It depends on what comes out in the record, and already with the testimony we've heard so far during the hearing, the timeline that Fani Willis and Nathan Wade had originally presented relating to their relationship, a lot of inconsistencies from other witnesses who have testified. So, the judge ultimately decides that's an important piece of this.

The other thing is that even if Fani Willis isn't disqualified from this case, what we've seen today in terms of testimony, contains enough allegations and innuendo that somebody who is as unscrupulous about sticking to the facts as Donald Trump is, has plenty of information here to say that, the entire prosecution, the prosecutor's office, is deeply corrupt. It would play into his narrative, the central narrative of his 2024 campaign that he's been politically persecuted, and that's one that many of Trump's supporters believe.

Israel's forces also say they have apprehended a number of suspects at the hospital, and have opened a secure route for civilians to evacuate the area.

Among them, they say, this teenager, his lifeless body seen here just in front of the gates of the Nasser Hospital. A short distance away, a Palestinian detainee appears, set up and released by the Israeli military and used as a messenger according to medical staff who spoke to a journalist working for CNN on the ground to tell civilians here that they must leave immediately. But soon after, doctors say he too was killed under Israeli fire outside the hospital. It is unclear from the video what  happened.

Good to have you with us.Well, a wave of deadly strikes hit the Russian city of Belgorod Thursday, killing at least five people and injuring more than a dozen others, including children. It follows a night of Russian strikes into Ukraine, which injured at least seven people and damaged residential buildings. The exchange of attacks comes as NATO defense ministers gathered on Thursday to discuss what comes next for Ukraine's war effort. The meeting in Brussels follows days of speculation over the alliances' own future. NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been trying to tamp down any doubt. He announced that a record 18 NATO nations are on track to meet the organization's two percent defense spending target this year. Mr. Stoltenberg also took the opportunity to allay fears over America's commitment to NATO. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
