And that is really one of the key challenges at -- for the administration at this moment.There are major questions over how much influence the U.S. will have over Israel's ultimate decision about, how to respond to Iran. You'll remember back in April when Iran had launched that barrage of missiles and drones against Israel that was thwarted with the help of the U.S. Now President Biden at the time had told Netanyahu to take a win. Israel really had a much more limited response in that moment. We will see whether that is the same kind of approach that the administration will take this time around as one of their key focuses is really trying to prevent this from escalating even further.",

I'm curious, Christiane, as to your read, given the fact that Iran did not give any warning here and given where the U.S. is in its political cycle, how much influence does President Biden have over Israel's response and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who of course, has been sort of riding a wave after the killing of Nasrallah?",

But when you also talked about taking out the head of the regime and that there is a push and you hear that from the former Prime Minister Bennett and others, right, sort of a, more of a unity within some in the Israeli government than we have seen in recent months.And when you start hearing things like taking out Iranian leadership and regime change, that is a totally different thing.

It's highly unlikely at this point that Israel or the United States would send in any ground troops. It would be, you know, strategic elements, sea based, air based, et cetera. So that -- that is here. But you know what, Erin, this is not the first time.This has been something that certainly the Israeli government since at least the last 25 years, since the American invasion of Iraq, for instance, they were very keen to have the United States agree to regime change next in Iran. At that time, President George W. Bush basically stood back and said no. So -- so this is something that's really been on the table for -- for a long time. It's something that Benjamin Netanyahu has floated many, many times to the United States, to the world, to the United Nations. It is not -- nothing to hit a nation's oil refineries, for instance. It could cause huge consequences. And again, whether or not they could properly disable a nuclear situation remains to be seen. But this is definitely something this Israeli government has wanted to do. And by the way, they probably find quite a lot of allies in the Arab states around which also wants to defang Iran, if you like. But again, the question is to what end? What is the end goal?

FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER AND COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGISTIn fact, if they could, they would have reversed the tickets and put Vance and Walz on top and the other two on the bottom. Number two is it gave them faith in democracy, the idea that people could sit down, disagree, and do so civilly. But in terms of Vance, they were shocked that the Vance that they've seen up to this point was not the J.D. Vance of last night, measured, thoughtful, emotional, willing to agree with his opponents, not divisive. The language that they used to describe him tells me that he has been misused on the campaign so far, that he would be far better communicating Donald Trump's agenda and vision and purpose then the attack dog kind of strategy that they've been using up to now.
