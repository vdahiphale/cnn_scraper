The IDF says it has destroyed 130 Hamas tunnels so far, including one near a school. And after a bruising election night, some American Republicans want to change how their party handles issues like abortion. Coming to you live from New York, it is Wednesday, November 8th. I am Zain Asher, in for my colleague Richard Quest, and this is Quest Means Business. All right, good evening. Tonight, thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Israel's offensive in northern Gaza, traveling south on the road designated by Israel as a safe corridor. One man said nothing, nothing was left of his home. Another teenager girl called it the Nakba, or catastrophe, of 2023. Israel is saying that the evacuations are necessary as it fights in the heart of Gaza City. The military is saying that it's targeting Hamas infrastructure and commanders and has destroyed 130 tunnel -- Hamas tunnel shafts. In southern Gaza, humanitarian groups warn of supplies dwindling. The US says the Rafah Crossing was closed Wednesday because of what it called a \"security circumstance.\" Nic Robertson is in Sderot right now. He joins us live now. So, Nic, just in terms of what we know, we know that the Israelis are pretty much inside Gaza City right now. They're staying at -- they're tightening their stranglehold on Hamas. What more do we know about the fighting taking place there right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes. It seems to a degree that Hamas is staying in the tunnels and not engaging in firefights.The IDF thinks that Hamas wants to draw them in, because Hamas will have booby trapped the tunnels, will find a fighting environment more advantageous to Hamas and less advantageous to the IDF, because the IDF has way more sophisticated weaponry. So in a way, the fight on the ground is not as face-to-face intense as perhaps the IDF feared it could be, and that perhaps, you know, gives us to understand why the casualty toll for IDF troops, the death toll among IDF soldiers, is relatively low. That said, it's -- I believe it stands at about 56 right now. It's not at all in significant. But what the IDF says it's doing on the ground is using intelligence to know which houses to go into and search. They're not quite going house-to- house, almost. And they say they've discovered 4,000 weapons systems so far, some of them in mosques and some of them in schools. But it does feel at the moment as if the fight is not at a stalemate, but does feel where the mounting US pressure on Israel to have a humanitarian pause is perhaps beginning to threaten whether or not the IDF can actually do what the prime minister wants them to do, which is to destroy Hamas completely. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over): As crushing as Israel as air strikes targeting Hamas are militarily, they've also become politically counterproductive. A crippling consequence, civilians, thousands of them, have been killed. Israel under US pressure for humanitarian pause.

Underground, they have hundreds of kilometers of tunnels connected to hospitals and schools. We continue to dismantle this capability. ABDELAZIZ (voice over): But the UN calls this exodus \"forceable displacement\" and accuses Israel of the collective punishment of some two million people. And these routes are dangerous and deadly.

He's losing to Trump, assuming he is the Republican nominee in all the swing states, but one that will decide the election. So Biden wasn't on the ballot either yesterday. So while Democrats are taking the results that they got and seeking to create some momentum for the president, you know, voters didn't have the choice before them. What they will do next year is they will evaluate President Joe Biden on his own record. Many of them -- a majority of them, according to a new CNN poll, don't believe he's up to the job. He has the capacity at the age of 81, as he will be in a few weeks' time, to serve a second term as president. And they're going to have to evaluate that against what they see with Donald Trump, who has not really been onstage for the last three years. People haven't seen the volatility, and the anger, and the extremism that he brings to the table. So the White House is basically arguing that once that comparison is clear, voters will again choose President Joe Biden, but he is very unpopular. And as you know, all of these swing states, last time, were decided by tens of thousands of votes.

But there wasn't particularly great news for Donald Trump. He's not very popular, either. And he has a lot of vulnerabilities. And the Republican Party has a lot of vulnerabilities, which were exposed yesterday. And I think despite the brave faces that you saw in the video, of senators explaining yesterday's results, i do think we've seen a several-year trend here of the issue of abortion in general, extremism on the Republican side being a weight on their candidates. And I don't think that's going to stop next year. But Biden has to throw his race into the context of that contrast. And that is something that they haven't done aggressively yet.

So they're judging the economy through what they see on the cash register, what they see at the gas station, what they pay for rent, what they pay for mortgage interests. And that is a less cheerful picture. But he has engaged in battles that have political currency over issues like the cost of pharmaceutical drugs and so on. And these are issues on which Donald Trump and the Republicans have been on the other side. On fundamental issues of democracy, obviously, Donald Trump has been on the other side. You know, every time the president -- every week, there's fodder for the president and his surrogates to kind of cast this contrast. Just in the last week, there was a story about president Trump's elaborate plans for retribution for his political enemies if he gets elected. That is fodder because I don't think most Americans want to elect a president whose fundamental role or mission is retribution. But they're not going to know that unless they're told that and the contrast is struck. So I think they have -- that is the assignment that the Biden campaign has now. Referendum, he could lose.

But what you'll see tonight are the two candidates that seem to be competing for that role, Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, and Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida.

It's coincided with, as you pointed out, worsening U.S.-China relations. This is all part of panda diplomacy. You mentioned it. That started in 1972 with President Nixon's historic visit to China. Giant pandas have become these beloved global ambassadors for China. Initially, they were gifted to countries; now, they're loaned. And they are not cheap. They cost zoos anywhere from $0.5 million to $1 million a year for a pair. China acknowledges these cuddly creatures are used for, in China's words, major political and diplomatic needs. So if you look at where these pandas are going -- and this is really interesting, because we were able to track this and look at the countries that are essentially getting these pandas. It gives you a sense of this new world order that China is hoping to craft. So they're going to some countries in the E.U., like Denmark, Finland and Germany and the Middle East, Qatar and China's northern neighbor. Not at all that surprising. Talk about Russia, getting pandas in recent years as well. It's worth noting, these are regions where China is looking to bolster its relations, increase its influence. Folks would say, perhaps when President Biden meets with president Xi, which is expected to happen here in California next week, maybe he will bring this up. There's a lot of other issues, of course, Zain, that we know are going on between the U.S. and China. Really, with China in general in the South China Sea and surrounding Taiwan, questions over China's ties with Russia, allegations of human rights abuses, IP theft, a really long list. So why would you bring pandas up? Well, it's something that's obviously very important to the American people. It's not all that unusual for a country's leader to bring this up. In fact, this week, Zain, Australia's prime minister was in China for a state visit and talked about the country's desire to keep Australia's pandas. So it shows you just how important this is for an entire population. And I should mention the three pandas departing the National Zoo right now, that leaves only four pandas in the U.S. And the contracts for those, which happen to be at the Atlanta Zoo, expire next year. So there is no word on any extension. If they are not extended and China does not give any more pandas out to the U.S. or to any Latin American countries, that would make the only panda in all of the Americas found in one place. That's Mexico City. So certainly preparing for a surge of visitors from the north, should that be the case.",
