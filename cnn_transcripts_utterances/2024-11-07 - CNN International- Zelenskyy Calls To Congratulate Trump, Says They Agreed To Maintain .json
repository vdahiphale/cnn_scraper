We begin this hour from the Rose Garden at the White House, where any moment President Joe Biden will address the nation for the first time following Donald Trump's election victory on Tuesday. A White House official says that Biden called to congratulate Trump and invite him to the White House. That official says that Biden also called for a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together. Trump's campaign says that he very much appreciated the call, and planned to meet the President soon. And the transition to a Trump White House begins right now. A number of high-profile allies are making a push behind the scenes for a spot in the new administration. That group could potentially include billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and former Democratic member of the House, Tulsi Gabbard. Now, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who reportedly was being considered for a number of roles, says that he will remain in the Senate. That is, according to a source. And sources tell CNN that the President-elect, in private conversations, has made it clear that he wants to reward those who stood by him over the last couple of years. They also say that Trump will be ready to carry out his agenda on day one of his new term, armed with a slew of executive orders along with the momentum of a decisive and historic election victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing. Look what happened. Is this crazy? But, it's a political victory that our country has never seen before, nothing like this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think there are a lot of folks, things to consider, right? There is messaging. There is tactics. There is a Vice President who ran a campaign for 107 days. It's very hard to run a campaign to really build the trust and get folks to engage with you.And so, those conversations are happening. I've been hearing about them. They're continuing to happen.

Particularly over the last couple of years, we've been having real conversations in the party, and the party has been messaging and campaigning around abortion rights and reproductive rights. To see over 50 percent of white women still vote for Donald Trump, that's a real conversation that we have to have, especially as white women stood with black voters in particular around the Black Lives Matter movement in those particular pieces. That's important to really take a look at and why that continues to happen, especially with someone who put three Supreme Court justices on the Supreme Court that actually reversed Roe at the end of the day.The second group that we have to look at is the Latino community. Particularly, we have been standing with the Latino community, particularly when Donald Trump was attacking their community around child separation and family separation. He has been very clear that he will deport folks on day one, and that's really harmful to their community. So, we have to take a look at that. And then the third conversation that's important is there has been this conversation happening around black men. And yes, while some of the numbers may have gone down just a little bit with black men, collectively, over 86 percent of black voters still stood with Kamala Harris in this election. And black men, out of any community and constituency of other men, black, especially white or brown men, stood with the Vice President at the end of the day, even leading up to the conversations that were happening before the election. And so, I think those three particular groups, where we saw some shifting in movement, the party has to look at, how do we reconnect with folks? How do we get back in communities and really talk about issues on the kitchen table? And that's important for us to think about moving forward.",

Donald Trump improved pretty much everywhere in the country, and we saw that in New Jersey. We saw that not just in New York State, but New York City, where Kamala Harris performed the worst since any Democrat since 1992. So, it tells us that these movements are national.And one thing I would tell Democrats is voters are complicated. You can't just go to white women and say abortion. You can't just go to Hispanic voters and say immigration. They care about a multiple -- multitude of issues. And that's what they were saying very clearly to this administration and in this race. And so, part of what happened on Tuesday night shouldn't be surprising. The Vice President of an unpopular President lost in this campaign. And why? Because Joe Biden was on the wrong side, which means Kamala Harris was on the wrong side, of several issues that voters were saying very clearly, and that's what Democrats have to absorb as they're moving forward to see what did we do wrong and what can we do better in the future?",

China's Xi Jinping says that he hopes both countries can find a way to get along in the new era. In his first term, Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese imports, and he is promising to do more of the same.Japan's Prime Minister also called to congratulate Trump. Sources say that he is hoping to meet with the President-elect this month, as he travels to the G20 summit in Brazil. French President Emmanuel Macron also spoke by phone with Trump yesterday. A French official describing the conversation as warm and building on the two leaders' pre-existing relationship. And the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia sent his best wishes as well, reiterating what he called the historic relationship between his country and the United States. And one expected focus of Trump's foreign policy, the wars in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the first world leaders to congratulate Trump, calling his win \"history's greatest comeback\". In his last term, Trump made several major moves benefiting Israel, like relocating the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. More recently on the campaign trail, he has urged Israel to get the wars in Gaza over fast. CNN's Matthew Chance has more. OK. We'll bring you that story just as soon as we can. In the meantime, I actually want to turn to Ukraine, where the President there, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called to congratulate Trump, and says that they agreed to maintain close dialog and advance our cooperation. But, there is reason for deep concern in Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on continued U.S. commitments to Ukraine's fight against Russia. He also said, quote, that \"Zelenskyy should have never let that war start.\" He also vowed to encourage Russia to do, quote, \"whatever the hell it wants to any NATO member that doesn't meet defense spending guidelines.\" Today, President Zelenskyy said that it would be suicidal for Europe to offer the Kremlin concessions to halt its invasion of Ukraine. Frederik Pleitgen is following the story from Berlin. So, Fred, as we said on the surface, they're calling to congratulate, but under the surface, there has to be real concern from the Ukrainians about what this win means for them on the battlefield.",

He said that she has great character, true character. She and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran.And then he addressed the nation, saying that, this may be a time for some to celebrate. And I think he used the words go figure. Of course, half the country is celebrating. But, he also said for those who are feeling defeated, he said being defeated does not mean that you are -- a defeat does not mean that you are defeated. We have to get back up. He said setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. Let me bring back in Kevin Liptak to sort of help us sort of piece together what else we heard.

      "sentences": "Yeah. One of the interesting things was taught -- was when President Biden said that this should officially put to rest any questions about election integrity in the United States, sort of making the point that Donald Trump and his allies had been alleging falsely that the 2020 election was marred by voter fraud for the last four years. This, now that they have won, and now that they have accepted their victory, this should put an end to those questions. So, that was an interesting point from the President.He also, in that speech, tried to burnish his own legacy, talking about the accomplishments that he had achieved while in office, and saying that they potentially might not be seen until 10 years from now, that they are just going into effect, and that items like the infrastructure bill won't necessarily be felt by Americans until they're implemented, and that could potentially take up until a decade. And you can almost hear Democrats kind of gritting their teeth when the President said that, because, of course, if the President was to hope to be re-elected, Americans needed to feel good about what he was doing now, trying to build an agenda that isn't necessarily going to be felt by Americans. It might be good policy, but it isn't necessarily good politics, particularly when a lot of Democrats don't think that President Biden made a good enough case for himself and a good enough case for what he was doing, particularly on the economy. And that's part of why Americans felt so sour, and that's part of why Kamala Harris may have left -- or may have lost. And I think in those Democrats' minds, President Biden's legacy is now wholly tied up in the fact that Donald Trump will be returning to office. When you think about the entire sort of objective of President Biden's political project, it was to ensure that Trump won, was defeated in 2020, but also that his ideas and that he himself weren't able to return to power in America, and of course, that has failed. And so, certainly, President Biden wants to talk about his policy agenda and all of the items that he was able to do, but he certainly left out a lot of what I think Democrats are trying to grapple with today.",

And again, it is a repudiation of the Democratic Party that we're talking about, and that is reflected in this press conference. Had Biden perhaps chosen to step down, allow a full contest for his successor, we could have been maybe talking about a different press conference that the President was giving today.So, for a lot of Democrats, I think there is anger towards the President as much as there is anger towards Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign for losing to Trump, and there is just a feeling of a massive change that is going to come to Washington, the first time you could argue Trump was elected by accident. This time, the American people knew exactly who he was. They'd seen him in action, and they've elected him with a much wider margin. So, this is a turning point in American politics.",

The way it constrains the president, ultimately, is impeachment. Trump has been impeached twice. Republicans chose not to convict him in a Senate trial. So, even if the Democrats did win control of the House and decided to impeach Trump for a third time, you know that it's not going to be very effective, because it's not going to eject him from office. So, Trump has that assurance.He is also armed with a new Supreme Court ruling that emerged out of his federal election meddling case, and the Supreme Court said that there is wide immunity for actions, official actions that the President conducts while he is in office. That gives Trump a shield that all of the things that he is going to do, even if they perhaps would seem to transgress the law, that he is not going to pay a price for down the road when he is eventually out of office. So, that's two big things. He has a Republican Senate. He may have a Republican House. He has got a very conservative Supreme Court. He has defied all of the attempts to bring him to justice, to account for his attempt to overturn the election in 2020. The law and politics and government institutions have been unable to prevent Trump returning to office, and I think they're going to be unable to constrain him if he is as willing to push against those restraints, as he was in his first term.",

It would be the U.S. Central Bank's second cut this year. The President-elect has pledged to send the U.S. economy in a new direction. During Trump's campaign, he repeatedly promised to attack inflation. He also promised to implement mass tariffs on imported goods and tax cuts. But, some economists say that some of those promises could actually make inflation worse.For more on this, let's bring in CNN Business Anchor Julia Chatterley. So, Julia, we know the expectation is a quarter of one percentage rate cut. Obviously, the elephant in the room is the election. I imagine Powell won't say much.

What he doesn't want to talk about, exactly to your point, Rahel, is Donald Trump. Good luck with that.The challenge that he is going to face now is all the questions are going to be asking, what his response is to potential tax cuts, to mass tariffs, to limits on immigration as well, and he is going to have to be careful. He can't act, and the Federal Reserve can't act preemptively. They have to react to what they actually see and what the government's policies start to look like. So, we're in this sort of gray period. What is clear is that I think there is a consensus that if we do see mass immigration limits, if we do see the blanket tariffs around the world on imported goods, it will likely slow growth, it will likely raise prices, and that could slow the Federal Reserve down, but it's just too tough to judge. He has got his work cut out today, Rahel. The good news, though, for borrowers, we are expected to see them cut by a quarter of a percentage point. The future, less clear today than it was.",

I mean, he says a lot of things. He doesn't always do them. So, if I were Jay Powell, I certainly wouldn't be looking at what Donald Trump has said he may or may not do.One thing, though, that I think we will see, and this is new and interesting, I think we're going to see Trump using the U.S. consumer market as a bargaining tool. I think that in some ways that's what the tariff threat is all about. It's about saying, we have the richest, deepest consumer market in the world, and we're no longer giving it away for free. And that's interesting, because that's something that folks on both the right and the left have been arguing should be the case. How that affects the market? What that means for the real economy? We shall see. But, I think from a foreign policy standpoint, it's going to mean a lot more complex economic negotiations with both adversaries and allies. SOLOMON: Yeah. That was sort of my next question, Rana, sort of play that out for me a bit further. And so, using the American consumer -- the American voters as a bargaining chip to sort of swing in any deals they may be having in terms of geopolitics, with Mexico, with Canada, with China --",

So, let's say that you're talking about the auto market in Germany, for example, German auto tariffs on U.S. goods are higher than U.S. tariffs on German goods. I would expect that to become a conversation, a much harder conversation in the future.
