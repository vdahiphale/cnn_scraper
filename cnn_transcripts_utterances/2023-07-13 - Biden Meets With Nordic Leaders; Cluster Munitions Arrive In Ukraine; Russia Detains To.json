This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Happening now, a pivotal summit in Finland with Nordic leaders as President Biden wraps up a high stakes trip. He is ending with a stronger NATO and long-term promises to Ukraine in its war effort. Next hour, Biden expected to speak and take questions from reporters. But first, more critical talks are taking place fresh off yesterday's historic NATO gathering. This Nordic summit is the first one since Finland joined the NATO alliance. The nation shares an 800 mile border with Russia. Biden, moments ago, meeting one-on-one with his Finish counterpart. CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, is leading our coverage off this morning. What is the big global message that President Biden is hoping to achieve once he returns?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think part of it here, obviously, is that unity of NATO, despite President Putin's best efforts at trying to crack NATO's unity, it's Russia that's cracking. The recent mutiny by the -- Prigozhin, the Wagner private military contractor boss, the mercenary boss. And then, just yesterday, another senior Russian general has been removed from post in Ukraine after complaining about the way the war is being fought. So, cracks on the Russian side, unity on NATO's side. But I think there's another message that comes across. And rememberingthat right now Secretary Blinken, in Asia, meeting with Chinese counterpart, heavy diplomatic press, Janet Yellen there just a few days ago in Beijing, Secretary Blinken in Beijing a month ago, a heavy diplomatic press, to try to reset and improve relations with China. And also send a strong signal to China that it should desist supporting Russia in any way in the war in Ukraine, economically principally. What has happened at the NATO summit really kind of reinforces that image, if anyone didn't understand it, that the United States is not at the forefront of trying to push weapons into Ukraine's hands. In fact, the United States and President Biden come out of the NATO summit looking like the country that, in fact, sort of wants things to go a little slower. President Biden and President Zelenskyy having that meeting yesterday, reassuring Zelenskyy not to be frustrated that he doesn't have a path to get into NATO. And it's the United States as well that's sort of being slow on the F-16s, was slow on the Abrams tanks. So, there's a message there in all of that to China, that the United States is not trying to start another war, which is Russia's message about what the United States is trying to do. So, diplomatically, he scores big because there's the unity of NATO, and that sends a very strong message to Putin, whose own leadership is cracking under the strains. But it also sends a message to China that this is a United States not looking for war, but actually hoping to end it.",

We heard from former President Dmitry Medvedev, who's now a senior national security official, who said that Russia would have to empty its arsenal of what he call these inhumane weapons.Kate, I did ask the general why he believes that this counter offensive is going so slowly, why they haven't made more progress. He says, they are making progress, but at the same time Russia has had months to build up their defensives and the Russian -- Ukrainian forces, despite having all kinds of new western training and equipment, are coming under very fierce attacks from Russian troops.

Reportedly 15 senior officials, senior military officials in Russia, in the wake of that incredibly insurrection by Wagner, were detained for questioning. That's according to \"The Wall Street Journal\" that said some 13 had - or rather 15 had been suspended from duty or been fired, 13 originally brought in for questioning.A source who is familiar with this told \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and I want to quote it, that this is about cleaning their ranks of those who are believed can't be trusted anymore. So, clearly there is deep suspicion in the wake of this mutiny. One of the biggest names on that list is General Sergei Surovikin. He had, at one point, led the campaign in Ukraine. He was then demoted and was, or maybe still is, we don't know, still leading the aerospace forces. We at CNN have reported earlier, according to a member of parliament, that Surovikin is resting and not available. That, of course, could be a euphemism for still under arrest and still being questioned. Surovikin did have close ties to Yevgeny Prigozhin. They were quite tight. He may have been seen as a sympathizer to Wagner. Of course, Kate, there's still major questions about Prigozhin himself. We originally thought he was going to Belarus. We've reported that he was back in Russia and, in fact, met with Vladimir Putin himself just five days after the June 24th insurrection. Now, what his fate is we still don't know. Secretary of State Tony Blinken saying two days ago that the last chapter of Putin and Prigozhin has not yet been written. Kate.",

Obviously, there are two competitors now, China and Russia. Technology has changed all of this. Our dependence with China has made this unlike the U.S. versus the Soviet Union.But there are moments where there are significant similarities. And you heard some of them here this week, certainly in Vilnius when the president gave that speech, but also just in the extraordinary tone of the communique and the participants in the NATO meeting who were all clearly getting their heads around the fact that we are in for another long twilight struggle here, to use the phrase that Kennedy used about the Cold War, which is to say, whatever this is, it's going to go on for a long time and we have to readjust our thinking accordingly.",

Because it was on July 2nd that this small bag of white powdery substance, as it was initially described, was found inside the West Wing. At the time it actually prompted a brief evacuation of the White House while hazmat teams came in to check this out and confirm that it was a nonhazardous substance. It tested positive from a field test for cocaine and then eventually, a couple days later, on July 5th we learned that it had tested positive in the lab for cocaine, confirming that positive test. DNA and fingerprint analysis has been ongoing. We have yet to hear from the Secret Service on the result of that. And we were told that this week investigators were going to conclude that investigation regardless of whether or not they find a suspect. And that is ultimately what we may learn today out of this briefing and what lawmakers may learn is, a, has this investigation indeed been concluded, and whether or not a suspect has been identified. On that second point, you know, I've been cautioned by law enforcement officials that they may not find a suspect here just given the number of people who go in and out of this West Wing entrance, especially on the weekends when there are tour groups coming in and out of this West Wing entrance on the ground floor of the West Wing. And also the fact that this was a very small baggy, that it may be difficult to pull prints or any DNA samples from. And, again, it was found in a cubby where visitors are asked to leave their phones. So, that's also posing an additional challenge here. Kate.",
