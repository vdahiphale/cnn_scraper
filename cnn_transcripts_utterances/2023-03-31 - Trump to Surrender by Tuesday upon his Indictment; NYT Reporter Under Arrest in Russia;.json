Ahead on \"CNN Newsroom\".A Historic indictment, Donald Trump becomes the first former U.S. president to be criminally charged. An American reporter under arrest in Russia, what Moscow is accusing him of doing. Gwyneth Paltrow is found not liable for causing a ski collision. We'll hear what the men who accused the actress said she told him after the verdict. Sources tell CNN Donald Trump will appear in the New York courtroom on Tuesday after a grand jury voted to indict the former president. It's the first time in history that a current or former U.S. president has faced criminal charges. Sources tell CNN the indictment includes more than 30 counts related to business fraud. The grand jury has been hearing evidence about hush money payments to adult film star, Stormy Daniels, which Trump has denied knowing about. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office says it has contacted Trump's legal team to coordinate his surrender. New York City Police are also stepping up security in case of possible protests. We have more now from CNN's Senior Crime and Justice reporter Katelyn Polantz. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Years of investigation and several weeks of closely watching a grand jury in New York, it's resulted in the first ever case, criminal case, against the former president of the United States. Donald Trump is now charged with several criminal charges in New York related to his business empire, and potential hush money payments that he may have endorsed that we know that his personal attorney paid out to a porn star as he was running for president in 2016.It is not exactly clear what these charges are at this time. Even Trump himself doesn't know of them, but we do know and we have confirmation tonight from both his attorneys and from the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, that Donald Trump has been charged. He has been contacted and that he needs to get himself from Florida, where his estate is, to New York City so that he can be arrested and processed in the court system and potentially face trial. So, right now, what is happening is, Trump is expected to appear on Tuesday of next week in court. He will be processed like any other criminal defendant. It may be a hectic and chaotic scene in Manhattan, either in or outside of that courthouse with a lot of additional security, but his photographs will be taken. He will be fingerprinted. He will appear before a judge. He will read his charges and he will be able to enter a plea. Right now, the expectation is that he will plead not guilty and progress toward trial. But that is where we are right now here in this New York case as he faces these charges. At the same time, there are ongoing criminal investigations that Donald Trump still faces and has not been charged in. In Georgia, a state case related to the end of his presidency in the January 6th attack on the U.S. capital as well as to federal criminal cases that grand juries in Washington, D.C. have been actively investigating and pursuing very high-ranking witnesses to tell them their stories of what happened, what they heard of with Trump, and what their interactions with the former president were like. Those are relating both to January 6th and the keeping of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida after he left the presidency. Though he hasn't been charged in those, they are quite mature investigations, and Donald Trump is facing quite a lot of legal risk there that he is trying to stand down as well as he is going to be moving forward as this case progresses in New York once we finally see the charges and it is before a judge.

Reporter from the \"Wall Street Journal\" was arrested on suspicion of espionage for the United States, the news anchor announces, Evan Gershkovich, it reads, now faces 20 years in prison. It was in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, 1,100 miles from Moscow, that Russia's federal security service former KGB say they terminated the illegal activity of the accredited journalist. They claim he was on a mission from America to accumulate classified evidence on Russia's military industrial complex. At a brief court appearance in Moscow, the case was designated top secret. And the 31 year old journalist was remanded in custody for nearly two months. A lawyer trying to represent Gershkovich says he was excluded from the proceedings. DANIL BERMAN, LAWYER (through translator): I don't know how long it took three or 15 minutes, and that's it after that, I assume Evan has already been taken away from here. We don't know anything. CHANCE (voice-over): The arrest comes against the backdrop of appalling U.S.-Russia relations with Washington leading international support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. There's already one U.S. citizens jailed in Russia too, for espionage, Paul Whelan, detained in 2018 serving a 16-year sentence. And it's been just a few months since U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner imprisoned in Moscow on contentious drug charges was swapped for notorious arms smuggler, Victor Boot, held for years in U.S. jail. The Russian foreign ministry says there's no question of another prisoner swap at this time. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says it vehemently denies the allegations against their reporter and says they're seeking his immediate release. But Russian officials are doubling down. MARIA ZAKHAROVA, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Under the cover of journalism, this person was involved in a completely different activity. There are lots of reports that he had accreditation. Therefore, he's a journalist. No, no, no. This is what he claims to be.

And even though they had been expecting a potential indictment for some time, they didn't think it was going to come this soon. Now, one of Trump's advisers told me shortly after the indictment that they were, quote, \"blindsided by the timing.\" They believed, like much of the media have been reporting on Wednesday, that the grand jury would be breaking for the religious holidays and a potential indictment will then come until mid-April.But in recent days, I'd argue that the Trump team had increasingly began to question whether the Manhattan district attorney's case was falling apart. We saw Donald Trump himself write on Truth -- write on Truth Social just hours before the indictment that he is, quote, \"Gained such respect for the New York grand jury and believed that they were perhaps reconsidering an indictment,\" which obviously was not the case. And just to take a step back, as much as we've seen Donald Trump lean into his own defense and try to project confidence that he'll come out on top at the end of this, including in the statement that he released shortly after learning of the indictment. This is really a jarring moment for him. He now has to go through the process of getting arrested and getting fingerprinted. And while Trump himself and his team believe that indictment will ultimately help him politically, he doesn't want to be indicted. This is a point that his advisers have acknowledged to me over the past several weeks over and over again. It also reminds me of reporting I did on Donald Trump during impeachment. He did not want to have impeached president on his resume, regardless of how much it may have rallied his base behind him. And regardless of whether his advisors and others thought that it would benefit him politically in the long run. Now what he is facing, though, is not an impeachment. It's a criminal indictment, and he's virtually no control over how this legal process will play out. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington. BRUNHUBER:  And for more on this, I want to bring in Ron Brownstein who's a CNN senior political analyst and senior editor for \"The Atlantic,\" and he joins me from Los Angeles.

It is something that we may see again in American history several more times before anybody goes to vote in the Republican caucuses and primaries next year.And in many ways, this may be the least threatening of the legal nets that are tightening around him with a possible indictment by a county prosecutor in Georgia and, of course, two major investigations by federal investigator -- federal special counsel. So, we are very much at the beginning of the process and you have a lot of people making very confident pronouncements about how this is going to play out, and republicans' kind of erupting in outrage and insisting this makes it more likely that Donald Trump becomes the president again.

Chris Christie, who's also a former federal prosecutor, has said something like that.But the vast majority of Republicans who have spoken have been preemptively condemning this investigation and kind of writing it off. They may have to do that three more times over the course of this year, if, in fact, Georgia and the special counsel move forward with potential indictments. And all of this, I think, locking arms around him does at least in the near term, strengthen his position in the Republican primary. But I think it is wishful thinking on the part of Trump defenders to believe that this would help him in a general election. You know, in that poll I mentioned, 70 percent of college educated voters who were the same voters that recoil from the Republican Party in '18,'20, and '22 in the Trump era, said that they believe that these investigations are fair and roughly, 70 percent said they do not want Trump to be president again. I can't see any way in which multiple indictments helps him in a general election and maybe ultimately, and even in a Republican primary, but certainly in the near term, in part because of this chorus of the party leaders basically dismissing this out of hand, it may make it more likely may solidify his position in this Republican race.",
