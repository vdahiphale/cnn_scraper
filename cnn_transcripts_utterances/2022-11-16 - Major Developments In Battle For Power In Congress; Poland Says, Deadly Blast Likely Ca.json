He needs 218 votes in the full House in January in order to secure the speakership, meaning the 31 or so Republicans who voted against him, he needs to get most of them back, because they supported a Republican challenger instead.This is why the margin is so significant. We do expect Republicans to take back the House, but the margin is going to be much narrower than they had hoped. McCarthy and his team had put a lot of money to try to get what they called a governing majority, a comfortable majority, but it will be a razor thin. And, Wolf, at the same time, they are preparing for investigations. Tomorrow, two committee chairmen, Jim Jordan and James Comer, who are expected to lead two key committees, plan to announce what they had plan to do next Congress, which is to investigate Joe Biden and his family's overseas business dealings.

It's about but what direction should it go in. Should it kind of still cling to Donald Trump or should it go in a different direction? Mitch McConnell wants the old days back when the Republican Party was like the Republican Party we all grew up with, and it's strayed very far from that. So, I think it we are going to see a dynamic that makes it very difficult, maybe not as difficult and miserable as the time Kevin McCarthy will have, but still there are going to be voices in that party who want to amplify sort of Trumpism, amplify Donald Trump.

He's trying to keep people out, but it's actually helpful to Donald Trump if more Republicans get in because that's what we saw. We all remember 2015. We all remember how he sort of moved through Iowa and New Hampshire. He benefited from this massive field. So, that is the central question.But he doesn't necessarily need his old supporters. He didn't have the establishment at the very beginning. He needs his base, but he needs donors. And donors are really questioning all of this.

HENDERSON:  I think the question is, do they come around eventually? Because we saw this dynamic in 2016, as the establishment didn't like him, moderates didn't like him. The true sort of Republican Party didn't like him, and then as he racked up, after victory after victory, they eventually came around. But what was so interesting about his speech last night is it was so low energy, right? I mean, I think there was a tweet that said Donald Trump himself seems tired of Donald Trump. I mean, that was sort of the delivery. And what is his message, right? He likes to talk about there's a doom and gloom in America that Americans haven't quite realized quite yet, but they will realize it at some point. What is going to be his message?

So, unless the voices of Fox sort of changes, you know, he is likely to have that support.But one thing that I've done just talking to voters all year, you get the sense from voters that you can still like Donald Trump but not want him to run for president again.

Even though it's not as big a majority, as Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, had wanted, they had hoped that they would be in the 230-seat range, maybe even 240-seat range. We don't know the final numbers here but we do know that they have at least 218 seats. That is the majority to take back the house. They may have up to 220.We'll see ultimately how many they have, but significant. Because once you have the majority in the U.S. House, you have the chairmanships on each key committees. That means you have subpoena power. You can set schedules for hearings. You can call cabinet secretaries to come testify. You can do what your party wants to do on the floor of the House. The speaker of the House, the House majority leader gets to set the exact schedule, what they are going to bring to the floor, what they refuse to bring to the floor, and decide the priorities, which is why winning back one chamber of Congress will have significant ramifications for the next two years of the Biden administration. Remember, Wolf, the Democrats had control of the House and Senate in the first two years under Joe Biden. They had the narrowest of majorities, 50/50 in the Senate, they had a handful of seats in the Democratic-led House. They were still ability to do a significant amount of legislation by passing bills, some significant bills, along straight party lines because they could do that under the budget process that allowed them to pass something like a nearly $2 trillion COVID relief bill, also that sweeping Inflation Reduction Act dealing with healthcare, climate change, taxes and other issues. They will no longer be able to do that, because in order to move through the budget process, you need to have support within essentially among your party, and Republicans and Democrats would not agree to move in such sweeping legislation like that. So, what does this mean for the next two years, Wolf? It means that any legislation that will pass almost certainly will be incremental, it will have to -- it will require a significant amount of consensus on both sides of the aisle, it would still need to surpass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, even as the Democrats are going to regain control of the Senate. They may have 51 seats but they will still need 60 to pass anything. So, what can actually get done next year is an open question. But they will have major things do deal with next year, including raising the national debt ceiling to avoid a debt default next year, funding the government, always a tricky issue, something that could lead to a shutdown if there's not an agreement between the two sides, but at the moment, the big pressure point for the administration will be those investigations into the Biden family, the border, the origins of the coronavirus, among a whole wide range of issues as a new dynamic here is now Washington, Wolf.",

So, it sounds like it's not quite as dramatic but it actually will be in January when the Congress reconvenes, and the new Congress. And even though the majority is slim, the oversight power will sting just as much to this White House, in terms of really inspecting the spending that's been going on, on the COVID relief bills, really looking into where some of this infrastructure money is going, and calling in secretaries for the grilling that they will certainly give.So, we're going to see a couple of different things play out. Yes, there's going to be drama among House Republicans, among themselves, but there's also going to be a sense of purpose about going after the Biden administration. Hunter Biden, the president's son, is already going to be front and center in some of these investigations. So, that is one of the things that is going to happen. So, even though it's a narrow majority, likely on the one hand of a finger, probably single digits, for sure, maybe five, maybe eight seats, that doesn't mean that these committees will have the investigative authority. But interestingly also, I think the House and Senate, what can get done here? There was such a big message that was sent from voters to Washington that people want to get something done. So, we heard Senator McConnell say that earlier. He actually hopes that they can find agreement on some things in the middle of the road here. We'll see about that.

That vote will occur in early January.But there is also going to be a big decision that could come as soon as this week, and that's what happens to the future of Nancy Pelosi, currently the House speaker. Of course, she will not be the speaker in a Republican-controlled Congress but does she stay on as Democratic leader? That is something that Democrats have been watching very closely, this decision I'm told from several Democrats. They expect this to come as soon as this week. She has not tipped her hand one way or the other about what she may do. She did say that the attack against her husband, it will factor into her decision, but then suggest whether it could force her to step aside. She did suggest several years ago that this end of this Congress will be the last time leading House Democrats, but has never firmly shut the door. But now that the House is called, that, and we could see potential a decision coming in the next few days here. And that would have significant ramifications given the fact that she has been the most dominating within her caucus for the past two decades. And then it will prompt a leadership scramble to replace her. Right now, the frontrunner to replace her, Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, someone who is right now currently in Democratic leadership. He is expected to be the frontrunner. But he could face a challenge. It's uncertain whether Pelosi's current number two, Steny Hoyer, will do. Will he challenge Hakeem Jeffries for that role? We learned today that Adam Schiff, who is a member of -- the chairman right now of the House Intelligence Committee, he will not run for that top Democratic spot, even though he had put his foot in the water over this potential run for the last several months. There are others who are looking to fill out the rest of the leadership positions if Pelosi does decide to step aside. So, it will prompt a significant scramble among House Democrats, because they believe, too, Wolf, because of the narrowness of this majority, they could certainly be back in the majority in 2024. They have a chance to do just that because of the fact the Republicans gained so few seats here, despite getting control of the House, they have a chance of getting back into power in the next election cycle.",

Administration officials have been eager to point out that Democrats on the call pointed out they ran on his agenda. And so, this is a White House than been trying to set up their leverage for these coming negotiations with Republicans to come at this from a position of strength. It's what you've heard from the president, he believes the message sent wasn't about wanting a divided government, but the fact that voters want Republicans to work with him, as much as they want the president to work with those Republicans. That's something we heard the president say a couple times last week. You can expect that that is going to be kind of the White House's mantra here, as they look at some of the negotiations over spending packages, over the basic functioning of government.

He says that there was a strong rejection of election deniers, political violence, and intimidation. He says it was an emphatic statement that in America the will of the people prevails.He goes on to congratulate leader McCarthy on Republicans winning the House majority and says that he's ready to work with house Republicans to deliver results for working families. And finally he says, quote, in this election, voters spoke clearly about their concerns, the need to lower costs, protect the right to choose, and preserve our democracy. As I said last week, the future is too promising to be trapped in political warfare. The American people want us to get things done for them. They want us to focus on the issues that matter to them and on making their lives better. I will work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, willing to work with me, to deliver results for them. And that last part, Wolf, exactly the point that I was making earlier, which is this idea that the president is going to go into this power- sharing divided government situation that he is now facing by focusing on the fact that he is ready, he is ready to negotiate, he is ready to deal with Americans, to address fundamental concerns. He is then going to put that onus on Republicans to then deal with him as well. This is the president setting the table, of course. Now on what areas specifically President Biden is willing to compromise, he really hasn't laid those out. He has laid out red lines, though, on abortion, national abortion ban, and cuts to Social Security and Medicare where he said he would veto any of that legislation.

Of course, he came into power after Senator Biden, then Vice President Biden was largely out, but he's about to develop one. And I am told that the White House is going to have meetings like we saw in the Obama era of the top four, they call it, the speaker, the ranking Democrat from the House and Senate. So we'll see this relationship build. If Kevin McCarthy is the speaker, or whoever is, that makes it difficult every time they go to the White House. But we've seen it in years past that presidents can be elevated by divided government. Look at Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George w. Bush, to an extent. So it's a new moment in Washington. It's difficult in some respects for the White House with these investigations and these hearings. But it's also an opportunity for this president to try and work together with them. So, it's really a fascinating, new dynamic. So, it's kind of interesting it's coming at the end of the week here when everything seems, you know, familiar with President Trump back in the ring again, Mitch McConnell being elected.
