Hezbollah confirms one of its senior commanders has been killed in an airstrike on a southern suburb of Beirut. Lebanon's Health Ministry reports at least six people were killed and 15 injured in that attack. But the death toll overall in the country after two days of strikes is now well over 550 including dozens of children, as well as at least two U.N. aid agency employees.Cross-border fighting has increased dramatically over the last few days. More than 200 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel and the Golan Heights on Tuesday according to the IDF. Most were intercepted or fell into open areas. Hezbollah says it also targeted a naval base along the northern mediterranean coast that houses an elite Israeli naval commander unit. The Israeli prime minister visited an intelligence base on Tuesday before meeting with his cabinet and security officials.

Hours later, Hezbollah confirmed that commander's death, though didn't indicate where that actually happened.There was a strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut that destroyed the two top floors of an apartment building with officials saying six people had been killed and 15 wounded. It suggests that that may be where this Hezbollah commander was killed. Hezbollah has been firing hundreds of rockets into Israel. It has been targeting, it says, a number of Israeli military bases in the northern part of Israel as well as several of the Israeli communities near the border that have been targeted by Hezbollah over this kind of cross- border conflict that has gone on for the past year. What we have not yet seen is deeper attacks towards, for example, Tel Aviv or places further south. However, just in the last hour, we've gotten reports from Israel about air raid sirens going off and reports of some kind of projectile being struck by Israel's aerial defenses over the city of Netanya.

Prosecutors say Routh camped outside of Donald Trump's West Palm Beach golf course for hours on end, armed with a rifle that he pointed through a chain link fence with a clear shot to the next hole where the former president was headed to on September 15th. According to court documents, Routh spent more than a month tracking Trump in Florida. Prosecutors told a federal magistrate judge that cell phone data showed Routh at the golf course as well at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort over several days beginning in mid-August. According to prosecutors, investigators found a handwritten note after detaining Routh that included venues and locations where Trump had or was planning to visit in the months leading up to the 2024 before election. Now Routh allegedly also left behind a letter in a box of belongings saying, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you. The case has been assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon.
