Plus star players taking the court, the NBA is LeBron James. And college basketball standout Caitlin Clark, their chance to make history by doing what they do best. The sports legend himself, Bob Costas, will be here to talk about it. But first leading this hour, a major announcement from President Biden today, who renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas for at least six weeks in Gaza. Their goal, to get more hostages release from Hamas and get more aid into Gaza. The President said the US plans to airdrop that desperately needed food and supplies into the war ravaged area. Here he was at the White House sitting next to the Italian prime minister just a few moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Yesterday we saw what happened in Gaza just, pure chaos, when desperation turned deadly as trucks that were carrying much needed aid were swarmed by hundreds of starving people.As we were still working to confirm all of the grim details, what we do know is that Israeli forces opened fire, arguing that their soldiers needed to protect themselves. Reports from Gaza on the ground say that that sparked the trucks to speed off and then crashing people in the crowd as they did so leading to more than 100 people killed, hundreds more injured. CNN, I should note, cannot independently verify those numbers at this time. But we did spend weeks working to reveal the facts of an earlier tragic moment. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and a team of CNN journalist in unprecedented detail documented one attack that killed more than half the members of one single family.

We verified social media content and spoke with ballistic and forensic experts, allowing us to piece together the events of a bloody night of death and horror amid intense and discriminate Israeli military fire that left civilians dead.We started by asking the IDF about the incident giving them pictures and exact coordinates. The military said their troops had come under fire from that location on January 4th, and they responded with a \"precise strike\" to remove an imminent threat, and can't confirm if the bodies are linked to that strike. Our investigation raises serious questions about the IDF's actions that day. This is where it all unfolded, there's a wider area of Salah al-Din Street. Before the war, it was an industrial zone, but it's Israel designated Salah al-Din the evacuation corridor out of Northern Gaza. Business owners allowed hundreds of displaced people to stay in these warehouses. Suddenly in early January, war arrived on their doorstep. Eyewitnesses say the warehouse is on both sides of the road, we recreated in this 3D model, were repeatedly struck from the ground and air. Families sheltering in the warehouses on the left, broke holes through back walls escaping into the farmlands. For the warehouse on the right, there was no escape for most. They were surrounded. They say the Israeli shot at anyone who tried to walk out, something the IDF denies. We tracked down Roba's mother and three siblings separated from her during the attack. They confirmed that among the bodies our cameraman filmed were five of Roba's siblings. The youngest among them was Al-Zain, he was 10, and Ali 13. What likely killed most of them was the shockwave from a massive 2,000 pound bomb according to forensic pathologists and weapons experts who examined our footage and satellite imagery. The blast shockwave is so powerful that it can rupture the lungs, leaving victims to drown in their own blood. What the family didn't know was that Roba was still alive, bleeding for four long days among the dead. After our January 7th interview, we tried to find her again lost in the chaos of overwhelmed hospitals. After weeks of searching, we found her miles away in Rafah receiving treatment.

But they had a number one pick last year and got a very good player named Aliyah Boston. Now, Caitlin Clark will join her. The rookie pay scale in the WNBA is only $78,000. But we wanted to throw in the benefits for Caitlyn because she already has deals with Gatorade and StateFarm and Nike, and those national deals will only increase when she goes into the pros.
