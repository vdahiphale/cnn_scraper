One of the highest marks of respect that the Congress affords to foreign leaders. He's only the second Israeli president to make such an address. The first was his father, President Chaim Herzog, 35 years ago. Despite strong bipartisan ties between American lawmakers and Israel and longstanding ties, this visit and this address is exposing some tension within the Democratic Party around that support right now in this political arena.

One thing that has become very clear is there is strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for Israel, despite the fact that over the last several days, there have been some tensions in the Democratic ranks that you talked about at the top.One of those tensions, of course, came over the weekend when the leader of the progressive caucus in the House of Representatives, Pramila Jayapal, called Israel a racist state. She later walked back those comments. But Republicans putting a resolution on the floor last night, asking lawmakers whether or not they supported Israel, that resolution passed overwhelmingly with just nine Democrats voting against it, because they said that they had concerns about Israel's human rights record. There are a handful of Democratic progressives who are not in the chamber for this speech, saying that they have, again, concerns about Israel's human rights records. Some of those members include Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Cori Bush. We also know that Ilhan Omar is not going to be in the chamber, neither is Jamal Bowman. So, those are just a number of Democrats who are not going to be attending this speech today.

We know of at least one witness, a personal aid to Trump who also worked in the White House is scheduled to come in, scheduled to testify as well as potentially others. And there have been so many pieces of this investigation that prosecutors can work for whenever they are carving out exactly what they want to say in this indictment, if it is approved by the grand jury. That in front of you is just a list of some of the people who have spoken to investigators, not the full list at all, that doesn't even include state officials, but there on that board, it is some of the closest advisors to Donald Trump in the West Wing, his own vice president, Mike Pence, all having spoken to the Special Counsel's office or testified to that grand jury already in addition to turning over documents and having so many other pieces of this investigation come together. So, when you listed those three possible statutes, the two that really stand out, that conspiracy to defraud the United States and the possible witness tampering statute, which we believe will very likely would be charged as obstruction of an official proceeding, that very much tracks with the arc of this full January 6th investigation, where prosecutors have looked at, not just what Trump was saying and doing inside the West Wing, not just what happened on Capitol Hill on January 6th, but what happened across the country, the sort of thing they've been asking questions about for many months now, from many, many witnesses, from a lot of different parts of both federal and state governments.

He also specifically attacked Special Counsel Jack Smith.But privately, this target letter is very much weighing on him. He recognizes the seriousness of these charges. And I'm told, after speaking with some of Donald Trump's advisors, that after his lawyers received that letter on Sunday night, Donald Trump did not share it widely with members of his inner circle. He kept it pretty quiet until announcing it publicly yesterday on social media. And you know, last night in his interview with \"Fox News\" is Sean Hannity during a town hall in Cedar Rapids, he admitted that this bothers him. Let's listen to that exchange, Kate.

It bothers me for everybody in this incredible sold-out audience and it's it bothers you. I got the letter on Sunday night. Think of it. I don't think they've ever sent a letter on Sunday night.

During high school, I volunteered with a Legal Aid Society for the elderly in Brooklyn, New York. I volunteered with the impoverished and the underprivileged elderly, including war veterans and Holocaust survivors who gave their best years to the country they loved. My mentor at the organization was a subtle, reserved professional. She was strictly business. The moment she broke character has remained with me for almost 50 years. It was the day she told me the love of her life died fighting for Israel. Her fiance, a tall, bright American Jewish boy, was inspired by designers (ph) dream and the Jewish people's desire for independence. He voluntarily boarded a ship to Haifa, fought in the Israeli military and fell in the battle for Israel's independence just weeks before their wedding. Although decades had gone by and she rebuilt her life, the cracks in her heart remained. That moment in which I learned of the life he gave for the State of Israel spoke to the very core of the bond forged between the people of the United States and the people of Israel, how the nations we built overcame loss, how deeply our stories complement each other's, how far we have all come together. Speaker McCarthy, I thank you for hosting this festive joint session of Congress celebrating the first 75 years of Israel's independence. Just a few weeks ago, during your first trip abroad as speaker, you honored the Israeli people by addressing the Knesset in Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, your sincere expression of friendship on behalf of the United States of America truly resonated with Israelis.

They are conspiracy to committed offense or defraud the United States, deprivation of rights, and the third is witness tampering.

We're going to have a new FBI director on day one. We're going to have big changes at the Department of Justice. Americans across the political spectrum need to have confidence that what is going on is based on the rule of law, not based on what political tribe you're in.
