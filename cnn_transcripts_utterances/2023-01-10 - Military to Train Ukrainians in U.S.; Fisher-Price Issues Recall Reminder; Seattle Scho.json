So, the Ukrainians will come there and begin training on the patriot missile systems according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. That training could begin as soon as next week. So, you see the urgency in getting them trained up on this complex aerial defense system as quickly as possible. It was only announced a few weeks ago at this point. So, bringing them in and getting that training going allows them to get it on to the battlefield as quickly as possible.Crucially, there is no timeline for how long this takes. Defense officials said last week it will take several months. The Pentagon is working on accelerating training on patriot missiles in any way it can to shorten that timeline and make them get out there faster. But, first, there is no definite answer on how much it can shorten the training on what is a complex, long-range, aerial defense system. But, second, they're not going to telegraph to the Russians when this system might be ready and in theater. Crucially, though, as we've heard from two U.S. officials, training on the patriot missile system could begin as soon as next week on the complex system. This will take time, Erica and Jim, but crucially the process is about to start.",

It means that they have burned through a lot of their stocks. They are getting some ammunition apparently from like the North Koreans and they're probably refurbishing some of their older ammunition, but they're not firing at the same rate that they were before. The Russians aren't going to run out of artillery ammunition. They're not going to stop shooting. But they're going to shoot less. That means they can shoot at fewer targets. That's good for the Ukrainians.On the other hand, as we noted, the Russians have more troops on the front line. Their mobilization has produced more personnel. That's strengthening their position.

So, I will say that what's been happening, we know that deaths are due to infants rolling over on to their sides or on to their stomachs while in the sleepers unrestrained.And here's a timeline of what's been happening. The original recall from Fisher-Price came in 2019. On April 12, 2019. It was re-announced just yesterday. And in the reannouncement it was noted that there have been about eight additional deaths reported since 2019. So, those deaths happened after the original recall. And you asked about the number, Jim. In total this recall impacts about 4.7 million sleepers out there. In total, there have been approximately 100 deaths reported in connection to the Rock 'n Play Sleepers. So, the takeaway message here for parents out there who might have Rock 'n Play Sleepers, stop using them immediately. You can contact Fisher-Price to get a refund or a voucher. And then there's also a message for store owners. It's illegal to sell or distribute these Rock 'n Play Sleepers.
