Great to have you both with us. Oren, let's start first with you. Walk us through what we've learned now about the training and what was going on when this collision, this crash happened.",

      "sentences": "We have our Dianne Gallagher in Fort Campbell. We also have General Mark Hertling, who has, of course, served for many years and flew many times in Blackhawk helicopters. Mark, General Hertling, given your experience here, a couple of points. One, the fact that a medevac helicopter was part of this, what does that tell us and just the danger as well of nighttime operations, even during exercises.LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, a couple of things, Jim, and Oren summed it up very well, on a Blackhawk, there are always two pilots, a pilot and a co-pilot, and there are always two crew chiefs both on the left and right doors. So, one helicopter had their crew. The other one had an additional passenger, more than likely a medic in the back. HH helicopters have -- the medevac helicopters, the ones with the big red cross on the side, are there to evacuate wounded soldiers. So, they were training in evacuation. And when you had that one other soldier in the back, more than likely a medic, but in the back of those HH helicopters, there are cassettes that you can load up litters, that you put wounded soldiers onto and carry them away from the battlefield. The other thing that I'd point out that this is all happening at night. U.S. Army trains continuously at night, but that's a challenge for aviators. They have to do it. But when you're talking about night vision goggles when you're flying an aircraft, and I'll demonstrate, pardon me for this, but you have to goggles like this in front of your face and that's where you can see using the illumination from whatever is out there, stars, moonlight. Last night, I looked it up. The moon rose at noon yesterday. It set at 3 59 this morning, so they had good moonlight, about 50 percent illumination from moon illumination last night, and that helps see with night vision goggles. The problem is, it's a limited scope of being able to see because you're literally reduced to the two soda straws of your binoculars. The other thing I would say, you know, they're going to look through what might have happened. As Oren said also, it could have been a wire strike. The aircraft could have hit each other. They could have -- you know, their tail rotor could have hit a tree as they were coming off the landing zone or going into the landing zone. That's why General Lubas said that they were going to bring in experts. There's a safety center at Fort Rucker, Alabama, that immediately sends out teams to investigate these kinds of crashes. The last point I'd make well -- well, two more, if I may, Jim, General Lubas, I don't know him, but when he stepped away from the podium, I noticed he had 201st patches on his left and his right sleeve. That means he's been to combat with this unit. He knows the capabilities of this air assault unit with helicopters, and he mentioned how much planning goes into any kind of helicopter operations. That's critical to understand. The last point I'd make is, you know, the majority of U.S. army soldiers today are married, more than 60 percent are married. So, when you're talking about the notification of next to kin, you have to go to both, you know, potentially wives and children, spouses and children as well as family members.",

The foreign ministry saying that he -- whatever he was doing in Yekaterinburg, the Russian city, 1,100 miles or so from Moscow, it was nothing to do with journalism.Within the past hour or so, a court in Moscow, where he's been arraigned, has designated his case top secret. It's revealed in a press statement that Gershkvocih has denied guilt. He hasn't accepted that he is guilty of espionage. And so they've remanded him in custody in a pretrial detention center. We don't know exactly where, but probably here in Moscow, for nearly two months, until May, the 29th. And so that may well be the next time we catch a glimpse of this 32- year-old American citizen. There's been a brief media scrum outside the courthouse where that decision was handed down. The lawyer who has been designated dated to defend Evan Gershkovich came out and said, look, I wasn't even permitted access to the case. I haven't even been allowed to take part in the process. And so that does not bode well for the prospects of this young Wall Street Journal reporter who now faces these very serious charges, which, remember, carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in a Russian jail.",

Russia, though, would only accept a one-for-one swap rather than the two for one that the U.S. had originally proposed.And so this now further complicates matters as it relates to efforts to secure Paul Whelan's release, because now you, once again, following a situation where there are two Americans who have been accused of spying, one, Paul Whelan, who was already convicted to 16 years in prison, and now Evan Gerhskovich, who faces similar charges. And we know that when you see the Kremlin already coming out and saying that they believe that they have caught this reporter, quote/unquote, red handed, that significantly decreases the possibility of this being ruled some kind of misunderstanding.
