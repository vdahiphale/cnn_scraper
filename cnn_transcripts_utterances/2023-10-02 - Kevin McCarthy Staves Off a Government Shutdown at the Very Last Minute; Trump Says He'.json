I mean, this was a massive weekend in Washington, honestly, it didn't go at all how we expected. We had so many conversations heading into this weekend about the inevitability of a government shutdown.McCarthy clearly decided at the last minute, he was going to make a different move.

Either he would pass this bill with massive spending cuts far below the ones he had agreed with President Biden which were demanded by the far right of his conference, then he would have put the government into a shutdown or he could face down those right-wingers that have been tormenting him really ever since he won the speakership over 15 rounds of voting back in January.He chose the latter option, and that is what has put his job on the line. I think the question now is how many Republicans will rebel against him in a vote to take the speakership away from him? And how many Democrats would be needed to get him over the line and keep him speaker. And if ultimately, a speaker who is sent to Washington to counter a Republican president with conservative government could survive for very long relying on Democratic votes.",

But if you're a moderate Democrat, say in a district where you're facing a tough re-election race, you could see a rationale for voting to keep McCarthy in office.That would give, well, those candidates some distance from the progressives in their party. It would allow them to defend themselves against Republican attacks in the general election, and it would make them look independent. And there are some Democrats who really fear the consequences of continuing months of chaos right up until the 2024 election, you know, for the health of the country. The flip side to that is, this would be an impossible vote for many Democrats to take in the house. There's huge mistrust of Kevin McCarthy. You know, politically, it would be impossible for a Democrat who would fear, perhaps, a primary challenge from their left to vote to keep a Republican speaker in power. And after all, let's remember, this is a Republican speaker who just opened an impeachment investigation against the Democratic President Joe Biden. So, there's no good feeling to him whatsoever, especially as many on the Democratic side of the house believe that, that investigation was what turned out to be actually a failed attempt to appease the hard right and head off this government shutdown. So it's going to be difficult for Democrats to keep united. I think the question is, how many Republicans stand with Gaetz and want to get rid of McCarthy, not least because there's no real obvious successor or anyone who could do a better job in a fraction-splinted Republican majority of keeping the house together, that's going to be the question and how many Democrats would be needed to prop him up.",

But if there's a lot of people with Gaetz, that's going to be a lot tougher, and you know, Stephen, you used the word that I really think is kind of the word of the moment here in Washington.Maybe, it always is, but trust, there is very little trust coming from any direction toward McCarthy from his office, among Democrats, and that's I think really making this situation really tough.",

And the reason the European Union is worried is that this has a huge impact on allies as well. You really heard President Biden speaking to that, trying to calm tensions, saying we will reach a deal, it doesn't just matter to his relationship with Ukraine, it also matters with all the allies here in Europe because they're going to have to step in, which they can't really do with that amount of money. And it's a European war, isn't it? So, this has huge repercussions. The reality of what we're facing here is really worrying.

It sounds like Matt Gaetz is going to jump in and try to, you know, kick him out of a job. The rules are such, that takes at least two days.I mean, we're a little ways off from this. The other piece of this, Max, and I saw you all reporting on this in the last hour, and we talked about this last week, the elections in Slovakia actually have pretty significant ramifications for Kyiv, and they really play into this idea that there are these new challenges and cracks in some of the western support in the context of that war.

And particularly, on the right and the far right, politicians are saying we've got to stop funding, stop supporting this war in Ukraine. And that's exactly what's happened in Slovakia. So, the Robert Fico who got the most amount of votes in the Slovakian election wants to stop funding Ukraine and was a very close ally, wants to stop supporting it in any way militarily only in terms of humanitarian efforts.So that was a big moment, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's going to become prime minister. He has to find a coalition partner, the key one was his far-right party, but they didn't get enough votes to get into parliament, so they're going to have to tie up with someone else. They need a bit of hope for people that are worried about this right now, is that they're going to have to tie with someone more moderate than him. So maybe, we'll get a more moderate version of this Ukrainian policy.",
