They were -- they were not infull tactical gear, but they did have helmets and batons, and they moved in on this street. This is 114th Street in Amsterdam right here. They moved in, in very large numbers onto the campus through a single gate on 114th Street. You can still see one bus down there. That bus is taking whoever is left to arrest. We saw dozens of people arrested that were brought out through a separate gate here on 114th. But the hall that had been taken over by students, Hamilton Hall, is just up the Amsterdam Avenue here. Police were able to get into it using a bearcats. They were lifted up to the second floor. They used flashbang grenades to sort of distract whoever was inside Hamilton Hall. And then they were able to get in. They said that the individuals in there had barricaded the doors with everything from chairs and tables to soda machines. And there weren`t many people in there. Police now say it is done, that everybody that was on the encampment for the last two weeks has been moved out or arrested, that everybody that was in the hall has been either moved out or arrested, and that the entire campus, there was nobody on the Columbia campus that shouldn`t be there at this point, say, New York police officers. The Columbia University has also asked the NYPD to keep a presence on the university through May 17th. The commencement is on May 15th, so it is clear that Columbia doesn`t want to have a repeat of what happened a couple of weeks ago when they cleared the campus once and the encampment reestablished itself. This time, they want to get back to the business of being a university. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you said hand, got to hand it to you, you are correct. Did you know that your two hands make up more than a quarter of all the bones in your body? All right, we all know that washing our hands is important, and that is particularly true if you`re a chef or another restaurant worker handling food, right? But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, only one out of every three food workers wash their hands like they should. That`s not just gross, it`s dangerous, and possibly quite literally sickening. That could lead to the outbreak of foodborne illnesses like norovirus, salmonella, and E. coli. But as you`ll see in this CNN report, a new startup in New York has a potential solution. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
