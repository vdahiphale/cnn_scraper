And in my travels, and Jeff backs this up with his voters, there are a lot of Trump voters who here say I can for Trump.But back here, if he is shown to be vulnerable, the challenge is can somebody show him to be weak in Iowa, like Barack Obama did to Hillary Clinton? Then I think the doors open a little bit. Then there is a possibility. And New Hampshire loves being contrarian to Iowa. Then if it's Nikki Haley, she would go home to South Carolina. The basic dynamic of the race has yet to change, though. If you add up the Haley vote, the DeSantis vote, and the Ramaswamy vote, then you have a challenge to Trump.

The White House warning that Ukraine funding is almost gone and that delaying it could hand a victory to Putin.

Let me make this perfectly clear. The immigration system has been broken for decades, and our Department of Homeland Security has been underfunded for years and years. And President Biden has addressed both issues with strength from day one. On the first day of his administration, he presented Congress with legislation to fix our immigration system, and we have submitted to Congress a Supplemental Funding Bill that will resource our department, the heroic Border Patrol agents that you displayed just a few minutes ago to fund them as they need to address what is an unprecedented level of migration not only at our southern border, not only in the Western Hemisphere, but throughout the world.",
