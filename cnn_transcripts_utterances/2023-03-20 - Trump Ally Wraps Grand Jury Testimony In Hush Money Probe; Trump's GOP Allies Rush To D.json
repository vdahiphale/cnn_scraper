Trump's legal peril and the political fallout looming over a major gathering of House Republicans. And a high-stakes handshake, China's President Xi Jinping strengthens his alliance with Vladimir Putin, praising him as a dear friend even as the Russian leader stands charged with war crimes in Ukraine. We'll have the latest on their talks in Moscow just hours after Putin's defiant visit to the war zone. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the latest testimony in the New York grand jury investigation of Donald Trump amid questions about whether the former president is on the brink of being indicted. Let's go right to our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid, she's just outside the courthouse in Manhattan. Paula, a former legal adviser to Trump's ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, wrapped up his appearance just a little while ago. Give us the latest.",

The court officers assigned to the court and all of them working together to try and ultimately, like we are, figure out, okay, when is this grand jury going to wrap up. Is there going to be an indictment, and when will we know from the district attorney, and once that process gets underway, then we could see some even more stepped-up security in New York City.Today we saw the NYPD placing more cameras in the downtown court area there. We also saw barricades being placed there on the side, should they need them. They can put them to use. So there's a lot of information and a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. The big question right now for law enforcement is timing, if the former president was to be indicted, how that will be told to the former president, how that will come out, and then of course his appearance. That is what everyone is mostly focused on. Should he be indicted, bringing him to court, what that is going to be like, and that is certainly something, Wolf, the secret service is very concerned about because they need to protect his safety and so they are very much involved in this. I'm told the date, that is the big question, you know, there's a lot of anticipation on when potentially there could be some kind of activity, some kind of notice from the grand jury, but we just don't know. But also, Wolf, it's all across the country. We're seeing indications in Washington, D.C. that there are meetings between law enforcement officials as they prepare for any potential protests. But I should also note, Wolf, right now, law enforcement is not seeing any kind of threat. There's nothing that is ultimately concerning to them. They're monitoring social media, but they're just not seeing what they saw, even in the days leading up to January 6th. But they continue to monitor everything.

I mean, there are at least two ethical rules that really would prohibit that, and as far as the D.A.'s office getting a letter that says Cohen waived, I mean, why wouldn't they be asking Cohen, why would they take it on his representation?

I think if there were some things that were cutting, he probably would have had Cohen come in and at least try to refute that.Keep in mind too, when it comes to a grand jury, it's not very common, as far as I understand, for a grand jury that's been presented a lot of evidence to not come forward and not indict. So, I think an indictment seems fairly likely at this point and we'll just have to see what's in that.

There is some really extraordinary factors here. He's a former leader of the free world, U.S. Secret Service protection, the security and logistical concerns are truly unprecedented.

They know what January 6th was, they know how it was, and they know what a similar thing right now would do to Donald Trump's credibility.

Is he going to go back to the well and are these Republicans going to go back to the well and say, every single charge against the president is politically-motivated? What can they say next.

Later, he went down to Mar-a-Lago and aligned himself with Donald Trump in the aftermath, as there was a push to try to establish an outside commission to investigate January 6th, align themselves with Donald Trump, scuttled that effort as well.And when after he was elected speaker of the House, the first person he thanked was Donald Trump for helping him get the votes after 15 ballots on the House floor. That, of course, happened just moments after January 6th, 2023, two years to the date of the deadly insurrection that happened on the Capitol at the hands of Donald Trump's supporters. This has been Kevin McCarthy's move all along, to align himself with Trump, but also perhaps not to get too far, not to say to be aligned with any sort of violence that could occur if that were to happen, if any protests were to happen in the aftermath of any indictment here.

The other thing that the Ukrainians have repeatedly said is that they do not want a peace situation, any ceasefire or anything like that if Russian troops remain on their territory. So, there appear to be a few nonnegotiable conditions that the Ukrainians are setting that the Chinese would find very difficult to meet under their 12-point program.",

Well, it's important to remember there are well over 4,000 banks in the United States and, you know, $23 trillion of assets, so this is First Republic is having some significant challenges. But this is not indicative of broader problems in the banking system. So, I think that's important to remember, number one.But, you know, deposit insurance has caps. And if you're worried about your bank, I always recommend for households to stay below the deposit insurance caps at $250,000. If you do, your money is rock solid safe. The FDIC, my former agency has a perfect record of protecting insured deposits, and there a lot of way you can get significantly more through account restructurings then $250,000, there're lots of information on the FDIC's website. So I do think, you know, people need to be mindful about where they're putting money. But, overall, the banking system, the vast majority of banks are quite safe. Regional banks in particular have been a strong backbone of our economy. They fared very well during the great financial crisis. They kept lending when some of the larger banks were pulling back. So, we must not lose faith in our regional banks. They're very strong and they're very important part of the economy. And, again, I think this is really segmented to a small group of banks that have not managed themselves as well as they should. But people should not be worried about the broader safety of the system.",
