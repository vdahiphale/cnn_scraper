      "sentences": "All right. New this morning, an inside look at what has become the frontline of the war against Hamas in Gaza, from a military standpoint, from a moral standpoint and also from the standpoint of culpability. We're talking about the hospitals there. Only one hospital out of the roughly 30 facilities in Northern Gaza is still receiving patients. That's according to a new report from the United Nations. They are run ought of fuel, food and medical supplies.Reuters has provided video of bodies piling up outside the courtyard of the Al-Shifa hospital. You can see that video there. We have also seen video from Reuters of this, babies outside incubators at Al-Shifa in need of incubators. Now, we just got new information the IDF says it has offered incubators to that hospital, and they have released an audio recording of that offer. Now, President Biden does say that hospitals need to be protected, and, indeed, the Geneva Conventions state that clearly. An official explanation reads, civilian hospitals are entitled to protection under the convention, whether they contain patients or not, but it may under, no circumstances, be used for non-medical purposes. All right, non-medical purposes, what does that mean? Again, from the official commentary on the Geneva Conventions, listen to this, that means the use medical units to shelter able-bodied combatants to store arms or munitions, as a military observation post or as a shield for military action. Now, remember, that both Israel and the United States say that Hamas is using hospitals to conceal command tunnels under Al-Shifa there, and also to hide the weapons caches. The IDF released video from outside the Al-Quds Hospital. You can see here they have circled that person they say as Hamas terrorist holding a rocket-propelled grenade launcher that is right inside of this hospital. Now, CNN's Nic Robertson embedded with this IDF to see the destruction surrounding a children's hospital, the Rantisi Children's Hospital. He embedded with them. He saw a whole lot on the frontlines. This is a hospital the IDF says hid weapons, tunnels and more. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Driving into Gaza with the Israeli forces. It's a war zone. The conditions of our access only show officers, no faces of soldiers and don't show sensitive equipment. We are passing mile after mile of destruction, buildings blown, collapsed, nothing untouched for the fury of Israel's hunt for Hamas. Streets here crushed, back to sand. Shops, everything that we see, no sign of any civilians here. A few miles in, we pull up at a command post, soldiers living in blown apartment buildings. Every building I'm looking at here, wherever you turn, it's destroyed, it's shot up. Hard to imagine how civilians endured the bombardment here. Our next journey, much deeper into Gaza, we arrive 100 meters from a battle with Hamas. Tanks blasting targets in nearby buildings. The IDF's top spokesperson waiting for us. BRIG GEN. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  We are now conducting an operation inside Gaza next to Rantisi Hospital.",

I'm standing right outside of the Democratic caucus meeting, which is still ongoing, but Leader Jeffries left, and he said that they are still evaluating the terms of this short-term spending deal.He said now the good news for Democrats is that there are no spending cuts that were included, there are no poison pill. He said they are still evaluating those bifurcated dates, the realty that some of the government funding is going to run out January 19th, other government funding is going to run out on February 2nd. He said they're still evaluating the impact of that on the American people. But I will say that a number of the House Democrats who are coming out of this meeting are sounding pretty upbeat about this proposal. Representative Pramila Jayapal, who is the leader of the House Progressive Caucus, she said she still wants to meet with her caucus about what they think about this proposal, but she said she thought it was a major victory for Democrats that spending cuts were not include here. And she said that she is considering that as a major win for the party and something that she could likely get behind. She said she just wanted to make sure that other progressives in her caucus felt that way before saying for sure that she was going to support this. So, you're getting a sense from Democrats that they see the writing on the wall. They know that Friday is coming up very quickly. They know Thanksgiving is around the corner. No one wants a government shutdown. And so while this is not the proposal every Democrat had hoped for, it's not the proposal Democrats would have written themselves, they are sounding very open to backing it despite the fact that Jeffries told us we would have to wait and see what happened on the floor.

But the fact is because a small group of those few members voted to remove our speaker a few weeks ago, we lost three weeks' worth of time to be able to pass those individual spending bills. And so we need to do what we have to do right now to keep this government open while we continue that process. I think we are all in agreement, though, that we will be able to save money in the long run, that we will be able to cut wasteful, excessive spending, and we'll be able to put in place better policies if we do it the way it was meant to do, the way the founding fathers, quite frankly, wanted us to do it by taking it up issue by issue as opposed to jamming through these massive omnibus spending bills at the end of the year, that we have stopped, which is the good news.",

We agree that we need to cut excessive, wasteful spending. We have a $33.5 trillion debt. We have a 1.7 annual deficit. We need to address some of the spending issues that have actually just had Moody's downgrade us once again, as well as Fitch. So, we need to be able to address those issues, but we need time to do it. And this will give us the three to four weeks necessary to pass the remaining bills so we can then go to the Senate and negotiate. I think what the Freedom Caucus sometimes misses is that we are one part of a federal government that is mostly controlled by Democrats. We only control one-third. And so when you see us at the negotiating table, we are not going to get every single thing we want all the time, and we can't be threatening a government shutdown in the event that we don't get every single thing that we want. I think the number one priority for us is to get a border that is secure. We are very concerned about the unsustainable flow of individuals and fentanyl and sex and human trafficking that is occurring over our southern border. We can use this upcoming appropriations process to leverage, to get some changes.

And as was explained earlier, as long as I've been in Congress for seven years, we have governed by omnibus bills right before Christmas. It is a terrible way to run a railroad. And the reason that we're in such trouble with our federal debt is because Congress is addicted, obsessed with this deficit spending.What happens is, you know, there's a C.R. that goes right up to Christmas break, and then they jam upon us, as was been said, thousands of pages in legislation that no one really has a chance to adequately read through and digest or amend or anything else. Last year it was $1.7 trillion, you know, with a few hours' notice, and they added $100 or $200 billion extra sprinkled on top of spending that no one had ever actually vetted or gone through. We cannot do that anymore. We have a $33 .6 trillion federal debt. Moody's downgraded our credit rating this week. Two weeks ago, the Treasury Department announced we have to borrow, borrow $1.5 trillion over the next two quarters to keep the government going. We cannot do that anymore. And so the latter C.R., the two-step C.R., everybody calls it something different. It's a new innovation. But it's going to change the way we've done this. We have broken the fever. We are not going to have a massive omnibus spending bill right before Christmas. That is a gift to the American people because that is no way to legislate. It is not good stewardship. It's the reason we're in so much debt, that and the effects of Bidenomics, but we have to change it. And so we've gotten together, I believe there's going to be bipartisan agreement on that, to break it up and put it into January, January 19th, for the first tranche of the bills, and February 2nd for the rest. And that will allow us to go through the deliberative process in good faith. I'm going to take everybody at their word that we're doing this in good faith to do the appropriations process, as it should be done. It should have been done before.",

But when we have a three-vote majority, as we do right now, we don't have the votes to be able to advance that right now.So, what we need to do is avoid the government shutdown. Why? Because that would unduly harm the American people. Troops wouldn't be paid. You know, we know all the effects of that. And so we have to avoid that, and we have a responsibility to do it. But this allows, as was said, as the majority leader said, this allows us as conservatives to go into the fight on the next stages of this, to talk about real border changes, policies at the border, to close the southern border, to get it under control, to talk about the oversight that's necessary on additional Ukraine aid, to get Israel done, if they don't do it, as we beg them to do. All these other matters in the supplemental, that puts us in the policy discussion, and we'll have stringent fights on principle and philosophy and cuts as well. We'll go here.",

Look, it took decades to get into this mess, right? I've been at the job less than three weeks, right? I can't change -- I can't turn an aircraft carrier overnight, but this was a very important first step to get us to the next stage so that we can change how Washington works.And I think the latter C.R., the two-step C.R., however you describe it, is a big important part of that, and I think every member in that room agrees that that's an important innovation, and it changes the way things are done.",
