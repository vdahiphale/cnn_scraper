Before you this evening now is a difficult decision, but it is the correct decision. All of the security agencies fully support it, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Once we are through that initial phase of 50, this initial phase of four or five days of pause, the hope certainly is that there could be a longer pause, that several dozen more hostages could be released. Almost certainly the focus would be on women and children.We have reported repeatedly that Hamas doesn't have all of the hostages themselves. There are different groups within Hamas. There are other factions across the Gaza Strip, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. So, there is an expectation, there's a hope that more of these hostages would be released. We have to put this into broader context Pam. I mean when we're talking about 50 out of an overall 236, that's just 20 percent. So, the vast majority of the hostages would remain. And, frankly, we don't know at this point how many are alive and how many are dead. So, presumably, those negotiations would continue. There's also the question of aid going into the Gaza Strip. And we understand that Hamas has demanded some 300 trucks of aid per day, and that that would continue even after this temporary pause of four or five days. What would happen after that? Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu made it very clear tonight that he expects the fighting to pick up once this temporary pause is over. As Oren alluded to at the beginning of that cabinet meeting, he said he wanted to make it very clear, we are at war, we will continue to be at war until we achieve all of our goals.

Egypt has also been a part of this because they, of course, speak with Hamas as well.And so this has gone to the very top of the Biden administration. The president himself, he has had numerous calls, more than a dozen interactions with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He's spoken just twice last week with the emir of Qatar. He's spoken with the president of Egypt. We have also seen the CIA director, Bill Burns, have a very central role in all of this. The conversation has been taking place among the Qataris and then the heads of intelligence between Israel and the United States. We heard the White House say earlier today that Biden has been expecting multiple updates per day and then jumping in when he felt it was personally necessary to do so.

So, if we can assume to expect ten in the first group, ten in the next and subsequently ten after that for four to five days, do expect to see a lot of children in this initial phase.We've always known the priority was women and children. There was much talk about elderly, the elderly in some weeks ago, but the narrative is really clearly focused on men -- sorry, women and children. These are, of course, let's not forget, civilian hostages. There was no parameter being discussed at present, which involves men who were serving or men of reservist age. So, this is no soldiers, this is civilian hostages. Look, this will be the biggest diplomatic sort of breakthrough since this conflict began back in October the 7th.

And what will be a key priority for, of course, the Israeli government is the potential release of some 50 women and children currently held hostage by Hamas and other groups, but crucially here Hamas inside the Gaza Strip. That would be in exchange for some 150 Palestinian prisoners currently in Israeli custody. Now, of course, there is also talk of a potential humanitarian pause on the table. We're talking about some four to five days of a humanitarian pause. That will be crucial in terms of getting vital aid into the Gaza Strip. And, of course, now we are learning that there is the potential for a Red Cross visit for hostages still in Gaza who haven't been released. Important to underscore, of course, that we are talking about the potential release of some 50 hostages, but it is understood that there are around 240 hostages currently being held inside the Gaza Strip. But, of course, this will be a welcome development for many families in Israel, waiting anxiously for news of loved ones still held captive in the Gaza Strip. On the Palestinian side, of course, another welcome development, but, of course, that 150 figure is still a very small fraction of the thousands of Palestinians in Israeli custody, including some 3,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoner Society, who are currently being held under administrative detention, meaning no clear charges and no ongoing legal process. Now, we did hear earlier today from the U.S. National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby. He said that this would require -- if the deal is indeed approved and put through, this would require careful monitoring to ensure that the terms of the deal are followed through, and also said that this could take a significant amount of time, unclear what really the timeframe that we are talking about here.

The president has repeatedly held these calls with him that he have included focusing in on the need to try to secure the release of some of these hostages.That last known call that the White House had read out was just a week ago today when the two leaders got on the phone. And the White House released a very succinct readout saying that the two discussed specifically the hostages who are being held by Hamas and the need to get them out, including Americans. And today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave President Biden a lot of credit for the current state of these negotiations as he spoke to the Israeli War Cabinet. Netanyahu said, quote, in the last few days, I talked with our friends, the president of the United States, Joe Biden. I asked for his interventions in order to improve the outline that is presented to you. And it was indeed improved so that it would include more hostages and less prices. These talks bore fruit. Netanyahu added, President Biden got involved and I thank him for that. Now, this comes as both President Biden and top officials across the administration have been engaged as these hostage negotiations have played out. In addition to speaking with Netanyahu, just last week, President Biden spoke twice with the emir of Qatar. Qatar has played a key role in mediating between Hamas and Israel as they're working to secure the release of these hostages. One big question is if this deal is reached, how many Americans might be included in that? There is hope that that three-year-old American girl, Abigail Edan, might be part of that group.

It shows that there's lines of communication in which Qatar has been able to stand in for Hamas and work out a strategy, Netanyahu's advocating for passing it, and it's the beginning of a vision of the possibility of more to come. There's discussion about, well, if this can work, can we extend the ceasefire for another day? Can there be another ten hostages released? And in the meantime, there can start to be discussions really about the extent of the humanitarian disaster and how much damage that is doing directly to so many civilians, so many children dying, so much medical care and food and water that are needed, medical supplies that are needed, and also to have real conversation about the strategy of the bombing and shelling that has been so broad in its impact on killing men, women and children.",

This small country has been amazingly effective at walking a tightrope between the U.S. and its allies, and their sworn enemies.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TODD (voice-over): A pivotal player in getting the hostages freed from Hamas captivity, is a tiny emirate, over 1,000 miles away from Gaza, smaller than the state of Connecticut, with about a quarter of the population of New York City. Qatar, an oil rich nation on a peninsula in the Persian Gulf, ruled by a 43-year-old Sheikh named Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who took over when his father abdicated ten years ago.

And man, is it raining, all the way from buffalo to D.C., and all the way down to the south.But to the north, Adirondacks, Catskills, Poconos, you are seeing the snow already, the air is cold enough to make that snow. Now down to the south, we had some risk of some severe weather that's really gone away for the most part right now. There is still a slight risk. We had a tornado on the ground near Hartford, Alabama, about 30 minutes ago. But that storm is completely disintegrated. Here's the rainfall later on tonight and into tomorrow. So if you can put of all of your travel until tomorrow, you are going to be in much better shape. Now, the Berkshires and all the way up to the Green White Mountains, that's where the snow is going to be. And the people that go there for you know, for the holidays, they want the snow, because they want to go play in it. So take the snow when you can get it in some spots. But really, we don't want it in others. There is the heavy snow, parts of Maine may pick up a foot of snow, and that would be some really good news, if you want to go play in it I guess. Now, FlightRadar24 is still showing us all of the flights, Pamela, that are in the sky, 6,000. But not, 4,000 were delayed today. But the good news of all of this, only 68 cancellations across the United States. So, yes, you may have been delayed, but you didn't get canceled. So, you are not trying to make up for that flight tomorrow. That's the good news. Look at this mess.",
