An earthquake disaster, more than 600 people are dead in Turkey and Syria after a powerful quake that sent tremors across the entire region.The magnitude 7.8 quake struck before day break in southern Turkey near the border with Syria. The quake and its aftershocks  collapsing buildings. Now a desperate search and rescue efforts under way to find people who are trapped in piles of rubble. Turkey is now appealing for international assistance. CNN's Scott McLean joins us from London. Scott, this is one of the strongest quakes to hit Turkey in a century. What do we know?",

      "sentences": "That's right. And this part of Turkey, Christine, is used to seismic activity, used to smaller earthquakes, but certainly nothing like this. And remember, this happened in the middle of the night, so people were jolted out of bed with this very heavy, terrifying shaking.And they're finding themselves running out of their houses or apartment buildings into very cold weather. Turkey is experiencing an unusual cold snap in that part of the country, and in places like Malatya, they are actually working to try to get people out of the rubble just as the snow is coming down. So, not only do you have these rescue efforts, but time here is of the essence, because people will not be able to survive for extended periods of time in this kind of a cold. We are also getting new information from Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency, saying that people who are un-housed at the moment are going to single-story buildings like schools and  mosques. Gas has been shut off for obvious reasons to avoid fires in many areas. But electricity and mobile connection is sparse in many parts of this affected region, which is a very wide swath of Turkey and a densely-populated part of the country. Gaziantep, closest to the epicenter, there are some 2 million people living there, at last count, 80 people were dead. But these death tolls are very likely to rise. The numbers that we know so far are people that they've actually been able to find and confirm. There's really only two good comparisons to this in Turkish history. One in earthquake in 1939, a 7.8, same as the one that we saw today, killed 30,000 people. Perhaps, a better comparison though was an estimate in 1999, a 7.4, that killed 17,000 and left half a million people dead. And so, perhaps, that is the kind of death toll that is feared at this point. After that earthquake in 1999, that's when Turkey really got serious about its building regulations, trying to tear down buildings that wouldn't meet building codes and rebuild them in a more earthquake-proved matter. But this is a long process, and today, it seems like in that part of the country, we are finding out sadly, which of these buildings are up to code, and which ones are frankly not. There's also at least at the moment a higher death toll, Christine in Syria nearby, and that's maybe not surprising, considering that the infrastructure there has been absolutely decimated by decades of war. And the Syrian civil defense, the White Helmets who became famous around the world for responding to missile strikes and bombings inside of Syria, to try to get people out, they're now working to try to free people trapped under the rubble of earthquakes. But one of the big concerns there and also in rural parts of Turkey is getting heavy machinery in. When you look at these pictures, you can see that it's going to be very difficult to work with your hands alone. And so, heavy machinery is desperately needed, but it's not always readily available, especially in some of these smaller towns and villages nearer to the epicenter, Christine.",

      "sentences": "Well, Christine, they're accusing the U.S. of overreacting, which is ironic in the eyes of many people, given their own usual obsession with sovereignty and national security. But I do want to mention one late breaking development that is just a short while ago, China for the first time admitted the second balloon spotted in the skies over Latin America last week was also theirs.And they're very much sticking to the same story line claiming that was also a civilian vessel used for testing flights, but it drifted off course due to the weather. A foreign ministry official said they have explained the situation to relevant governments, and according to her, those governments have expressed their understanding, that obviously was not the reaction they got from the U.S., which is why you have heard from their defense ministry, issuing that vague threat against the U.S.  But also from the foreign ministry repeating a lot of the condemnation and accusations, saying they shooting down the balloon and quote- unquote \"hyping up\" the incident was irresponsible and unacceptable. But the thing is, despite this rhetoric, few observers think at this juncture, there would be immediate aggressive China's military actions against the U.S. And -- a lot of the posturing, they think is addressing a domestic audience here, and there is just some hope, they think, that China may want to turn over the page quickly to bring the relationship back on track, which of course, was the purpose of that now cancelled trip by Secretary of State Blinken. But Christine, a lot of unanswered questions here and many of which we may never find out because how secretive the system here is, including why does Xi Jinping and his government decide to do this at this particular sensitive time. And if it was indeed due to some sort of miscalculation and a failure of coordination within their system, then that would be very concerning or even alarming for not only the U.S., but the rest of the world.

And I'm glad you asked this question, because there's been a lot of churn around why it took so long to shoot this balloon down.Look, you know, I firmly believe that if we had taken the shoot first and asked questions later approach, today, we would be asking questions about why we failed to consider the risks to lives and property on the ground. It's a legitimate concern. The fact of the matter here is that, once we discovered that this balloon was in U.S. airspace, the first thing to do was to stop and think and figure out the best course of action. It's really important for people to understand that -- to understand that when it was determined that this balloon could not be shot down safely, it's not like we were going to let the balloon simply traverse across the United States collecting data. The very next step would have been to figure out what we could do to protect sensitive information. And so, I think the administration, the federal government made the right call here, protect lives on the ground, protect property, coordinate with other federal agencies, but also, what we don't know all the steps taken to protect sensitive information as this balloon moved across the country.",

Fact that this wasn't part of the public discourse here in the country. So, from that perspective, it really does concern me. And I think that, what we may be seeing here and we'll have to wait until all the details are in. But we may be seeing an emboldened China that saw those instances in the past and realized that the United States wasn't going to   take any action, and so, they decided to be a little more aggressive this time around.",

I do think, to a larger part of your question, I do think this is significant with regards to our diplomatic relationship.   Now, we were at a point where Antony Blinken; Secretary of State, was about to head back to China for sensitive diplomatic discussions, and what China wants more than anything right now is to be able to move forward with those discussions. So, this is the worst possible thing that could happen for China at a time like this. And I think their narrative around this is all about trying to appear strong at home --",

So, what we can learn are not only -- it's not only information about Chinese technology.But we can also learn a little bit about Chinese trade crafts. So, we're going to be looking at the equipment to see if there are things that might allow for the Chinese to pick up encrypted signals Intelligence that might allow them to decrypt signals Intelligence at the end of this. There are a lot of possibilities here. But it's important for people to know that it's not just about the technology, we are also interested in understanding their trade craft.

It's punishable by up to life in prison, and the trial begins today.Now, this is the largest national security trial to take place since Beijing imposed sweeping security legislation in the wake of the 2019 anti-government Hong Kong protests.

They have already pleaded guilty, but among the 16 or so defendants who are pleading not guilty, you have a former journalist, her name, Gwyneth Ho. Now, they are accused of organizing and participating in an unofficial primary vote. That took place in July of 2020. And Hong Kong had previously held a similar exercise, in fact, in 2018 without incident. But when this 2020 vote took place, the liaison office, which is China's top representative here in Hong Kong said that there was an attempt to paralyze the government, and they said that they were trying to contravene the law. Now critics say that the national security law is being used to crush dissent, and to crush opposition here in the territory -- I want to share with you this statement that was recently put out by the senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, Maya Wong. She writes this, quote, \"Hong Kong's biggest national security cases wrapped in legal language, but it's just part of the Chinese government's relentless efforts to smother Hong Kong's Democracy movement. The very real threat of life in prison for peaceful activism shows Beijing's utter contempt for both Democratic political processes and the rule of law\", unquote.
