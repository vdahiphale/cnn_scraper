      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN Tonight.There sure are a lot of suspicious objects flying around our skies lately. Exactly one week ago, it was that Chinese spy balloon. This afternoon, it's what the Pentagon calls a high altitude object shot down by an F-22 fighter jet about ten miles off the northern coast of Alaska near the town of Deadhorse. But what is that object? Who does it belong to and what was it doing up there? Plus, of course, it's Super Bowl weekend. Bob Costas will be here tonight with what he's most excited about. Americans are expected to bet $16 billion on this game. Is this harmless fun or a new national addiction? Bob Costas will give us all the scoop on the big game. And Congressman George Santos is still at it. This time he's lying about Senator Kyrsten Sinema, according to her. If people lost track, we'll bring you the full compilation of Santos' deceptions from just this week and what his colleagues are now saying about him. But let's start with the mysterious object shot out of the sky over Alaska this afternoon. Joining me is Fareed Zakaria, Host of Fareed Zakaria GPS. Fareed, great to have you here with us tonight. So, let's talk about what we know about this strange mysterious object. We know it was flying at 40,000 feet, which they say posed a threat to civilian airplanes. It does not appear to have any surveillance equipment on it. It's about the size of a small car. It was unmanned, did not appear to be self-maneuvering, meaning that it was subject to the winds, it was much less predictable. So, Fareed, do you want to hazard a guess as to what this thing is?",

      "sentences": "Alisyn, sometimes in life it's best to be honest and say, I don't know. What we do know is the balloon was flying at about 60,000 feet, so much, much higher. This one, as you say, is about 40,000 feet, which means the Pentagon is exactly right, it does interfere with civilian flights. I would have wondered if it could possibly be a drone. That is usually too high for a drone. Commercial drones fly at about 400 feet above, but they can go as far up as I think 20,000. Military drones can get up to 30,000. This one is at 40,000. But the Pentagon says it had no surveillance equipment on it.It also said that it burst on impact. It shattered on impact, which doesn't suggest it's a balloon. So, if we want to play this game, it's something that shatters on impact, does not have surveillance equipment, is going higher than most drones, lower than these spy balloons, you got me.",

It's one of the reasons why you sort of (INAUDIBLE) rushes to make judgments. One has to be careful in getting the story right is that, it really -- there's a lot of possibilities.

One of the things that I think was in some of the reporting was that one of reporters asked, did you try to communicate with China to ask them, is this something coming out of China. And the response that the administration, I think it was Admiral Kirby, gave was we're not talking to China because they didn't answer our last phone call, which sounds a little -- like this is a kind -- we're in a very bad moment with China. And the danger here is it's a very powerful country.We have lots of issues with it. There're issues relating to Taiwan. There're issues relating to China's enormous military buildup. It now has more ICBM launchers than the United States. That's not nuclear missiles. That's places where you can put nuclear missiles. But it tells you that China is, by the Pentagon's own estimation, triple the nuclear weapons it has and we have no military-to-military dialogue, we have no arms control treaties, we have no hot line between Beijing and Washington. And so when something like this happens, it isn't easy to quickly clear it up and clarify it and say is this something of yours. And to me that's a very dangerous place for us to be. It reminds me when you look at history of where the United States and the Soviet Union were in the 1950s before arms control, before superpower summits, before regular confidence building measures. There's an enormous amount of mistrust, suspicion, no good lines of communication. And what that means is one of these crises could go bad, right, because it could escalate. And there isn't enough information. There could be a miscalculation. And that's a dangerous place to be. Remember China is a nuclear armed essentially superpower.",

But we've got to get these answers first and foremost. CAMEROTA:  Well, yes. One of the things that he's being criticized for is the lack of transparency. Senator Murkowski of Alaska, who's quite concerned about things flying over her home state, said today we're going to press the White House for more transparency.

I wrote a book about the White House chiefs of staff, and my latest book on the Biden White House, The Fight of His Life, spells out just how badly things can go when a president switches White House chiefs in midstream. But so far, this is a tribute to Zients' and I think also to a foreign policy and nationally security team that is finally really hitting its stride.

But it isn't like people at CNN don't have their allegiances.The game shapes up as a good one. The odds makers say point-and-a- half, two points in favor of the Eagles. The Eagles have had a great season. They've lost only one game including the playoff. And generally speaking, it's believed that the Eagles have not by a lot but by an observable amount the better overall teams. But Mahomes, with all due respect to Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes is a gigantic talent.

And so, apparently, at one point, the Biden administration said, yes, we'll talk with two hosts from Fox Soul, and Fox apparently said, yes, that's okay, too, and now the White House has backed away. If I were advising Joe Biden, and he hasn't called me, but if I were advising Joe Biden, I would tell him, look, Fox and every conservative outlet, right-wing talk radio, the internet, they will all call cowardice on you, fair or not. He was afraid to come on Fox. He was afraid to face the questions.
