You know, mail-in voting has been so key prior to Donald Trump to successful Republicans. I mean, not just in states like Florida, states like Arizona, Utah, you name it. And it's something that I've talked to, you know, Republican strategist and some of those swing states like Arizona who are just frustrated because they feel as though, you know, they wouldn't be able to get more voters to come out and vote if the leader of their party weren't attacking this very democratic mechanism for voters to cast their ballot.",

GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENTAnd so this heavy lift crane vessel is really the first piece of major equipment that we're expecting to arrive later today and in the coming days. And it could take several days for them to clear all of that wreckage out after that. Officials say divers are going back down into the water. They want to recover those four remaining men and offer closure to their families. But, look, Dana, another obstacle in this could be the hazardous material that's been discovered around the ship. More than 50 containers, more than 700 tons of flammables, corrosives, lithium batteries. Officials have said it's just not safe around the bow of the ship right now where that bridge actually came down. So they're still working on clearing that. And investigators as well are having a very busy day talking to those pilots again of the ship still trying to piece together what caused this power outage, this total blackout that led to the pilot losing all power, all ability to steer the vessel and ultimately led to the crash into the bridge and the collapse, Dana.",

In fact, Lieberman was only 537 votes away from becoming the first Jewish vice president, making history as the first Jewish-American on the ticket of a major party is just one way the world is remembering.The former senator passed away yesterday at the age of 82 after suffering complications from a fall. He became well known during his near quarter century in the Senate on many issues, including national security. He spearheaded the idea of a new Department of Homeland Security for better government communication after the 9/11 terror attacks. His hawkish views earned him a Democratic primary challenge in 2006, which he lost, but then won reelection as an independent. Lieberman was an observant Jew. He didn't work on the Sabbath. In the rare case that he had to, he walked miles to get to the Capitol. He walked the walk every day in every way, a mensch (ph) with a wicked sense of humor. Joining me now, Republican senator from Maine, Susan Collins, who was a close friend of Senator Joe Lieberman. Thank you so much for being here. I am so sorry for your loss. And, of course, the country in the world is mourning the senator. Just yesterday, you were at a town hall in your home state of Maine, you were speaking to students, you were asked to name your favorite person you've ever worked with. I want to play for our viewers your answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I have been fortunate to work with an awful lot of people that I really liked. But if I had to pick one person, it would be former Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. He was a Democrat, is now an independent. And we came from different states, Connecticut and Maine. We had -- we're different parties, but we work together as a team. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
