State Department Special Envoy for Global Engagement James Rubin joins the show. Also, ahead, how the flow of information has shaped us and our world. Author Yuval Noah Harari talks to Walter Isaacson about his new book, \"Nexus: A Brief History Of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. For the second time in two months, Former President Donald Trump has been the target of an apparent assassination attempt. It happened Sunday, while the former president was playing golf at his club in Florida. A Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel poking through a fence a few hundred meters away from where Trump was then playing. The man in custody, Ryan Wesley Routh, spent time in Ukraine and recently wrote about other global hotspots, including Afghanistan and Taiwan, in a self-published book. He had also criticized Trump on social media. This moment in American history is fraught as the rhetoric around the election becomes more heated and political violence increases, and the nation is awash in guns. One man who knows about political pressure is Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI. He was actually fired by Donald Trump for what McCabe says was politically motivated reasons. He's joining me now from Washington, D.C. Andrew McCabe, welcome back to our program. You know, when you heard about this, what went through your mind first? What did you think was cause for this?",

      "sentences": "Well, Christiane, I'd have to say, what went through my mind first was just amazement, the fact thatwe've had two similar incidents, two attempted assassinations on Former President Trump in just, I think, nine weeks. But it's a sad but kind of expected commentary on where we are in this country right now, with the idea of political violence. Law enforcement officers and intelligence officers like myself have been cautioning for the last several years that all the indicators are we are edging in a direction in this country that will likely result in many more instances of politically motivated violence. We know this from the increased level of threats that people -- especially government officials are facing at every level, state, local, federal, everything. And we know that the law enforcement entities designed to protect these folks have said that they are completely overwhelmed, they're receiving more threats than they really have the capacity to deal with. So, it's a very dangerous time in the United States. And of course, we're in the very end of a heated political season with the presidential election. So, it's a very toxic mixture of dangerous threats right now.",

Guns don't have an inspirational impacton people, but they do have a tactical impact on people. The presence of guns, the ease with which just about anyone can put their hands on a very lethal, essentially, weapon of war in this country makes the problem much more dangerous, much more immediate, and harder for law enforcement to track. And I would argue that same presence, the oversupply, if you will, of guns that we have in this country makes a lot of problems in this country worse. So, you're far more likely to die of suicide by firearm if you live in the United States of America. You're far more likely to experience a mass shooting where someone in your family may. So, all of these things are made worse tactically and lethally by the fact that the people who are compelled to do them, for whatever reason, can easily arm themselves with very destructive weapon.",

You startat the crime scene itself, preserving the evidence of what actually took place. Because unlike what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, here we have a suspect who will -- who needs to be prosecuted. So, investigators and prosecutors are assembling the evidence they'll need to prosecute him. But you also want to understand his motive, why he did it, what sort of things were driving him. And for that, then you start to expand beyond the crime scene. You execute search warrants at his residence, maybe at his business, maybe at the homes or his vehicle or other places. You speak to all those people, anyone who's been in contact with him. And crucially, you try to seize and examine every piece of computer media that he may have had, whether it's a laptop or a phone or a tablet or any communication devices, hard drives, thumb drives, all that stuff, because you want to read everything he wrote. You want to understand the sorts of messages and communications he was having with friends and associates. All those pieces help the investigators understand what truly drove this guy. They are looking, first and foremost, to see if anyone had knowledge of this. If anyone helped him. Helped him plan it. Helped him fund it. Anything like that. And then, also, to see if he was talking to other people who might also be inclined to engage in the same sort of criminal behavior.

It's just, you know, a lot of this kind of violence. So, I want to talk to you about the rhetoric that we started off talking about. The latest from Donald Trump in an interview with Fox said, quote, \"Talking about Biden and Harris, their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at when I'm the one who's going to save the country and they're the ones who are trying to destroy it from within, both from inside and out.\" Well, as an FBI official, how do you assess that kind of public statement from the intended victim here?",

But it's very, very weird, for instance, to hear Elon Musk, who owns one of the biggest social media operations in the world, tweeting earlier and asking why no one was trying to assassinate Biden or Harris, as if he was encouraging it. He then deleted it and said it was a joke. But it's very alarming that kind of rhetoric in public and definitely a sort of a third rail. And I just wonder a lot of focus on the Secret Service and a lot of criticism for what happened the first time around and potentially now, although, they spotted this one.

So, we'll put that on hold for a moment. But yesterday is a really interesting example, because by some measures, the security apparatus that the Secret Service had in place actually worked the way it was supposed to, the advance agents who were there to kind of clear the area and protect the president before he arrives to wherever he's going on the golf course. They perceived the threat. They addressed the threat. They neutralized the threat in that moment. But when we put it in the overall perspective, it's clear that that's not sufficient. Even though it was successful in the moment, they've got to think bigger about creating a broader and more complete perimeter around this president simply because of the vast number of threats he faces. So, they are challenged with a lack of resources. They have been challenged with some questionable leadership in their recent history and it's, you know, asking for more things in Congress in these days of limited budgets is never popular, but if we want our political leaders to be protected, we have got to support institutions like the Secret Service and oversee them to make sure that job gets done correctly.",

And, I mean, you think about, you know, how much the U.S. spent over the so-called global war on terror, on firing Hellfire missiles at farmers planting roadside bombs, and, you know, you can pay $500 and take a shot at, you know, former president, and it's happened twice.

And many mythologists and theologists, they blame human nature, that there is something wrong with human nature, which causes us to be self-destructive. The book \"Nexus\" gives a different answer. The problem is not with our nature, it's with our information. If you give good people bad information, they make bad decisions. They make self-destructive decisions. And we are now seeing it all around us. You know, we have the most sophisticated information technology in history. And at the same time, we are losing the ability to talk with each other, to listen to each other. You know, there is maybe one thing that Democrats and Republicans in the United States can agree on, is that the democratic conversation is breaking down. Everybody accuses the other side, of course, but the basic fact is that this ability which sustains democracy to hold a reasonable conversation, it is breaking down at exactly the same moment that we have supposedly the best information technology in history.",

The truth is a very rare and costly kind of information. The basic function of information, in most cases, is not to reveal the truth. The basic function is to connect, to connect large numbers of people into networks. And the easiest way to connect large numbers of people is not with the truth, it is with fictions and fantasies and mass delusions.",

Sometimes we need rest. We need sleep. The algorithms are tireless. They never need to rest. They are not organic. And what we see in the world now is that they increasingly force us to work according to their pace. There is never any time to rest. The news cycle is always on. The markets are always on. The political game is always on. And if you force an organic entity to be on all the time, to be always active, always excited, it eventually collapses and dies. And, you know, the most misunderstood and abused word in the English language today is the word excited. A lot of people mistake the word excited for happy. Like they meet somebody, they say, oh, I'm so excited to meet you. Or like you publish a new book, oh, this is so exciting. Now, excitement is not always good. Excitement for an organic being, like a human being, means that your nervous system and your brain are very engaged, very active. Now, if you keep an organic system very excited, all the time, it breaks down, collapses, and eventually dies. And this is what happens now to democracies all over the world. This is what is happening to humanity. We are far too excited. We need time to rest. We need to kind of slow down. And because we give increasing control of the world to tireless non-organic algorithms that never need to rest and can just increase the excitement all the time, we are breaking down. We need more (INAUDIBLE) not excitement in politics, in economics, in many fields.",

And you got, again, this wave of the walls of religion in Europe, culminating in the 30 years' war, which was arguably the most destructive war in European history, at least until the two World Wars of the 20th century, for the same reasons that we see the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories and so forth right now. When you make the production of information easier, what you get is not necessarily facts, what you get is a lot of junk information, a lot of fake news and conspiracy theories and things like that. If you want the truth, it's not enough to have a technology of -- to produce information, you need institutions, costly institutions that make the effort to separate reliable information, which is rare, a kind of information from the flood of unreliable information. And in early modern Europe, it took 200 years to create such institutions, like newspapers, like scientific associations. You know, in scientific journals, they don't run after user engagement. The algorithms today on social media are exactly like the first wave of publishers in the 15th and 16th century. In the 16th century, they also ran after user engagement. We want user engagement. And they discovered, in the 16th century, that if you produce a book by Copernicus with all these mathematical calculations about the movement of the planets, nobody buys it. It's boring. But if you publish a witch hunting manual that tells you that there is a worldwide conspiracy of witches led by Satan, and they have orgies, and cannibalism and child sacrifice, and they try to take over the world, and some of your neighbors in the village, they are part of this conspiracy, and these are a few signs how you can identify these witches in your town, in your village and kill them, these were the big best sellers. And this led to this craze of the witch hunt, which was not a medieval phenomenon. In Medieval Europe, witch hunting was a very rare -- I mean, people didn't care so much about witches in Medieval Europe. The witch hunts were a modern phenomenon, ignited in part by the print revolution and by this flood of witch hunting manuals, which were good for user engagement and very bad for everything else.",

You can use a knife to murder somebody or to save their life in surgery. In the 20th century, we saw that electricity and steam power and cars can be used to create totalitarian dictatorships or liberal democracies. It's the same technology. This is also true in the 21st century with A.I. It has enormous positive potential to create the best health care systems in history, to help solve the climate crisis, and it can also lead to the rise of dystopian totalitarian regimes and new empires.
