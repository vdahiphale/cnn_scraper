That big red plume we saw coming up, that was all the result of what the IDF would say was be 20 years of planning that developing the intelligence source, knowing which Wi-Fi systems to tap into, which CCTV cameras in which corner stores unwittingly became eyes and potential ears for the IDF in this multifaceted system, which has only grown, one can say wings, because of the ability and the omnipresence now of drones that now just changed not only the landscape of a battlefield but the landscape of the preparation for that battle. So all of this information the IDF would have had. SCIUTTOintelligence as well, given not just the strike on Nasrallah but other Hezbollah leaders, as well as this enormous attack on pagers that targeted thousands of Hezbollah fighters.

That's certainly not my view. That's not the Israeli view or the American view. I think the broader view is that Iran is weaker and more vulnerable. So I think that says two things. There are two questions that should be on everyone's mind.The first is, to what extent Israel would consider itself expanding this war to Iran in order to neutralize not only their military but also their nascent nuclear threat. And does Israel have that kind of intelligence capabilities? That's an open question. The second is, if you're Iran, the desire to get a nuclear deterrent yourself becomes far more important in this after these attacks. I mean, you remember, the United States has been talking for many years about a complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. Well, they weren't able to accomplish that. In fact, North Korea's strength even got former President Trump to go and talk and negotiate with Kim Jong Un Well, I mean, you know, Iran would be in a radically different position today if they had nukes. I mean, you know, Hussein would have been in very different position if he had nukes, as opposed to just people thought he was getting nukes right? He probably wouldn't be lying dead.

Yesterday, when he came out, he had only said that it was a strike on Hezbollah Central Headquarters, but now confirming that it was indeed to target and successfully kill Hassan Nasrallah. His announcement came moments after Hezbollah itself acknowledged for the first time that Nasrallah was indeed killed in this strike.Hagari also defended the legitimacy of this target, as we are learning of this mounting death toll in Beirut from this strike, as multiple residential buildings were flattened in a strike targeting this underground compounds that the Israeli military said was beneath those buildings. He said that he believes -- Hagari said that he believes this was a legitimate target under international law, and accused Hezbollah of using the civilians in the area as human shields. We have heard this language, of course, before from the Israeli military, not only in this case, in Lebanon, but also multiple times before in Gaza. He also talked about what is going to come next in terms of the possibility of retaliatory attacks on Israel that the Home Front Command guidelines are being changed for central Israel, limiting gatherings to less than 1,000 people in central Israel, telling people to take necessary precautions. But clearly, at this point, we are not seeing any kind of major, major changes in the guidance to civilians here in Israel. And part of that stems from the fact that, as I've been speaking with Israeli officials over the last few hours, it's become very clear that they believe that Hezbollah is currently in disarray, not only because of the death of Hassan Nasrallah, but also because Israel has killed many of most, I should say, the overwhelming majority, of Hezbollah senior commanders over the course of the last week and a half, they believe Hezbollah is in disarray, and critically, that their operational capabilities have also been significantly disabled, as the Israeli military on Monday, for example, carried out strikes on more than 1,600 targets. They believe that those targets successfully took out many of the rocket launchers and weapons depots that could have been used to fire thousands of rockets per day against Israel, the kind of massive retaliatory scenario that Israel has been anticipating, but that has not come to pass. And so now, Israeli officials believe that it is these attacks over the course of the last 10 days that have not only put Hezbollah designated Hezbollah's command and control structure, but also degraded its operational ability to actually carry out these attacks, even if it chose to do so.",

For anyone who has been to the southern suburbs of Dahi, it is absolutely cramped. So you can imagine the consequences there for the civilian population. We have heard from Lebanon's Health Minister telling CNN that they estimate around half a million people have now been internally displaced. And a reminder, of course, of what we've been seeing for a year now is this crossfire on Lebanon, southern border between Israel and Hezbollah, and that has already had already led to the number of civilians fleeing parts of southern Lebanon, around 100,000 forced to flee their homes there now. So as you can imagine, that number has only increased significantly given the strikes that we have been seeing. What is also a huge point of concern and these evacuation orders that we're hearing now from the Israeli military, we're hearing from people on the ground telling us that they are receiving these evacuation orders, but that there isn't enough time to get to safety before the bomb strike.

And in fact, several months ago, I met with a senior adviser to Nasrallah, who told me that one of their worries was that the many Syrians who work in southern Beirut, menial tasks, doormen working in shops, are probably their weak point, that these are people who might be passing information to the Israelis, perhaps for money. And also keep in mind that many Syrians are deeply bitter at the role Hezbollah played during the Syrian Civil War, when Hezbollah deployed thousands of its fighters to Syria and many therefore, for instance, we're seeing that there are celebrations in rebel held areas of Syria when the news of Hassan Nasrallah death came out. And there's another thing the same senior Hezbollah official told me that during that Syrian war, many of the Hezbollah fighters who normally would follow precise instructions on how they use their cell phones, for instance, they got a little sloppy while they were in Syria. They were communicating with their families back in Lebanon. They were sending pictures basically the Israelis they believe were able to start to identify individuals by using the data that they could collect from those phone calls, connecting these people. And therefore, you know, there's a variety of possible holes through which Israel could have gotten to allow them to be able to not just kill Hassan Nasrallah, but so many other senior Hezbollah military commanders.
