The incidents this summer in places like Vegas and Phoenix, in Dallas. Hot places. But also, as we go through this big heatwave, this is really kind of moving east and north to Atlanta. We've seen incidents in Newark.Generally, the policy from airlines is, when the temperature onboard the plane is above 80 degrees inside the passenger cabin, flight crews close the shades, open the vents to try and keep things cool. But the CEO of American Airlines just said that fright crews are having to use those practices more often and longer throughout the year. The problem is the worst when just sitting on the ground waiting for a gate or having pushback from the gate waiting to depart. It's know officially as a tarmac delay. The situation is really pilots sometimes have to turn off the AC to save fuel, and flight attendants have been complaining about this for years. In fact, since 2018, they've gathered more than 4,000 extreme temperature reports. This is where it gets really interesting. The rules are pretty murky. The Department of Transportation says that the temperature onboard the plane has to be comfortable during a tarmac delay. There's no real federal limit here. And so now this is getting really interesting because Congress could make this into a harder regulation. The FAA's fate determined by Congress right now. The House FAA reauthorization bill would order the FAA to review existing standards on air temperatures in places like passenger cabins. So, we could finally see a federal standard for temperatures inside planes. Something flight attendants really want. This has passed the House. Currently stalled out in the Senate. Poppy. Phil.",

And Coco was very clear about what she wanted to do, be world number one.And the more that she gets on these big stages and she talks about who she is and where she comes from, all she's doing is opening doors for everyone else to see why it's so important to let these women have their moment. They celebrated Billie Jean King's 50th anniversary there for what she did for equity in pay. But there is just so much more to do in terms of what they get paid, how they are treated. And they're (INAUDIBLE) but making progress. And I think that this -- I just want to say this one thing. This final, this women's final, is what American tennis needed. I know that people hadn't paid attention too much because we usually look for the big names and they don't necessarily belong to us.

The NCAA has these archaic rules that do not apply to them, but only to other people. And now that these players and these student athletes, rather, are allowed to have the opportunity to speak up and say we deserve more, I have a feeling you'll see more players that are in the ancillary sports, more student athletes in these ancillary sports, like tennis and gymnastics, make more deals. They're only giving it to basketball players now and a lot of football players and a few players here and there, right? There could be some gymnasts here and there. But what she's saying is, if I'm just as good, I should be allowed to take this money the way that these other - the other student athletes are taking money. I think it's ridiculous.
