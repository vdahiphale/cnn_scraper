The head of the Israel Security Agency, the Shin Bet, vowed Sunday to eliminate Hamas all around the world, even if that takes years. Elliott Gotkine joins me now live from London. Elliot, bring us more of the latest about this ground offensive. And is there any indication that Israel is adjusting its tactics in response to warnings from the U.S. that they have to be more careful about the civilian population. ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST. So, the short answer to that is no, I think. But you know, Israel hasn't really finished the job in the north yet. And it's already saying that it's expanding its operations to the south and all parts of the Gaza Strip. And to that end we saw, for example, an air strike as part of these 200 air strikes or so, strikes that we saw over the overnight. Israel saying that among those strikes was a school in the northeastern town of Beit Hanoun from which it came under attack, and also where it discovered more tunnel shafts, explosives and weapons. But yes, as you say, it is expanding now, not just to the southern part of the Gaza Strip, but also to all areas of Gaza, it says. And we spoke with another a spokesperson who says that this fighting won't be over anytime soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Until we get all of the Hamas battalion strongholds, and until we work on them and take them off the battlefield, there will be active fighting. And we said from the beginning to Israeli civilians and to anybody listening in the world that this unfortunately will take time. It won't be a quick and easy operation. It's a difficult operation, in difficult combat terrain where we're fighting a very committed enemy that has no issue with sacrificing civilians for their military cause. We, on the other hand, are trying to limit our force in order to get the job done without exposing the civilians to that danger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because we saw the breakdown of those talks, Israel saying because Hamas didn't abide by its terms of the deal to release those remaining women and children. Hamas now saying that it will not go back to negotiations until such time as there are -- as there is a ceasefire. So, Hamas says no more hostages released until there's a ceasefire. Israel saying that look, these hostages need to be released for us to consider going back into a truce. So, we do have a bit of an impasse.And as the fighting ratchets up, it's going to make it that much harder to get back to the negotiating table for real and to see a truce coming into effect once more. At the very not least, because Israel says it is still far from completing its objectives of destroying Hamas militarily, preventing it from governing the Gaza Strip and getting those 136 remaining hostages that Hamas abducted back into Israel.",

Emphasizing the need for de-escalation and a ceasefire, according to Qatar's state news agency. Qatar has been a key mediator since the war began, and the Prime Minister expressed concern to Blinken that the bombings in Gaza following the humanitarian pause could complicate future mediation efforts and worsen the humanitarian crisis. Blinken just wrapped up his third trip to the region since the start of the war as he looks to discuss Gaza's future with Israel's Arab neighbors. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed since October the 7th. That is, according to the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. That death toll is expected to rise in the coming days, especially with renewed air strikes by Israel. As the IDF says that they're continuing to target Hamas. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more now on the details of how Gaza's hospitals are struggling to help those in need, and how residents are responding to the attacks. And a warning to you that his report does contain disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Look around. This is Gaza City's Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital where the wounded are treated in the open on wooden pallets. The emergency ward is already jammed. The courtyard is full of body bags. Dozens were killed in a series of Israeli strikes Saturday, many more still under the rubble. (EXPLOSION) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Israel claims one of those strikes killed a senior Hamas commander, who helped plan the 7 October attacks. He was, perhaps, one dead among many, many others. This woman lost her daughter and grandchildren, and names them all. And may God judge those watching us die, she cries. It's a similar scene in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza -- more wounded, many of them children. More dead, many of them children. They bombed an entire street, says Saad. He pulled his brother Mohammad (ph) from the rubble. But his brother Mohammad was dead. Says Saad, let me say goodbye to him. My father's been killed, cries this boy after a strike on the Jabalia refugee camp, Sunday. The seven-day truce seems like the distant past. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now the U.S. destroyer downed the first drone while operating in the Southern Red Sea. At that same time, the ship saw a ballistic missile that was launched and landed in the vicinity of a commercial ship that was operating in the area.Now, as the U.S. warship responded to the commercial vessels distress call, it shot down a second drone that was flying towards both those ships. Now this is just the latest in a series of incidents involving U.S. forces, not only in the Red Sea but across the Middle East since the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for attacking Israeli commercial vessels in the Red Sea and said it launched ballistic missiles into Israel itself. The U.S. deployed two carrier strike groups to the region in an effort to deter Iran and its proxy groups from expanding the conflict. But those same ships have constantly come under attack from Iranian backed groups like the Houthis. This raises the question about what more can the Biden administration do to protect American forces deployed to the region? Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Those ships and both the Ford and the Eisenhower groups were put in specific locations as part of the preliminary operations to do exactly what they're doing, intercepting missiles from other countries. But it certainly puts the crews in danger even though they have a great deal of air defense capability on each one of those ships. Multiple capabilities on the Carnegie, for example. So, they are they are -- they can self defend. But what they're also doing is protecting Israel and making sure this doesn't expand. But I think we're going to see additional strikes probably on the Houthi rebel groups and other groups in the near future. And there will be strikes against proportional targets, as we always do to send the message to try and get them to stop. But this is going to be very difficult. Because those Iranian backed rebels will continue to try and harass shipping in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Gulf and in several other areas in in that area. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Is that likely to over shadow events today? DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, certainly a topic of discussion here amongst delegates. And I think what he said was that a phase out, meaning a stopping of fossil fuel usage, would not be having the impact that is suggested. The science says generally otherwise. And certainly, it will apply more pressure on COP president to really put his money where his mouth is when it comes to having concrete steps towards at least phasing down fossil fuel usage in the coming decades to avert the worst of the climate crisis. You know, as one delegate, the head of the Greenpeace delegation, told me a short time ago, she said, it's game on now for the next week or so for the negotiators to try hammer out something that works for the livability of this planet.

And now our sea levels have already risen about three centimeters on average per decade over the last century. So, in the last 100 years we've added 30 centimeters of ocean rise.Now going forward, we could add that same 30 centimeters, but just in the next three decades. So, rising just as much in the next 30 years as we did in the previous 100. That rise can amount to about a foot -- as much as a foot or that 30-centimeter mark. More profound coastal flood events from tides and storm surge could be an issue. Moderate flooding could occur 10 times as often. Major cities are already vulnerable to sea level rise like Boston, New York, Charleston, Miami, New Orleans. They all deal with something called Sunny Day Flooding. Sometimes it doesn't even take a storm anymore to get that water to go inland. Just a regular high tide that's higher now than it was before. Here's a look at another simulation, three degrees sea of warming. Water coming into the National Mall there at DC. Lady Liberty standing around even more water if that warming continues to rise. But like I mentioned, COP is all about action, right? So, if we look at a place like new. York City, if that carbon pollution continues, future generations like Gen Z and Gen -- and Gen Alpha could see six to seven degrees of warming if we keep these emissions as business as usual, as they are right now. But if we cut them, look at how significantly the warming could be cut to. Closer to two degrees of warming, which is much closer to that Paris Climate Agreement goal of 1.5. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
