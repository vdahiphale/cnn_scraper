There is breaking news in presidential politics. Liz Cheney, not a Democrat, says she is voting for the Democrat. Plus, with just six days until debate night, how the two sides are getting ready for what could be a decisive moment in a very close race. Good evening. John Berman here, in for Anderson. Four killed two students, two teachers, nine injured. People gather tonight in Winder, Georgia taking part in a community ritual that no community ever wants, sharing a moment that no one would ever welcome and every piece of footage that is now a regular part of the visual catalogue of American mass killing. Footage, like this of students being marched out of the place where teachers and classmates had been murdered, their hands up as a precaution. Today's mass shooting at Apalachee High School was the 45th this year. CNN's Ryan Young is there for us tonight. Ryan, what are you learning about the investigation tonight?",

You have kids who went to high school for the first time and who are now trying to figure out whether or not they ever want to go to school again. This vigil was full of people who were just letting their hearts pour out because they can't believe this happened in their neighborhood, but just in the last three minutes or so, the FBI has released a statement that basically this shooter has been made aware to them before. There were concerns about him. The family had been moving around. The father had indicated that this kid did not have access to weapons and that local authorities did the most they could before this kid moved and came to this jurisdiction So, they were made aware that something was off about a situation with this 14-year-old. And of course, today was every person's worse nightmare. As this turned out, he was able to make it inside the school with a weapon and opened fire. We've talked to so many students who heard the gunfire. I was actually just talking to a young lady who said she was on the way to the bathroom and apparently, at this school the doors lock behind you when the door opens and closes and she was caught in the hallway. She had to bang on the door to ask to get back inside. Luckily, her teacher recognized her and was able to let her in. I will tell you over and over, we hear from these students that the teachers did the most they could to keep them protected, keep them safe, put them in closets barricade doors, and run. We know two teachers lost their lives. So, I talked to a student today and said they saw the blood trail as a teacher was hit and was trying to get back into one of the classrooms. I want you to take a listen to a student that we just talked to, a ninth grader who said, one of the students who lost her life today was a friend of hers. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Why was he or why were they involved in the school. Why -- what was the motivation for the shooting? And their investigation is going to find that. They're going to comb over everything, all the electronic evidence, all the electronic data. They're going to interview all the family, friends, associates of the shooter. They're going to find out everything that he's been doing in the last few weeks, the last few months. But I also found it interesting that he surrendered where, when there's active shooter training with the FBI and local law enforcement we're trained to get to the scene as quickly as possible. There's an active shooter, the individual is killing individuals, wounding individuals. The fact that the individual surrendered, that the shooter surrendered to the SRO officers. The SRO, their training just as you see on all of the body cams, their training is to get to the scene and immediately neutralize the threat. If that individual still had the weapon in his hands when the SRO arrived at that scene, most likely that SRO would not have given commands. The deadly force policy clearly states that individual is a threat to the community, and he is a threat with the gun in his hand. I still want to find out how the individual, how the SRO bravely was able to subdue the individual, and how they surrendered because if he had his weapon in hand, the SRO probably would have engaged him and would have killed him without any alerts or warnings to stop doing what they're doing.",

But it also tells us something which is, we see this time and time again, people who are emotional in their own personal lives, overwrought by events, driven to actions like this, once they are focused on mission they manage to be able to stay focused on mission pivot quickly. Okay, there's an obstacle here, I'm going to go to the next place, the path of least resistance. I'm going to continue and find victims where I have them. And as we circled to in our last question, while trying to increase lethality as he went to students, to teachers. One of the things we have to look at is, where those teachers who were trying to intervene or just targets of availability that he was willing to surrender when confronted by police, which means he was willing to kill people. That was in his plan, but not necessarily willing to die for it, which is sometimes built into the plan.",

And I think that Maggie is right, that having a Republican with a prominent name stepping forward is an opportunity for people to say it is a permission slip for people to leave the traditional Republican Party as it sits right now and vote otherwise, if that is somebody they want to write in or if they do want to vote for Kamala Harris. You saw little bit of this play out during the primary with the Republicans. There were attempts to try and say, you could have her permission slip to vote outside of Trump. This is something that Republican Party has been tussling with. But those Nikki voters, if you go back to the primary, there were plenty of those that were Independent voters and not traditional Republicans.

      "sentences": "Very tight, John. This battle for 270 electoral votes, take a look at this, you will see how title race this is. Our brand new polls across six states, now, in two of them, we see a slight lead for Kamala Harris. In Wisconsin, 50/44. Michigan, she at about 48/43 advantage there. Those are outside the margin of error. In Arizona, we see the reverse, we see Trump outside the margin of error.And in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, look at that in Pennsylvania, a dead tie. These states have no clear leader, well within the margin of error, and they could determine which candidate gets the 270 electoral votes. Why so tight? Look at this gender gap, John, this is going to be one of the things we watch all the way through November. You see here, where Kamala Harris extends her advantage with female voters and Trump doesn't extend his with male voters in a place like Michigan. She has 16 point advantage. He only has an eight point advantage with male voters. In Wisconsin, 17 percentage point advantage among women for her, nine percentage point advantage for men for him. Those are the states where she's leading. So that's what she's looking to do, extend her advantage with female voters in places that he doesn't overperform with male voters. That's key. And then, take a look at who is left here. I'm surprised by these numbers, but there's a swath of the electorate in these battleground states that is still movable. 16 percent in Pennsylvania, 16 percent in Michigan, down to 12 percent in Georgia. Obviously, most people say their mind is made up. But among these likely voters, there is a chunk of vote here who say they could change their mind, or they're not yet willing yet to commit to a candidate, John.",

So, that's one way that I think they're doing it in a way that we've never seen a national campaign.Can I just say one thing that I think is very interesting in this polling? And that is she's winning on this question about who cares about me? Who cares about you? And you can see that theme now starting to run throughout her campaign. Even in her most recent ad, she opens up with I am focused on you and Donald Trump is not. I mean, January 6 was about Donald Trump, his efforts to try to cheat the election were about Donald Trump, even his failures on COVID were about Donald Trump. So, that's going to be the greatest contrasts and she's winning on that question. And I think she can enter into these other policy issues through that lens that he could care less about you.",

But women are not a monolithic voting bloc, no voting bloc is. So this is one about identifying your persuadable voters.And this is the fun, the science, and the business of politics is to sit here and say, who are your persuadable voters? Where are they? What counties do they sit in? Are these swing counties? How are we going to be able to talk to them? How many times do we need to talk to them? Is that a mailer? Is that a phone call? Is it a text message? Is the TV ad? Is it a message to their phone? What are you doing to talk to them and then getting them on their message to turn out in the fashion they like it.

He has been all over the place in the last two weeks alone and frankly, over the last couple of years.

Sources say he is not changing his prep work from the first debate, meaning there will be no mock debate with a Harris stand-in. Instead, he is having more informal sessions called policy time and quite a bit of it, we understand, this time with ally and former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who debated Harris in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Harris will be debating a stand-in for the former president, someone who not only will be wearing a red tie like the president, but was also the stand-in during Hillary Clinton's mock debate in 2016.I'm joined now by Hillary Clinton's former Campaign Manager, Robby Mook, and Republican Debate Coach Brett O'Donnell. Nice to see you both, gentlemen. Robby, first to you. The Harris campaign agreed to the ABC format even though they say that having muted microphones will fundamentally disadvantage her.

The big question on my mind is what Donald Trump is going to show up to this debate. I think Brett could write on a 3x5 note card in about two minutes, the five things that Donald Trump needs to get across in this debate and the struggle that Trump continues to have is, he can't deliver a coherent message.And so, this debate is an opportunity for him. He's kind of lost the narrative over the last six months and I think it's incumbent upon him to try to get that back.

And so, you after the initial introductions, I think it'll be game on between the two of them. The question mark is, is the debate about personality, or is it about policy? And I think Kamala Harris wants to make it about personality. My guess is she'll be fairly aggressive. She was with Mike Pence in their debate. And if Donald Trump can avoid taking the bait from her and focus on policy and make her defend policies that she has been inconsistent on, and make her own the last four years, then he could have a fairly successful night.",

They get preservation orders, subpoenas, they get the IP address, they trace it to a location in Georgia. They send that to the Atlanta Field Division and to the local authorities in Georgia and say, here is the information on this place where this threat is coming from.The Jackson County, Georgia Sheriff's Department goes to that location and they interview the parents and they say there are guns in the house and we do have a son. They interview the son who is then a 13- year-old in the eighth grade in Jackson County who says that posting wasn't me. I don't care what anybody says, that's not me. The father says there are guns in the house, but he doesn't have access to them because they're under lock and key, and that they're secure. That individual, the 13-year-old they interviewed is the same individual who is charged now in this shooting.
