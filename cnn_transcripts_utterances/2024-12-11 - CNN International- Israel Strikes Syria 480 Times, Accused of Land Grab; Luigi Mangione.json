Two years later, a released prisoner told her he saw him in jail. They beat him so much. His wounded leg was infected. He was in so much pain, she says. There was no medical care in prison. And because of all he was going through, he lost his mind. The prisoner last saw him taken away crying and screaming hysterically. She went from one detention center to the next searching for him, until they broke the news to her in the most cruel of ways. They handed her his belongings and told her to register his death. There are no words to describe how I was feeling when I left, she says. I was holding onto the hope he would be released and our family would be reunited. They didn't even give me his body. This is the last photo she has of Mazen (ph) and his youngest boy, Reith (ph) doesn't remember his dad. Noor (ph) was six and so attached to his father. Every day, he would wait by the door for him to come back. When I would hear someone calling Baba, dad, it was torment for me, Infiras (ph) says. What did these children do to be deprived of their father? She has to be strong for her boys, she says. She is all they have. Her father also disappeared into the black holes of Assad's jails like her husband. Their only crime she says was being from Darayya.",

And also, we don't know how this is all going to play out, particularly on the security front.Looks good so far, but it's premature on the part of countries to suspend reviews of these applications. There are people who now are living in other places that just need, at least for the next few months, to know that they'll be safe.

DAVIES:  Do you think FIFA learned any lessons, Steve, good or bad, from the Qatar experience? STEVE COCKBURN, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S HEAD OF LABOUR RIGHTS AND SPORT:  My fear is that the lesson they've learned from Qatar is that they can ride out the criticism. DAVIES (voice-over):  In Qatar, there was unprecedented levels of construction of stadiums and infrastructure. Migrant workers died in the process. Saudi Arabia meanwhile has pledged to build 11 new purpose-built venues. It was seen as a landmark moment in 2017 when FIFA became the first global sports body to write human rights commitments into the bidding process for its major events. But nearly eight years on, actions are speaking louder than words. LINA AL-HATHLOUL, SAUDI HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  I think no organization -- human rights organization has been consulted. And I will even add on that Saudi Arabia has been forbidding human rights organizations from entering the country since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman came to power. DAVIES (voice-over):  Lina al-Hathloul is a Saudi human rights activist. Hers is one of 11 organizations that recently raised concerns about FIFA's approach to Saudi's World Cup bid. Amnesty International called it an astonishing whitewash, while Human Rights Watch dubbed it an abysmal failure to implement mandatory human rights risk assessments. Their latest report published just last week revealed that in the first six months of this year alone, 887 Bangladeshi workers died in Saudi Arabia. Citing unpublished Bangladesh government data, the report said the majority were recorded as dying of \"natural causes\". There've been questions about how many were caused by working conditions. FIFA's overall assessment of the Saudi bid awarded it a higher score than any other that's gone before, judging the human rights risk to be medium based on an evaluation carried out by a Riyadh-based company.",
