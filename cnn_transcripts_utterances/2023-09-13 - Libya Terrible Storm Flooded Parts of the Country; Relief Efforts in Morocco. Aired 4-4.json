We are high up in the Atlas Mountains, and that has proven to be a real struggle for rescue teams. Many of these villages, many of the hardest hit areas across Morocco are in these remote high up mountainous areas. And that has proven to be a real challenge for rescue teams. Now, just yesterday, we were in another village further up, further south, and this is a village which has proven hugely difficult to reach. We spoke to people there who have been impacted by the earthquake. They told us that the international rescue teams had only just made it to the village yesterday, that they had been spending days digging through the rubble of their collapsed homes with their bare hands. And they have, uh, only just begun to receive that humanitarian aid, have only just begun to see doctors and medical personnel on the ground there. And of course it has been difficult to reach some of these areas. The roads have been blocked in some places because of the debris, because of damage to the roads. But of course there is still a real sense of frustration among these residents in these remote villages, around that delayed response. Many people on our living in temporary shelters, including in this village, you can see at the homes damage behind me, just further down the mountain, many families living tent shelters now.
