There had been some hope that there would be a limitation or perhaps a slowing down of Israel's targeting of the entirety of Lebanon, particularly of course, when it comes to the capital Beirut following those warnings from the Biden Administration. But clearly, that is no longer the case. We have seen Beirut being targeted, once again focused on the heart attack (ph) area of the southern suburb of Dahieh.As you mentioned, the Israeli military has said it was targeting strategic weapons, which they say, was placed in an underground storage facility in this southern suburb. This is a suburb that is known to be a Hezbollah stronghold, but it is also an area that is still densely populated with civilians. It is a very, very crowded neighborhood. There are many residential buildings in this area. And of course, while we know that the Israeli military has issued evacuation orders ahead of a number of its strikes, oftentimes these orders or warnings are not coming with enough time for civilians to actually evacuate to safety. And it is a deeply distressing situation for many civilians in the area, in the capital city, particularly those of course, who have already been displaced as you mentioned. But we're also seeing yet more airstrikes, of course, in Southern Lebanon as well, earlier today, targeting the Nabatieh. The city of Nabatieh where we saw, again, the Israeli military saying that they were targeting Hezbollah assets there. But again, this strike has targeted a municipality building. People were killed, including municipality workers and even the city's mayor, in this airstrike. So clearly, there is still growing concern for civilian safety across the country.",

What police are telling us is that this fuel tanker veered to avoid hitting an obstacle, maybe another truck, and it rolled several times before landing in a ditch and then the fuel started spilling from this tanker.

Nigeria is going through a massive economic crisis, so fuel has become quite expensive after the removal fuel subsidies. So, free fuel is something that many people will rush to.Unfortunately, it then caught on fire and this spread quite quickly. Some video on social media from the scene appeared to show a big fire covering the entire area.

And what we witnessed, besides the unimaginable and unspeakable level of destruction and devastated infrastructure and neighborhoods, the civilians were extremely fatigued. And everyone we met and spoke to assured that there is nothing they can find, but flour to bake some bread or canned food. So, the nutrition level was already in a bad situation back then. Now, it has already exacerbated and become even worse.So, this is also a reminder that humanitarian aid must be allowed to enter Gaza unimpeded and safely considering the fluctuation we have been witnessing for a long time now. On the other side, or on the other hand, hospitals and healthcare workers are over overstretched. Many of the healthcare workers have already been working for over 12 months now non-stop trying to save lives. Our ICRC Field Hospital in Rafah at Southern Gaza Strip continues to deliver urgently needed medical assistance, but it must be also and constantly supplied with the medical supplies, equipment, medicines, and also doctors and nurses, so that it can continue to save lives. The same for all the hospitals and healthcare facilities across the Gaza Strip. HILL:  You discussed that the fluctuations in aid -- the State Department pointing out yesterday that aid is down more than 50 percent going into Gaza.

An increased number of trucks or pellets (ph) that enter Gaza does not change the reality as much. What we need is that we need a constant flow of Gaza.We need humanitarian aid to pour into Gaza Strip non-stop to prevent the humanitarian situation from deteriorating any further, to provide all the essential needs everyone needs in Gaza, including from diapers to cooking utensils, to cooking gas, food, and fresh water, and spare parts for the generators that hospitals are running on. And this has to be constantly maintained in order to prevent, as I mentioned, the humanitarian situation from deteriorating any further, and that people can start to feel an improvement, a simple improvement in their daily life.",

So much so that the federal aviation industry -- Federal Aviation Administration, pardon me, is now opening an audit because they want to know why. A report by a government watchdog found that last year, air traffic services were facing significant staffing challenges.CNN Aviation Correspondent, Pete Muntean joining me now from Washington. So there's this staffing issue. I don't know if that's the sole issue. What more do we know about this investigation?",

This really shows that this industry- wide issue hasn't been linked (ph) just yet. And the FAA says it will audit these 45 busiest airports in the U.S. for the potential of these near collisions on runways, known officially as runway incursions that I've been reporting on since the start of last year. And the headlines have really been emerging coast to coast.The catalyst at New York's JFK in January 2023, an American Airlines flight bound for London taxied in front of a Delta flight that was already accelerating for takeoff. Nobody hurt in that incident, but investigators said the pilots of the American Airlines flight were distracted by paperwork, essentially got lost on the ground. But the list really goes on -- Austin, Boston, Burbank, Reagan National Airport outside D.C. in June. And the most recent incident just last month in Nashville, when the tires of an Alaska Airlines flight that was taking off blew out after the pilots of the flight had to slam on the brakes when a Southwest Airlines flight taxied down in front of them. Now, investigators are still doing interviews in that case. The FAA says its audit will really drill down on the risks at each airport. Remember, might not always be pilots who are entirely at fault here, could be something a bit more structural. And the FAA wants to know if there are gaps in procedures or issues with equipment, or maybe there's a process at the airport that's causing problems. Investigators have not only been concerned about the design of some airports, but also the lack of early warning technology. 35 airports in the U.S. have that technology that alerts air traffic controllers of impending collisions, but there are about 500 airports in the U.S. with commercial service, so a small fraction. The NTSB said that technology saved the day in that JFK near collision at the start of last year. And the NTSB Chair, Jennifer Homendy has told me she wants that technology at more airports. Of course, a lot of eyes on this new audit, Erica, and the FAA says it will be finished sometime next year.",
