This, as we are learning tonight that the company that owns the sub was warned about potentially, quote, catastrophic problems.Plus, Hunter Biden's plea deal. President Biden's son agreeing to plead guilty to federal criminal charges, and was likely avoiding jail time. Republicans are calling it a sweetheart deal, is it? And, turning Russians against Putin's war from a prison cell. Top Putin critic Alexey Navalny back in court, as he launches a new campaign from behind bars. His health is deteriorating though, we have learned by the day. His daughter Dasha is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the clock is ticking. The situation growing more dire at this hour, as rescuers raced to save five people on board that submersible off the coast of Newfoundland. The submersible is named the Titan. It has, we understand, about 34 hours of breathable air left. This is according to the Coast Guard. The vessel was headed nearly 13,000 feet beneath sea level, beneath the ocean surface. It was going to the side of the Titanic wreckage. And it has been missing in the Atlantic since yesterday morning. I'll show you some live pictures here. This is out of Newfoundland, rescue teams are gathering there, the scene on your screen. You are seeing on your screen the search area for the submersible, which is no bigger than a minivan itself, is now larger than the entire state of Connecticut. So you are looking for a proverbial, needle in a haystack. U.S. military now sending in additional resources, including C-17s and C-130s, and flyaway deep ocean salvage systems, as it's called, which can recover large objects up to 60,000 pounds in the ocean. This daring mission could be the deepest rescue mission in history, and there are new signs tonight that it possibly could have been avoided. Industry leaders writing a letter to the CEO of OceanGate, Stockton Rush, back in 2018. They wrote expressing deep concern, and they were writing to Rush, who I just want to emphasize tonight, you know, may be alive right, fighting for that last air. He is on board the missing sub tonight. Well, they wrote him a letter, in which they said that the current experimental approach adopted by OceanGate could result in negative all comes, from minor to catastrophic. Your marketing material advertise that the Titans will meet or exceed safety standards, yet it does not appear that OceanGate has the intention of following class rules. Well, that was nearly five years ago. Here we are, five years later, and that OceanGate sub has been missing, and it may be at the bottom of the oceans shore near the Titanic's wreckage, 12,500 feet underwater, it's it waters that are as deep as the tallest mountain in Japan, Mount Fuji, is tall. Now, at that depth, I just want to emphasize, it's pitch black. There is no light. You can barely even see a hand in front of your own face. The pressure of course is bone crushing, there's no way to get out. We just spoke to a software engineer who not only went on an OceanGate expedition to the Titanic, but did so in the very sub that is now missing beneath the surface tonight. And he described what the conditions are like inside the sub, if it's at the bottom of the ocean right now. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And also with me, Larry Dailey, a Titanic logistics specialist who rode a submarine down to the Titanic 20 years ago on Sunday. Thank you both very much. And obviously, a sobering conversation that we are about to have. David, you spent an enormous amount of time mapping this area underwater. How hard is this rescue mission? DAVID GALLO, OCEANOGRAPHER &amp; EXPLORER: Oh, it's difficult. But, you know, I've got to say, I think compared to some of the big missions where we've had Air France or Malaysian Air, it may seem more manageable. But, the oceans are a tough place to look. Pitch black in- depth, you don't know what the waves and currents are doing, so it can be really tough. But, a lot of this activity and effort going into the search right now, as I called the armada descended. I can't believe that that effort should have been put into what happens in those few hours after that sub doesn't return to the service, that we've known that this might happen for ever, for decades that this was going to happen sometime. But did we prepare for it? No. And there is no protocol, none of that stuff until this is what we end up with, difficult searches for five people and their loved ones in the balance.",
