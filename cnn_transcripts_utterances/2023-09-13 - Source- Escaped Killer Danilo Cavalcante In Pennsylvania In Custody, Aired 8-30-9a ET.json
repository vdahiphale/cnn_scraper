When we found out that Cavalcante had a rifle, obviously, law enforcement really changing their tone, saying that we're going to make this intense push today. But honestly, Phil, this morning, when we saw law enforcement presence returning to this area, it still seemed pretty business as usual. There were some updates -- Rather, there were some activity overnight. But we saw what looked like the regular shifts change at around seven o'clock this morning.We saw them bringing in the armored vehicles again. We saw them bringing in the Pennsylvania State Police horses that we've seen a comb through some of the river beds again. So all of that, frankly, seemed pretty normal of what we've seen in the past 2448 hours, specifically in this part of Chester County. But like I said, the thing that really stood out to me and our crew here on the ground was the more tightly focused aerial support. Because you know, when we've been seeing these choppers, of these fixed wings up, they're making large miles long circles around the area, really think, looking to see if they can spot anything or even just providing some support to troopers on the ground. Take a look here, take a look there. But this has been a very, very focused circle. And I think you can hear some folks honking as this news starts to spread that Danelo Cavalcante has been captured. There's already some support that we're seeing from local folks giving to the troopers who are standing at this intersection at the northeast corner of this perimeter. Phil, Poppy.",

They probably can't do that, because he is currently represented by counsel in his murder case, which is on appeal, so likely, that won't happen.Second thing is, he's in custody, they're going to take him to another facility. I'm about 100 percent Sure, it will not be the one he escaped from but a more secure facility. He was to be transferred from that county facility to a state prison.

And you can see some of those enormous assets as well that have been brought in over the course of this investigation, especially in the past 48 hours when there was this truly intense show of force after that revelation came out that Cavalcante did indeed get his hands on a rifle. But no doubt, like I said before, we've been out here at this particular intersection on the corner of the northeastern most part of the perimeter just as I keep saying as well, a few miles it seems from where helicopters are watching Cavalcante from above.

And these are aerial images of just an enormous SWAT team taking him down, cuffed, putting him into this van, cutting off his shirt as they identify him. With us now, former Supervisory Special Agent, Scott Duffey joins us. Context of this, you did something very similar in 1999, with an escaped killer on the run, what are your thoughts as we wait for this press conference? SCOTT DUFFEY, SUPERVISORY FBI SPECIAL AGENT (RET.): Well, good morning to you both. Thanks for having me on. I'm telling you; I'm feeling the same chills just watching the same thing that everybody's watching, and brings back all of the flood of emotions from 1999. The fact that he's caught, the fact that no, from -- from what I gather, nobody injured, it's fantastic. And to have taken him into custody, it's just there's a lot of emotions. And as -- as I saw that the all the different vehicles kind of rushing out of the scene, trying to head to, to wherever they're going, they're all -- they're all feeling the same thing. That one moment of elation, just bringing calm this to a to a ravaged community. And they're probably all heading to put eyes on him to say this is who we've been looking for, for the last two weeks, so it's a tremendous celebration. Especially with all that being said, the professionals got him. They took the fight to him and they took him into custody without -- it looks like without -- without incident.",

So you know, you have -- you have the -- the neighbors that are locking doors and doing everything shutter in place, but law enforcement is out there, and they are searching day and night, especially with the storms last night.But to be able to zero in on him from what I gather, get the right people in place, the tactical units.

That was a 48 day man hunt through the woods using the same tactics.Many of the same people, it ended in a terrible shootout where the face of this investigation, the voice of this investigation, George Bevins the lieutenant colonel from the State Police said this was the most intense gun battle he had ever seen in his career. Much more recently, in July, we had the case of Michael Burnham, a survivalist, a former Military man who went into the woods, that lasted about 10 days. And you see the marshals -- the U.S. Marshals, they are in the man hunting business. The state Police, they've been through this, as our agent was just describing, you know, multiple times in very similar dynamics. In some way, this is a familiar ending for them. Much better than in the Friend case. And, and similar to the Burnham case, but I think these things have brought them closer together as a team.",

I spoke to actually a gentleman who's a contributor for CNN, he came up to this area because his mother lives right in the search perimeter. And he said, I'm just afraid, because my mom is here, basically by herself. And I want to stay over just to give some sort of peace of mind and comfort. That's really what people have been thinking about. You know, how do I secure my home protect my house?Because as of Monday night, they knew definitively he was here. And of course, it turns out he was here the whole time. Let me actually talk about this, Phil, because we were looking at these pictures right now. And I have a little bit more information as to where exactly this is. Let's be very clear. This capture, it appears happened smack dab in the middle of this most recent perimeter that the Police set up. We're in South Coventry Township, we're on the north eastern portion of this perimeter. And if I'm looking at the map, and we can see where some of these helicopters that are providing this live footage are, it seems that it's just maybe a mile, two miles south of where we are just off of Route 100. And I'm looking at the map here, again, near where these images you're looking at with this intense Police presence. And you can see there is the French Creek that's a location that we've been talking about when we've been asking law enforcement folks where they're searching. And it's also seems to be centered very close to Priser Road, which is also an offshoot of Pottstown Pike, that's route 100 that we're standing on right over here. So all signs here seem to suggest that this capture happened in this perimeter. And that has been one of the main messages that Pennsylvania State Police has been trying to say, from the moment Cavalcante escaped the Longwood Gardens area, we believe he's in this perimeter, we believe we have in contained, we have set up troopers basically every, you know, 200 to 300 feet to try and seal him in, to try and trap him in and then ultimately flush him out. It seems as though at this moment, that is what has happened here. And you can see the law enforcement agents gathering out there on the scene, waiting to see where this vehicle goes next. And I am sure at 9:30 when this Pennsylvania State Police press conference occurs, we'll get more details exactly about exactly how they were able to take Cavalcante into custody here.",
