They're still sweeping through that area in the sort of southwestern region of Russia. Some of it is in the Kursk region, and some of it is in the Belgorod region -- regions of Russia, and they're trying to take some of those small, little villages that are right on the border with Ukraine.Nevertheless, having said that, it appears, though, the Ukrainians have managed to get around 30 kilometers into Russian territory. And some of the numbers, Rahel, that we're getting, and these are numbers that have been confirmed by the Russians, are actually quite staggering. Some of Vladimir Putin's closest advisors have told him that 28 villages at least are now under Ukrainian control, and some 120,000 Russians have had to leave their homes and be evacuated. 180,000 are under evacuation orders, and that is in the Kursk region alone. Again, in the Belgorod region, you also have some people evacuating as well. So, certainly, this seems to be a pretty big problem for the Russians, and a big problem for them to also try and hold up the Ukrainians. And as you can imagine, Rahel, Vladimir Putin absolutely angry at the situation. He had in a meeting with those advisors earlier today, where he lashed out at the Ukrainians, lashed out also at Ukraine's Western allies, saying there will be a response by the Russians. I want to listen into some of the other things that he had to say there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (Interpreted): It appears that the enemy, with the help of the Western masters, is fulfilling their will, and the West is fighting us with the hands of the Ukrainians.

Whether or not that's going to work is still not clear.There are signs that it is already happening, however.

      "sentences": "Well, it's clear that it's getting under Donald Trump's skin. We saw over the weekend that Donald Trump was really amplifying these posts from far-right conspiracists about the crowd at one of her rallies in Detroit being fake. Donald Trump had claimed that it was AI, referring to Artificial Intelligence, to create that crowd. And let's just be very clear, that it's not true. We hundreds of people have gone to this. Many media outlets have witnessed this, including CNN. These crowds are real.But, what I think it comes down to, Rahel, is that crowd size, in particular, is something that Donald Trump cares a lot about. He fixates on it. And it's also been a point of pride for him, the fact that his events draw thousands of people, when over the past several years, Democrats have been unable to really match that, and I think especially when you look at Joe Biden's crowds compared to what Harris is doing now, it just wasn't the same. So, he has been really frustrated by the surge in enthusiasm that Harris is seeing, and that's why he is amplifying these fake posts, trying to claim that they are not real. But, as it -- to speak to the larger agenda and really ways that Donald Trump and his team are trying to go after Harris, it's been difficult. I think it's no secret, and we've been talking about this for some time now that his campaign has struggled with how to define her, both her and her new running mate, Tim Walz. They really have tried to throw a ton of different attacks at her and see what sticks, but haven't found a real playbook yet to go after her. Now, one thing that many people, even we just heard from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy this morning say this, say that he needs to focus more on policy, on the issues where he does better than Democrats, particularly areas like the economy, immigration, crime, all things they want the former President to be focused on. But, he is not a diligent messenger. And as we know, when you go to these rallies, I was at that rally in Montana on Friday, he riffs. He goes off scripts. And when he does that, he tends to attack more personal. He goes after more personal and nasty attacks for his rivals. That's exactly what we're seeing kind of play out now. What is interesting actually, though, I think, is if you look at how they're deploying J.D. Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, last week in the aftermath of Harris announcing Walz as her Vice Presidential pick, it wasn't Trump who was out there on the campaign trail, following them around and trying to draw the contrast between the two campaigns. It was J.D. Vance who was going to the same cities as them, and he has been really the one now tasked with focusing on the policy and being that messenger for the Trump campaign, because they know that he is more diligent in that messaging than Donald Trump, who, as we know, has been more scatter shot when it comes to trying to do that.",

I think a lot of people who I talked to, particularly Republicans in Congress, people close to the former President, even sometimes people on his campaign will admit that this is not what they want him to be doing. [11And I think what's interesting is that a lot of Republicans are telling him the same thing, which is, there are areas to undermine her. Her policies are not the policies that Republicans want, and they think they actually have a very strong messaging case to make against Kamala Harris. The problem is, is Donald Trump actually making it? And I think, as we've seen, he is not. I mean, he does talk about policy in some of his rally speeches that there is no question he does that, but it's not a focused messaging -- message delivery, I should say, that he does tend, when people do get under his skin, to make his attacks more personal, more personality driven, and that's exactly the opposite of what his team has been wanting him to do. And it's been interesting, because I do think -- I mean, Donald Trump has never been a disciplined messenger. It wasn't like he was a disciplined messenger when it was Joe Biden, who he was facing off against, but I think because Harris has had so much enthusiasm and enthusiasm that they didn't necessarily expect her to sustain for this long of a time, that's why you're seeing him kind of do more of this and more acting out and really reverting back to his 2016 playbook and lob the same attacks against her like he did against Hillary Clinton back then.

Democratic Strategist Julie Roginsky, and Republican Strategist Evan Siegfried. Good to see you both. He is the author of \"GOP GPS\". Evan, let me start with you. Our reporters, they have both sort of touched on how the Harris campaign is trying to keep this momentum going. If you were advising the Trump campaign, however, how do they respond to this? What should they be doing differently, because Republicans don't appear to be too enthused with how the campaign is responding? EVAN SIEGFRIED, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, &amp; AUTHOR, \"GOP GPS\": I think they need to keep Donald Trump off the campaign trail, first of all, because the more he goes on the campaign trail and does those riffs, he reminds everyone of the chaos goblin he was as President that everybody got tired of and voted him out because of. I think they also need to start highlighting how Kamala Harris, with what little policy she has put out so far, she flip-flops on a lot of these issues. She was for fracking -- or she was against fracking, and now she is for it. She was against taxes on tips, and now she is for it. And there are many different areas in which you can go out and say she has been bad, and they just aren't doing that. Their campaign message is being overshadowed by the candidate himself, with his crazy conspiracy theories about AI-generated crowds, about Kamala Harris not being black or choosing to be only a few years ago. It doesn't work and it doesn't help. He thinks he is running against Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it's a completely different situation in that the crowd sizes are much different. Hillary Clinton's crowds, you can see a tumbleweed going through. There is a massive crowd every rally for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.",

From your vantage point, what voters does she appear to be picking up?JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, &amp; COFOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES: Well, I think she is bringing together the Democratic coalition that Joe Biden so effectively coalesced, for lack of a better word, back in 2020. Look, Evan makes a very good point, which is, in 2016, Donald Trump was a show man, but he was kind of an unknown quantity. And so, people took a chance on him because they knew Hillary Clinton. They weren't particularly enthusiastic about her, and they said, well, what the hell? We'll try it with Donald Trump to see how it goes. Since then, the experiment has failed. It failed in the midterms in 2018 and it failed certainly in the 2020 election, and it failed again in the midterms in 2022. And for some reason, Republicans are so enthralled to him, and I think terrified of going against him and against the MAGA base, that they're giving him another shot again this year. It won't work. And the reason it won't work is because voters have repeatedly said in election after election after election since 2016 that they don't want to follow Donald Trump off the cliff. And as Evan pointed out, I think, incredibly presciently, if he continues to go out there, and of course, he will, because he is an egomaniac, he will not stay home and let Kamala Harris have access to all the media for herself, they're going to see the unhinged behavior that they have rejected time and time and time again. And so, because of that, you see Kamala Harris, those numbers going up, and you see her coalescing the people who may not have been that enthusiastic about Biden, but are basically coming home to the Democratic Party now.",

He is trying to find that message that works. But, his messaging, in his mind, should be attacking conspiracy theories because that's what won him the presidency in 2016. Again, this is eight years later, and Americans care more about the border, cost of living, which is related to inflation, and who is going to do the better job for them and protect them, both economically and physically in the next four years. And Donald Trump isn't speaking to that. It's much more grievance-laden. It's much more of the Donald Trump we got to know as President.

What happens with wind and wildfires is it will take the embers of the fire and then spread them faster. They'll flow into the wind into a new fresh spot, and a fire -- a new fire can start there. So, that's really the problem that they're dealing with here in Greece.Now, we do have an extreme hazard for wildfires, or that fire risk for parts of Greece, as we go through the day today. It comes down a little bit to a very high level going into tomorrow because those winds do start to ease back a little bit. That's been their biggest contender than the last couple of days. And you can see there where the winds try to die off in parts of Athens going into tomorrow, but then they do pick back up later in the week. So, something that we'll have to watch through the next couple of days. What the winds will also do is drag the smoke across the Mediterranean. You can see the smoke from satellites in space cutting across the sea there. And again, that would also be problems for air quality, smoke inhalation, things that we need to keep in mind. And you can see how heavy this smoke has been around some of the iconic ancient ruins there in Athens. So, something to keep in mind. It's not just Athens. We're also been looking at some hot spots for wildfires across a lot of Europe and it's because we're dealing with some drought conditions. Drought conditions are either a warning or a high alert for parts of Italy, again, parts of Greece, going into Turkey. And when you have drought conditions, that is the dry fuels on the ground really dry ground that can spark with that fire, it's the food that the fire needs. On top of this, we also have heat alerts in place. You can see some of the medium and high in the oranges and the reds there. What happens with the heat is the heat will dry out those fuels even more, making them even more of a super fuel for some of these fires. So, things to watch in the coming days. Again, thankfully, maybe a little bit of a break with the wind tomorrow, but it comes back later in the week. Rahel.",

The Republican presidential nominee insists that nobody attended Kamala Harris' Michigan rally last week.(VIDEO PLAYING) As you can see, thousands of people there packed in airport hangar near Detroit to see the Vice President at her rally. But, Trump demands that she should be, quote, \"disqualified from the race\" for using what he calls a fake crowd picture. Trump also posted these photos on his Truth Social platform, alleging that Harris' team used artificial intelligence. Let's bring in CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, tracking the race to the White House. He joins us live from Los Angeles. Donie, always good to see you. So first, if you might just fact track that claim that Harris used -- the campaign use AI to inflate her crowd size despite the video we just watched. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. I mean, obviously, Rahel, it is absurd. It's false. But, I really think we're seeing -- we've talked for a long time over the past year or two about how artificial intelligence could be used to sow confusion or chaos in this election campaign. And normally, when people have thought about how AI could be used in a way to misinform people, it's been like, oh, somebody will create a fake tape or a fake image. Academics that have been studying this for a long time have come up with something called a liar's dividend, which means even -- you don't even need to create fake AI content. Just the idea that it's out there, the idea that it's possible, allows for people who want to misinform people to claim that real things haven't happened, and that's exactly what we're seeing here with Trump now. He is using this idea. And by the way. I mean, it is absurd, because there is so many cameras, of course, at these rallies, so much media there. It's so easy to debunk this stuff as being false. But again, it's just planting that seed of doubt in people's minds, and really quite a dystopian. It's like a black mirror episode, using just the idea that this technology is out there to now question what is actually happening.",

Trump Media &amp; Technology Group lost more than $16 million last quarter, and its revenue remains low, according to Friday's earnings report. The loss has come as Trump Media plans to launch its new streaming service Truth+.Let's bring in Matt Egan now, who joins us live from New York. So, Matt, where do things stand now? I mean, you've been reporting on some wild swings for this company. What about right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, it is just remarkable to see a company valued in the billions of dollars, despite generating less than a million dollars in revenue. It's a really bizarre situation, made even weirder by the fact that the majority owner, of course, is the former and potentially future President the United States. And Trump Media, on Friday after the closing bell, revealing that they generated just $837,000 in revenue. Again, thousand dollars (ph) in revenue. That is down 30 percent year-over-year. The losses are piling up. They posted a loss of $16.4 million. The good news is, that's actually an improvement from recent quarters. But, all of this is weighing on the share price, which you can see from that chart, it is well off the spike in late March as the company went public.And what's notable here is that over the last three weeks, since Vice President Kamala Harris became the de facto nominee for the Democrats, this company has lost a quarter of its value. Now, remember, Trump Media, it's not trading on fundamentals. It's all about hype and momentum. It's really become a way for traders to bet on whether or not former President Trump is going to be back in the White House, making Truth Social the presidential platform for communications. But, this loss, this sell-off today and in recent weeks has wiped out a chunk from the former President's net worth. As recently as three months ago, his shares in this company were valued at over $6 billion, today, just about $3 billion. So, he has lost half of the value of that stake. And as we saw, the stock is down another four percent as we speak today. Rahel.",

It is a new streaming platform available on Truth Social, on Android, iOS and the web. They say they're focusing on content that includes news, Christian programming and family programming. They say that they also really want to pay particular attention to content that is, quote, \"neglected\" by big corporations or at risk of cancellation. They are trying to play upon some of the success we have seen from Fox News and other conservative outlets on the streaming front. And what's also interesting here is they're building their own custom technology here to deliver the streaming content to consumers, and they say that this makes them uncancellable by Big Tech.Of course, Rahel, you and I know that streaming is not an easy business to get into right now. I mean, anecdotally, I don't know about you, but I've talked a lot of people who are trying to cut down on the number of streaming platforms that they subscribed to, especially as they deal with the high cost of living. And this is a very cost-intensive business. Even some of the biggest media companies on the planet are struggling to make money here. So, this won't be easy.",
