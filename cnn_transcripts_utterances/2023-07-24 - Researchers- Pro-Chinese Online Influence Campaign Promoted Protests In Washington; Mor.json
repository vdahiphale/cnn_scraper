In this case this happened a few months before the mid-terms. We don't really have the ability to connect the dots between what these protesters were doing and the U.S. election. However, it's really interesting that you see Chinese operatives sort of adopting that we used to consider, the Russian playbook. The 2016 you had all these Facebook and Twitter post kind of trying to play both side of the debate, fanning American divisions. That's exactly what's going on here in the research. There were two protests last year. They're very obscure protest. Right? They didn't get much attendance. But this Chinese company is linked to them, and there were protests supposedly against the U.S. restrictions on the goods coming from Xinjiang, where the U.S. government has accused the Chinese government of atrocities. That was the main protest event. Again, very sparsely attended. Freelancers here in the Washington DC area who were hired unwittingly to attend these protests. They didn't know exactly what was going on with them. But speaks to sort of the intent of some of these actors in China and elsewhere to influence discourse, to kind of fan the flames. And it could be sometime to look out for as we move into election in the next year -- Boris.",

It's just like there's no escaping it. And this in mind, the first time Las Vegas hit 100 degrees this year, was the last day of June, which was the latest on record that it ever did that. But since then, the average temperature has been about 110 degrees and July's on its way to be a record month.But the heat is not just a problem here, is across the entire West. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELAM (voice-over): A heat wave bearing down across the globe with little relief in sight. Millions of Americans are under heat alerts. And now wildfires are ablaze creating more challenges for some communities in the Pacific Northwest. Residents in parts of Maricopa County, in Arizona, were told by local authorities to evacuate as firefighters battled the Diamond fire while facing scorching hot temperatures. MAYOR KATE GALLEGO, (D) PHOENIX: The heat has been unrelenting in our community. ELAM (voice-over): In Phoenix, Sunday marked 24 consecutive days of at least 110 temperatures. And in Las Vegas, the city has seen 10 consecutive days of temperatures at or above 110 degrees. Tying the longest streak of days with those high temperatures. In parts of Arizona that heat is so brutal emergency rooms are filling up with people being treated for heat related illnesses. Dr. Frank LoVecchio shows us the ice bud used to treat some of the worst patients. DR. FRANK LOVECCHIO, ER PHYSICIAN, VALLEYWISE HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER: We try for a little bit of ice, you know, on here, on the bottom. Get a little bit on the bottom. And then they get their body on here, we like to throw away all above them. So what's going to happen then is the only showing is going to be their head. OK, that in an ideal world. We also like to throw water on there. This has been shown to drop their temperature a degree almost every five minutes if done properly. ELAM (voice-over): It's not just heat stroke. The director of the Arizona burn center says people are getting burned on the pavement. Accounting for the half the patients in the Valleywise ICU. DR. KEVIN FOSTER, ARIZONA BURN CENTER DIRECTOR, VALLEYWISE HEALTH: The pavement is so hot that all it takes is a fraction of a second to get a pretty burn. And to lay on a pavement or a hot surface for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 1/2 an hour, and hour, that's full fitness burn, the skin is completely destroyed.

And as these extremes are getting more and more extreme each year from the heat and the cold.

Researchers looked at data from Florida and Ohio. They found that the gap in excess deaths grew after COVID vaccines became widely available to Americans. Researchers say, it suggests the political attitudes towards vaccines play a role in the severity and trajectory of the pandemic. In Iran, the country's hardline rulers had banned a film festival after a promotional poster and actress not wearing a hijab -- the head cover worn by many Muslim women. State-run media say Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance deemed that poster inappropriate. You may remember the mass protests across Iran last year when an Iranian woman burn hijabs, cut their hair to protest the mandatory dress code and the death of a woman who was arrested simply for not wearing one. And in Montana, a woman was found dead following an apparent bear encounter. Wildlife officials say that grizzly bear tracks were found near the victim's body in the Custer Gallatin National Forest.
