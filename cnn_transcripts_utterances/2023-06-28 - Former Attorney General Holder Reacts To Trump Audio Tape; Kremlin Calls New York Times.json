I could have declassified it, this is still a secret.But last night speaking to Semafor and ABC News, he said he wasn't really showing his guests anything secret at all. This is what he said last night: \"I would say it was bravado, if you want to know the truth, it was bravado. I was talking and just holding up papers and talking about them, but I had no documents. I didn't have any documents.\" As for his use of the word plans during the Fox interview earlier yesterday, he said: \"Did I use the word plans? What I'm referring to is magazines, newspapers, plans and buildings. I had plans of buildings, you know, building plans. I had plans of a golf course.\" So to believe the former president, he was citing a classified document to bolster his argument about Iran, while pointing to plans for the four or five doglegged seventeen or something. If that were true, why did he say these are the papers, which certainly suggests the people with him were in a position to see the papers in question. Also, one of the people had every reason to pay close attention, a ghostwriter and a publisher working on the memoir of former chief-of- staff, Mark Meadows, who wrote this apparently about the moment in Mark Meadows' book: \"The president recalls a four-page report typed up by Mark Milley himself. It contained the general's own plan to attack Iran, deploying massive numbers of troops, something he urged President Trump to do more than once during his presidency.\" If the former president had just been idly waving a stack of papers around, why would the ghost writers specify that it was a four-page report? Or was the ghost writer also just lying? Excuse me, full of bravado himself. Last night on the program, former FBI deputy director, Andrew McCabe said he was pretty sure the special counsel would have already spoken to the people in the room. And it's hard not to imagine he asked them what they were shown and whether it had classified markings. Joining us is Eric Holder who served as attorney general during the Obama administration.

But here's the deal: The fact that it was included in the indictment that was returned in Florida is an indication I think that the Justice Department is confident that it is going to be able to prove that in fact, those documents that he had in his hands were in fact, what he said they were, some kind of classified plan about attacking Iran.",

It makes us stronger and more competitive around the world. And so I'm worried that that's where the Supreme Court might actually go. My hope is that they will follow precedent.

That's a topic, Tom Friedman addresses in his latest \"New York Times\" column: What Happens to Putin Now? In it, he writes: \"In the near term, though, if Putin is ousted, we could well end up with someone worse.\" Tom Friedman joins me now. He is the author of a number of best- selling books, including \"The World is Flat: A Brief History of the 21st Century.\" So, Tom, there are -- I don't even know where to begin with what happened this weekend and there are so many kinds of unanswered questions that we still don't know. I mean, does this make sense to you what we do know? Does it -- I don't understand what Yevgeny Prigozhin was thinking about? What awaited him in Moscow unless he thought he had some sort of inside deal with somebody there who he thought my back him. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK POST\": Well, Anderson, I think you hit on really the right issue. You know, between Friday when they set out from their base until Saturday when he turned around, they traveled 400 miles, that Wagner Group. During that travel, they shot down six Russian Air Force planes, including one highly sophisticated command and control plane. So what we can take from that, I think, Anderson is that some faction of the Russian military was clearly supporting him. What happened after that, we're going to just keep peeling this onion every day, because he may have felt he lost that faction, putting may have turned somebody around. He clearly felt his life -- Prigozhin's life and the life of his men might be in danger and so he took the plea bargain offered by the president of Belarus. But I think that the central point is, there was a faction in the Russian military, that had to be very high level that was supporting this mutiny and for Putin, that has to be very disturbing.",

But he has tentatively set this January trial date and they're working toward that goal.

She added new claims, alleging that he further defamed her when he participated in the CNN Town Hall and in other forums, continued to deny that he had sexually assaulted her and assailed her character.So when she filed that amended complaint, he had to file an answer to those new allegations. And it also gave an opportunity to assert any counterclaims, and that's what he did. Now, given that a jury credited her testimony that he sexually assaulted her in that Bergdorf Goodman dressing room, there's very little leeway for him to argue that she said something false about that attack. So, what the counterclaim asserts is it's trying to split hairs between what the jury found he did affirmatively, that he actually sexually assaulted her and penetrated her essentially with his fingers, but rather not his genitals, and her saying -- continuing to assert on CNN after the verdict that he had raped her. That's the very fine needle that his lawyers are asserting is the basis for this counterclaim of defamation. I don't see it having any merit. I don't see the judge is going to have much patience for it at all. But this may be an attempt to sort of muddy the issues, perhaps delay the trial, appeal to a political base, and perhaps just sort of confuse the issues when and if these new allegations actually go to trial.",
