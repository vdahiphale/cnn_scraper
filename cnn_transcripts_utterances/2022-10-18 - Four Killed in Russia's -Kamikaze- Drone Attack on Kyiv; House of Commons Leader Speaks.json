And bye-bye BTS but just for now, why they're taking a break and when we can expect them to return to the stage. We begin this hour in Ukraine where Russia is increasing its use of deadly and destructive kamikaze drones against civilian targets across the country. Well, that blast rocking Kyiv on Monday, was just one of several strikes in the capital that left at least four people dead. Chaos and fear on the streets of Kyiv as residents ran for shelter. Russia's attacks appear to be part of a wider assault that took aim at critical infrastructure. But drone attacks also reported in the south and east of Ukraine. The mayor of the port city of Mykolaiv says tanks with sunflower oil were hits sparking fire at one of the terminals. Ukraine's president says forces were able to shoot down dozens of drones across the country, but says more international help is urgently needed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): In just 12 hours from 9 p.m. Sunday 37 Iranian Shaheds and several cruise missiles were destroyed. The world can and must stop this terror. When we talk about Ukraine's need for air and missile defense, we are talking about real lives that are being taken by terrorists. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And ultimately, the MPs did not support her. They supported Rishi Sunak, it was the membership that is far more conservative, far more concerned with her free market agenda, deregulation and ultimately the way in which they hoped she would continue the Brexit agenda of Boris Johnson.And now you have at best a caregiver government in which Jeremy Hunt who did run in that election race that was eliminated in the first round with the lowest score of any of the candidates. And you now have with the incorporation of Jeremy Hunt, seven out of the eight candidates that run in that election are either the Prime Minister Truss itself, or folks that that ran against her. And the only person that's on the outside here is Rishi Sunak. So, the fact that she's been able, at the moment, at least to hold on to that position simply has to do with the fact that the Conservative Party is trying to calculate whether or not it can afford a new leadership appointment before they have to face the general public and what that reaction will be. And those of the debates and discussions that are going on in the scenes behind this. And for this moment, they don't want Liz Truss out there in the public eye.

But one could argue that over the span of the past six years, things haven't been going well in the United Kingdom.They haven't. You're absolutely right. And for me, I'm absolutely convinced at the moment. Boris Johnson won that election in 2019. And ultimately did it on a single issue. A highly emotional issue that was simply around Brexit. The reality post Brexit now is that the government has to actually deal with concrete, economic, global problems. And what we're seeing is that they're not equipped to do that. Liz Truss is the fourth Prime Minister since 2016. But given the fact that the major challenges today are economic challenges, and that this is the fourth chancellor in the guise of Jeremy Hunt, just since the summertime shows you the extent to which this party is ultimately no longer able to come up with solutions and policies that can address these particular questions that they have that majority that Boris Johnson delivered. And for the moment, at least, they're able to essentially map out their future, take that time to calculate whether or not there is somebody there in the wings that can help restore their reputation after the damage done by Boris Johnson and now by Liz Truss. And help them rebuild in the two-year period leading up to that 2024 scheduled general election, or whether ultimately it will be time for them to face the registered voters in the U.K. and for them to decide, finally, who the new prime minister should be.

Not just for drones systems which the Iranians have a plethora of drones that they can use, both ones with visual cues and with loitering capability and with the ability to seek out and research targets. But these are especially particular because they hit specific targets. They were designed by Iran with about 120 pounds or 200 kilogram pound with a payload. And it is actually smaller than what you would see drop from an aircraft. The smallest possible bomb that struck from an aircraft. But it is geared towards hitting a point target. A stationary target from a long distance away. So what Russia is doing by buying these drones is basically admitting that they are out of precision weapons. They are running low of precision weapons. Russia has turned into somewhat of a hollow army. They came into this with very poor operational objectives that they could not meet.

JEFF BENJAMIN, K-POP COLUMNIST: It's a tough question because what BTS has done in so many ways is just so unprecedented for a Korean musician, for, to be honest, a lot of musicians in the general pop sphere at large, you know. So was it inevitable? It's definitely an important cultural thing. It's something the BTS always shared that they would indeed serve one day.
