Up until this point, it appears that Germany is kind of unwilling to do that unless it sees the U.S. give these Abrams tanks. The U.S. has said it's not going to give those tanks, but for very different reasons to Germany's reasons, purely for logistical reasons. They run on jet fuel, not diesel, and they would be incredibly difficult for Ukraine to maintain and operate on the battlefield.Basically, what Zelenskyy says he needs are three things -- tanks, long-range artillery, F-16s. No indications that he will be getting long-range artillery or F-16s. He is going to be getting a lot of equipment, some $2 billion worth of strikers, various infantry, fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, MRAPs, and things such as ammunition, munitions for aerial defenses, things that they really need. But everyone right now is waiting to see what will happen in terms of these tanks that they so desperately covet and which Great Britain came forward and said, listen, we're going to give these Challenger 2 tanks, because the reason that Germany has given up to this point in terms of not wanting to provide tanks is they don't want to risk escalating, they don't want to risk facing the wrath of President Putin. And obviously having the U.K. step up and fill the void in the first place allows them some kind of diplomatic cover. So waiting to see where Germany will ultimately fall on this issue, Don.",
