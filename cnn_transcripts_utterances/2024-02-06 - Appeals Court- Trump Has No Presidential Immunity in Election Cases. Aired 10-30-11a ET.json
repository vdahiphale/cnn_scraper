      "sentences": "Special Counsel Jack Smith first went to the Supreme Court back in December, urging the justices to take it up before the D.C. Circuit. He made a pretty compelling case about the Supreme Court's assessment being necessary here. This is -- was the kind of dispute that brought us all to the apex of presidential powers and -- or the apex of whether a president is going to try to be above the law. And we now have a series of judges who said no, the president is not above the law in this kind of situation. And there just might be some interest among some of the justices to say, we need to have the last word here.I think it could be close. They only need four votes, as Ellie just said, to grant the case, but there'll probably be enough momentum to say there's no reason to take it up now because, you know, we -- it's not like we have another case coming up like that right now. You know, let it go to trial. Let that proceed, but I would have to say, Sara and folks, I'm just a little bit split given the importance of the question overall and how Jack Smith himself had set it up originally. The justices could take a pass here. There'll be a lot of incentive for them to take a pass given everything else that they are deciding right now especially in the Trump realm. But they -- it just takes four. It just takes four. SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Joan Biskupic is split, ladies and gentlemen. We will be watching to see what happens.

      "sentences": "Yes, Joan makes such a good point. You know, when Joan Biskupic is split, you know, it's complicated. But Joan makes a great point that, you know, back a couple months ago, the special counsel thought it was imperative that the Supreme Court step in, resolve this question.But that was as much about the constitutional question as it was about really timing. Like, that was why Jack Smith wanted to go right to the Supreme Court. Don't let the Trump team go through all of these steps, drag this out because that would raise the possibility that this might not go to trial before the November 2024 election. So, he was really going to the Supreme Court just to resolve the issue once and for all. Now, it is likely that the Trump team will appeal this to the Supreme Court, not only to exercise their rights, but also to draw this out. But again, I've talked to sources close to the Trump team, and they know that this, this is not their strongest argument nor is it their strongest case. I mean, they knew that they were likely going to lose after the appellate arguments, and they would be surprised if the Supreme Court takes up this issue, especially in the same week that the justices are already hearing a different case on Trump's ballot eligibility. A much stronger argument for the former president, one that many legal experts expect that he will likely prevail on. So, it's only be a surprise, and the special counsel's office right now they are declining to comment on any of this. But I think it -- I can say in a report that it would be a surprise to the Trump team if the Supreme Court agreed to also take up this question of immunity. I mean, we'll see what they do. We absolutely expect the Trump team will appeal, but I think it would be a surprise. And the appeals court has really set up a tight turnaround to send this whole case back down to the trial court where it could then proceed to a trial before the November 2024 election, which is, of course, what the special counsel's office has been advocating for.",

In 2020, Donald Trump got just over five percent, I think it's 5.3 percent of the vote in D.C., meaning about 95 percent of D.C. residents voted against Donald Trump.So, he's going to have a tough road in front of that jury. And I have to add this, he better get his act together behaviorwise in front of a jury, right? Look at two weeks ago when it went in front of the E. Jean Carroll jury, he's stomping out of the courtroom. He's muttering under his breath. The judge is condemning him in front of the jury. I mean, you try that in front of a criminal jury and the consequences are going to be much worse than a huge civil verdict. But look, it's a tough jury pool for Donald Trump. No question about it.

There are checks and balances for behavior that was criminal or alleged criminal during the term of office. That's a very huge consideration. There's another part.

The last of which involved some of the same underlying facts, which led up to January 6th and on January 6th.The legal team tried to make the claim that, hold on, we've got double jeopardy here. We've already been through a trial as it relates to Donald Trump and the conduct occurring on or before and on the actual day of January 6th. And for that reason, you can't try us again. That's the principle. This court rejected that. They said, first of all, an impeachment is not criminal. It is a political vehicle. It has always been considered as such, and it will remain as such. Secondly, even if we were to assume this actually is a criminal proceeding, which it is not, at the impeachment level, there's a thing called the Blockburger test. That's a fancy way of saying, we're going to compare and contrast the crime that you were alleged to have committed in the criminal court and one in the other context. Are the elements that you're required to prove the case the same? Are there different things we have to prove? If there are different things or additional charges or additional elements, they're not the same case. Therefore, even if an impeachment were criminal, which it is not, they are comparatively different and there is not a double jeopardy attachment. This undermines fatally any argument that suggests that, hold on, would have you doing the political context will essentially absolve you and immunize you in the criminal courts as well. That's a very important notion in a world where we now live in, Sara, where we've got multiple impeachments over the course of years. But fundamentally, this is a huge decision. The timeline they have given him to appeal, February 12th, a very quick turnaround. If the Supreme Court opts not to take up this case. If he ultimately chooses not to appeal the case, it goes right back to the judge who has made it very clear she wants this case to go smoothly and quickly, and has set a very aggressive calendar to do such that is in line, frankly, with other cases involving January 6th. Fundamentally, Jack Smith, only charged four different counts against his former president. It was streamlined intentionally. Will it make a difference now, the Supreme Court may opt to weigh in?
