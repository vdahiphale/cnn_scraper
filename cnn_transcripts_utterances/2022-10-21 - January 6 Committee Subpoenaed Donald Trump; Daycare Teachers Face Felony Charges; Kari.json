But we are going to keep the conversation going with our panelists from all across the political spectrum. And they're on the screen right now.And here's a really provocative question that we've been or going to tackle tonight. Here it is. So, what if the 2022 midterms are a repeat of 2020? I know it sounds like a very interesting proposition, maybe a scary one for a lot of people, but what if election deniers are refusing to accept the results? I'm not saying January 6th happens again, but what might be the consequences of that? I'll talk to master pollster, because he's really scared to death that that's exactly what will happen. And plus, the January 6th committee subpoenas the former president. Well, it's out there now, but what will come next? Is there enough time to really do anything about it if he were to thumb his nose at the whole thing. And the story that people are talking about tonight, parents around the country, have you seen this? Former daycare workers are facing felony child abuse charges after a viral video showing an adult wearing a scream style mask yelling in little kid's faces and chasing them around the room. It's also videotaped, by the way, and you have frightened children who are screaming and who are crying, and it's frankly awful and excusable. But could somebody really go to prison for this? We had a lot to talk about tonight here on the show. I'll kick it off with the midterms. There are now 18 days away. I want to bring in pollster extraordinaire Frank Luntz. Frank, it's nice to see you. Happy Friday to you. Although I wonder, you know, I've been reading a lot of your work and following along. And I have to tell you, you've been very scared at the proposition that all the conversations around election deniers aren't just sort of this esoteric thing about our democracy being in peril. You think past might be the immediate prologue. Tell me what your thoughts are. FRANK LUNTZ, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER:  It's possible, and this is based on focus groups and surveys that we've been doing over the past couple months, and the intensity of the anger of the rejection of our political process has actually grown over the last two months, and we know the gentleman who's responsible for it. One of the challenges right now is to ensure that our democratic process is respected, appreciated, and most importantly, trusted. And what we are finding right now is the same kind of fear that people had the same kind of anxiety about the electoral -- electoral process that happened in 2020 in the weeks leading up to it is happening right now again, in 2022. And while there's no presidential race at stake, there are Senate races, governance races, secretary of state races, attorney general's races in the local states that can make a meaningful, measurable impact. And whether or not people trust our election system. Now make no mistake, a lower percentage of Americans trust our institutions. And that's everything from education and hospitals to Congress, the Senate, Supreme Court. It's not just political. It's all of our institutions. And if that trust then is lack of trust is passed down to our -- to our electoral system, God help us. What will bring us together? What will get us to work together side by side?",

Your country matters more than anything else. And I want to make that point for your panelists, because I know you put on Republicans and Democrats, but the truth is on the new CNN we're more than just partisans. I think we are. We're about the country. We're about the future. We're about democracy and economic freedom, and that requires us to call out those on the right, Donald Trump, and frankly, those on the left, Stacey Abrams from four years ago. We need to call out those who simply refuse to accept the election returns because that is an asset that eats away at our confidence at our country and our future.",

I doubt this election cycle for the same reasons maybe that people doubted 2016 different reasons. But the truth of the matter is, how do I have confidence if everyone wanted to doubt the integrity of that election and the absence of interference? And then now in 2020, no one says boo in that same category. Can you respond how you view that level of, or that thought process, that these are somehow equivalent?",

That's different than rejecting the entire system and teaching your kids and telling your friends that there's no reason anymore to support democracy. The fact is there will be millions -- it's going to be a high turnout based on our polling right now, but there are millions of people who won't vote because they will think that their vote either won't matter or won't be counted. And it's up to the people who run these elections to demonstrate, to prove without a shadow of a doubt that your candidate may not win, but there is a value in participating. And that's why we have to be careful about what we say, about how we communicate, because this is a very precious, fragile system right now. It's our responsibility to make it stronger.",

We've got political commentators for CNN, Scott Jennings and Ashley Allison, and also Kevin Madden, who was a former top aide to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. You know, on the point we were just touching on, obviously you're never guaranteed to vote for the winner. That's not supposed to be the premise of democracy. But the idea here that we have election denialism that is part of campaign platforms, that's very ironic. Because the same people who will then oversee to ensure that it's in integrity and has a system that's fair, are saying you can't trust it. I mean, it's really the double-edged sword.

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, I want to break this down in a couple of parts though, because it was referenced Stacey Abrams, and I know my friend Scott will probably bring that up because we always jest about that.There -- there's a difference between voter suppression and election denial. Stacey Abrams believes that voter suppression took place in Georgia, and because of that, the votes that were cast for her were not completely counted. They were thrown out because of either signature matching or polling places closing, or you name it. She has not led it insurrection. Instead, she started two organizations, one, to get people to count on the census and one to get people to register to vote, and then she is engaging in the democratic process. She has not tried to challenge Brian Kemp as governor. Only ex -- with the exception of on the ballot. On the other hand, you have candidates, I don't know any election deniers from 2020 that have Democrat -- or Democrats or independent or libertarians. But you have Republicans who are running two thirds of their candidates in this midterm who do not, not just don't believe in the election, want to overthrow the nature of our democracy. And I think it's important to be very clear on what they are doing. And the reason why they are trying to run on that platform is not just for 2022. They want to get in office so that they get to administer these elections to make our democracy weaker in 2024 and beyond.",

There's no way that even if Donald Trump pulls out a straight Steve Bannon here and just says, forget it, I'm not even talking to you guys. I'm not going to respond at all.Even if they referred him for contempt, even if they get it to the Justice Department, nothing is going to come of this. Neither Congress through its efforts, nor the Justice Department is going to hold him on a simple misdemeanor of contempt of Congress. If he's facing problems with the Justice Department, if he's facing indictment, it's a larger issue of conspiracy to defraud the United States for January 6th. This is just something they throw in as an afterthought. COATES:  So, your issue is not, or your thought is not that the DOJ would be dismissive because it's not credible because they have other fish to fry.

And of course, even if the House were retained by Democrats, this still committee gets goodnight in January no matter what.

But just like Donald Trump had all these protections when he was president and could push off all the inquiries that were going on into his administration. Joe Biden is going to get to rely on those exact same privileges and protections. He's got Supreme Court precedent from the Trump era about that limits the power of Congress to even enforce its subpoenas. He's going to be able to use that to push back. And let's put -- be very clear. If on his way out of office, Joe Biden tries to instigate, you know, a crowd to go march from the capitol, I'm sure there'll be a committee to investigate it.

Giving people what they need not only helps to mix it, it consistently stays safer here. The shootings are down and the hope is up. That's what you here for. My relationship with the Philadelphia Police Department is cool. It's saying the officers in a different light. It builds trust and it builds confidence. They need to see that all cops aren't bad.
