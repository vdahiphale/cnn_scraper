Senator Kyrsten Sinema announces that she's leaving the Democratic Party becoming an independent. She talks exclusively with CNN. And the World Cup quarterfinals are underway, a member of the U.S. Men's National Team talks about his team's journey. This is what we're watching At This Hour.Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here. I'm Bianna Golodryga in for Kate Bolduan. Brittney Griner is back on U.S. soil, returning to her home state of Texas this morning. The WNBA star is expected to undergo a full medical evaluation after spending 10 months in Russian custody. Griner was arrested in February by Russian authorities for carrying vape canisters with cannabis oil. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years, the U.S. and Russia agreeing to a high- profile prisoner swap trading Griner for a notorious Russian arms dealer. CNN's Rosa Flores is live in San Antonio where Griner arrived this morning, a big relief and a big Lone Star State, welcome home for their own Brittney.",

You can look on your screen and see that moment. There was no big spectacle. There was no big fanfare. What we saw was the plane land. Some officials get on the plane. And then Brittney Griner moments later walk off that plane and get into -- walk into a hangar. Now those were her first steps as a free American on U.S. soil.Now I just received a statement from Brooke Army Medical Center and they say that the standard protocol was for her to be transferred to Brooke Army Medical Center. So that's most likely what happened right after those shots that you see of Brittney Griner walking into that hangar. Now according to Brooke Army Medical Center, this is a standard protocol for her to go there for a medical evaluation. And then the statement that we received goes on to say that they don't release any more information because of privacy reasons, which is very understandable. But Bianna, you and I've talked about this. We've talked about it on this show. Trevor Reed went through this process not too long ago. And so and his family has done interviews with CNN. And that's how we know a little more about what actually transpires and the process. And what happens is, according to his family is that the -- they are offered medical treatment, medical attention, and also a program, a gold standard program from the Department of Defense to reinstate people into normal life, into civilian life. So we're expecting her to be offered that, but of course, Bianna, we don't know if indeed she will accept that type of treatment or not. Bianna?",

So Fred, I know that Bout has given an interview to state media there in Russia, and we've heard from Vladimir Putin too. What did he say? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTNow Viktor Bout is all over Russian state media. His arrival was all over Russian state media. And he said something that is very good for Vladimir Putin. He said that he has found that the Russians do not leave their own behind. So he's certainly going along with that narrative from the Russian president of being someone who gets the Russians back if they are in custody abroad. He also said in an interview, that he had absolutely no idea that this swap was about to happen. Let's listen to what he had to say.

The Trump team then did their own search and found two more documents with classified markings at a storage unit.The Justice Department is also concerned that the Trump team won't name a custodian, a Custodian of Records to sign an attestation saying, we've looked we've handed over everything with classified marking so that is all going to be an issue in a secret court proceeding before a judge today.
