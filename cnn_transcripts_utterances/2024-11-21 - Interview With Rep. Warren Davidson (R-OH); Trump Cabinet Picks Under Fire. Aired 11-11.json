This morning, growing controversies involving Donald Trump's top administration picks are threatening his new Cabinet before some are even officially nominated. Pete Hegseth, the man who Trump wants to lead the Department of Defense, is on Capitol Hill today meeting with the senators who will decide his fate. But his visit is overshadowed by a police report that's offering some new details about a sexual assault allegation against him, something he is denying. Sara Murray joins us now. So, again, Hegseth has denied these allegations, but we are learning more from this police report.",

      "sentences": "That's right.The police report really sheds light on the competing narratives around what happened this evening in October 2017 in California surrounding this Republican women's conference. And I want to talk about the woman's account first. She's referred to as Jane Doe in this police report. She said Hegseth was giving off a creeper vibe during this conference. She said she later ended up in a strange hotel room and she claims Hegseth took the phone from her hands, that he blocked the door with his body and that she remembered saying no a lot. Now, there was a lot she couldn't recall. She said at one point maybe somebody slipped something in her drink, although there were other eyewitnesses who said they saw her that evening,she seemed sober. There were also differing eyewitness accounts about an encounter this woman had earlier in the evening with Hegseth at a hotel bar. One person said she showed up as a crotch blocker when Hegseth was hitting on another woman who wasn't interested in his advances. Another person said they saw this woman, Jane Doe, and she appeared to be flirting with Hegseth. At any rate, after what happened in the hotel room, this woman waits a couple of days. She then seeks medical care. They do a rape kit and she says she believes she may have been sexually assaulted and the nurse ultimately is the one who reports this to authorities. This is very different from the account Pete Hegseth gives to authorities. He says that she ends up in his hotel room. It's kind of odd that she's not leaving, but that they became intimate and that there was a consensual sexual encounter. He said there was always conversation and always consensual sexual conduct. He said that he and this woman, Jane Doe, discussed the fact that she was married and she said she would tell her husband she had fallen asleep on a couch in someone else's room. And he also said she showed early signs, some early signs of regret, although he didn't explain what that was. As you pointed out, Pete Hegseth has denied that there was any kind of sexual misconduct. His attorney, Timothy Parlatore, told me that: \"This police report confirms what I have said all along. The incident was fully investigated. The police found the allegations to be false, and that's why no charges were filed.\" We should note, though, the police report doesn't say that they found all the allegations to be false. It's true that no charges were filed, but there is other evidence in this case. There's surveillance video. There's a memo from the district attorney that could shed light on why charges were not filed, but at this time there are no plans to make any of that public. We should also note that our team approached this woman again, the woman referred to as Jane Doe last week. She declined to comment, and when our team tried to ask her about these allegations, she broke down in tears, Pam.",

In this lawsuit, the former pro wrestling executive is accused of enabling the sexual abuse of children by one of her company's employees. Now, McMahon has denied these allegations, which go back to the '80s. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now. What else have we learned, Katelyn?",

This morning, we learned the Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene will chair a new House subcommittee that will work with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, their new project, the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, as people call it. We have learned one of the first orders of business for them could be ending remote work for federal workers, based on our reporting. But this is about more than bringing people into the office. It could also drive people out of government altogether, which is sort of the point here. So I want to bring in CNN's Rene Marsh. So tell us more about this effort to try to get members of -- employees of the government who work remotely back into the office and how they think that will help cut down on the work force.",

      "sentences": "Right.So, their big goal here is to slash government spending. And they -- Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, what their first ideas are for this DOGE is essentially to mandate Monday through Friday in the office for all federal workers across the federal government,in hopes that many of these federal workers will quit and in turn saving the federal government money and salaries. So let's take a look at the numbers. Right now, as we speak, 1.3 million federal workers are approved for telework. That's about half of the federal work force. And of those working these sort of hybrid schedules, they spend the vast majority of their time in the office, 60 percent of their time in the office, according to the Office of Personnel Management. And then just a small percentage of the larger bucket of the over two million federal workers are completely remote. But that is the sect of the work force that they're really focused on when it comes to this mandate that they're pondering of saying no more working from home, everyone come back to the office. And they're also thinking about coupling that with moving some of these agencies out of Washington, D.C. So we have those two things together, moving the agencies, some of them, and also demanding that everyone is in office five days a week. They are hoping they will be able to shed and thin out the ranks.",

And, occasionally, Republicans get weak in the knees when it comes to Republican nominees, but they seem to find a way to vote for Democrat nominees. And I think Republican voters are pretty sick of that. And the president's, frankly, not going to show a lot of patience for it. He dealt with it in his first term, and he's saying, look, there's certain roles. Like, I need an attorney general right away. I'm not going to waste time with that. We're going to move. And we know we need a strong and focused military. That's why he picked Pete Hegseth. He's the right person to deliver that. And I think you can't have an absence as secretary of defense.

First of all, there is president of a member of Congress resigning and then the Ethics Committees continue on with the investigation and releasing the findings in at least two examples. So there is president for that. And on Matt Gaetz, he would oversee the Justice Department. He would be the chief law enforcement official. The DOJ did investigate him.
