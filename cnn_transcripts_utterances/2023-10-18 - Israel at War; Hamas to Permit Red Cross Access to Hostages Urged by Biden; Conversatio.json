      "sentences": "I think the reactions will not be positive. This will be seen as a full-throated endorsement of Israel and of Israel's comportment over the 10 last days, which obviously Arab countries have denounced. I think there will be a lot of talk about what wasn't said. There was no call for a restraint. There was no call for a ceasefire.It's important to remind viewers that the leaders of these Arab countries have many young people who are now impassioned and outraged and upset and are taking to the streets. And so, they have to be seen as taking a hard stance, as supporting the Palestinian people, they are also trying just like President Biden to thread the needle, if you will. He did say, as you mentioned, that there has been some agreement on the Israeli side to allow the passage of aid into Gaza with the proviso that Hamas does not divert that aid, but he also said that he hoped that would happen as soon as possible with no real clarity or sense of when that might be. And I agree with David that he did issue, as well, some gentle warnings to Israel after the first half of the speech which was all about this remarkable display of solidarity with Israel. He said, we have felt that rage after 9/11. We learned from mistakes that were made after 9/11. I believe his quote was, while you feel that rage, don't be consumed about it, and make sure you have clarity about your objectives. That is obviously urging Israel's leaders to think very strategically and very clearly about what comes next. Everybody has been waiting for quite some time now for this much- anticipated ground invasion. There are very real questions, I think, being asked by world leaders from many different countries about what that looks like, what the tangible result would be of that. The Israelis have said they want to, essentially, dismantle and uproot Hamas once and for all, but still questions remain. How do you go about doing that? Who steps in to fill the void afterwards? We have heard previously President Biden say in an interview on \"60 Minutes\" that he does not think it would be a good idea for Israel to try to reoccupy Gaza. And so, I think just a subtle warning that now is also a time to take a deep breath and think very, very clearly about what the next moves might be and what the ramifications of those might be. And also, a very stern warning, presumably to Iran, to Hezbollah, to others in the region who might be watching this moment, he said who might be thinking of attacking Israel, he said, \"Don't. Don't. Don't.\" Sara.",

If it's going to land in a field somewhere, they'll leave it alone.

We do not want this humanitarian aid to end up in the hands of Hamas and be repurposed to their war machine against us.So, it's very important. Just a few days ago, we heard that UNRWA, the U.N. agency, admitted that there were fuels and some medical supplies in Gaza City that were stolen by Hamas, people that were purporting to be from the Gazan health ministry, which is also Hamas controlled but they were from Hamas, and they stole some of these supplies.
