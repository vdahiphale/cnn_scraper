It is 04:00 p.m. in Beirut and here in Tel Aviv. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\". Let's get straight to our breaking news. Well, the Israeli military says it is engaged in fierce fighting in Southern Lebanon after Israel launched what it calls a limited ground operation there against Hezbollah, with ground troops entering the country for the first time since 2006. Israel's military saying the operation is aimed at removing immediate Hezbollah threats from villages along Lebanon's southern border. Hezbollah says no Israeli troops have entered Lebanon. Well, the Israeli military spokesperson spoke last hour, saying Israeli forces have been targeting areas that were staging grounds for an October 7th style attack planned by Hezbollah's slain leader Hassan Nasrallah.

But the fact is, if Israel's goal, and this has been its stated goal, is to push Hezbollah back beyond firing range, or as far beyond firing ranges they could manage from the northern border. We have to talk about the Litani River, if their intention is to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which required Hezbollah to move back beyond the Litani River. We're talking 20 miles here. And we're talking many dozens of villages that you would have to clear like we saw them do this one village right across the border in the last 24 hours, and that doesn't just imply that would require a large number of forces over time.

On the other side J. D. Vance's team, despite Trump's comments calling Walz a moron, they say that he is, quote, a wily political veteran who is, quote, very good in debates, and they have reminded people that J. D. Vance has only been in the political spotlight for about two years now. So, it's interesting to watch both sides expectations set here on the Vance side, they actually picked him because they thought he would be stellar in a debate back when they assumed that his opponent would be Vice President Harris. And they have spent the last couple months readying him for this head-to-head showdown against him, while they've watched all of Walz previous debates. And he has also maintained an aggressive media appetite, where he has been in front of reporters sitting down for interviews, sitting down for this political Sunday shows in the U.S., really trying to sharpen him on issues heading into this debate. Walz, meanwhile, has been practicing all throughout the weekend. He held a mock debate session with Pete Buttigieg, the Department of Transportation Secretary in the U.S., reprising his role of the opponent. He was actually Mike Pence in some of the debate preparations the last go around.

Firas Maksad is the Director of Strategic Outreach at the Middle East Institute and a senior fellow there. And Trita Parsi is the Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible statecraft, both joining us today from Washington D.C. Firas, let me start with you. Israel has chosen to ignore what was a diplomatic option in the U.S.-French ceasefire proposal table last week in New York, opting instead to take military action to take out the threat of Hezbollah on its residents who are displaced in the north, given the momentum it has had from these six the strategic success in assassinating the Hezbollah Chief from a dozen or more commanders.

I think Firas is quite right on several of these differentpoints, but I do think that there's a premise to this question that may not be entirely correct, because we presume that the Israelis or Netanyahu has some sort of an end game of some sort of a balanced equilibrium at the end of this. I'm not so sure we should presume that, because the Israelis themselves have made it quite clear, that they believe that peace actually is neither achievable nor necessarily desirable, given the compromises Israel would have to agree to get that. So rather a state of constant warfare, in which there's pockets of peace. And then every two or three years there's some form of an increase of violence in which Israel does what it calls mowing the lawn is essentially what Israel has settled for. This is the strategy they have been pursuing for the last 20 plus years. It's just a much deeper and more intense period of violence than what they had otherwise expected. But this is, I think, what they are aiming for, and if they can take out Hezbollah and potentially even significantly weaken Iran, they believe this will give them several years of tranquility. But peace is actually not something that they truly believe is possible or even desirable at that point -- at this point. So, I think if we adopt that time understanding of Israel's calculation, their behavior is not necessarily contradictory to this frame, whereas, if you actually believe that they're looking for some sort of a piece, that's when you have to engage in these intellectual acrobatics of trying to figure out how is this path that they have chosen, in any way, shape or form, going to lead to a peace for that.",

It's reflected also in Hezbollah's position in Lebanon, where they really have sought not to escalate against Israel and keep the conflict until now, limited to a largely border conflict, a war of attrition with Israel, clearly with the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah and the decapitation of Hezbollah's leadership. And we have to highlight that an Iranian IRGC general died in that bunker directing that war, together with Hassan Nasrallah.

The BidenAdministration promised that this would be the end of forever wars, that they would be pulling out of the Middle East, not drag, not allow the U.S. to get dragged into more wars in the region, focus on other regions. But instead, we're seeing that if the United States is giving the Israelis every means to be able to do all the kinds of escalations that Biden says that he is against, but yet he provides the means for them to do so, and if then the Iranians respond, which now appears to be likely, according to U.S. intelligence. And this is a buzz that's been going on for going on for the last 12 or so hours here in Washington. And the United States, and steps in and gets directly attacked by Iran as well. Then the United States is yet again, just a month before the U.S. elections at war in the region. And Netanyahu will be had to be crowned as one of the smartest and most strategic actors in the region, because he's been able to score several victories with just a few moves, including getting rid of the next Democratic President of the United States by getting Trump elected.",

That is still not the ultimate red line for the Iranians. The ultimate red lines for them, is themselves, their regime, their preservation. And given what Netanyahu said yesterday in the video message that he put forward to the Iranian people, which had a very clear regime change message that leaves the Iranians with the impression, I think, in which they have no choice. This, again, is completely unavoidable. This -- there was no necessity for this. But this is the direction that Netanyahu has wanted to drag the region. For the last 20 years, he has been trying to get the United States involved in a direct confrontation with Iran because it serves his interest in his view, because the United States is far more capable than Israel in terms of degrading Iran. So, he needed to have a war that would drag the U.S. into it in order to achieve that objective. And it appears that he may very well be successful.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, a senior White House official is telling us that the U S believes that Iran is preparingto imminently launch a ballistic missile against Israel. This is something that the U.S. has been concerned about over the past few days, with officials really watching very closely to see if Iran would try to retaliate in any way for Israel's killing of Hezbollah Leader Nasrallah just last Friday. Now, a senior White House official is telling us, quote, we are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. They add a direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran. Now, you'll remember, back in April, the U.S. led this multinational effort to try to intercept a barrage of drones that were sent by Iran towards Israel. The U.S. and other countries were largely able to intercept many of those drones at the time. So, a U.S. official is telling us that the U.S. is preparing to aid Israel in a similar fashion. Now we don't have any more specifics from the White House about when exactly this attack might take place. They simply said they believe it's being done imminently. Also, no details on where exactly in Israel, Iran might be targeting, but this is something that the U.S. has been watching with great concern in recent days, and the officials have gone as far to say that if Iran or any of its proxies or partners tried to use this moment to target American personnel or interests and parties in the region, that the U.S. would be prepared to respond. Now we know that the U.S. has really tried to bolster some of its posture in the Middle East. They have noted the Pentagon has that they have a significant capability in the Middle East. Were this conflict to spread out into a wider regional conflict. They pointed to the fact that they have carrier strike groups, that they have troops in areas that could deploy if necessary. So, we are still waiting to hear exactly how the U.S. plans to help Israel defend itself, specifically against this potential attack, and what it could mean for the broader conflict as large as we have seen tensions really escalating over the course of the past two weeks. And so, we will see what else the White House has to say. What other explanation they can offer for why they believe this attack might happen at any moment.",

As of thismoment, we do not identify any aerial threat launched from Iran. We dealt with such a threat before in the past, and we will deal with it now. I call on the public to continue acting responsibly, as you did throughout the war, adhere to the directives of the home for command, which we updated earlier today. It's on the home for website. Our staff members will tell you what to do. They're in the studios. Our aerial and our planes of the Air Force are scanning the skies. But this is not an absolute defense, therefore you must keep adhering to the Home Front Command. We are in peak alert both on the offensive and the defensive, together with our allies, the U.S. we follow together on developments from Iran. I will be here to update you on each development. Is the IDF prepared to attack Iran? IDF is prepared both on the defense and the offense. I will not say anything more than that. Launching towards Israel from Iran, there will have consequence, I will not say more. We have plans and we have abilities, launching from Iran into Israel will have consequences. The IDF is prepared and is operating in Syria, thwarting threats launched throughout the war, and already attacks wherever there is infiltration from Hezbollah and trying to do so. Our allies in The U.S. central command in the U.S. and its abilities, as were expressed in April, as were shown in April, they are together, prepared with us. It's already based on a very high ability of Israel in disguise, and we will know how to deal but this is not an absolute defense. So, the public needs to act responsibly and carefully as we guide you, in order to minimize the impact of the Home Front. I will be here to give you updates on any development that will happen immediately.",
