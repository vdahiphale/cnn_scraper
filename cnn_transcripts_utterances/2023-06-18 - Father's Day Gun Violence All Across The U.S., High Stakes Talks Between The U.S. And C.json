One person is dead and at least 22 others injured after gun fire erupted overnight during what witnesses described as a Juneteenth celebration. CNN's Camila Bernal is following these developments for us. Camila, police were reportedly there and left before the shooting got started. What else are you learning?",

We did not hear the kind of insults and accusations and criticisms that have emerged in the past.Instead, there was talk of a commitment to a stable and consistent relationship with the U.S. wanting to ensure that you could handle unexpected and sporadic events in a calm, professional, and rational manner. That's the kind of discussion that the State Department had going into this, saying that they wanted to establish clear lines of communication to prevent something going wrong, for example, in the South China Sea between U.S. and Chinese warships and war planes from spiraling out of control. So, hearing, again, a more positive and professional tone coming from the Chinese side. Meanwhile, Secretary Blinken did issue an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, to come visit Washington. It was received and approved. There have also been agreements basically to enhance people and people exchanges and more passenger flights between the two countries.

Your goal is to build a bipartisan consensus on the threats posed by China and protect America's interests around the world when they're being threatened by China.You know, many Republicans blasted this trip as a sign of weakness. What do you want to see the Secretary of State accomplish over there? Can he accomplish anything over there? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): First, thanks for having me. I disagree with the Republicans on this. Secretary Blinken is traveling to China in a position of strength. Our Indo-Pacific alliances, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia have all strengthened relative to China in the last year. Our economy is turbo charged after the depths (ph) of the pandemic, where the Chinese economy has high youth unemployment and lower GDP than they expected. And also, we're putting their military friend of no limits on a path to strategic defeat in Ukraine. Secretary Blinken has a strong hand to play here and I think it's the right time for him to go, sit down and make very clear that the United States is not going anywhere in the Indo-Pacific.

Do not bet against the United States. We are going to be in the Indo- Pacific. We're going to stand by our allies there. We're going to ensure freedom of navigation.

I've been covering him for five years, most of his time as mayor, and whenever we find out about what his private work is, which sometimes is publicized and sometimes is not, we do report on it and ask him about it.What happened more recently was there was a lawsuit filed by a former employee of a real estate company and that lawsuit mentioned that Mayor Suarez was receiving $10,000 a month from the real estate developer for unknown services. We sought to find out what those services were. We've been reporting on it ever since. There's paperwork from inside that company that indicates that Mayor Suarez was paid to assist this developer with a permitting problem at city hall. The mayor denies any wrongdoing. He welcomes the investigations that are being conducted by local authorities and the FBI. He has criticized the paper for the coverage but it's something that the newspaper has been invested in for a long time. He is understanding what the potential -- what -- who he's doing business with, who's paying him, and what potential conflict, if any, might exist with city hall. It remains to be seen if that becomes a question on this campaign trail so early on, but I know that folks like yourself and other networks have been asking him about it, and he has been saying that he did nothing wrong.
