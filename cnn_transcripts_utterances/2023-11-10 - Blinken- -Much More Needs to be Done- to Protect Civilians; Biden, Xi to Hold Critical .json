But aides say the fact he's sitting down with Xi is a positive sign as well. Now, in announcing this meeting today, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, quote, the leaders will discuss issues in the U.S., PRC bilateral relationship, the continued importance of maintaining open lines of communication, and a range of regional and global issues. Now, senior administration officials say they are hoping that this will start to present a framework that the U.S. can have in trying to maintain competitive relations in China, while also trying to avoid any misperceptions or surprises of between the two countries. But aides have also been realistic that there may not be any concrete outcomes coming from this exact meeting. It will be the second time the two lead are meeting since Biden became president. But officials say that President Biden is prepared to raise a host of issues in this sit-down with Xi Jinping. That includes pushing President Xi on trying to reestablish the military-to-military communications which China had ended about a year ago. There is also expected to be discussions about the conflicts in Israel and Ukraine, as the U.S. has really urged China to take a more constructive role in both of those conflicts. They are also expected to talk about some issues of agreement, things like climate change and officials say the president is prepared to push Xi Jinping on issues where they disagree. That includes issues related to human rights as well as the situation relating to Taiwan. But, of course, this meeting is also playing out, as you're seeing significant global tensions in those conflicts in Israel and Ukraine.

They're going to be working closely with postal inspectors. They're going to be getting all that material to Quantico, to the labs to be tested. They will be looking at the stamps, the DNA. They will look at fibers. They are going to try to determine the origin of the envelopes, where they were purchased, the point of entry of where they entered the postal line, with the postal inspectors. Each one of these things, each one of these are clues towards the investigation. Most likely, FBI headquarters is going to be coordinating all six divisions and getting them all together and getting all the materials, so that there's one division, which has one clue and Georgia has another one. They will be brought together so there's one repository, one person and one organization, one unit at headquarters that is going to bring it all together. They are looking for identifiers. They're going to work at -- they're going to work with the FBI behavior analysis unit at Quantico. They are going to look at way the letters were written, what type of language was used to indicate who may have been the person who wrote the letters. The indications may additionally lead to more leads. The fact that there are far left organizations symbols on there may be something that is going to throw them off. My gut instinct says it's a little bit too much of them trying to claim responsibility, and in fact, that Fulton County was targeted as well as specifically also leads me to believe that it could be.

As of yesterday lawmakers talking late into the evening said they do not have a good sense of which way Speaker Johnson was actually going to lean when it came to whether or not to pursue this two-step strategy where you have a number of government agencies that would be defund on one day, other agencies that would be defunded on a later date. That is the preference of some members of the House Freedom Caucus. Then you have moderates and people who are veteran appropriators, who have been arguing behind the scenes to Johnson that this is just a short-term fix, that the better way to go about a funding showdown with the Senate Democrats and the White House is to try to pass as many of their individual spending bills as possible, and then set themselves up for January when they can have a larger funding fight. In the meantime, the argument from some of those members has been let's just do a short-term as clean as possible spending bill that might include some kind of Israel aid or some kind of debt commission, but nothing that would really set up a massive showdown with the United States Senate. It's just not clear what Speaker Johnson is going to do. As you noted, this is really his first big test as a newly minted speaker. And so far this week, he's had a couple of setbacks. They tried to pass a number of individual spending one-year bills on the House floor this week. There were differences between the moderates and the hard- liners on two of those bills. They had to pull them. Obviously, it just shows you that this speaker has the same problems that Kevin McCarthy dealt with when he was speaker of the House just last month -- Kate.",

That later date may be coming up soon.McCarthy and conservatives hard right in this conference was certainly very versatile. Mike Johnson does not have that among other House Republicans, neither among moderates or among the hard-righters conference, that he is broadly well liked. But once you get down to brass tacks and you have to govern, he is certainly facing the same problems the former speaker did with the narrow, narrow majority that House Republicans have and with the coalition that you have in the House. You have moderates running for reelection in districts that Biden won in 2020, and you have the hard right, who are unyielding and don't want to compromise on issues of spending nor on many other issues. That is an incredibly difficult, you know, tightrope to walk for speaker Johnson. We know he's in the more conservative side of things, but as a leader, as someone who has to actually govern, this really is a test for him.
