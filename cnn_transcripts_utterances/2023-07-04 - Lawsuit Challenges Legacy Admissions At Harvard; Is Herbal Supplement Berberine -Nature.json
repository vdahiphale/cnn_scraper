      "sentences": "What its critics call a different form of affirmative action is now being challenged at Harvard University. Three minority advocacy groups are suing the school over its legacy admissions, which gives preference to the children of alumni.This comes just days after the Supreme Court decision ended race- conscious affirmative action in higher education. CNN's Athena Jones joins us now with the details. And, Athena, this has been percolating for some time. Outside of the debate over affirmative action for racial preferences, the question of whether it's fair to give preference to the children of alumni. So where does this -- what argument does the lawsuit make and where does it stand?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Jim. That's exactly right. This is a discussion about merit. What qualifies as merit? If you can qualify on merit, can you give special preference to people who have a parent or relative who went to Harvard or who are big donors to Harvard?These groups, three Black and Latino groups are joining together to say, no, that is not far. They say that these legacy and donor-related admissions get preferential treatment. The vast majority of them, nearly 70 percent, are white. So what this amounts to is a policy that ends up giving an advantage to rich, white students and disadvantages other students who don't have those connections or are minorities. The complaint notes that the district court called these preferences given to legacy applicants sizable and significant. And the complaint really goes to great lengths to spell all of this out by providing a lot of data using admissions numbers. So let's look at some of that. They found that for the class of 2026, just under 2,000 applicants gained admission out of an applicant pool of more than 61,000. But look at that admission rate. 3.24 percent is minuscule. But it's very, very different if you are related to someone who has donated to Harvard or if you have a parent or relative who went. For donors, those applicants were seven times more likely to be admitted, with an admissions rate of 42 percent. If you have a parent or relative who went to Harvard, you were six times more likely than an ordinary student to be admitted for an acceptance rate of 33 percent. So this complaint argues that this is just not fair. They want the U.S. Department of Education to call on Harvard to stop doing this, to call this practice discriminatory. And of course, the timing of this matters so much, because it's less than a week since the Supreme Court severely limited the use of race in college admissions. And so these groups are arguing that if the court is going to do that about race, it is now even more imperative to eliminate any policies that disadvantage minority students while advantaging white students -- Jim?",

Folks who play sports, they got a big boost over the general population.But there were specific ways that this complaint lays out about how legacy applicants benefited during the admissions process. Can you lay out a couple of them?",

      "sentences": "Sure. This is so interesting. You're right, athletes, people who have athletic skills get a special leg up.But when it comes to legacy and donor applicants, they get all kinds of what the university calls tip factors that get weighed into their application. For instance, if you are related to a donor, you could end up on the Dean's interest list, which includes ratings for how important the donor is to Harvard. If you are one of these donor-related or legacy applicants, you have your application closely monitored throughout the entire process. They say it's annotated, so notes or symbols are added to make sure admissions officers pay it special attention. And these folks also get flagged again when they're trying to narrow down the final pool of applicants. These legacies get flagged again. A lot of advantages that these groups are not fair and should be eliminated -- Jim? SCIUTTO: It would be interesting to know if the dollar amount of donations can be co-related with an increased chance of admission. Part of a longer conversation.

Because we really don't have many clinical trials looking specifically at the effectiveness of Berberine for losing weight.But I can tell you, there's one study that shows Berberine associated with a 0.25 percent reduction in body mass index among those who tried taking the supplement. But when you think about those who have taken Ozempic and Wygove, those are associated with a 4.61 percent reduction in BMI units. So 0.25 versus 4.6, you see a big difference there. And the bottom line is, Boris, we just simply don't have the rigorous scientific data to really pinpoint the effectiveness for Berberine.",
