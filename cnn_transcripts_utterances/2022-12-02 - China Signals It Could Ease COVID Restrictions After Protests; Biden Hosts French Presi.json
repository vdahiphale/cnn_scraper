We begin with signs that China may be ready to ease the draconian COVID restrictions that have transformed daily life and sparked violent protests in cities all across the country. According to state media, the official in charge of China's COVID response says the country faces a, quote, new stage and mission in pandemic controls. Their remarks follow a surge of anger with the government's Zero COVID Policy and its human cost that has led to unprecedented public protests and calls to oust President Xi Jinping in at least 19 Chinese cities in the past week. Let's bring in CNN's Steven Jiang. He's live in Beijing. Is this a signal, Steven, good morning, that the protesters, I guess, won here or had their voices heard at least?",

      "sentences": "Well, Christine, here's the thing. The authorities here have not even acknowledged that protest took place, let alone admitting the demonstrations have prompted the changes and adjustment in their enforcement in recent days. So what's going on here seemed to be a two-pronged approach in terms of the official response to the protests.On the one hand, they have been ramping up their clamp down any open dissent. We have been speaking to some protesters who told us police have tracked them down actually, by geo locating their phones to protest locations. Others who are detained told us they were forced to unlock their devices to hand them over to police as, quote-unquote, evidence. So there's a lot of both high-tech and low-tech surveillance and crackdown going on. But on the other hand, we have noticed changes on the ground in terms of officials in multiple cities lifting long- standing lockdowns and reducing or even removing testing requirements among certain segments of the population. And in some cases, for the first time, people who test positive are being allowed to quarantine at home instead of being sent to those mass facilities often in horrific conditions. But the problem here is a lack of consistency or clarity. And the underlying challenges facing the authorities obviously remain the same in terms of the relatively low vaccination rate among the elderly, and the lack of medical resources in dealing with a potential surge in severe cases. So Zero COVID is not going away overnight. But this time, one thing that's different, Christine, is the shifting in their messaging and propaganda. For the first time, state media has stopped demonizing the virus, and instead, they're saying things like the Omicron Varian is much milder and a weaker than its predecessor. So seemingly, they were setting the stage for an eventual exit from the Zero COVID Policy. Christine.",

This is not a typo, one to three feet, that's from two different storm systems right now, just in time for meteorological winter which started yesterday, by the way, remember astronomical winter starts on December 21st.So this is a look at the latest weather alerts over six million Americans impacted by this, by the way, Salt Lake City included within a winter storm warning. I want to show you the radar there because snow levels there are crashing hard. That's a telltale sign, a cold front has moved through. Precipitation changing over to snow. So Interstate 80, Interstate 70 moving East and West is going to be quite dicey this morning. Now, we had two storm systems, one, now moving off towards the East. And then a secondary storm is going to continue to pile on the snow for the same locations here in Nevada mountain range, has a high avalanche potential going forward this weekend, because of the amount of snow, the fresh fallen snow and also the impressive winds that will be whipping across this region. Look at some of these snowfall totals at the ski resorts making skiers and snowboarders rejoicing, but really causing some headaches on the interstates and the local roadways as well. Lower elevation, we'll see rainfall, that's for San Francisco, Los Angeles, right through a better part of the weekend. Here's a look at the wind forecasts. The front range of the Colorado Rockies, get this, 60-mile per hour winds. You factor in the dry conditions that are in place, as well as the ongoing drought and we have the potential for some fire weather. That's why we have a critical fire outlook for portions of the Oklahoma Panhandle, as well as the sections of the central plains into Kansas. So lots to take note of this weekend, but the big storm system impacting the West and the Pacific Northwest. Christine.",
