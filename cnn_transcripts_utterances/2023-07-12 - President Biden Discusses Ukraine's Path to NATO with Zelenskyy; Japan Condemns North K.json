But Kyiv did receive new long-term security guarantees from leading nations, as well as a substantial show of support from the world's most powerful military bloc. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy just spoke to reporters on his last day in Vilnius. He said the two-day meeting produced meaningful success and that he's confident that his country will one day be a part of the NATO alliance. Earlier in the day, he reiterated the importance of Ukraine in NATO. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But first I want to bring in CNN Melissa Bell, who joins us live now, in Lithuania. So, Melissa, that was a wide-ranging speech to reporters, he was obviously taking questions from reporters there. He expressed gratitude for the security guarantees from NATO allies. He also said that he is confident, he's very confident that even though Ukraine will not become a NATO member while the war is still ongoing, he's confident that Ukraine will become a member as soon as the war ends. He also made it very clear to everyone who is listening that there is absolutely no way that Ukraine is gonna give up any inch of territory. Not even one village was what he said in exchange for peace with Russia. Just talk us through what stood out to you.",

There's been no mention at all of the way out of this, of the eventual peace talks and negotiations, of what pressure might be brought to bear on UKyiv, that it might give up in the name of peace. No mention of that at all. They took President Zelenskyy to be absolutely clear about that in those closing remarks, suggesting that he didn't believe he would be betrayed by any of the Western allies. So, I think, that is an important final message, but the most interesting thing about what he just said was the tone. When you compare it, Zain, with the tenor of the tweet that was sent as he came here to Vilnius, some of the remarks he's made along the way, this was about thanks, it was about recognizing what's been done, and crucially about recognizing the difference between the 2008 memorandum that allowed the beginning of the possibility of accession for both Ukraine and Georgia to NATO and what has come now. Fifteen years on, one of the points that's over and over at this summit is that what has tangibly changed from the promise that has played such an important role in all that's unfolding in the battlefield and what Ukraine has tangibly achieved in terms of accession. He explained it there. Not just a change in tone, but saying, look, there is a big difference. Now what we have are firm commitments that have been in front of the legislators of these countries and that is completely different but a very different tone. Mr. Zelenskyy, there, looking much more grateful, thankful, aware of what he's received so far that perhaps he had seemed at the beginning of this two-day summit. Zain.",

Ukraine has always asked for more, more, faster, faster and the United States has been slower than the Ukrainians would want, has not provided as much as the Ukrainians would want. And so, what we saw over the last 24 hours was really some of those tensions coming up to the surface, both in terms of the Ukrainian president expressing his frustrations yesterday, that NATO didn't go quite as far as he would have liked to see in terms of commitments for Ukraine to join NATO. And also on the U.S. side, the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, this morning fielding questions about that lack of a commitment and talking about the need for gratitude for the United States, for all of the support that it has provided. And so, ultimately what you saw President Biden and President Zelenskyy do in their meeting today was to try and put aside those frustrations, to put on a united front and to both do what the other side wanted to see, which was on the Ukrainian side, President Zelenskyy expressing gratitude and on the American side, President Biden recognizing the frustrations and the courage of the Ukrainians. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Your resilience and your resolve has been a model for the whole world to see. And the frustration, I can only imagine.

Melissa, let me go back to you because a lot of people have focused on this idea of the fact thatUkraine has been promised a way to become a member of NATO for about 15 years now, going back to 2008. Clearly, it hasn't happened. Jens Stoltenberg has said, look, we have made some adjustments. It's not going to be the membership action plan. We are going to make it much easier for Ukraine to eventually join NATO, provided that they meet certain criteria. You spoke to Jens Stoltenberg. I mean, what did he say about his understanding of Ukraine's level of frustration with all of this. Well, bear in mind that Jens Stoltenberg is a man who's overseen of the course of the last few weeks. Behind the scenes, these enormously complicated negotiations, not just, Zain, on the question of Swedish succession and what Ankara felt about that and the logistics of Finland's accession, how that was going to change, but of course, the specifics of the disagreements on exactly how far NATO needed to go towards Ukraine at this particular summit. And there have been huge divisions here in the Baltic states. They felt much more strongly than Western European countries or in the United States, that a strong signal should have been given. I put to the Secretary General that according to the latest American estimates, it is now some 350,000 Ukrainian lives that have been lost, and that one can therefore understand the frustrations expressed by President Zelenskyy.

The same thing is happening since February. People are starting to believe that. People are starting to make migrants responsible for the economical issues that Tunisia have. And in the same time, there was this last week, what happened was a Chinese man was allegedly killed by a migrant and this led to this whole hatred and this whole xenophobia that's unleashed on specs. And the government response was to deport migrants to the border because the government firmly believes in those anti-migrant theories as they explained it in February in that presidential statement.

You feel it. You feel that racism is still here because there isn't a lot of anti-racism culture in Tunisia. Over the last 10 years, there were several protests against discrimination. There were several symbolic actions, even a law voted in the previous parliament, but there was never a strong policy of fighting hatred, of fighting discrimination or racism. What really changed between that time and what we are seeing in the last months is that now it is -- I've heard this expert in the article you mentioned that told me racism was made official. It is now an open-policy to be anti-immigration, to find out where undocumented migrants work, to be very harsh when it comes to migration. And this leads to a different form of racism.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN HAVANA-BASED CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Russian warship sails into Havana. Cuba greets the ship, the first Russian naval vessel to make an official visit in years with a cannon fire salute. It's just the latest sign of the reforging of ties between Russia and Cuba. While much of the rest of the world has denounced Russia for their invasion of Ukraine, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, seen here alongside Vladimir Putin, inaugurating a statue of Fidel Castro in Moscow in November, defends Russia's war. We are condemning, we are rejecting the expansion of NATO towards Russia's borders, he told Russia today. We condemn all the measures and sanctions that have been applied as a way to coerce the Russian Federation. And Russia increasingly is throwing a lifeline to their old ally just 90 miles from the United States. Since the war in Ukraine began, Russia and Cuba have signed a flurry of new agreements that would open the first supermarket selling Russian food here, increase oil shipments to the island, even develop this beachside community outside of Havana. It appears to be the most significant Russian investment in Cuba in decades. In February, after Russia donated 25,000 tons of wheat, Russia's then ambassador to Cuba said the aid will continue to flow. In spite of the challenges, he says, Russia and Cuba continue developing their strategic relationship based on the historic friendship, solidarity and mutual sympathy between our two countries. The warming of ties for many Cubans feels like a trip back to the future. In this video from the 1960s narrated by Fidel Castro, Cubans are told how visiting Russian experts would modernize the island. Instead, Cuba grew dependent on Soviet aid. The USSR collapsed and facing punishing U.S. economic sanctions, the island plunged into a financial abyss from which it is yet to emerge. While Russian officials have suggested establishing a military presence on the island, some analysts feel that Moscow no longer has the capability to do so.",
