Now, Donald Trump is talking nice and definitely not shutting down speculation that she could be joining his campaign at some point very soon. Of course, this comes after Nikki Haley made the first move saying just one day before that she would be voting for him in November.CNN's Steve Contorno has much more on this.

The NCAA and the power five conferences, you know, hope by reaching this settlement, they can stabilize college athletics after just, you know, years and years of lawsuits. But lots of questions remain with these settlements.But any athlete who played a division one sport from 2016 to the present, they have a claim for some of that $2.7 billion. Now, how they plan on, you know, paying the star quarterback versus the pole vaulter, that's still not clear. The $2.7 billion is expected to be paid out over a ten-year period. Now, if athletes opt into these settlements, they have to agree they're not going to sue in any further antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA. Now, as a part of the settlement, each school, moving forward, it's going to have the ability to spend a maximum of roughly $20 million per year on direct payments to athletes, which is something that's never been done before in NCAA history. And it's going to be up to each school on how much to allocate that money while remaining compliant with title nine laws. Now, the direct pay to athletes, that could actually start as soon as the fall of 2025. The deal still must be approved by the federal judge that's overseeing this case, but still, you know so much to be determined, like, you know, what is this going to do to roster sizes in particularly football, Amara? They're likely going to have to have less than 120 players if they're paying everyone. And, you know, what does this mean for Olympic sports that typically don't make any money for this school. If they got to pay the athletes, are they going to continue to have those sports? So, Amara, you know, we have a settlement, but still so many questions.",

Yesterday, the country's premier went after comments that were made by some U.S. lawmakers accusing officials of targeting Americans. Now, according to the premier in the past six years of the 195 people convicted for firearm offenses in the country, only seven of them, seven of them were U.S. citizen. Now, Hageric, who is from Pennsylvania, is one of these five Americans that were arrested in recent months for having ammunition in the Caribbean country. Now, in each case, American officials said that the accused did not know that they were traveling with ammunition and officials in Turks and Caicos, well, they've pushed back on this argument that the government should get involved in their cases, saying that the judicial process there really has to play out. And they noted that judges there have the discretion in handing down these sentences. According to the premier, no American has ever received the mandatory minimum sentence of 12-years in prison. Hagerich, who was arrested in February, said that he forgot his hunting ammunition in his bag. Now, in an interview with the CNN affiliate, he lamented missing several family events saying in part to, quote, the events that I've missed that I haven't been able to show up for my family, I've watched both of my children celebrate their birthdays on FaceTime, I've watched my daughter graduate kindergarten on FaceTime, I've watched countless of baseball games on FaceTime. Now, officials again in the Turks and Caicos Islands have said, look, let's let this play out. Let's see where this goes. Again, judges have the discretion here. Hagerich is scheduled to be sentenced at 10:00 in the morning. Now, some U.S. lawmakers said that depending on how these cases play out, they could, they could push for a do not travel advisory, which would no doubt impact tourism on the island. There's another American who will learn his fate next week. And then the remaining group, they're going to be in court in June and July. John?",
