National views of Liz Cheney. This was as of last year. A tremendous gap partisanly speaking. She's quite popular among Democrats, a 62 percent favorable rating. But look among Republicans. Of course, she's a former Republican - or at least former Republican congresswoman, just 12 percent. This is something we've seen in the polls over and over and over again. Despite her GOP affiliation, she's far better liked among Democrats than she is among Republicans with that 60 percent unfavorable rating.",

Fifteen percent of Democrats say they'd support it, versus just 8 percent of Republicans.And this, I think, is one of the things I think Joe Biden might be worried about heading into 2024. Third-party candidates poll better among, and this is declared or potential candidates, just one poll is better among the GOP or neutral, Kennedy, Democrats, Cheney, Stein, and West all poll better among Democrats.

I don't have a lot of pictures of my brother on display in my house. His death is still so painful to me that I find it hard to see his photos.These two pictures really stunned me. They were taken shortly before Carter graduated from Princeton in 1987. He looked so young and happy. There's no hint that 15 months after this picture was taken he'd kill himself in front of our mom. Looking at these photos, I don't recognize my brother. And I realized, I don't think I ever really knew him. I didn't allow myself to. And I didn't allow him to know me. When our dad died, Carter was 12 and I was 10, and it slapped us both into silence. We never spoke about my dad with each other or with anyone. I think my brother would be alive if we had. Why is it so hard to talk about loss and grief? We all go through it. So, why do we keep it hidden away, crying in private, speak the names of our loved ones in hush whispers only we can hear? That's why I wanted to talk with President Biden. He's been more public about grief than any American president in history. And this is his most personal interview yet. Do you ever still feel overwhelmed by grief?",

You can't under LBJ without thinking about the role that Texas and race played.For Joe Biden it is grief. And as Anderson mentioned a moment ago, he brings it into the public square in a way that's very rare for people at the apex of our politics.

Kennedy lost a child while in the White House, a son named Patrick who only lived for 39 days. Rarely did any of them talk about it publicly.And certainly, you know, President George H.W. Bush lost a daughter, Robyn, to leukemia in 1953. She was three years old. He and Barbara Bush talked about it more after they had left the White House, in later years. But he kept a photo of Robyn, according to his son, on his desk her entire -- his entire life. I think it's so important for the most powerful man on the planet to talk about this.

The other one was coming to believe in his own Irish roots. You know, he carries with him today a rosary in his pocket.
