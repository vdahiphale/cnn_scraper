Tonight, Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns of energyterrorism as millions of Ukrainians deal with rolling blackouts after Russia's strikes. Then, Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Imran Khan speaks out after being shot in an apparent assassination attempt. We'll bring you the latest from Islamabad. Plus, mass layoffs begin at Twitter after new boss, Elon Musk, announces a huge job call by e-mail. I'll talk with one employee who just lost his job. But first, tonight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of committing energy terrorism with its relentless attacks on Ukraine's power stations. Mr. Zelenskyy says Moscow is plunging the country in the cold and the dark as a way to break people's will because Russian forces can't win on the battlefield. Russian aerial attacks on civilian power stations this week left millions of people without electricity and water for periods of time as you can see there on your screen. G7 nations meanwhile on Friday say they established a coordination mechanism to help Ukraine restore, repair, as well as defend its energy infrastructure. Our Christiane Amanpour joins me from Ukraine's capital which is suffering intermittent emergency blackouts. Christiane, great to see you. Look, for weeks now, we have seen, I think it's fair to say cruel escalation by President Putin, forcing millions of civilians to be in the cold and in the dark. But just give us a sense of what you've seen on the ground, Christiane, is this breaking their spirits?",

Khan spoke from his hospital bed in Lahore, his first public appearance since his convoy came under fire on Thursday as he led a protest match to press for early elections, one person died in the shooting. Khan's right leg was fractured by bullets. He is vowing to resume his protest match once he's recovered. Have a listen.

Well, tensions between North and South Korea are reaching a fever pitch. The North is demanding the U.S. and South Korea immediately stop their joint military exercises if they want to avoid a quote, \"grave situation\". And that is according to Pyongyang's state-run media quoting the foreign ministry. And it comes as the U.N. Security Council meet to discuss the North's barrage of missile launches, if you remember this week. South Korea scrambled fighter jets earlier today after its military reported seeing about 180 or so North Korean military aircrafts near the border. CNN senior national security correspondent Alex Marquardt joins me now from Washington D.C.. So, Alex, U.N. Security General has strongly condemned this evening, North Korea's actions. Meanwhile, correct me if I'm wrong, we are waiting to hear from the Security Council. What can we expect to come out of this? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Isa, this was a meeting that was called yesterday by a number of countries, including the United States, the U.K. and France. As you noted, we've already heard from a spokesman for the Secretary-General today, saying that he's deeply concerned about the situation on the Korean peninsula. So that meeting in New York expected to get underway in this hour. The question of what may come out of that meeting, unfortunately, probably not very much beyond expressions of anger, of concern, of frustration. Of course, calls for North Korea to end what so much of the international community sees as these provocative actions that we've seen over the course of the past few days. Now, we've seen an extraordinary number of missile launch events throughout the course of the year. But the biggest one yet was earlier this week on Wednesday, some 23 missiles were launched by the North. The following day, three more including an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now, when the North fires ballistic missiles, that is very much in violation of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council. So that is a big reason, of course, they're holding this meeting today to remind the North Korean's of that. The North Koreans simply don't seem deterred by that. Earlier -- last night in fact, we saw North Korea fire 80 artillery shells into the buffer zone between North and South Korea. So, we are getting into a very dangerous escalatory phase beyond just these missile tests. We are expecting officials and experts do expect that really any day now, we could see yet another nuclear test by North Korea. Isa?",

One of the dates that has been under discussion recently by Trump's team is the -- November 14, or at least sometime in that third week of November right after next Tuesday's midterm elections. Now aides have not decided on a firm date for a presidential campaign announcement by Donald Trump. But they are looking at that third week of November, thinking that that would be an ideal launch point for him to jump into a 2024 Republican presidential primary, because they want him to ride the wave of momentum that they think they're going to have coming out of the midterm elections. They feel very confident that the Republican Party will perform well next Tuesday, and that the former President, if he gets in front of a crowd the following week to announce a presidential campaign, will be able to reasonably take credit for some of those victories that they expect Republicans to have.
