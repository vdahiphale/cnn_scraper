And ultimately, Donald Trump will win again in November, it could cost them both the Senate and the United States House. The purpose of this meeting was to essentially allay those fears and try to tamp down those growing calls for Biden to step aside.

I need more of the kind of analytics that show the path to success. More important than my concerns are the questions that have been raised by the American people that Donald Trump is an existential threat. Joe Biden has to go to the American people, not just in one meeting, one press conference, one speech, but consistently and constantly. Tonight will be important.

And, of course he was -- he was working from a teleprompter. So, it's not the kind of informal give and take that you'll see tonight at the -- at the press conference.I've heard both from leaders and the Finnish president is fairly new, he's only been in office a few months. The ones who have been in office the longest tell me that they don't see the same Joe Biden that they saw, say in 2021 at his first summit meetings, NATO meetings and so forth, or even when the war began in 2022. That isn't to say that they are nervous about whether he can handle the job now, they say their worry is, what will this look like in two years or three years from now?

My current estimate, though, is that Donald Trump has a clear advantage there at this particular point of six points. And this is part of a larger pattern that we're seeing sort of in the battleground states so we can break it down by the Sunbelt in the Great Lakes, North Carolina sort of close to that, Sun Belt, right. Look, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, look at all these very clear advantages for Donald Trump five, five, six points. You go over to the Great Lakes. This is where Joe Biden's campaign believes that they can play ball. At this particular point, post-debate, we are seeing Trump advantages, but look at how they're smaller. They're significantly smaller than what we're seeing in the Sunbelt. Pennsylvania, three points. Wisconsin, two points. Michigan basically a tossup of one point. And here's the key thing, Boris, if Joe Biden carries Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, he can lose Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, and he will get to get this exactly 270 electoral votes if he carries the other states, and of course, Nebraska, second congressional district, which he did last time around.",
