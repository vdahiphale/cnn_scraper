First up though developing this hour after months of delays and hurdles Turkey say it will now start the process to ratify Finland's accession to NATO. But still it has not endorsed Sweden's bid. China's President will fly to Moscow next week to meet with his Russian counterpart Xi Jinping's first visit to Russia since it invaded Ukraine. It's also the highest level visitor Putin has received since the war began in an apparent show of support. Anger is spreading across France after President Emmanuel Macron ordered a rise in the pension age without taking a vote. Protesters have blocked a key highway in Paris and strikes are escalating across the country. And Crystal Palace Football Club has parted with its Manager Patrick Vieira the only Black Manager in the Premier League is far in setting bad sign for diversity in England's top flight football. All right, you're with us for the second hour of \"Connect the World\" wherever you are watching you are more than welcome. Our major story today, more fears hitting the U.S. banking sector after after the collapse of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks earlier in the week. It looked like First Republic could be next. That was before 11 major U.S. banks stepped in with a 30 billion yes, you heard that figure correctly $30 billion cash injection. Well, this caps a frankly crazy week for global markets concerns over bank failures spread across the world. European and Asian markets became jittery. And Swiss lender Credit Suisse also needed a helping hand. So tonight we ask if the cracks been patched up? Or is this a dam about to burst? Well, there are so many moving parts to this story. Let's bring you in an expert here. Financial Times U.S. Banking Correspondent Stephen Gandel joins me now. Good to have you! What can we expect from the weekend? Because let's face it, we have had a pretty damaging weekend last weekend and what do you expect to see next week? STEPHEN GANDEL, U.S. BANKING CORRESPONDENT, FINANCIAL TIMES: So hopefully what you can see - what we expect to see if someone steps up and buys Silicon Valley Bank, that process is ongoing. The FDIC would prefer to have a bid in today, although I don't think that's a hard deadline. So if it nobody steps up there, none of the either other banks or a private equity firm, then I think that could cause some more jitters. The other thing we're watching is First Republic's stock still keeps on going down. And you said that, as they're put cash into the bank. We have to be clear; this is a very unusual rescue plan. It's not like typically what you do what they did with tarp is you come in and you put cash into the capital accounts of the bank right? It covers any kind of losses in this case, in bonds, but in the financial crisis in loans, they didn't do that. What Jamie Dimon did and the others is they did the same thing that you would do. If you opened a bank account, they just put $5 billion into or 30 collectively into a deposit account. It's a very different kind of structure for ways to try to shore up the bank so we also have to watch to see if that the market investors, everyone else is going to like that.",

It would be worse if she didn't say that. But what I will say in terms of that this crisis comes out of 2008 or relation to it is that the reason financial crisis happens, because things happen that we don't expect to happen. All the things that happened in the financial crisis, bad loans, foreclosures, that's not the problem now. Like we did put a lot of places of checks in place with the very big banks to make sure that are repeated, that didn't happen. But by emphasizing that, what happened to 2008 doesn't happen again, we have something totally different now. And this is kind of a run on deposits, not based on bad loans run on deposits are based on kind of a lack of protection for those deposits. The fact that regulators were lost, they dropped the ball on some of these banks, and that these banks had these huge bond portfolios that with the Fed raising interest rates, they lost a lot of money. So I think it's not - if you have your money, and not some of the big banks, I think if you're money in the big banks, no one has to worry. But if you have your money in a small regional bank, will you lose the money? I'm not sure. Will you be locked out of your account for some banks? Probably maybe seen that and will you have some stress in your life, again probably.",

He said this week, and I quote him here that failure is a direct result of an absurd 2018 Bank Deregulation Bill signed by Donald Trump that I strongly opposed. Can you just briefly explain what he's alluding to here? And is it as simplistic as this? Or is it really more macro low interest rates, suddenly spiking lots of dry powder lying around bad investment decisions by people who frankly, shouldn't have been making those investment decisions probably shouldn't have been running the bank.",

      "sentences": "I mean, it's so - you'd never can say one thing. It's an exaggeration of what Senator Sanders is saying. But what is true is thatwhat Dodd Frank put into place was that every bank with more than 50 billion in assets would be a part of this super regulatory structure where they get an extra look to make sure that they were safe. And in 2018, and a narrative that was building up in part a narrative that was built up by Barney Frank was that that had been overreached, that these regional banks that were below JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, those regional banks really didn't need the kind of scrutiny. And in fact, the scrutiny that was being placed on them was making it harder for them to lend to midsize or smaller companies that would be more likely to go to them. And so this narrative built up and so through that, and the Trump Administration took it up, and they took this cap from 50 billion to 250 billion. So the question is, did - was that a mistake? And maybe that 250 billion is was the issue because the problem we had Silicon Valley is like a 200 billion, maybe it should have been 50 billion 200 billion, it still would have caught Silicon Valley. But even if that cap hadn't been moved, there are other ways within Dodd Frank to loosen those things. So I think it's just in general, a collective kind of a think thing that as long as we protected what happened in 2008, make sure that didn't happen again. We'd be fine. And taking their eye off the ball from regulators and from policymakers and from lawmakers about there is risk in the banking system beyond again, these big ones JP Morgan Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citi.",

And we saw that this week with Credit Suisse, which has a whole litany of problems all to itself, in addition to the pressures we're seeing across the sector, but we saw the Swiss National Bank Central Bank in Switzerland, say we can extend a line of liquidity if needed. And we saw Credit Suisse say they will borrow up to $54 billion worth. But Becky look at Credit Suisse right now, shares are still trading down today. They had some recovery yesterday, but on the weak Credit Suisse shares are actually down 20 percent despite that mega loan. So you have to question what can regulators and central banks do, particularly for a bank like this one.

So on the one hand, that sort of gives the Fed cover to continue with its interest rate hikes, and perhaps it would have prior to a week ago, right, but now it has to consider the risk of financial instability. And even if it is a small risk, the consequences of what that could look like are so great that the Federal Reserve now has to consider that moving forward. And you're seeing a really fierce debate in the investment community about what is the right move in this environment, considering the fragility of banks right now, considering the jitteriness that we are seeing in the investment community, just look at sort of what has happened over the last week or so Becky. I like your technical term that it's been a crazy week for the market, it certainly has. And so when we hear from the Fed next week, I should say that expectations are now leaning toward perhaps a quarter of a percent when they raised rates instead of the half a percent that we were expecting a week ago. But it is critically important, Becky, not just what they do in terms of interest rates. But what he says what Chairman Powell says in terms of confidence in the economy, but also confidence and resolve in terms of what the Federal Reserve is willing to do, and able to do to really shore up competence in the American system and the global economy.",

Lvova-Belova I think on camera even talking about this directly with Vladimir Putin on one occasion. I can already anticipate the reaction and the response from the Kremlin to this.

And this case deals with the thousands of children alleged to have been taken from their parents or coerced from their parents taken from Russian occupied areas of Ukraine into what the researchers and the ICC has called re-education camps. Now, we've spoken to children and parents, just a few weeks ago, we told the story of parents going into Crimea, and rescuing their children from these kinds of re-education camps. At the most serious allegation, talks about the orphans that were taken from state facilities and into Russia, given to Russian parents. Now, while Vladimir Putin and the head of his group that is involved with children's rights have been named in this arrest warrant they will say and they have repeatedly said this is the issue of them protecting the children, something that really doesn't fly with the facts. When you look at these children going to these camps, and being taught in Russian being forced to sing the Russian national anthem separated there, from their parents, forcibly.

They say now it's up to countries outside of Russia to arrest Vladimir Putin because of this arrest warrant for war crimes associated with forcibly deporting and re-educating children from Ukraine during this conflict and for his head, Maria Lvova-Belova of a civilian group within Russia. There in the warrant, they said that Putin is responsible for this directing this program and also should have done more to stop it as it got going. But of course, the reality of this is for another country to is part of the Rome Statute, the treaty that governs the International Criminal Court to arrest Vladimir Putin should he leave the country would be a very big step though they would be compelled to do so. And the track record of this isn't necessarily good in bringing heads of state to justice, Becky.",

And that is, of course, the former head ofSudan who was indicted and under arrest warrant for genocide in Darfur. This South African example would be the perfect test case whether Vladimir Putin goes to that summit after this warrant has been given. But the track record, as I say, for countries that might be less critical of Russia, like South Africa, like large parts of Africa would be under pressure by the Hague and Western powers to arrest Vladimir Putin. But the track record of them doing so is not there in these kinds of cases. But we shouldn't diminish the fact that a very powerful politician, the head of Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council has been placed under an arrest warrant, to he is expected to show up at The Hague and face charges. It's very, very unlikely he will, but it's a truly significant moment for international justice, Becky.",

So, I think that's very significant. All the messaging that President Putin gets the messaging that he gets from NATO over the last couple of days, you know, a couple of nations standing up and saying they're going to send fighter aircraft, to help Ukraine in the fight. At the tanks that are being sent, the artillery that's being sent, the precision weapons that are being sent all of that all of that is messaging to Putin, to stop the war that you're not going to win the war. This is also messaging to Putin, recognizing that it's unlikely that he's going to end up facing the ICC in the near future. But it's messaging to him that your world is being proscribed and is shrinking, that whatever you think you're going to come out of this war with a chunk of Ukraine, your position on the world stage is utterly diminished. Russia's ability to represent itself through you on the global stage is going to be diminished. It's going to be a different global place, and you won't be part of it. So, this is very, very strong messaging. And of course, Putin will try to shrug this off, he'll try to play it to the domestic population in Russia is just another part of the West scheme to impugn and take down Russia's importance and value around the world. But eventually, all of these slings if you will, all of these arrows that Putin takes on whether it's the anger of families who've lost loved ones, fighting for Russia, in Ukraine. Whether it's the economic impact of his war, that he's able to shrug off, and perhaps President Xi next week can help insulate him from a little bit more. All of this diminishes him slowly, but definitively at home very much abroad, but at home and undermining him at home as well, is all part of the key to getting Putin to understand to stop the fight.",

Moscow can be quite slow on its feet sometimes to react to these sorts of things and bequite equivocating, until it's figured its way forward. They've seen this coming. This is the message. It's not a surprise. But I think President Putin is unlikely to test Maria Zakharova's strong words by flying into Paris or London, where he knows that he would face being served the arrest warrant and potentially taken off immediately to face justice. So, I don't think he's about to test it. His world has gotten smaller and irrespective of what Russian officials say about him, that message will penetrate the Kremlin walls, and we'll get into his thinking.",
