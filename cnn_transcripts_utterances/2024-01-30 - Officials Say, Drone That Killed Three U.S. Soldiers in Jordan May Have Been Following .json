REP. MIKIE SHERRILL (D-NJ):  Well, I would really like to see the administration use the tools to ensure that we can add some calm to the region. We do that by gathering our allies because, make no mistake, it is the desire of these organizations backed by Iran to escalate the situation. And any destabilization of the region is bad for the United States. We've already seen the Red Sea largely shut down by the Houthis. That impacts global shipping. That impacts our ability to make our supply chains more resilient. So, we are working incredibly hard to ensure that we have a calmer, better situation in the region.",

Look, as a nation that's just come out of 20 years war as a veteran of the global war on terrorism, I can attest to the fact that the last thing we need right here is to enter into another long-term war in the region.",

And here you have a Republican Party in the House that has, for years, said we need border legislation. I agree, I've wanted a comprehensive solution on immigration for many, many years. However, now that the solution is actually at hand, you see the person who is the likely nominee for president from that party saying, no, don't do it, because it's better for me if I have it as a campaign issue. And suddenly all of his acolytes have backed away from it. So, the hypocrisy and the shamelessness has constantly been a frustration to me.
