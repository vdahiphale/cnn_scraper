You know, those are coming. The days when you can put in a Special Counsel to avoid all of that are far behind us.

I think they probably -- I think what is driving this as much as anything is the fact that they have a very, very strong case in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation, one that is, I have to say, I mean, from the public evidence, and we don't know all the evidence, but the public evidence sure looks like he does not have a defense to the Espionage Act charge or to obstruction charges or even to a potential, you know, perjury charge, for at least suborning. So he is in substantial trouble, and there is no question that this is not going to help him, because it's for input, as Andrew said, it's going to insulate the Justice Department from some degree of political attacks, because this guy looks like he has no political valence whatsoever. He's a professional prosecutor. That's all he's done for 30 years. And apparently, he has kept his nose clean. I'm sure they vetted him as well as anybody.
