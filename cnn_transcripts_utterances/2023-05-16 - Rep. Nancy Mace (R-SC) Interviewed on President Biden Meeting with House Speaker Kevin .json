Good morning, Congresswoman. The clock is ticking on this.

Of course, he said when he became speaker he would give Republicans 72 hours to review legislation, and President Biden is scheduled to go on that trip tomorrow. So are you optimistic they can reach an agreement this afternoon? REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC):  I think it's deeply problematic given the trajectory that we are right now and how close we are to June 1st deadline that the president is traveling out of country. He should be here on the Hill working with Republicans and Democrats to strike some sort of a compromise, because guess what? Both parties, Republicans and Democrats, got us into this mess, and both sides need to come together and show the American people how they are going to get us out of it. Leaving the country right now is not where he should be. He should be here, and they should be working something out to balance a budget, rein in spending over the next 10 or 20 years, something reasonable that both sides can agree to.",

That's $12 trillion.It's insane to me that we are having this argument on Twitter and on the airwaves, and we need to get into a room with both sides and figure this thing out.

I'm always wanting to start from the strongest position, a position of strength, because you know that you are going to lose people or lose votes or lose different portions of a bill when it goes into the Senate or when you're negotiating with those across the aisle. And that was my concern. My concern also is that neither side is going to hold the other accountable, that we are just going to keep spending into oblivion until we are broke. And guess what, we are pretty much broke right now, which is why we need to take it seriously, which is why I would like to see a plan that balances things out in five years, but I would take 20.

We don't have to unless the president wants us to. And if that were to happen, if we were to somehow not strike a deal by June 1st, then we would have to prioritize spending.

So let's talk about it with CNN senior law enforcement analyst Andy McCabe.

He's echoed the sentiments of his boss, William Barr, who was attorney general at the time. So I don't think it's surprising where the report came out.

The investigation was initiated not based on raw uncorroborated intelligence, but on significant understanding and awareness of what the Russians were doing in their multi-pronged effort to influence the 2016 election. We knew the Russians had been targeting us in cyberspace. We knew the Russians had been going after and stealing electronic information from our political institutions, from government institutions for over a year, until the beginning of 2016.We knew they targeted the DNC and exfiltrated an enormous amount of information about Hillary Clinton. And then, we knew that the Russians used that information in an effort to impact the election by releasing those emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. We only found out later at the end of July, that prior to weaponizing, that information. They'd made essentially an offer to the Trump campaign that they had information about Hillary Clinton, and that they would use it to benefit the Trump campaign. So, with that understanding of what the Russians were doing, we had the question, the very real and very significant question of whether or not members of a domestic political campaign had conspired with or taken assistance from the Russians. We didn't know if they had, we didn't know who that might have been. But we knew that it was something that had to be investigated. That's the opening of the case, that as I said, the I.G. and other investigative entities approved of that action in hindsight.",

It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you're 40. That obviously has gotten a lot of attention for many years.
