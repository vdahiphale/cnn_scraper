      "sentences": "The justices sounded skeptical about Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.But they also seemed to be signaling that they might not be prepared to green-light a speedy trial in special counsel Jack Smith's January 6 federal case against Mr. Trump. We're also following Trump's hush money trial in New York City. Former tabloid executive David Pecker is on the stand, as he has been all week. He's been testifying for the first time today about a key figure in the case, adult film star and director Stormy Daniels. Keep watching your screen for updates from inside the courtroom. They are -- well, they are on that side of the screen. We're bringing you the reports from our reporters. Let's bring in CNN senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic, who was actually inside the High Court today as the oral arguments played out. Joan, what stood out to you, and was there anything that you would be able to discern that we, just hearing it, would not? (LAUGHTER)",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, it was incredibly gripping right there in the room, Jake.I cannot -- I cannot overstate just the suspense going into it and then just hearing those questions, realizing the direction they were going, which is much further in a direction than I think any of us might have predicted. Just to talk about some of the people in the room, Jack Smith is sitting there at the same table as Michael Dreeben, who was defending his position, John Sauer defending President Trump, Jane Roberts, one of -- chief justice's wife there, Patrick Jackson, husband of newest judges -- justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson. The room was filled with many dignitaries just trying to hear all this. And what they heard was an argument from the justices that went more in the favor of Donald Trump than I think some people were anticipating. He might not win on the whole shebang of absolute immunity here, but the questions really showed how sympathetic they were to his position and how skeptical they were to Jack Smith's side as articulated by government lawyer Michael Dreeben. And I will tell you the surest sign of that, nature of the questions and then the fact that John Sauer did not even offer a rebuttal. I mean, he had a free five minutes at the end or close to that to reinforce his points. And I think he heard most of the justices themselves make those points. First of all, the kinds of, I wouldn't call them quite off-ramps, but detours before a trial would be something that we weren't sure -- we thought was kind of baked into the question the justices took up, official acts versus private acts, just what is at issue here. Jack Smith says it doesn't matter, that anything that has been charged here is something that can go to trial. But then a question that came from Justice Kavanaugh, Donald Trump's second appointee to the Supreme Court, asking about, should any criminal law that the president be subject to have a clear statement that it would have to cover the president? That is a very high bar for prosecution of the president under these kinds of charges, because, of course, the president isn't singled out in any of these. That was another point. And then the overlay, Jake, was really interesting in terms of the justices' fears about overzealous prosecution, the checks on the government, a grand jury, the attorney general, anyone who would have a hand in bringing a prosecution against a president. They were concerned about a certain unfairness, retribution. And any time Michael Dreeben tried to really push the justices toward the actual acts that are -- that are at issue here and the kinds of crimes, they were brushed away by the more conservative justices. Samuel Alito kept saying, I don't really want to talk about the offenses here. Neil Gorsuch said that. It fell to Justice Sonia Sotomayor to really stress what was at issue. And Michael Dreeben kept pounding away, pounding away on the allegations against former President Trump and his disruption of the peaceful transfer of power -- Jake.",

Donald Trump sees the presidency as protection. That is why he wanted to stay in office, because he had all these potential things around him that were looming, cases that he wanted to avoid. And that very idea might have been the thing that drove Trump to try to hang on to power as much as possible. So, look, you can look at it the way that Alito is looking at it, but I do think that we're experiencing actually quite the opposite. And if there is not anything in the law to deter people from going into office to protect themselves from doing criminal things, then, basically, the presidency becomes the very monarchy that the founders didn't want.",

This New York trial is under way. The Georgia election subversion case, no set date. The classified documents case, supposed to start in May, but the judge there has constantly pushed the bar down the road. So it's possible, it is possible that the New York case is the only case resolved before the election, maybe some of the others. My question politically is, 193 days, America votes. Many Americans will vote early, but that's Election Day, 193 days away. If this goes back to the trial court, and then there are decisions made, and that's appealed up to the appeals court, this all being in the news -- there may not be resolution. Donald Trump does not want to be convicted before the election, because even a lot of Republicans say, if he is convicted, that would make them think twice about voting. Enough Republicans to swing the election think they would think twice. But is this just constantly being in the news, helps them raise money, but does it help them with the small universe of voters who will decide who wins?",

If every president is fearful that they may be treated by their successor to a criminal prosecution, then would that mean that, at the end of every single four-year period, you have got a president who starts to self-pardon? He also said happily, we have never had the opportunity to address the issue of self-pardon. He doesn't want it. I'm sure it's now being teed up. Another part of it was also mentioned, you talked about Bill Barr, attorney general. One of the things Justice Alito mentioned was the idea of, well, are -- if -- would it be a defense to your conduct if you had a preapproval by your attorney general that what you were doing was not illegal? Would that give you a safe space, to which they said, yes, it would? Now, he then said, hold on, does that not incentivize you to appoint somebody to be your attorney general who becomes essentially your yes- man? I know you have written about the hatchet man in your book as well, Elie, and thinking about this. Well, the response was, well, we have got structures in place, through the whole confirmation process, that will protect us against that.

That's for the fact-finder. PHILLIP:  I do think it was just another line that struck out to me from Justice Sotomayor where she said, the framers did not put immunity in the Constitution. And she noted they could have. They knew what it was. There were other examples of it at the time. They didn't do it.

Ultimately, \"The National Enquirer\" AMI, Pecker's company, buys the rights to the story from Karen McDougal for $150,000. And then there's this interesting dispute between the Trump camp. They don't want to pay. Shockingly, Donald Trump's people don't want to pay for something. AMI wants to get paid. Ultimately, they just back off and AMI says, you know what, we're going to pay for this. Donald Trump's team does not end up paying for that.

There's some concern, actually, on \"The National Enquirer\"'s part that what they're doing may violate campaign finance laws, very important detail.
