X-odus, Twitter-like Bluesky adding one million users a day. We'll speak to the platform to understand why. And boxing and some buffering. 60 million Netflix viewers see Jake Paul beat Mike Tyson despite tech glitches galore. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, President Joe Biden giving Ukraine permission to use long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. The Kremlin calls the move throwing \"oil on the fire,\" quote. It comes as Moscow deploys around 50,000 troops to the southern Kursk region where Kyiv launched its surprise counteroffensive in the summer. Washington says more than 11,000 North Korean troops are now operating there. This also comes after one of Russia's largest attacks on Ukraine in months. At least 10 people lost their lives in Monday's missile attack on the southern city of Odessa, according to authorities. Well, Nick Paton Walsh joins us now. Nick, good to have you with us. It's being considered as a provocative, a controversial decision here in the United States, but it does feel like it follows a similar pattern and that it's almost at the point where it feels too late that the United States relents and provides the support that Ukraine has been asking for. How much of a difference will it make?",

Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announcing Monday that it will begin selling its popular weight loss drug Wegovy in China after receiving Beijing's approval earlier this year. The company already sells the diabetes drug Ozempic in China. And it's way ahead of competitor Eli Lilly, who has approval to sell but is not yet available there. China is also considered a prime market for weight loss drugs. Surveys show that more than half of Chinese adults are considered overweight, and that amounts to more than a half a billion people, more than the entire population of the United States. Jared Holz joins us now. He's a healthcare equity strategist at Mizuho. Jared, fantastic to have you with us. I feel like all the emphasis on these weight loss drugs is pushed towards the United States, probably because I believe in Wegovy's case, it costs more than $1,300 a month. So, it comes down to price. Just talk to us about the Chinese market opportunity for all of these players.",

You mentioned more than a billion people in China. And the statistics are overwhelming there, just like they are here with respect to the percentage of adults that are overweight or obese. So, when we look at the pricing dynamics of, you know, over $1,000 per month or per treatment regimen here, it's probably closer to $150, $200, $250 In China. So, there's a big pricing differential, but I think when with Novo Nordisk and Lily, they will hope that the volume will more than offset that, which it probably will.",

We learned ashort time ago he's tapped former Congressman Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary. And he's casting a wide net, too, for secretary of the treasury, according to sources. Possible picks now include Kevin Warsh, a former governor of the Federal Reserve, as well as Marc Rowan, co- founder of Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. Meanwhile, Elon Musk had been pushing for Cantor Fitzgerald's chief executive, Howard Lutnick. Kristen Holmes joins us now from West Palm Beach. You and I were talking a couple of hours ago on Quest Means Business that perhaps the message is if you promote yourself, if you push too much and you look like you're telling the president-elect that you should have the job or where you should be, you kind of get replaced and other options are looked at. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Julia. I mean, that sounds exactly like what has happened with Howard Lutnick. I've been talking to sources all day about when we're actually going to hear about secretary of treasury. Obviously, this is one of the bigger posts, and it is surprising that we haven't gotten an answer yet. They still are telling me that this is in the works. These conversations are being had. Those two last people that you just mentioned, Kevin and Marc, who are expanding that list there, they were meeting at Mar-a-Lago today with Donald Trump as he continues to try and work out who he is going to actually pick for this position. But in the case of Howard Lutnick, we know that when it came to Scott Besson, who had been the top front runner, a hedge fund manager, that Howard essentially walked in and said that he wanted that position as well. Well, that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. We're told that even rubbed former president, now President-Elect Donald Trump the wrong way, using that position to kind of promote yourself, as you noted, those are things that don't go over well when it comes to Trump world. So, now the list is expanded. How this actually works out, we'll wait and see. They were supposed to have meetings today, but clearly, they had a couple of other pieces of business to attend to first, as you mentioned, naming the secretary of transportation, and Sean Duffy was something that they got done today.",

He served in Wisconsin, but after that, and before that as well, he was a reality TV star, but now, he is a big Fox contributor. He continues to appear on Fox all the time. And his wife is on Fox as well, and he himself has co-hosted a show on Fox Business called The Bottom Line. The reason why we bring this up in terms of his television experience is we know that something that's really important to the president-elect, part of the transition process that he has done is actually watch video clips of these various candidates to see how they perform on TV. They don't want any surprises. And also, Donald Trump wants people who can defend him on television. He still believes that TV is the biggest medium, that's the best way to communicate. And so, he's looking at people across the board who he believes can, quote/unquote, \"effectively communicate.\" That's the term that I've heard over and over again from these senior advisers. And part of that is being somebody who can be on television. Clearly, Sean Duffy has that same criteria. And he's not the only one. If you look across at Kristi Noem, who's often on TV, Matt Gaetz, always on TV defending Donald Trump. These are all people who have pushed forward Trump's agenda, but not just behind the scenes, not just at press conferences, but gone on the airwaves to do so. And clearly Sean Duffy fits into that criteria as well.",

You know, people love to hate on Spirit Airlines, but you should care about this even if you don't fly on Spirit, because it really changed the industry, ushered in the term ultra-low-cost carry, really a pioneer in that, and that forced major airlines to introduce the notorious Basic Economy Fair. But the bottom line here is, this could have big implications for every other U.S. airline, a competitive industry. So, this might, keyword might, Lead to ticket prices going up on other airlines. Here's the good news. If you have a ticket or a credit on Spirit Airlines, you will not notice any change for now. Spirit insisted a statement that guests can continue to book and fly without interruption and can use all tickets, credits, and loyalty points as normal. Also, no impact on workers. We're hearing from Spirit's Flight Attendants Union that they will remain on the job. Their contract is in place. No changes of pay or benefits. So, no immediate job furloughs, like we saw airlines begin to do during the pandemic. Also, Spirit underscores that vendors will continue to be paid. Big questions now about what will happen to Spirit Airlines in the long run. Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022. Just a few months after that, JetBlue tried to do the exact same thing, but its acquisition of Spirit was blocked by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds. Frontier ended its merger plans with Spirit earlier this month. So, that means no apparent lifelines left for Spirit Airlines, saddled with about $3 billion in debt. So, now, it's really on passengers to pay attention here. A top airline consumer advocate tells me that flights could start to get eliminated in the months ahead. So, it's especially important to sign up for alerts and check the flight status online obsessively. Silver lining here is that this is unlikely to have an impact on Thanksgiving or holiday travel with the Thanksgiving rush here in the U.S. just a few days away. Julia.",

Netflix says a staggering 60 million households tune in to watch boxing legend Mike Tyson take on social media star Jake Paul. Paul won the fight via unanimous decision after eight rounds, but many say the match was a little underwhelming with the bigger fight being the one Netflix had against its own technical issues. Don Riddell is here with more. We can talk about the Netflix platform, which I think is interesting, Don, but I want to talk about the fight. I mean, Tyson is a little old. I'm not being ageist.

And this guy has been incredibly good at carving out a niche for himself in the boxing world in a very untraditional way and making it work for himself. He's not had that many fights. But, you know, it's remarkable that he was able to get himself into a position where he could talk Mike Tyson out of retirement and get him back into the ring and set up this fight, which made both of them, I'm sure, millions and millions of dollars. It was massively, massively hyped. And a lot of fans, of all generations, from what I can gather, were really invested in this fight. I think one of the unwritten rules about sport is the more you hype anything, the less exciting it's going to be. And I think that was the case here. And it was perhaps inevitable that the fight was a bit of a dud. But it was definitely a landmark moment for the broadcast/streaming industry because this, I think, clearly is where things are going to go from here. Netflix have acknowledged the issues. And I actually, after the fight, I spoke to one of the men who helped promote the event and this is how he described it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NAKISA BIDARIAN, CO-FOUNDER, MOST VALUABLE PROMOTIONS:  I mean, the number one reason is the event broke the internet. There's never been a streaming event of this magnitude in history. We had the highest streaming viewership in the history of the United States. We had the biggest viewership of women's sport in the United States ever. And what's even more impressive is we had the biggest attendance that Mike Tyson has ever fought in front of his whole career. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
