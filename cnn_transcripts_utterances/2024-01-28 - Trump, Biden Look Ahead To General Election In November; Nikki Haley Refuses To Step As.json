And by the way, that helps Joe Biden because she's a Republican attacking the Republican likely nominees, so that helps the Democrat. Despite her being there, it is now essentially a general election contest and he has to go after Donald Trump and do it in some ways harshly because the Republicans really until now with Nikki Haley were wary of pointing out these obvious flaws in Donald Trump's candidacy and in a way it falls to Biden to do it.",

It would require an upset for the ages for her to turn this around, partly because she's now on, despite being in her home state, it's relatively hostile territory for her. All of the party big weeks in her state have lined up with Donald Trump.It's not the state, politically, that it was when it made her governor in 2010. Instead, it's become very, you know, MAGA, very Make America Great Again, very Trumpian. And that makes it so hard for her. The other states that follow, there's not many that are congenial for her. Bottom line is Donald Trump is popular among Republicans, and that's pretty handy if you're trying to win the Republican nomination. Nevertheless, the longer she stays in, it is significant because there will be some of those dissenting Republicans. That's where the 25% figure I referred to before refers to in New Hampshire. There was that sort of number. That's a big number of dissident Republicans who do not like Trump. And those people can rally to her again, when independence can vote, they help her. And every day she stays in, it's good news for Joe Biden because it means the Republicans are fighting each other rather than fighting him. And because, as I mentioned, it provokes Donald Trump to get angry. He does not like anybody, but particularly, Trump record suggests women standing up to him and not falling into line. We see that in the E. Jean Carroll case, that huge $83 million sum that he has been -- that he has to pay out to her for defaming her, the advice columnist. That, and Nikki Haley, it all keeps in the mind of many of those suburban swing voters, the sum of those personality traits they do not like about Donald Trump. And when, you know, Donald -- Joe Biden always says, don't compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative. Until now, people couldn't see clearly that alternative. The alternative is Donald Trump, and he has to hope that somehow, in that comparison, he comes with all his flaws, he comes out the best. So that's why the Niki Haley candidacy may not win. I think it's almost certainly will not win, but it has a huge impact on the 2024 race.",

This U.S.-provided M109 Paladin Howitzers near Bakhmut is often silent because they don't have enough shells to target the Russians, the commander tells us. We cannot fulfill our tasks 100%, he says, although we really want to. My crew and other crews are just waiting for it and are ready to work around the clock. But it gets even worse.

It's almost like firing cannon balls in medieval times. But the commander says, sometimes, it's all they can do. Every shell that is suitable for the Paladin, we use, he says. It's better than no shells. The Russians face no such shortages in this area. Ukrainian military intelligence believes Russia produced around 2 million rounds last year and acquired around 1 million from North Korea. Massive barrages have laid waste to Bakhmut and much of the surrounding area. At the headquarters of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade's artillery division, the frustration is palpable. From their drones, they can see the Russians gather to continue their assaults on Ukrainian positions. But they often can't take them out because they need to conserve ammunition, the commander tells me. The ratio is about ten to one, he says. Ammunition is very important to us. Russia is a country that produces ammo. They have strategic reserves. Yes, they use old Soviet systems, but Soviet systems can still kill. Even without enough ammo, the Ukrainians say they are stopping most Russian assaults here. And the M-109 crew did manage to fire at Russian positions.

We intend to free all the 136 hostages to get them back home. And the best way of doing that is to apply pressure on Hamas. That is what is being done right now as we speak. We're destroying Hamas. We've killed thousands of these terrorists. We have dismantled hundreds of miles of terror tunnels and infrastructure in Gaza. We will continue to do so until Hamas is destroyed.
