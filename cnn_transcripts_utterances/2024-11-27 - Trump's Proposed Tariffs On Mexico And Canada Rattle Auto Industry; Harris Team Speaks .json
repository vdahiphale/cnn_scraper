She did not wade into any of the blame game. She did not offer any reasons for why she believes that her team lost. But she did notably reference the very short timeframe of her campaign -- only 107 days -- saying that she believes what they were able to achieve during that time, she said, was unprecedented. And she had this message for her supporters going forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I know this is an uncertain time. I'm clear-eyed about that. I know you're clear- eyed about it and it feels heavy. And I just have to remind you don't you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power that you did before November 5.

And they were, to put it lightly, much more blunt about what they thought went wrong in the campaign, namely blaming the very short duration that they had, saying that it did not give Harris enough time to distinguish herself in this selection. That she couldn't -- she didn't -- wasn't able to craft her message to appeal to more Democrats.Put bluntly, David Plouffe who was, of course, a senior adviser to her, said there was a price to be paid for the short campaign. So, Kate, certainly much more to learn from the Harris campaign's team post-mortem of what went wrong.

Guys, thanks for being here.Charlie, let's talk about these tariffs just as John and Vanessa were talking about it. Chuck Grassley, a top Republican senator -- he told Politico this and he was telling reporters this, Politico reporting. \"I'm concerned about the potential of it,\" when asked if he was worried about another trade war on the horizon. \"But,\" he says, \"right now, I see everything that Trump's doing on tariffs as a negotiating tool. And we'll have to wait and see how successful he is about that.\" As a negotiating tool it gets back to the question do you take him seriously? But should Republicans, do you think be worried about Trump and this negotiating tool and/or Trump implementing this? CHARLIE DENT, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, I think Sen. Grassley is right to be concerned because no state would probably have more to lose in a trade war than Iowa. Much of the corn of Iowa goes I'm sure to Mexico -- Mexico retaliates against tariffs. But as a negotiating tool, yes, Trump wants to use this -- these tariffs as bargaining chips. But he also wants to use these tariffs as a revenue source to help pay for or at least partially offset the reauthorization of the 2017 tax cuts. And so he wants to use this as a revenue source. So I think he's wanting to use this more than as a simple bargaining chip or a negotiating tool. I'm not sure what part of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 we didn't learn about. When you think about it, in 1930 we imposed 20 percent tariffs across the board, which exacerbated the Great Depression. Global trade after that dropped from $3 trillion to $1 trillion. So these tariffs, if implemented as proposed, would have devastating effects on American manufacturing and agriculture for all the reasons you just pointed out in the lead-up to this segment with all the various inputs coming in from other countries to make things here in the United States.",

That was a major problem for her.And so -- and, of course, they failed to respond on that transgender ad. I mean, where was the response? That seemed to me to be campaign malpractice. But the fact that Biden was so unpopular and most of the country saw it was on the wrong track, she was actually -- she was running into the wind much of this campaign. So this vote was perhaps a bit of a referendum on Joe Biden and inflation or their response to inflation more than anything else, and they could just never get out of their own way on that issue. But we're going to spend a lot of time trying to analyze and diagnose what went wrong, but I'd have to say those are the major fault lines for the Harris campaign.",

And to be perfectly honest, I'm not positive that her having had a longer amount of time would have ultimately been decisive but it could have helped.Look, what she did in that short period of time was when she became the nominee her own favorables were incredibly underwater by about 15 points. She was able to bring that up to if not positive then at least even. Also, perceptions of the economy. She was able to turn those around as well. Again, Democrats were way underwater. President Biden was way underwater in terms of how people viewed Democrats and the economy and their perception of how we would do better on it. But she was able to get that back up also to about even if not slightly positive. That's incredibly difficult to do, especially in a short period of time. Obviously, they raised bananas amounts of money. So I'm really not here to say that she could have done more. But what we saw, and you see this primarily when you're looking at non- battleground states versus battleground states, is that those headwinds were incredibly high. You know, six, seven, eight points in non-battleground states. The areas where we focused, the campaign was able to turn that around and get it incredibly close. Obviously, states like Wisconsin were decided by less than a point, right? So that's great work. If ultimately the headwinds were too strong for her it probably would have been too strong regardless of whether Joe Biden had gotten out six months before that as well.",

It's a much broader spectrum, correct?BABINEAUX-FONTENOT:  Oh, that's absolutely right. In fact, the fastest-growing segment of people turning to the charitable food system are people who don't qualify for federal nutrition programs -- working-class people. And, in fact, the people who are on federal nutrition programs, when you take away the elderly, people with special needs, and children, the vast majority of them have at least one job. So these are people who are out there working hard and simply cannot make ends meet because of other things that are happening to them.",

What was your major takeaway?BABINEAUX-FONTENOT:  Both that the situation is difficult and it's so inspirational to me. I've been to all 50 states, as you said, over 200 food banks. That includes Alaska and Puerto Rico. And every single place that I went I saw people, even in the middle of a global health pandemic, rolling their sleeves up and helping their neighbors. It gives me hope, it gives me optimism, and I'm also cautious in that optimism because I know that there are some big challenges that we're going to need to confront as a society.",
