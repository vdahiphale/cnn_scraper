But Priscilla's lawyers now say there are several issues with the document. They say Priscilla's name was spelled. Lisa Marie's signature doesn't look right. As you know, Lisa Marie is Elvis Presley's only child. She was laid to rest at his Graceland estate earlier this month.Joining us now to talk about this is CNN's chief business correspondent, and \"EARLY START\" anchor, Christine Romans.

It will always be mine, Graceland. It will always be. And when it is no longer mine, it will be my children's. And that is that.

And I think this study really gives us an idea of just how potentially damaging this can be.And so in this study, they basically looked at around a little over 400 children and they assessed their screen time as early as 12 months. And on average it was about two hours, which is a lot. And then they followed them for about nine years and they found that once the kids reached about nine years, they actually showed signs of decreased executive functioning and attention. What is executive functioning? It's really how we focus, how we pay attention, multitask, make decisions, plan. It's so critical to our professional academic success, our ability to mentally and emotionally regulate ourselves and function. So, these are really critical skills. And the other interesting part of this study is that around 18 months, some of these children had an EEG, which is a way of assessing brain function, and they already saw early changes on the EEG. Now, you can't definitively prove that it's the screen time that was associated with this and not something else in the home environment in that -",

So maybe parents who gave their kids screens, there was something else going on at home too.But the bottom line is, when a kid is looking at a screen at that young of an age, they're not -- their brain isn't developing in the normal way. They're not able to learn with that face-to-face interaction back and forth that they get with a parent. The hands on, the socialization. That 2D just doesn't cut it. And so this really fits with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations that under 18 months children should not be using screens unless they're using it to video chat with a family member.
