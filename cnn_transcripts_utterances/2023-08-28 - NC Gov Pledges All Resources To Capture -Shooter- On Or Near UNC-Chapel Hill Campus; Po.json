This is still very much so an active situation and you're seeing the police officers in tactical gear show up there on campus.The alert from the university went out to those in the area shortly after 1 PM Eastern with the alert saying that there was an armed and dangerous person on or near campus. We've since been told that this incident centered around the Bell Tower part of campus, which is the central part of the UNC campus. And we've been looking at video coming from our local affiliates of police in tactical gear escorting students, it appears, out of buildings with their hands up. Now, in the last 30 minutes, some students have been emerging. They no longer have their hands up and it seems as though they're no longer running out from those buildings, but it is still, as you could see, very much so active. College campus is very busy right now. The - this is the second week of classes, so the start of the second week of school and anxiety is very high because information is so scarce. UNC-Chapel Hill is a very open campus for those of us who have been there and the lockdown situation is still very much so active with students, we understand, still sheltered in place in some of those buildings.   They were calling this an active assailant situation with reports of shots fired coming in shortly after the 1 PM Eastern hour. There hasn't really been an update from police since then. We've been standing by. But shortly - just a short time ago, our producers in the control room sent me this statement from Gov. Roy Cooper, who tweeted out, \"I have spoken with Orange County Sheriff Blackwood, and Department of Public Safety Secretary Buffaloe and pledged all state resources needed to capture the shooter and protect the UNC campus.\" So that's coming from Democratic governor in North Carolina, Roy Cooper, a statement a short time ago. So this active assailant still on the loose right now. You're looking at video again and just shortly after 3 o'clock and you see some students there, it appears, with backpacks walking on campus with a heavy police presence, as well as ambulances in the area. We're keeping a close eye on this and we'll update you when we have more information, Brianna?",

There was about - around the 2 o'clock Eastern hour, we saw people running from these campuses - from these buildings on campus with their hands up and now you see a lot of officers just sort of standing around talking to one another. You see crowds of students walking in the background that just walked off camera there and we talked about this being the start of the second week of college classes. You remember, I'm sure, what it was like to start college and the anxiety that goes in with going back to school and being a freshman on campus. But this is an all too familiar scene in America. We just had what happened in Jacksonville, the nation's still reeling over that tragedy, only for us to start this week on Monday with reports of an active shooting on campus.

Obviously, they are incredibly busy dealing with the situation, which is underway at this point in time. We see people on phones in the video.

It's just that the language is clearly being - the language is different that we're hearing from law enforcement, and we don't know why that is. Was there - they're just talking about weaponry or an assault, that's scary enough to lead to a lockdown. So we don't know what that is. One has to - one can assume it's a gun, but that's sort of - we will wait to see if there are victims or others that we should be concerned about. I think the bigger thing right now is just within the last hour, looking at UNC, their Twitter feed, you have a massive lockdown just within the last hour and now you do have a person that - at least the - and I just want to make sure I get this right, the UNC Police are now showing a picture of an individual that they're looking for who appears to be a student. So you may have a very - we might have a very confined incident. I did want to go back to something that Nick was saying. Generation lockdown has gone to college. I mean, this is the same group of kids who were Sandy Hook, who got raised through Sandy Hook. The Sandy Hook kids would be nearing or in college at this stage - who are now in college. This group, this generation that we call, unfortunately, Generation Lockdown, is now - has all the training that a nation that has not addressed the gun problem has to give them to protect them. And many colleges and universities now require before the student can get into classes or get into the dorm room, emergency contacts. So what you're seeing is the deployment of these emergency response systems, getting to students through their phones and saying, stay put. And so this is - I don't like it, it's just the sophistication of an apparatus that has grown out of the tragedy of school shootings in America right now.",

I think we sort of don't realize how bizarre, if not sad that is as a nation, but the systems of notification to students, what we call reverse 911s. Lots of schools do not allow students to register or attend classes or get into their dorm room until they have emergency information, cell phone numbers, next of kin, your parents' numbers just in case anything happens, in particular an active shooter. You have a pretty sophisticated - and I've been following it all afternoon - communications alert system coming out of the university. It is - it stopped being active in the last 25 minutes. That could simply mean that they'll have an announcement hopefully about the end of this. They do have a picture up online of who the suspect is. They're not identifying who it is, although you can see some chatter on social media, but there is a formal picture out by the police.

She's reporting what happened as she was in the Wilson Library on campus and then sort of breaking down a little bit as she's speaking about what it's like to go through this. She said that she was at the library and after five minutes, she got an alert on her phone that there was an active shooter in the building next to her and that there was a police presence, and they filed a single file out of the building. She didn't see anything other than that, but obviously incredibly scared.",

Led police departments here in Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, Chief Ramsey, minutes ago, I was speaking to you about another shooting in another city in Jacksonville and now we are talking about this one here. But this one's still an active situation and I wonder, as we watch the police presence there, as we watch the word being distributed to students on campus, and the still open questions as to whether the shooter is still at large or have they made any contact with the shooter. Can you tell us what police are likely to be up to right now and focusing on?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think right now, they're just trying to get a handle on what exactly took place, who if - who is that they're looking for in this situation.One thing that I've learned over time is that when you have a situation like that that's unfolding, information - initial information is not usually all that accurate. So I heard a lot of discussion around whether or not - using the term shooter versus shooting and so forth. But I also and I - it's hard to tell when I'm looking at this, whether or not this is old footage or if this is coming in live, but there are a lot of police officers and they're standing around. I don't see the urgency that you would see if they were searching buildings because you think you've got a shooter inside and that sort of thing. So I'm just trying to kind of sort out exactly what it is that's going on. I'm sure they'll update us pretty soon or at least as soon as they can. But right now, it's difficult to tell whether or not this is something that occurred on campus, off campus, did someone saw a gun, were shots actually fired. If someone had been struck, I think we would be able to see something going on that would indicate that, ambulances or something like that if there were actual victims at this point in time. I don't see any of that. That's a good sign, just the police so far.",

They alerted a security officer there who responded. You wonder what led to this here. Was it eyewitness? Did they hear something? And that's an open question, one we're still trying to get answered.",

We had heard earlier reports from our affiliates that there were some activity in the area of the Bell Tower, which as we understand is sort of central to campus. That is very close to the Wilson Library where the student was.But again, she didn't see anything and we haven't spoken to anyone who has, but the governor himself at this point calling this a shooting, referring to a shooter as he is pledging resources to help find a shooter and to protect UNC-Chapel Hill. Chief, he is saying that law enforcement is talking about an armed and dangerous suspect, warning people that if they see someone they believe to be the suspect, obviously to keep their distance and to report to law enforcement. I don't know. We should also remind people we have this sort of one vantage point and oftentimes, Chief, we are restricted in covering these kinds of events to a vantage point like this. So what are the realm of possibilities where you see they are bringing students off campus here and are these live pictures or are these from moments ago, Michelle (ph)? These are live pictures, Chief, just to be clear. So these are live pictures that you're looking at of all of these emergency vehicles parked there and students have been trickling out here just over the minutes. What do you make of that?",
