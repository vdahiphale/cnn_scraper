And the Southwest Airlines meltdown drags on now for an 8th day with thousands more flights canceled. Will Southwest get back to a full schedule tomorrow, as the company claims? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin this hour in Ukraine after one of the biggest Russian missile assaults since the start of the Russian invasion. Let's go straight to the capital Kyiv.

In the city of Kharkiv, four missiles hit what's being described as critical infrastructure.And we got a statement just a little while ago, Wolf, from the head of the power company putting a somewhat darker turn to this day when many Ukrainian officials were happy with the amount of missiles that were intercepted. The head of the power company said that there has been significant damage to the power generating system in Ukraine, and he said the company is having difficulty providing electricity -- to restoring electricity to parts of Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odessa, Mykolaiv, Kherson and Lviv. That's basically all the major cities in Ukraine. So, they may be taking some comfort Ukrainian officials from the fact that they were able to intercept 54 out of the 69 missiles fired today in addition to eleven drones. But clearly significant damage has been wreaked upon the already battered electrical system here in Ukraine, Wolf.",

It's, as you said, cold. These holidays, the New Year's holiday, which is just upon us is really one of the biggest holidays of the year, and keep pounding Ukrainians, remove any type of hope that this is ever going to win. And then also today we had statements by the foreign minister and the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry saying, any idea that we are going to agree to, the peace supplement that Zelenskyy has proposed, forget it, it is delusional. And so, I think what they're trying to do is exactly put up that front and say, this is never going to end. And it's a message both to Ukrainians and I think to the Russian people, too, but also to the west. Don't even think that this is going to end, and you will have to keep supporting them.

You can't match them tube for tube. Well, you know, that may be what we say, because we don't have that artillery, but this war is rapidly evolving into a World War I, kind of trench warfare where the Russians are really in placing their positions in Donbass.

This is really going to be a gold mine for them as they assess whether they should bring charges against the former president or his associates related to January 6. The former president's legal team tells me they are not terribly concerned about this particular criminal investigation. They believe that it's a very high bar for the Justice Department to bring charges. And even though the committee has laid out their case and what they say is a road map for bringing charges, they don't think that the Justice Department will likely agree.

There may be new leads that they have. And for DOJ, who's been asking for these transcripts for a long time, it's a double edged sword. Because when you have this kind of presentation before congressional committee versus a grand jury where you can really kind of curate the testimony of some, they've got the good, bad and the ugly in there.And there certainly could be pieces of it which might be exculpatory or at least confusingly ambiguous to it.

Now, obviously, a lot of first responders have developed health conditions after 9/11. So we asked Santos for comment to clarify these discrepancies. We have not heard back. But our KFILE team has uncovered a number of other false claims and fabrications that Santos made. That includes that he went to a fancy private school in New York and was forced to drop out when his family fell on hard times. The school says no record of him actually attending the school. Another claim he made was that his mother had a historically Jewish last name. He used that same last name to set up some GoFundMe accounts. But genealogists, working with CNN, found that there's no evidence of that last name in his family tree. In fact, no evidence whatsoever of Jewish or Ukrainian heritage. So this is all coming, of course, as the legal scrutiny is starting to intensify around him. There are both local and federal investigations, including the Nassau County District Attorney's office.

And here, I think, you know, there's very little of that. Wolf, briefly, I think there's three ways this resolves itself.

And the second way would be political. I doubt there are two-thirds of the House that would vote to expel him and then the legal, and that's -- those investigations that are coming forward.

The state Attorney General is probably going to look at this nonprofit that dealt with animal welfare, but it seems to be fictitious, the organization. He's also got the local district attorney.

Are there other filings regarding his assets or were there misrepresentations as to his assets to secure other loans? I think all of those things will be ripe for subpoena.

And you see it from the cockpit of a U.S. aircraft, an RC-135 Rivet Joint, which is a rather large reconnaissance aircraft with a crew of about 30 people inside.You can already see how close you are, then you see the two aircraft drifting even closer together. That's when Indo-Pacific Command says, this was an unsafe maneuver by that Chinese J-11, the RC-135 Rivet Joint, the U.S. jet descended away. You can see as they go farther apart there so that there wasn't any closer interaction between the two or the risk of a collision there. And that, of course, is the great concern here. This only adding detention between Beijing and Washington, and there's certainly already enough of that here. Here you see the tension also around the South China Sea. China insisting that most of the disputed body of water is its sovereign territory. The U.S. not recognizing that claim, insisting it will fly and sail wherever international law allows. Wolf, there are generally interactions between aircraft as different militaries in the air that are safe and professional. A defense official says this was certainly not one of those and they will raise it with China's military through the appropriate channels.",

The most important, respect the people.RIDDELL (voice-over): Raised in the slums of Sao Paulo in the 1940s, Edson Arantes do Nascimento discovered football at a young age. He made his debut for Santos at the age of just 16. And within a year, he was scoring goals for the Brazilian national team. By this time, he was better known by his nickname Pele. And in 1958, at 17, he became the youngest man to play in a World Cup final, scoring twice as Brazil beat Sweden. It was the first of three world titles he'd help win for his country. He electrified audiences with his fancy footwork and ability to score seemingly impossible goals. So it was something of a disappointment that his 1000th goal was a penalty.",

For Pele, that was half a lifetime ago. But his infectious love of the game ensured that he remained relevant. He served as a U.N. ambassador for ecology and the environment. He rubbed shoulders with state leaders all over the world, and he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth in 1997.
