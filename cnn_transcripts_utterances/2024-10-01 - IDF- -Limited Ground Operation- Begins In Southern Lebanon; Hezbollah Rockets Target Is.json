The U.S. says Israel informed it of a number of operations, including the ground incursion, and a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that the mission can be a risk that the White House will keep discussing that with the Israelis.

First, nobody is interested in full-scale war. Then comes the bombardments from the air, all kind of operations. Then it will be very, very limited ground operation, limited in time, limited in territory.And few weeks later, how we might be in the outskirts of Lebanon of Beirut. And then -- and then comes the main question, how do we get out from there? Because entering Lebanon is the easy side, the easy step. Look what happens in Gaza. Israel is deeply stuck in Gaza without having any idea how to get out from there and what to do with Gaza. Same is expecting us now in Lebanon, we will start a ground operation. It will get complicated. I'm sorry, I'm so pessimistic but experience taught us that that's the way things are going, especially with the mud of Lebanon.",

All those things were not even challenged.And in any case, Israel as Israel shows the military option as the first one.

The thing is to try to solve it really once and for all, like of everyone is wishing.But once and for all is never a military solution. Once and for all is always a diplomatic solution. Look at our relations with Jordan and with Egypt. This is once for and for all, because we have a peace treaties with them. And we even don't challenge it, don't try it.
