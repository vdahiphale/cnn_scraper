We're breaking down the legal threat to Trump as prosecutors must decide whether to indict him.And we're also getting new information about Trump's political peril with his 2024 White House campaign already under way, his team sharing new warnings with the former president about his ongoing fixation with the last election. And breaking news, Chief Justice John Roberts just ordered a temporary freeze on plans to end a Trump-era border policy this week. We'll go live to the southern border as we assess how this might impact the growing influx of migrants from Mexico. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.

They are about rioters. And we even are seeing right now, there's another Oath Keeper seditious conspiracy trial that's teed up for the coming months.

It says in part, while this stage of the litigation proceeds, we will continue our preparations to manage the border in a safe, orderly and humane way when the Title 42 public health order lifts. We urge Congress to use this time to provide the funds we have asked for border security and management and advance the comprehensive immigration measures President Biden proposed on his first day of office. There're two elements there that I think are important to focus on. One there has been intensive work behind the scenes with the Department of Homeland Security but also senior officials at the White House in preparation for the lifting of Title 42. They are very cognizant of the fact that there will be a surge of migrants at the border, and they need to both surge -- personnel surge, technology and infrastructure but also they are weighing new potential rules related to asylum as it pertains to try to manage what's coming next. So, the Department of Homeland Security has put out six kind of top line principles that they were using as they prepare for this moment. Those principles include surging enforcement, working with NGOs, kind of setting the stage for processing speed, those types of elements there, as they work through things right now. But I think the bottom line here, that we're hearing from administration officials given the extent of the effort going into this, given the very real concern about what may happen when Title 42 lifts, is that they are still preparing for whenever it lifts knowing that this stay may only be temporary, and they need to be ready when it does lift, if it does in the near term.

There are thousands of migrants there who are waiting for the lifting of Title 42.Now, I've been in contact with migrants there as well as a nonprofit organization that is helping all these migrants. And the director of the nonprofit tells me that there's about 2,000 migrants there living in squalor, a lot of them living on the streets or camping out in those tents that you're taking a look at from the air. Now, according to two migrants who I just got off the phone with who are in that camp, who are living in the streets, they were jumping with joy because the Supreme Court kept Title 42 in place. Now, if that sounds counterintuitive, it is, because what Title 42 allows immigration agents to do to swiftly return migrants to Mexico. But here's why it makes sense in their mind. They say that the U.S. government has offered so many exceptions to Title 42 that allows them to walk to the port of entry that you see behind me here in Brownsville, Matamoros, that they would rather do that. Because the thing is these migrants say they don't want to enter into the United States illegally. They would rather get in line and allow for immigration agents to process them. They want to seek asylum. They want to be able to do it legally, Brianna. And that's why it's so counterintuitive because they are happy that Title 42 is staying in place is what they're telling.",

I think one of the challenges is that I think Kevin McCarthy put forth some names that were just not acceptable names, they weren't appropriate. And so we wound up with too few Republicans on that committee. So, there are going to be some people who will look at the committee with kind of a side-eye glance.But I think they've had a professional approach. They were dogged. They were determined. And they were also media savvy enough to make sure that the American public who wanted to tune in could understand what they were doing. But the key here is that you cannot run for president, you cannot serve as president if you participated in an insurrection. That's been true since the civil war. And so if this sticks, if the Department of Justice takes this seriously, you could see for the first time ever a presidential candidate disqualified to even run because of what happened  on January 6th.",

The Fed just raised rates again and that does not sound good for the future of the economy. You're going to hear him talk about that and the border.

Are they going to come up with a plan? What are they going to do about the fact that we have higher interest rates? What are they going to do about health care costs? These are things that Republicans need to be -- they need to have a plan for it. And because they didn't have a plan in the last election, they very seriously underperformed. And, by the way, in response to the last question, Brianna, I have to tell you. Donald Trump doesn't call me up and ask me what his message ought to be.

We have some significant breaking news out of California where a jury has reached a verdict in the sexual assault case against Harvey Weinstein.CNN's Natasha Chen is joining us live. She is outside of the courthouse there in Los Angeles with details here. Natasha, tell us what the jury decided. NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Brianna, the jury decided that Harvey Weinstein was guilty on three out of the seven counts here. And those three counts are all related to the same Jane Doe accuser. There were four women who accused him in this case, causing the allegations for the seven counts in total. Again, those three guilty counts are all related to the same person. As far as the other accusers, he was found not guilty on another sexual assault count. And the jury was actually hung on some other scenarios, some other issues. And so, the mistrial was declared on other counts. So, again, three out of the seven counts he was found guilty. Now, the jury deliberated for 41 hours in this Los Angeles trial. It's much longer than the jury in New York deliberated for that case where he has already been convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. So, when this trial was going on, he was behind bars in custody here throughout this case. And, with this case now, they will be looking at a sentencing range if he had been found guilty of all of these counts, he would have been looking at 60 years to life. We'll be looking for more information now about what this means now that only three counts he has been found guilty on. This is interesting because he's actually appealing the New York case. And so depending on how that appeal goes, this result could be very important for how long he remains in prison, Brianna.",

And if that case were to be overturned, then this case in California then serves as a way to have him serving time notwithstanding what happens in New York.
