He's known as a master strategist who has spent many years building key structures across the country in key battleground states. And those states delivered massively for him, particularly in the north. Elections in Nigeria, a one in rural areas, many of Peter Obi's supporters the main, the opposition candidates, who many were saying was a third force candidate, many of them urban middle class voters.And whilst there were sizable a number, they were just not enough to come up against the other parts of the country with the rural voters who were always going to support the ruling party. And Tinubu has called for appeal, as appeal to the opposition candidates who are rejecting this mandate and who are saying that the results were rigged, and actually called for the Electoral Commission chairman to stand out. In his acceptance speech, Tinubu said, this is a serious mandate. I hereby accepted. I'll be your servant, and not to be your leader to work with you to make Nigeria a great country. I take this opportunity to appeal to my fellow contestants, let us team up together. It's the only nation we have. It is one country and we must build together. Let's work together to put broken pieces together. Now, the opposition party candidates have not released a statement this morning yet, but I spoke earlier to one of the spokesman who says they will be holding a joint press conference later today to react to this when. So Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar will be holding a joint press conference later. We don't know what they're going to say but most likely along the same lines that we've heard previously. Now, Tinubu faces an uphill task. This country is deeply riven by religious lines, ethnic lines and now a generational line. Many young voters will be waking up disappointed this morning that their candidate Peter Obi did not win. He was seen as a reformist candidate against Bola Tinubu, who is very much part of the establishment. A veteran politician here very respected, but very much part of the establishment in a country that many young people are leaving in droves and saying it's not working for them. John.",

So you know China's spy balloon, that made a lot of headlines but cyber hacking seems to be where the real action actually is.

NOONAN: You know, John, I think that report is largely confirmation of what many of us in the industry have understood for decades now. And I think you are exactly right that the spy balloon was interesting but the cybersecurity threat from China is far more pervasive, far more persistent and in the long term I think potentially far more lethal.
