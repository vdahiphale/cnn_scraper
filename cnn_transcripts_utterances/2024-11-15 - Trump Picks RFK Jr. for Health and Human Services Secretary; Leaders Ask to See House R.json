It is Friday, November the 15th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Palm Beach, Florida, where Donald Trump attended a gala at Mar-a-Lago and spoke about some of his controversial picks for top posts, many with pretty questionable credentials.The latest is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a conspiracy theorist who has loudly spread misinformation about vaccines. Trump has chosen him to lead up America's Department of Health and Human Services. The scion of one of America's most famous families is vowing to make America healthy again. Trump applauded him on Thursday, saying he'll do unbelievable things. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECT: Today, I nominated him for, I guess, if you like health, and if you like people that live a long time, it's the most important position, RFK Jr. And I just looked at the news reports. People like you, Bobby. Don't get too popular, Bobby. You know, you've reached about the level now. We want you to come up with things and ideas and what you've been talking about for a long time.

Collins is a lawyer and veteran who served in Iraq. He's currently an Air Force Reserve Chaplain. Trump announced North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as his choice to be Secretary of the Interior. And he looked to his personal defense team to fill a key slot of the Justice Department, tapping Todd Blanche as Deputy Attorney General. Blanche played a central role in the Manhattan hush money and classified documents cases against Trump.Now, new this hour, Trump's choice for U.S. Defense Secretary was once involved in a police investigation into an alleged sexual assault. According to California officials, National Guard veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth was actually charged and he was not directly named as the alleged perpetrator. But the magazine Vanity Fair reports that Hegseth claimed the sexual encounter was consensual, citing two sources. The assault allegedly happened in 2017 at a hotel in Monterey, California. The city said in a statement it would not release the full police report, citing state law and did not indicate what became of the investigation either. Meanwhile, outrage is growing over Trump's audacious choice for Attorney General Matt Gaetz. After getting the nod from Trump, the Florida House Republican resigned from Congress and a House Ethics Committee that was supposed to release a report into his behavior as early as Friday has cancelled plans to do so. Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are insisting the findings be released. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBAN (D-IL): The timing of Mr. Gaetz's resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report.

She, from day one, clarified the reason for Russia's special operation in Ukraine, the anchor says, criticizing the actions of the Biden administration. Gabbard's words in 2022, right after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, caused even panelists on Russian state TV to cynically ask if she's a Kremlin agent. Yes, the host said, without providing any evidence. But the Russians ripping into designated Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. Waltz at the Republican convention proposed deploying more American drones in the Black Sea and bragged about how Trump threatened to bomb, as he put it, Putin's Kremlin, the anchor says.

Late last week, as the U.S. State Department lowered its travel advisory for El Salvador, citing a significant reduction in crime, it also warned that Bukele's emergency measures allow authorities to arrest anyone suspected of gang activity and suspends constitutional rights. And yet most we meet seem unfazed by the added show of force.",

Some think it is far too extreme. But when you speak to the folks on the ground in El Salvador, and we've made multiple trips there, even those who disagree with Bukele's tactics will tell you they're incredibly happy with the outcome. They feel far safer, safer than they've ever felt before in their own country. Many of them will say that as extreme as those tactics are, they were necessary to eradicate the gangs that really took control of the country for so many years.
