Well U.S. aid to Ukraine will be on center stage this week as the U.S. House of Representatives returns from a two-week recess on Wednesday.With Ukraine's leader blaming recent losses on a lack of assistance, President Joe Biden plans to ratchet up the pressure in a meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday. Talks will include House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has refused to bring a Senate bill including $60 billion for Ukraine up for a vote. Pentagon and national security officials are also calling on Johnson to allow a vote on the bipartisan Senate bill. CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: The White House is ratcheting up pressure on House Republicans to pass $60 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, saying that the country faces a dire situation and is running low on ammunition. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan taking it a step further on Sunday and calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to take it up and take it up immediately. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, the reality is that Putin gains every day that Ukraine does not get the resources it needs and Ukraine suffers. And there is a strong bipartisan majority in the House standing ready to pass this bill if it comes to the floor. And that decision rests on the shoulders of one person. And history is watching whether Speaker Johnson will put that bill on the floor. If he does, it will pass, we'll get Ukraine what it needs for Ukraine to succeed. If he doesn't, then we will not be able to give Ukraine the tools required for it to stand up to Russia. And Putin will be the major beneficiary of that.",

He also said tens of thousands of civilians have died in territory occupied by Russian forces. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers.CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments.

But, you know, you continue again to see these kind of morning flares at the edge of the race here. Trump won a dominant victory here, as he did in New Hampshire. But something like 80 percent of Haley voters in both states said they do not believe he will be fit to be president if he is convicted of a crime. All of this hangs over the Republican Party, as does the question of him trying to channel campaign contributions to pay for his legal bills. That was one of the biggest applause lines Nikki Haley got down here, you know, when she argued that the RNC should not turn into a piggy bank for Trump's personal legal problems. And he will have to come up with this money for the New York judgment. And the question of where and how he do so, how he does so could create more headaches for him.",

You know, the -- the shortest path to 270 electoral college votes, which is what it takes to win for Biden, is to rebuild what I called, 15 years ago, the blue wall.And that would require him to hold Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, both of which look pretty good for him. I think at this point largely around the issue of abortion, but also Michigan, where his polling has consistently been underperforming where Democrats have been. I mean, Gretchen Whitmer, the governor, won the state by 12 points in 2022. And Trump is consistently leading there with Biden struggling among white, blue collar voters, younger people and the Arab-American community. This effort to have an uncommitted people vote uncommitted, which is being supported not only by our American interests, but also by Bernie Sanders political organization, I think is an important test. A similar effort fizzled in New Hampshire. It didn't really generate a lot of protest votes. But if it does generate a significant protest vote in Michigan, which, as I said, is almost an indispensable state for Democrats, I think you're going to see more anxiety in the party about Biden's posture toward Benjamin Netanyahu, who, you know, whatever else you can say about him, he is someone he has identified with the Republican Party pretty overtly over the years and at the margin probably would prefer to be dealing with Donald Trump in the White House than Joe Biden. And I think the pressure on Biden to reconsider his relationship and the amount of rope he is giving Netanyahu would probably be intensified significantly if this uncommitted effort, you know, posts a serious result on Tuesday.",

And it is those details that the parties, the United States, Israel, the Egyptians and Qataris as mediators for Hamas are going to be trying to thrash out in those talks in Doha to try to get a deal that will see at least some of those Israeli hostages who were kidnapped on October the 7th freed in exchange for a pause in the fighting, the release of Palestinian prisoners and more humanitarian aid going into the Gaza Strip.Now, we heard from National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan over the weekend talking about the understanding of contours of a potential deal being reached. The sticking point up until now, at least so far as the Israelis are concerned, has been Hamas' demands for a complete end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and also the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Whatever the case, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend saying that even if a deal is reached to free those hostages in exchange for a ceasefire, that ground operation in Rafa will still go ahead.

Many will be disinclined to move, taking the view that, well, they've moved before so many times that where they are being told to go to, may not be any safer than where they are right now. So there are a lot of challenges in moving that number of people. And the United States perhaps has seen added urgency or added to the urgency of these talks to get the hostages freed in exchange for a ceasefire in order to forestall this kind of ground operation. Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli government's perspective is that in order for Hamas to be destroyed, in order for Israel to be able to say mission accomplished as far as the destruction of Hamas is concerned, it must go into Rafah to destroy what it describes as the final bastion of Hamas to prevent Hamas continuing to threaten Israel with another October the 7th. And as a result of that, this plan has been presented to the War Cabinet for the evacuation from areas where fighting is taking place. They didn't specify Rafah, as you said, but it seems likely that Rafah is a part of that plan and quite when that would be enacted or what details are a part of that plan. We're not too sure right now, but certainly Israel's intention is to go into Rafah with or without a deal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages.",
