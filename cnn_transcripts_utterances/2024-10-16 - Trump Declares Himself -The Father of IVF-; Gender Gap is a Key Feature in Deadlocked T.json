But moments ago, Mr. Trump clarified that he was, in fact, referring to some U.S. citizens, specifically his political rivals. Let's listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is the enemy from within and they're very dangerous.

      "sentences": "That's right. And it's notable for a couple of reasons. One is that, of course, this comment that he made over the weekend about the enemy from within being a bigger threat to the United States than our foreign adversaries drew a lot of backlash. And, you know, we saw a lot of Republicans take to the airwaves to try and defend Donald Trump on this.And one of the key arguments we heard in those lines of defense was that he was referring to protesters, rioters, when he talked about sending in the military or the National Guard to deal with the \"enemy from within.\" They argued, that is what, you know, other leaders have done in the past to deal with those types of situations. However, he made very clear in that moment when Harris Faulkner asked him about this, that he was talking about his political opponents, that he was talking about Democrats. He brought up the Pelosi's specifically. So I think, you know, it's very clear where Donald Trump or what Donald Trump meant about that. The other part of this, of course, is that we have heard from Republicans for weeks now really blaming rhetoric from the Democrats for what they argued led to some of the assassination attempts on his life. They argued that he's not doing -- he's not using that type of rhetoric. However, I think clearly, we are hearing some of that dangerous rhetoric from him. Now, I do want to talk about another very notable moment during that town hall that's getting a lot of attention, which is when Donald Trump was asked about IVF, and protections, and access to IVF. Donald Trump essentially said, he loves that issue and that he is the father of IVF. I want you to take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But look, obviously, it was a bit of a weird comment when he said, I am the father of IVF. We know that IVF really started in the '70s. But when I talked to Donald Trump's team about this, I tried to get an answer on what exactly was he trying to say there? And they argue that this is an issue that Donald Trump believes that he really set the tone for within the Republican Party. And they pointed back to in February that Alabama Supreme Court ruling where essentially they had a Trump ruled that frozen embryos are children. And then that led many hospitals and clinics to pausing IVF treatments.Donald Trump came out on that and said, I support IVF. The party should support IVF. And really, since then, I can tell you from my conversations with people close to the former President that this is something he brings up a lot, particularly when people ask him, why do you not think that you're doing -- why aren't you doing well with women voters? And remember, that was what this town hall was all about, him trying to narrow that gender gap with Harris. And he often argues he's not sure, he thinks they don't like his rhetoric, but that he should -- they should like him on the issues. And this is one of the issues that he often talks about. So I think that's where a lot of this was coming from, despite it being a bit of an odd answer.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. He clearly believes it will help him. Alayna Treene, thank you so much.We want to drill down now on the question of the gender gap by starting with a look at where the presidential race stands right now. Let's take a look at a new CNN poll of poll average. Right now, there is no clear leader in this race. An average of 51% of likely voters support Vice President Harris, while 48% back former President Trump. But this relatively small gap falls within the margin of error. On the other hand, the gender gap remains quite wide. A recent ABC News poll and Ipsos also is included in that poll, found a 17% difference based on gender. Trump winning male voters by eight points as Harris leads by nine among women voters, zooming in specifically to the support for Harris among women, they're bolstered for her by women under 40, black women and Hispanic women. Meantime, the margins for Republicans among white women seem to be dwindling. And this is raising all sorts of alarms for the Trump campaign. In 2012, Mitt Romney, who famously had a line that he regrets, I'm sure about binders full of women, he was up by about nine points. Then four years later, and the access Hollywood tape later, also, we should note, Donald Trump was up six points. Most recently, he built on that in 2020, getting a seven point advantage among white women. But if the current polling holds on Election Day, Donald Trump would only be up plus one. That would be the lowest margin for Republicans among white women in this century. Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, acknowledged that gender gap last night during an event in Pennsylvania, and he made this direct appeal. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J.D. VANCE, REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The polls also tell you that we're doing better. President Trump and I are doing better with male voters. And the Democrats are doing a little bit better with female voters. Well, I think moms are the best ambassadors to say, look, don't believe the lies that you've heard about these guys. Vote for what's in your best interest. Vote for public safety. Vote for lower grocery prices for your family.

So there are still some kitchen table issues that voters, male and female alike, will take into consideration.And then the other elephant in the room is illegal immigration. We've seen the effects of fatal fentanyl on the streets. We've seen the effects of, you know, violent, illegal, criminal aliens who are here. And so there are other factors at play.

And I know, you know, as Trump was one of the first republicans, myself included, I was the first Republican in Congress to speak out about the IVF ruling in Alabama. So too was Trump.And so, you know, we know that he's going to be a strong voice. He put IVF in the Republican platform. He put the fact that Republicans want to protect access to birth control and contraceptives in the Republican platform. It had never been done before. This is a fight I've been making alone for a long time, as you know, since overturning of Roe v. Wade. And I'm glad that, you know, if he becomes president, when he does that I have someone that I can go to and talk to about women's issues because I do truly believe he gets it. He had his granddaughter on stage at the RNC, at the convention giving a speech. You know, the women in his family are leaders in the public and private sector. So I think we see someone who is passionate about women's issues. I've talked to him about it privately and publicly, but it will be up to the voters to see what they say in November and why it's so important that he's stressing the women vote.

And this is what happens next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAN #1: Tape him, tape him, tape him. Get your hands behind your back. Get your hands behind your back. Get your hands behind your back. Get your hands behind your back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And what they say is that, you know, he was actually in that scuffle, hitting these officers as they were trying to take him into custody. Finally, it's worth pointing out that this is an occasion where training is also a major issue. Those two officers actually testified in court about the lack of training that they receive when it comes to people with disabilities. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAN #2: Light training with people who are hard of hearing. WOMAN #1: Okay. Can you tell me more about that? MAN #2: It was about seven years ago. I don't remember much of it. MAN #3: Have you received any training in dealing with members of the public who have disabilities? MAN #2: Maybe briefly, but nothing that I recall. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It also comes, guys, as we've been reporting that the Phoenix Police Department was recently the subject of a scathing report by the Justice Department, accusing officers of using excessive enforcement techniques against people of color, as well as those who are experiencing disabilities, so a lot of eyes on this one. It is worth pointing out that the police union there said that they are asking the public not to jump to any conclusions based on video. They say, this is an incident where you had two officers in fully marked patrol cars who were attacked in their view. The head prosecutor in Maricopa county says, she will be personally reviewing this case, guys.",
