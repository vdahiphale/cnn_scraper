We are talking of course about George Santos, the freshman Republican Congressman from New York who lied about nearly all aspects of his life to help get himself elected. Late today, yet another freshman New York House Republican Brandon Williams joined the call for him to quit. As for Santos, he says he is not going anywhere. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If George Santos resigns, the seat will be vacant until a special election is held, which will cut Speaker McCarthy's narrow legislative majority by one. The price for it being a Congressman, of course, where some fellow Republicans in Washington and back home said they don't trust and should not be serving, if serving is even the right word.It's like the old joke, a guy tells his friend, my brother thinks he's a chicken. The friend asked, why don't you take him to a psychiatrist. I can't. The guy says we need the eggs. Congressman Santos appears to be a pathological liar and it is no joke, but McCarthy may need the votes. Joining us now is Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman. So you and your fellow Nassau County executives, the County GOP officials have said he should resign. What do you think is going to happen? BRUCE BLAKEMAN (R), NASSAU COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER:   Well, I'm the chief executive officer of a county. His congressional district is about one half of the county, we have almost 1.5 million people in Nassau County. His congressional district, 700,000 people roughly live in Nassau County and I just found myself in an untenable situation whereby, as a chief executive officer, I have to deal with Federal officials all the time. And I felt like I could not deal with him, I could not talk to him, because he's an out and out liar. And I can't have a relationship with somebody who is not going to tell me the truth. And we are now finding ways in which we can go around George Santos and make sure that the people in his district are served without having to deal with him, I will not deal with him.   I think he should resign. I think that lying about where you attended college is audacious, lying about where you work is outrageous, lying about your religion is ridiculous, it is almost funny. But lying about the fact that his parents were survivors of the Holocaust to me, I think is tragic. I think it trivializes the death of six million people, t wo million of which were children. And I think that that shows that he has no concept of the scope of his untruths. And for me, as an elected official, I had to make that clear to him and to his staff, and to the people in my county that that was unacceptable and I wasn't going to have anything to do with him.",

And remember, this is a very blue district, it was a Biden won district and in a special election, you would have a ton of attention on this race.We have a lot of people who would come out just to vote against George Santos, you know, an anti-George Santos vote and there is a very likelihood that Democrats could win that seat back and so it would make the House GOP's razor thin majority even slimmer and that is something that is certainly weighing on the minds of Republican leaders -- Anderson.",

He only has a four-vote majority, which we saw on display in a painful way, all last week and it is very possible that if this goes, this district that their district is part of a special election, then it could go blue, especially given what we're seeing with Santos.And the other is that there is a process. There is a process that is happening now in the courts and there is a process that will happen in the Ethics Committee. So we have seen leaders in both parties take a beat and let that process continue. That is not stopping his colleagues from calling on him to resign.

The other question mark that remains is whether President Biden had any involvement, knowledge, awareness, possession of any of these documents at any time, and based on the reporting that I've seen so far, that remains a major question. There are many, many, as Maggie said, there are many, many differences between former President Trump's situation and this situation with President Biden for documents that were discovered from his time as Vice President. The one thing that I do think is similar amongst both of them is that there are people besides those two individuals who are potentially relevant to the investigation. So for both investigations, the questions for the Justice Department become well, who were the actual people who moved classified information from one place to another, who had access to those documents, if anyone?

We've really seen them standing back up, not just since the search, which actually was pretty condemned, but once it was clear what the volume and severity was of the documents that were in, said to be in former President Trump's possession. So this is something that just allows Republicans to say, you know, hey, look, this happened with Biden, too.

We still have more to learn about the nature of the documents in the Biden situation. And certainly, the cooperation piece is completely different as far as what we know. Certainly, former President Trump did not cooperate and as you said, can be alleged to have obstructed that investigation. In this case, according to what we've learned so far, the Biden folks have all cooperated immediately as far as when they discovered the documents.",

He's been in trouble with the law before pleading guilty to fraud in a fake art case. Now we're learning even more about his past. Court documents show he was cut out of his father's will, also allegations he'd swindled money from his father, he's also described as a sociopath, among other things, in a dispute over the estate.CNN Jason Carroll has more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As investigators are now in the process of testing items that could be connected to the disappearance of Ana Walshe, a clearer picture is emerging of her husband Brian and his troubled financial past. Court documents show he was involved in a bitter legal battle over his father, Thomas Walshe's estate friends, as well as Walshe's nephew, alleging in signed affidavits the elder Walshe and his son had been estranged for years after Brian Walshe absconded with almost $1 million from Dr. Thomas Walshe. Court records also say because of the alleged theft, it required Dr. Thomas Walshe to continue working past the age at which he had wished to retire, as a significant amount of his savings were stolen and never returned. (on-camera): And that's part of the reason why these court documents say Walshe's father cut his only son out of his will in the years before his death in 2018. (voice-over): Despite that, Walshe took steps to take control of his father's estate while saying in a sworn affidavit he and his father had been estranged several times over the years, but says they mended their relationship. Ultimately, Walshe's legal efforts were unsuccessful. A judge ruled against him. But those same documents revealed more information about Walshe's past, including that at some point he had checked himself into a mental health facility. His father's friends calling him a sociopath, and court documents dated in 2019 saying, Brian is not only a sociopath, but also a very angry and physically violent person. I want nothing to do with him. These allegations surfaced years before Walshe pleaded guilty to federal charges of selling fake Andy Warhol paintings.

Brian Walshe's trouble passed, allegedly checked himself into a health facility, his father's friend calling him a sociopath and violent. What is that to tell you? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT, PROFILER: Well, if the term sociopath was applied by a trained mental health professional, that would have a lot of significance to me. Sociopath is an old term. It was really thrown out in 1968 by the mental health professionals. The new term is psychopath, and it is a personality disorder. It is not a mental illness. Psychopaths know right from wrong. They know the laws, they know the rules. They just choose to break them. And there's a set of 20 very specific personality traits, but one of them is that these are very grandiose people. They're very glib and charming, but when they do commit crimes, they absolutely have no remorse whatsoever for their victims. And that becomes most of the time, that becomes a very prominent trait when a psychopath does act out violently.",

And most people that do have psychopathic traits are not violent, but they live on the edge. And you don't want to be in a relationship with them because their rule of life is to take whatever they want whenever they want it.

But the thing with people that are genuinely classified as psychopathic, their repertoire of being able to handle a situation in their life that they're dissatisfied with is far broader than you or me. So, if they're upset with a spouse, divorce may not be the option because they want a permanent break. So that means murder. So while you may have someone that is primarily a white-collar offender, again, if they're confronted with a life situation that they don't like, they can easily become violent and act out in a way that is very concerning.",

In fact, I've done interviews with many of these people. They're very proud. And even when you point out their mistakes, they don't see their mistakes because again, they think that they're smarter than you are. And they also think that they're not going to get caught, what's really interesting, when you do interact with someone that has those traits, their affect is very off, and affect means emotion.
