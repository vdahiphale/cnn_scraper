Rain across the eastern part of the country, heavy snow in parts of the west, it's all making for a messy start to Thanksgiving travel.Plus, we're watching the market reaction this morning to President- elect Donald Trump's new tariff threat, how it could impact your wallet. And a potential game changer for those wildly popular obesity drugs, the Biden administration has a plan to make them more affordable for millions of Americans. Good morning, I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. Here we go. The holiday rush is getting underway. About 80 million people across the country are hitting the highways and airports during this busy Thanksgiving travel week. But the weather is showing up like an unwelcome guest this year. Some big storms and a blast of cold air could cause some holiday headaches out there. CNN's Derek Van Dam and Ryan Young join us now, they're looking at all of this. Derek, this is sort of like that leftover Thanksgiving buffet. You can't -- you know, not everybody wants it, this weather that's coming our way.",

One right now along the eastern seaboard that could bring kind of moderate delays to, let's say, JFK, LaGuardia, southward into the D.C. region. But this storm system out west that's bringing some mountain snow and rain to the coastal areas of California, this is what I'm looking at for more delays as we head into the day on Thursday. If you're getting that late last-minute trip into get to grandma and grandpa's house for Thanksgiving Day afternoon.Okay, so here's the radar. The first storm that's currently impacting the East Coast, but it's moving quickly. So, that's a good news. It is mixing in some rain and snow, perhaps some freezing rain across the higher elevations of Vermont, New Hampshire and Northern New York. Heading further south, though, towards this I-95 corridor, Boston to New York, this is all rain. So, we'll keep this in the liquid variety. No frozen precipitation here, which is good news for the roadways, so many millions of Americans hitting the roads for this travel period as well, but the west, not the same situation. Any of these mountain overpasses here, very dangerous because of the snow that will be accumulating, not in inches, but in feet. So, there's the two storm systems, they kind of separate the country, lots of clear conditions across the middle part. Let's advance this and forward it in time, and you can see that first storm access the East Coast. Wednesday could be your ideal time to travel for this holiday weekend to get to your destination and settle in for the long haul, because Thursday, this storm explodes along the East Coast. It will bring snowfall to Northern New England. It looks like to be a cool, damp and rainy day across the major East Coast cities once again. So, the storm system exits off the East Coast and then it draws in the coldest air of the season behind it. It kicks in the lake- enhanced snow machine into high gear. And you won't believe these temperatures, Jim. We are going to bottom out into the 40s, even the 20s for Chicago, and well below freezing all the way to the Gulf Coast by out there in the early parts of next week.",

I appreciate it.Also new this morning, very interesting development here in Washington, a new government plan could make popular anti-obesity medications more affordable to millions of Americans.

How this proposal is different than what's currently the case is, currently with Medicare and Medicaid, these medications are covered for patients who are obese or overweight, only if they have another underlying chronic health condition, like diabetes or cardiovascular disease.So, this is really the Biden administration proposing to treat obesity as a disease itself, make these medications accessible for all patients with obesity. And like you said, Jim, these medications are expensive. They can cost about a thousand dollars a month without coverage. So, having coverage would be a huge game changer for patients. The only thing here is, Jim, this is a proposal. We don't know when it will be finalized, what that timeline might look like, if it's not made final before the end of Biden's term. Is this something that could roll over for the Trump administration to consider? And then could we see politics playing a role here? That's something to keep an eye on, Jim.",

Catherine, I mean, you know, you and I -- we see these ads all the time on T.V., and a lot of people use these medications. This could be a huge deal. That could just be a game changer for a lot of Americans if this actually goes through, if it doesn't get ensnared in politics, as Jacqueline was just saying a few moments ago, because you do have a different mindset when it comes to these medications when the Trump team comes in.",

They are obviously very expensive, and if Medicare and Medicaid do start providing them just for weight loss, universally, which right now Medicare does not by law, there are lots of people who would not only potentially have access to these medications to lose weight, but also, potentially, there could be health savings down the line for all sorts of other diseases and illnesses that are linked with obesity. So, things like Alzheimer's, diabetes, joint problems, et cetera.So, there are a lot of questions here about, you know, not only could this improve people's lives, but what would the impact be for the federal budget, right? They're going to spend a lot of money up front, especially if they don't (INAUDIBLE) these drugs, which they very may well, as they could under the Inflation Reduction Act. [10:10:09] They'll to spend a lot of money up front, but there could be some savings to the federal government in the long run if they end up not having to pay for those kinds of health interventions that are linked to obesity.",

He's talking about following through one of his core campaign promises, saying he's going to roll out a 25 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico and Canada, 10 percent hike on imports from China. What does that mean for prices, consumers will pay?And, Catherine, I guess the other thing we have to talk about is, I mean, we're looking at the reaction on Wall Street a few moments ago. It doesn't look like Wall Street is freaking out over this just yet. Is it possible that this is just bluster or that the market is thinking that it's just bluster at this point?",

      "speaker": "RAMPELL",
      "sentences": "So, I'll take those questions one at a time. If in fact -- threatened tariffs, they would have huge effects on prices. Mexico, for example, is our number one trading partner. It surpassed China relatively recently in that regard. We get lots of consumer goods from China -- excuse me, from Mexico, whether we're talking about, you know, T.V.s produce, lots of vegetables come from Mexico. In fact, like 90 percent of avocados, for example, come from Mexico, about two- thirds of the fresh tomatoes that Americans eat. So, all of those things would see higher prices, not to mention the fact that we also get a lot of inputs, intermediate goods in the United States from Mexico and from Canada that are used by American firms to make and produce their own products.So, housing, for example, you know, there's a huge housing affordability crisis in this country, but we get a lot of our lumber and a lot of our cement from Canada. So, those costs would -- unavoidable at this point. So, if you voted for Donald Trump because you thought he was going to reduce the cost of living, I may have some bad news in store for you. But as you alluded, you know, there is some potential hope, I don't know what to characterize it as, that this is just bluster. And, frankly, I think we don't know. Trump carried out a lot of his tariff threats back in his first term. And there were plenty of things that he was itching to do by the end that his staff at the time basically restrained him from doing. There were reports about one of his economic advisers, Gary Cohn, swiping trade documents off of Donald Trump's desk. And I don't think you will have that same kind of coterie of aides who are thwarting him, whether you call them the Deep State or anything else, because these are true believers, these are loyalists, and I think it's quite possible that Trump may carry out some of these threats. I think the only thing that would restrain him at this point, it does believe him and does begin to freak out, which, as you point out, hasn't happened yet. ACOSTA:  Yes. And Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary has said, oh, you don't need to worry about all this talk of tariffs from the campaign. You know, I think he's a free trader and so on. And then, lo and behold, we get this announcement from Trump before he's even sworn in as president that he wants to do these very large and potentially very impactful tariffs.",

I talked to a law enforcement source yesterday who said that migrant apprehensions on the U.S. southern border on Sunday were about 1,500 migrant apprehensions. If you compare that to December of 2023, when about 10,000 migrants were crossing into the United States per day, you can see that the number has dropped significantly.Now, those numbers dropped and plummeted this summer after the Biden administration practically barred asylum at the border and started deporting everyone that didn't have a legal basis to stay in the United States. As a matter of fact, the latest numbers from CBP show that about 206,000 people have been deported from June to September. And one of the things that's important to note, Jim, is that the Biden administration have been managing the border through legal pathways and also a relationship with Mexico. And as you were just talking about moments ago, that relationship could get a little icy based on the threats of tariffs to Mexico that President-elect Donald Trump announced yesterday.

Of course, the Texas governor had launched his Operation Lone Star in 2021, only months after the president took office. But also it was an affront to the Biden administration, and that included what you mentioned, which is the buses with migrants sent to those Democratic-led cities, blocking portions of the border to federal agents, and also setting up those buoys in the Rio Grande.All of this to say that the Texas governor had often argued that he was the one securing the border in the face of federal law enforcement, while Homeland Security officials said that it was getting in the way of their operations. And all of this ended up in court and in a series of lawsuits that you heard Tom Homan mentioned there shortly ago. But now we're entering a new phase. And in that phase, sources tell me that Trump's team wants to work very closely with Texas. They want to use what Texas has done on the border as a road map for how states should be cooperating with federal law enforcement. And the moves that frustrated the Biden White House are ones that are welcome under the incoming Trump White House. And that is clearly shown by Tom Homan, the incoming border czar, being along the border today with Abbott. It's also in some of the considerations that I'm told that the president-elect is making, including, for example, bringing in the Texas border czar, Michael Banks, to be potentially the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So, all of the personnel moves alone and where they have been indicates how this relationship with the White House will evolve when it is Donald Trump sitting in the Oval Office. Jim?",
