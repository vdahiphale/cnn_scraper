Appreciate your company.Well, one story dominating all others this hour a seismic shift in the race for the White House after President Joe Biden's stunning decision to end his campaign. The move following increasing pressure from inside Mr. Biden's own party to step aside in the weeks following his dismal performance in the presidential debate. A source says plans for President Biden to exit the race was set into motion Saturday night and finalized on Sunday. We've learned that information given to Biden by his closest advisors underscored that the path to victory was basically non-existent. In a letter posted to his official account on \"X.\" Mr. Biden said, quote, \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" unquote. The President went on to offer his full support and endorsement for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the democratic nominee this November. And he urged Democrats to unite behind her. In her own statement, Harris thanked Mr. Biden for his extraordinary leadership as she put it and decades of service to the country. She went on to say she was, quote, \"honored to have the President's endorsement.\" And that it was her intention to, quoting again, \"earn and win this nomination.\" Now in the hours since the announcement, we've seen an outpouring of support for the Vice President including from donors who say they're reinvigorated and ready to put their money behind Harris. And already we've seen donations pour in. ActBlue says, \"small donors have helped raise more than $46 million since Harris launched her campaign.\" That's in a matter of hours. The group says it is the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is following all the developments. He has the latest for us from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The Vice President Kamala Harris receiving support from across the democratic party for her to replace President Biden on the democratic ticket. In the wake of that bombshell announcement on Sunday, the Vice President moving quickly reaching out to senators, other lawmakers, state officials as well, asking them for her support. Now, she said in a statement that she intends to fight for this nomination. It certainly is not a done deal. However, the breadth of governors and senators and House members, including some governors who could be on her shortlist for a running mate, like potentially Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. The list goes on all through their names to support her candidacy, as did California Governor Gavin Newsom. Of course, he is a longtime potential rival of hers, but he certainly said he supports Harris. So state delegations also weighing in from Tennessee, from South Carolina. So time is running short for her to choose a running mate. It's a compressed primary schedule, if you will. The voting for her, if she becomes the nominee and a running mate, would be between August 1st and August 7th. So around two weeks or so to get this worked out. Now, there is no question there is still a bit of time for some Democrat to step forward in challenging her. But on Sunday evening, there is no question that Democrats are rallying behind her. This has been a contingency plan in the works, and she set it into motion with President Biden's decision. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

After going through all of that, it's just hard to imagine there is the stomach for a full-fledged second fight to bypass her, especially with the candidates who might have the best chance and be considered the most viable alternatives, like Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom already indicating they won't run against Vice President Harris.",

His approval rating has been stuck at 40% or below for over a year. Two-thirds or more of people have said they think he's too old to do the job for another four years. Really telling was that all year they have been on the air virtually unrebutted in all of the swing states. And he was trailing, still trailing after all of that, still trailing Trump. And his approval rating was no better than it was nationally.Harris offers the opportunity for a burst of energy. She can deliver the Democratic case against Trump more vigorously and more cogently. Obviously, she's going to unlock a lot of fundraising. If you look at it demographically, she has the potential to improve upon Biden's biggest problem, which is that he's eroded since 2020 among younger and nonwhite voters. But she does risk some retreat among what has been, I think, his most surprising asset, which is that even amid all of his other problems, his vote is held up among older and blue-collar whites. Can she put the Sun Belt swing states back in play? North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. If not, she will have the same narrow path that he does going through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And those states don't seem to be intrinsically easier for her than they were for Biden.",

And they're also going to try to -- with their roots in San Francisco and California as some kind of woke liberal. The reality is, I think, you know, I've talked to a number of people who have studied her image with voters. And the answer is, is that it's surprisingly unformed.

And, you know, a month ago, she was not a particularly popular or beloved figure, even in her own party, with very low polling numbers and attached to an unpopular administration. What I've seen this past 12 hours has shown me something, which is that I think for Democrats, we spent three weeks sitting outside the ICU, which is where people are very, very sick in our American hospitals, looking at American democracy.

Several Democrats telling CNN she could help reenergize the base, especially the young and minority voters. A source saying Vice President Harris is already working the phones, calling lawmakers and delegates to shore up support for her candidacy. She had a list of about 200 calls to make on Sunday alone, including with the heads of the Congressional Black Caucus and Hispanic Caucus. Several Democratic leaders are already speaking out in support of Kamala Harris. That includes Congressman Ted Lieu from her home state of California. He became the first member of the House Democratic leadership to endorse Vice President Harris, writing on \"X\" that he's honored to back her again after endorsing her in the 2020 race. Another California lawmaker, Congressman Eric Swalwell, told CNN earlier that Harris is the right candidate to take on Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Now sources tell CNN that the vice president did not know about the president's decision until Sunday, then the two spoke multiple times over the course of the day. And now it has been a moment for the vice president to try to gain momentum as she called multiple Democratic lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders, among others to get their endorsements, oftentimes telling them in their phone calls that she wants to earn the nomination and wants their support. Now, the outstanding questions remain as to what this will look like and what the process will look like over the next few weeks when we're only on the cusps of the Democratic National Convention. And then two when the president will address the nation. He has been recovering from COVID and the White House doctor said, his symptoms are improving significantly.

Current Democratic Party rules suggest there are several steps that need to be taken to formally nominate the next candidate. First, potential nominees will need to gain signatures from hundreds of delegates and be recognized as candidates. Next, more than 3,900 individual delegates and 747 superdelegates would be called upon to select the nominee. The superdelegates may or may not take part in the first round of voting. If no candidate gets a majority voting continues in rounds. When all the delegates are involved, the majority of the total delegate votes will win the nomination.
