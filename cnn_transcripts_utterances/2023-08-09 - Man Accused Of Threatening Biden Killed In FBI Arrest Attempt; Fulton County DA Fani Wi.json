CNN has learned when she has her say next week, she is expected to seek more than a dozen indictments in her election interference probe of Donald Trump, the former president. And also tonight, a live report from Maui. You see it there, walls of flames sweeping the island, at least six people have already been killed. Good evening, everyone. John King here tonight, sitting in for Anderson. Breaking news tops our hour. The killing of a Utah man by FBI agents trying to arrest him. That and the contents of the government's charging documents, which are frankly beyond chilling. Page after page of Craig Robertson's social media postings describing at times in lurid graphic detail who he would allegedly kill and how.

He wrote that: \"I hear Biden is coming to you, Utah. Digging out my old ghillie suit (That's his camouflage outfit that you see there) and cleaning the dust off the M-24 sniper rifle.\" And then he says \"Welcome buffoon-in-chief.\" And so they were ready. Seeing this post, the FBI decided that it was time to move in and take him off the street. Now, this is a man that they had been monitoring since March because of other threats that he had posted, most significant, what really started all of this was a threat that he posted against the Manhattan district attorney here in New York City, Alvin Bragg because he's been investigating the former president, Donald Trump. And so he posts this Facebook message about wanting to essentially come to New York City and kill the DA. And so the FBI gets alerted to this posting, and that is what starts this investigation back in March. They start doing surveillance on him. They even go over to talk to him. In March, they approached him. They see him, he is wearing a Trump hat. They talk to them, they say, hey, we're on to you, what's going on? He then lists threats against the FBI, those agents who came to his home, and so this goes on for several months. But finally, today, this morning, the FBI moving in, out of concern that with the president visiting Utah and what this man was saying he was planning, they decided to move in. There was a confrontation, he pointed a gun at them, and then they say that they shot and killed him.",

What makes this individual different is he is articulating graphic, specific, violent threats, right. And then, that's what initiates the FBI investigation, and in the course of that investigation, he rebuffs all efforts to speak to him and then he starts to threaten the FBI agents who came out to his house. He continues to make essentially death threats against Alvin Bragg, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Gavin Newsom, and shows actual proof of his ability to do so. He is posting photographs of nine assault weapons someplace in his residence, presumably, he says he has a ghillie suit and a sniper rifle and then posts a photograph of himself with a ghillie suit and a sniper rifle. So this was a very logical investigation of somebody who is escalating along that cycle of potential violence, and the FBI finally had to step in knowing that a conflict with the president of the United States might be in the offing and then you have the unfortunate result of that encounter today.",

It is something that they literally have to monitor every day. Now, we'll also say that this is a perfect example of a case that shows how responsible careful political leaders of both parties are very careful not to engage in this sort of violent rhetoric and targeting speech that we hear from Donald Trump very frequently. And the reason is that the most extreme supporters of those political leaders and certainly those who follow Donald Trump, we have seen will actually follow through on some of these comments. We know that from the January 6 people who showed up on the Capitol on January 6, many of them said, we came because Donald Trump told us, so this person is a perfect example of what happens when someone like Donald Trump encourages sort of rhetoric, targets people online.

What motivates them? Who's gaining or losing their trust and why?In the next few months, I'm going to talk mostly to Republican voters about the former president. Is his nomination inevitable, despite his many legal and character controversies? Or is there sufficient demand for change and a new face for the party? We start our series in Iowa, because that's where the race really begins, and the Republican presidential field is scheduled to descend on mass to the Iowa State Fair beginning tomorrow, a defining moment for those campaigns just five months before the first in the nation vote.
