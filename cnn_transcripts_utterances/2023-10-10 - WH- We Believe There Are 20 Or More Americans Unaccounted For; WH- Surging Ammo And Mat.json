Hamas has infrastructure in all of these areas. So really, we're not talking about a very large area. It's perhaps twice the size of Washington, DC. So you might be able to flee from northwest to southeast, but there's not really anywhere to go. It's a very small, cramped place and the Israelis believe they have targets in most of the Gaza Strip. So there's nowhere to go.And in addition to that -- and I think this point has been made clear very vividly before. Unlike Israel, there are no bomb shelters in Gaza. There are shelters for Hamas and its leaders, but for ordinary people, the best they can do is perhaps hide in the basement. And as we've seen from some of the intense Israeli strikes, even those buildings aren't very solid -- Anderson.",

And what we saw in some of the areas that there were very suspicious sort of cracks in the roads where it would appear there were tunnels underneath.

So what we do, we actually try to encourage the population to move out. And I heard your discussion earlier. Gaza is big enough to move out. If we're targeting a neighborhood where we know that you have headquarters of Hamas, we send the messages to the population to get out of this area, to move South to a different location. And we hope that they will do that.And I will take this opportunity to call to the people in Gaza to move away from Hamas headquarters, from Hamas militants, because we are coming to get them, we will come from the sea, from the air, from the land.

I think that as we speak, Prime Minister Netanyahu is meeting one of the leaders of the opposition in an attempt to form some sort of unity government. I find it hard to believe that we will see a ground operation before those efforts will be exhausted. Because if a ground operation means a lot of casualties, it's  a big decision and it's  the kind of a decision that the Israeli public -- although it's public supports such a decision -- I think people will accept it much more if it's -- if the unity government decides on it and not the current government in power now in Israel.",

You know the -- on the one hand, Israel was distracted, right, for the last nine months since the Netanyahu coalition brought forward this very controversial program of a judicial overhaul and to reshape the balance of power in Israel. Bringing out a quarter of a million Israelis every week to protest. That created rift within Israel, a rupture that was unprecedented within civil society. Israel was completely focused on that.There were reservists, saying they weren't going to serve. There were the armed -- the government was attacking the army and back and forth. What this did was it created this division within the country that our enemies were able to take advantage of. The writing was on the wall. People were warning about this. And you know how we know? Because it's happened in the past in Jewish history. This isn't the first time. It's happened thousands of years ago, during the time of the Second Temple. It's happened when Israelis and Jews are just not focused and don't come together. Our enemies find a way to wedge in, and they take advantage of that situation, and that's exactly, unfortunately, what happened now. We had no intelligence of what Hamas was going to do. They took us completely by surprise. 1,000 Hamas fighters crossed into Israel and the exalted amazing Israeli intelligence agencies don't know a single thing. It's  unimaginable. But it happened on Saturday. And one of the reasons I think it was, was because we were distracted.",

He said it is not on hold, even though obviously over the last few days focus has been elsewhere for Israel. Are you reading these attacks potentially, as Hamas trying to sabotage progress on that front? RAVIDgeneral, but I don't think that this necessarily was the main reason. I agree with what Yaakov said. You know the big picture here is what happened to Israel in the last nine months when this judicial overhaul weakened Israeli society, Israeli economy, Israeli military. And you know, in a way Israeli Intelligence Services were not strategically surprised. Because over the last nine months they warned again and again and again that the weakening of Israel and the rupture within the Israeli society makes Israel's enemies think about trying to challenge Israel and to attack Israel. The intelligence services said that publicly and the government disregarded those warnings. So while there was an intelligence failure in the, you know, tactically, strategically, I think the Israeli intelligence was warning the government that because of the domestic and internal political crisis that was man made, OK, it was man made by the government because of that Israel is in a security danger.",
