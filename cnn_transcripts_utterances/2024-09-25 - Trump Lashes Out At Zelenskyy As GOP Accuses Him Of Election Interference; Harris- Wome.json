And, of course, we have seen several of them embroiled in investigations, from his administration. The phones seized by several of them, including the Police Commissioner, the School Chancellor, the Deputy Mayor, several officials in his administration. This has all been going on, as today, we saw Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party, who doesn't often get involved in the politics of New York City, on the local level, calling for Adams to resign, saying she did not see how he could continue to govern the city. He responded to that by saying that he had not faced any charges yet. Of course, now tonight, we see that he has been indicted. I want to get more on this breaking news with CNN Legal Analyst, Jennifer Rodgers, who is joining us. And Jennifer, obviously, we're still waiting to learn a lot about this.

You just really can't run the city, and face federal criminal charges at the same time. But as for more than that, we'll just have to wait and see. Southern District of New York has, I think, three of those investigations. The Eastern District of New York has the other one.

Then, you ask the grand jury to vote, and you have your indictment.

Important for people to understand. These are federal charges brought by the Southern District of New York. So, there is no overlap here. There is no jurisdiction that Eric Adams has over this office. Just to give you a sense, though, of how close it will hit to home. I used to walk to the Southern District of New York. I'd walk past the Mayor's office. It's maybe 200 yards away. So, it's a very small world, down there, in Southern Manhattan. Now, as John Miller just said, it looks like there will probably be a court appearance, tomorrow, in federal court. At that point, we, and Eric Adams, will see the indictment. So then, we'll know exactly what he's charged with. The other thing to watch for, and we remember this a few -- from a few weeks ago, when Sean Combs was indicted in this same district, is, will there be a bail argument. I do not think federal prosecutors will try to lock up Eric Adams. I think it's borderline impossible that they will ask that, given that he's the sitting Mayor, and even if he wasn't. But let's watch for that. Let's see whether they agree to let Eric Adams out on bail. I think it's likely he will be bailed. But then he's going to have to contend with this indictment, either way.",

Highly unusual.Then asked for and seized his phone, his other phone. City Hall then turned over a iPad and another device, voluntarily after that. So, they've been going through that. What does that mean? That means that they have access, through subpoena, to his telephone records, text messages, emails, things like that. But I think from an investigative standpoint, when they did that, they wanted to get into that phone, to say what lives just on that device. Are there notes in there? Are there apps that they can't access because they are encrypted, by using subpoenas to the provider that they can see things on Telegram or Signal or WhatsApp and so on. So, they have been through his devices, during a period contemporaneous with this. But two other points important for right now. One, we will learn about these charges, tomorrow, when they unseal this indictment, and bring it forward. It is not entirely clear whether the Mayor will be in court, tomorrow. Or whether they'll unseal the charges, and then by arrangements, understanding that he is the Mayor of the largest city in America, and has a very important role to play, and is innocent until proven guilty, that they may have to schedule an appearance, possibly before someday next week, where he goes before a magistrate, and answers these charges in an initial appearance.",

That was clearly the decision that was made, with Sean Combs, a couple weeks ago.Alternatively, you can decide, this person's not going to flee, this person's not an ongoing danger to the community. Voice of HONIG: In which case you can negotiate a surrender, and a court appearance, a few days down the line. It appears from the reporting you just talked about that that's the way this one looks like it's going. I think it makes sense. I don't think there's any realistic way Eric Adams could flee.
