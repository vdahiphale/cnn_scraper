Now, the question tonight is, where is this man hiding and where is this man heading?Law enforcement say that they believe Cavalcante may still be in the general area of the Chester County Prison, which is outside of Philadelphia, and they believe that he may be headed south.

Why some of Donald Trump's co-defendants, all 18 of them and maybe even a couple more, in the massive election subversion case in Georgia are now trying crowdfunding to pay their mounting legal bills. And a paid family leave plan in Michigan would give workers time to care for a newborn or a sick family member. So why are some Republicans calling it summer break for adults? State Senator Mallory McMorrow has thoughts, and she is here tonight. But I want to begin with our breaking news, everyone, the manhunt in Pennsylvania tonight.

So, you know, they've got to just take their time and really go through everything they possibly can. But I think the fact that this is getting so much attention is a positive thing because his name and his picture is out there. People are being told to be very vigilant, very alert. This is a very dangerous individual. This is nothing to play with here at all. Someone see anyone who even resembles this guy, call 911, let the police figure out whether or not this is the right person. I know they're also using the technology that they have available. I'm sure the helicopters and drones are looking for any signals that he signatures and so forth. They have dogs. So, they're doing everything they possibly can. But at the same time, you also do have to take a look at how he got out in the first place. You're absolutely right. Now, they have the priorities right. They got to find him first. But at the same time, people are not supposed to get out of jail. I mean, escape from jail, I should say. So, there's a lapse there, and that has to be corrected.

What was interesting about Judge Kelly's sentencing is that the government wanted 27 or 25 to 30 years. And while he agreed that this was a threat and an assault on democracy, there weren't any mass casualties. And he came in the middle. He gave them 17, 18, and 10, depending on who the defendant was.I think that's a fair sentence. That's a lot of time. You know, they got to do 80% of that time even if they're on good behavior. But I think he struck a real balance. Ultimately, what's going to really happen here for justice to be done for January 6 is that Donald Trump has to be held accountable. That's what the federal case is about and the state case. And he's really the main piece. It was funny you said you needed Donald Trump in your January 6 cases, but he's omnipresent. He's on the news every day. Depending on the jury you pick, you can talk about Donald Trump as bad as you want.
