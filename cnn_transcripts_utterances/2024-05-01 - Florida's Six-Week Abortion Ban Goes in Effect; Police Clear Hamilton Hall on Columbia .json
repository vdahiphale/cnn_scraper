But the women who have been coming in the last few days as this ban has been approaching, what have you been hearing from women in the last few days?DR. CHELSEA DANIELS, FLORIDA ABORTION PROVIDER:  In the last few days -- I mean, excuse me, the ban goes into effect today. But in Florida, there is a 24-hour waiting period, which means that you have to have two physician visits at least 24 hours apart in order to obtain an abortion. So for example, that means that if yesterday, on Tuesday, April 30th, I saw patients who were exactly six weeks and zero days of pregnancy yesterday, because of the 24 hour waiting period, we cannot provide them an abortion today because they are six weeks one day today. And so we are already seeing just the absolute distress and anguish that this is causing people. We had so many conversations yesterday with patients redirecting them to care in other states. And I firmly believe that this is human cruelty and moral injury and distress to me as a physician to my patients who know their bodies better than any politician could.",

These are overnight pictures from UCLA's campus. This is what was playing out this morning, just absolute mayhem, if you will. It was wild night of violent clashes there. The NYPD called in to the campus. We're standing by now to see what happens next now that university officials have declared the pro-Palestinian encampment on that campus, they have declared it illegal. Fights broke out overnight, as we're showing you after that statement from the school's administration, and counter- protesters showed up. L.A.'s mayor put out a statement this morning calling what took place absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable. Unrest and chaos has engulfed campuses still across the country.Police confronting protesters at the University of Arizona at Tulane as well just in the last 24 hours. And in New York, the NYPD says there have now been over 200 arrests overnight as officers cleared out and took back that academic building -- here's video of it -- that academic building at Columbia University were protesters had taken it over and seized it for some 20 hours. We're standing by now this morning to hear from New York City Mayor Eric Adams who is expected to hold a press conference about all of this very soon. And Sara Sidner live at the scene at Columbia University. I'm very interested to hear what the mayor has to say this morning, Sarah.",

They were taken out. So the building is, at this point, secured by police. There's a very large police presence here surrounding the building now, with barricades that were up that we have not seen before.We are going to be talking to a student reporters who was on the ground and inside of campus in just a bit.

That is where we find our Stephanie Elam after overnight there were clashes between pro-Israeli protesters and pro-Palestinian and protesters who were in that encampment where we saw some violence certainly breakout overnight.

Zionists maced the majority of students in the encampment.

I just talked about Florida. In Arizona, there is also action today. The state's Senate could vote today to repeal that Civil War era ban on all abortions.

Joining us right now is someone who knows all too well the real-world impact of these state abortion bans.
