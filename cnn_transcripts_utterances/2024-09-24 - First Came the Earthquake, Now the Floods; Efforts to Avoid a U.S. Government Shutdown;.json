Andnow it`s reeling from what the Japanese weather agency said is the heaviest rainfall that it`s ever seen. If you take a look at some of these videos, you can see entire roads and rivers have completely flooded. People are wading through these flooded homes and businesses and just waste deep water. And if you take a look at some of these homes, they`re actually temporary shelters that people evacuated to after that deadly January 1st earthquake that killed hundreds. Here`s what one resident had to say about the double disaster. AKEMI YAMASHITA, RESIDENT (through translator):  The earthquake occurred on January 1st. And again, the city became like a scene out of a movie in September. I cannot help thinking the Noto region might be cursed or something. I`m shocked that so many unbelievable things happened in one year.",

Now, according to local government officials, part of the destruction that we`ve seen from these floods could have been exacerbated by the damage caused from that earthquake earlier this year, in particular, because of the damage caused to embankments and revetments. Now, according to the Japanese government, they`ve dispatched members of the self-defense force, the police force, and also firefighters to try to rescue any remaining survivors. They`re also there to assess the exact extent of the damage caused. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Nikon Small World in Motion competition blends art and science by showcasing scientific and technological advances through videos and time- lapse photos all taken under the microscope. Submissions this year included water droplets evaporating from the wings of a butterfly, a cell in the spinal cord of a zebra fish and other beautiful scientific imagery. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
