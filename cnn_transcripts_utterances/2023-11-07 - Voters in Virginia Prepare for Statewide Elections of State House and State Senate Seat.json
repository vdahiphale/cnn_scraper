(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA):  We are delivering, and I think results matter. So now it's time to put it in the hands of the voters to ask them to send a team to Richmond that can work with me and not against me. I believe that we're going to hold our House and flip our Senate. And I think that we have demonstrated is that that's a license that voters should extend to us after 2021 where we swept in across all the state races and flipped the House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's go to Ohio first where there is a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Now, we have a decent clue on how this will go because of another ballot measure that took place in August. It was Ohio's issue one, where the no was seen as a proxy vote for abortion rights. No won in that situation with 57 percent.This time around, of course, the wording is flipped. You actually have to vote yes for abortion rights. There has been some sort of haggling over the ballot leverage in Ohio. The secretary of state, the Republican secretary of state, didn't actually put the amendment's language in, he put his own language. That worries some abortion rights folks. We'll just have to wait and see what happens. But I want to put this in some context nationally, because there have been six other ballot measures since the Dobbs ruling on abortion rights, and the abortion rights side has won every time from the deep red states likes Kentucky to the very blue ones like Vermont. If, in fact, it passes in Ohio tonight, that will become the seventh state to enshrine abortion rights, or at least vote on the abortion rights side since Dobbs.",

So Kentucky, Beshear perhaps a slight favorite. But you go to Mississippi, Tate Reeves, the incumbent Republican, taking the Brandon Presley, the Democratic candidate. No Democrat has won the governorship in the state since 1999. But keep in mind, Presley is, as you put in that tease, Elvis's second cousin. So maybe that might get him over the top.

We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can't, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can. Do you understand that?\" At one point during testimony, Trump leaned into the microphone and said, quote, \"This is a very unfair trial. Very, very, and I hope the public is watching.\" The civil fraud trial brought by New York's Attorney General Letitia James is seeking $250,000,000 in damages and to bar the Former President from doing business in the state of New York which could spell the end of his business empire. David Schoen is with us he was an attorney on Trump's defense team in the second impeachment trial and speaks with the President regularly. Good morning, David. It's good to have you.

DAVID SCHOEN, TRUMP'S LAWYER DURING 2ND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: I don't have any idea what he means by that, but I think that from President Trump's perspective, it was a good day for him and that he stood up to what he believes to be a very unfair proceeding when much of America believes to be an unfair proceeding. I'm not sure why they called him as a witness, frankly. This case is quickly becoming, or has become already a circus. And I think this just added to it. I think the judge sort of one of his comments epitomized the entire situation when he said, I don't want to hear what he has to say. I'm not sure what purpose was served; except I do think it will help President Trump in the polls.

There has been a lot of discussion about what would happen after the military conflict is done. The president has made very clear.

You know, what -- what does governance look like in Gaza? Because whatever it is, it can't be what it was on October 6th. It can't be Hamas.So I think a lot of these questions are being asked amongst ourselves, amongst our partners and with our Israeli counterparts, and -- and we'll keep having those conversations.",

They're supporting these militia groups that continue to fire rockets at our bases in Iraq and -- and Syria, and they're -- and they're also supporting Putin's war in Ukraine.
