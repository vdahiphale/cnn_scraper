Then a landmark ruling from a top European court finds Switzerland guilty of violating human rights by failing to take sufficient action against climate change. Why this decision could have a ripple effect across the globe? Plus, the young Americans getting their first chance to choose a president this year. Many are saying they don't want Joe Biden or Donald Trump. We'll tell you their reasons. Human Rights Watch says Children in Gaza have been dying from starvation-related complications. The report released today accuses Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. Israel denies that accusation. This as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a date has been set for a ground operation in Rafah despite strong international opposition to such an offensive. More than 1 million displaced Palestinians are seeking shelter in that Gaza City -- in southern Gaza City. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Hamas in its latest statement says that the latest Israeli proposal does not respond to any of their demands. And that seems to be because Hamas is really taking quite a hard line as it relates to that first issue of the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza, demanding totally unfettered access to northern Gaza, whereas, the Israelis Have sought to impose some kind of a cap on the number of people who could return. And also, trying to maintain a security presence at that line separating northern from southern Gaza. And then there is the issue of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza as well. Nonetheless, Hamas says that it will study this latest proposal, that it appreciates the efforts of the mediators to try and reach an agreement. And I'm also told that tonight the Israeli security cabinet is set to me to discuss these hostage negotiation, ceasefire negotiations. So, there is still the possibility of an agreement.

So that could feed into the precedent as well. It is not easy to bring forward these claims, but it is possible. And, you know, international courts around the world are going to face this kind of challenge. Pacific Islanders, for example, are bringing trying to get the International Court of Justice to rule on a similar issue when it comes to the impact of climate change on their lives and wellbeing.

Not only did the appeals court deny Trump's request to move the case out of New York, or rather to put it on hold so there could be a consideration of moving the case out of New York. We also have seen what the jury questionnaire is going to look like. That would be the initial 42 questions that potential jurors will be asked in New York County when they come into court on Monday, and that is going to set up the process to choose those 12 jurors plus some alternates who would hear this case. Those questions, they aren't questions that ask people if they've heard of Donald Trump or if they voted for him in the past. They're questions more geared toward weeding out people who might have a strong bias for or against Donald Trump and can't be impartial. One of the questions explicitly asks, do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald Trump, or the fact that he is a current candidate for president that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror? If someone says yes, they have a strong opinion that interferes with their ability to be a fair and impartial juror, that person will not be serving on the jury. The judge has made that quite clear. There are other questions about the news they consume if people have ever supported fringe political groups in the United States like the Proud Boys or Antifa or even the QAnon movement. Those are going to open people up to further questions. And all of this taken together is going to come going to take place in court to see if there can be a jury seated that is believed to be fair and impartial for the former president in his first criminal trial.",

He's used it as much as for campaign speech, walking in and out of court, as he has to be able to comment on the case itself.

We asked the Biden campaign about the dissent that we're seeing among some young black voters and they frame this as a race between a president that actually cares about making life better even if all Americans haven't felt the full impact just yet, and another candidate, Donald Trump, who they say cares only about his rich friends and helping himself. All of that said, the Biden campaign is aware of this dissent among some of these young voters and they are concerned. Renee Marsh, CNN, Washington.",

There are a lot of people arguing in the Democratic Party that especially to those voters who are disenchanted with his support for Israel, that a vote for Trump or simply not showing up at the polls will allow Trump, who they say will be a far worse president for Arab-Americans, for Palestinians and who will be far more pro-Israel than Biden that will enable him to win back the presidency.But that's not really an argument that gets through. I think the issue of what has happened in Gaza, the humanitarian crisis is something that is a very deep moral problem for a lot of these voters. And it is the kind of issue that on its own can stop somebody voting for the president. I think in recent weeks, you've seen prominent Democrats from Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, Chris Coons, the Delaware Senator, who's very close to Biden, calling for limits on how Israel can use weapons that it's bought from the United States in the conflict. That is, first of all, a moral and humanitarian position, but it's also intended as a warning to the White House about the very corrosive impact this conflict is having on the president. He really needs it to end very soon. It doesn't look like, with Israel poised to go in through Rafah in Gaza that it will do.",

He's used it to create this narrative of being persecuted, almost as though he's a political prisoner. That's worked very well with Republican voters. It crowded out a lot of his Republican rivals in the primary race.I don't think that is going to have a similar impact in the general election but we really don't know. As you say, we've never had a present or a former president or a presumptive Republican or Democratic nominee go on trial. I think most people believe that of the four cases, this money -- this one related to business irregularities to cover up allegedly a hush money payment to adult film star, this is the least damaging to Trump if he's convicted. It doesn't look like right now that the other cases, including the federal election interference cases from 2020 are going to go to trial before the election. This could end up being the only one. So I think there'll be a lot of Americans especially given that this relates to a personal matter. It dates back to the 2016 campaign who will struggle to see the relevancy, even if prosecutors are billing it in itself as an attempt to pull the wool over the voters' eyes in 2016. So, we don't know how it's going to play out if Trump is convicted or conversely what the political impact would be if he's acquitted in this case. But, you know, he's going to use it to further this narrative that he's being unfairly treated.",

Of course, there's been a lot of legal back and forth and he is now going on the offensive to derail Trump's delay tactics. Walk us through that and how consequential this case could be to Trump. COLLINSONSmith has argued against this. The case is due to be heard by the Supreme Court on April the 25th. We don't expect to get a result of that case until July, which means the -- even if the Supreme Court turns down Trump, the window for a trial to take place before the election is quite narrow. It could still happen, but Trump will try again to delay it. What Smith is now trying to doing is to cut off another delaying tactic in this very case because Trump is telling the Supreme Court, even if you decide there is no way massive claim of presidential immunity. You may decide that in some circumstances a president could be immune from prosecution. And then that has to go all the way back down to the lower courts for arguments about where this current case fits into that legal determination. That would delay it for months, probably take it back, not just past the November election, but into next year. And if Trump is present, he believes he will have the power through the attorney general that he would appoint to end this prosecution completely. So this is a vital argument that Smith is making a vital moment in this case as it appears that the hopes of many Democrats that this trial could take place before the election are beginning to fade.",

He only has a one vote majority going forward in the House among Republicans.All it would take would be one Republican lawmaker to call a vote to replace him if he puts this Ukraine aid, which is opposed by Donald Trump and pro-Trump lawmakers on the House floor. So he faces a great moment of -- a great dilemma here. What I will be watching for, I think is whether Democrats will agree to keep Johnson speaker in any vote to oust him, basically voting for a Republican to be speaker in return for the passage of that Ukraine aid. [08:40:10] This is a very interesting tactical moment for the Democrats as well. Do they want to keep Johnson as speaker in order to get that vitally needed aid to Ukraine without which President Zelenskyy says he will start losing, you know, battles against the Russian forces?

That was in late February. The Israeli military claimed its tanks fired warning shots to disperse a crowd after seeing people were being trampled.But a CNN analysis of the videos, interviews and eyewitness testimonies casts doubt on Israel's version of events. Katie Polglase has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): It's early morning on February 29th on Al-Rasheed Road in northern Gaza, thousands of starving people have gathered here to receive food. But as the aid trucks arrive, this happens. The night would become known as the Flour Massacre. By morning, over a hundred would be dead, in one of the single biggest mass casualty events of this conflict. CNN investigated this incident, obtaining never-seen-before videos of that night, collecting evidence from 22 eyewitnesses and tracing the aid itself all the way to a Muslim charity in the U.K. It was the IDF that was then responsible for safely delivering these vital supplies, but we found they opened fire on unarmed starving Palestinians at close range as the aid arrived. Their explanation for the tragedy using this drone video was a stampede that called soldiers to fire warning shots in the air. They later admitted to firing some shots directly at so-called suspects who approached them. But the IDF footage is incomplete. It cuts between crowds surrounding the trucks and bodies lying on the ground. Even this reveals they were firing in a densely packed area, likely to cause severe bloodshed. CNN requested the full footage from the IDF, but it was denied. Jihad Abou Watfa was amongst the starving Palestinians and started filming as the trucks crossed into Northern Gaza. JIHAD ABOU WATFA, EYEWITNESS (through translator): We decided to face the danger, to risk our lives to obtain any piece of bread for our families. POLGLASE (voice-over): Videos from Jihad and another key eyewitness, Belal, indicate the gunfire started earlier than the IDF claimed. The IDF published this timeline, saying the trucks arrived at the checkpoint at 4:00 a.m. They then crossed at 4:29 and only after that did the IDF fire shots at the crowd. But in Belal's video filmed seven minutes earlier at 4:22 a.m., gunshots ring out. He warns there is a tank. The IDF claim the convoy was still stationary at the checkpoint at this time. Next Jihad begins filming. It's now 4:28 a.m. and there's a barrage of gunfire and the shots are close. Analysis by weapons experts of the bursts indicate it is heavy automatic gunfire at 600 rounds per minute. Jihad keeps filming. A tank is beside me. We're now under siege, he says. Moments later you see a truck driving along the road. We spotted traces from the gunfire here. One could be seen ricocheting up here, according to weapons experts. WATFA (through translator): The feeling was totally indescribable, fear, confusion. You fear, God forbid, going back to your family as a martyr. POLGLASE (voice-over): As day broke, the number of dead and injured that emerged was staggering. Interviews with survivors at hospitals afterwards found some people had been shot in the upper body. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Where were you injured? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): In my chest, and it went through my back.
