This, in terms of political strategy, has been a tactical nightmare, a disaster.And so if you're Donald Trump, if you're a Republican, generally speaking, you're going to step back. You're going to allow the disarray to continue. You're going to use this time to raise more money.

I hear from voters and other strategists are also hearing from voters. I hear from grassroots groups on the ground that are going door to door in these swing states.

I would prefer Joe Biden on his worst day, including the debate night, than Donald Trump who will put my family in mass deportation camps and get rid of them, who would take away my rights and freedoms and make me raise my daughter in a country that has less rights than I did, who would impose an imperial presidency on us, especially after the MAGA Supreme Court gave him immunity where he could today be planning SEAL Team 6 to go and murder his political opponents. They are scared to death about the possibility of Donald Trump. And before you say, well, then shouldn't they then be the first ones to say they should change out Joe Biden? No, because Joe Biden - to them, Joe Biden is the one that has brought them the tools necessary after a disastrous four years of Donald Trump, after so many communities lived in fear. Donald Trump is the one that had - I'm sorry, Joe Biden is the one - see, it happens to everyone.

First, as you've seen these initial clips from this interview, which are intended in part by Biden and his team to show the country that he is capable of continuing, do you think that they convince you, convince others that's true? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think, first of all, with regard to the clip you just showed, you know, the idea that testing is potentially going to embarrass somebody or something like that, that's certainly not the intent of cognitive testing or neurological testing. It's maybe to try and get some answers to what has been causing some of the symptoms that he seems to have from time to time. He seems much more coherent tonight as compared to the debate. But I still think that that's an open question. Is there something else that's going on here? Or are these truly just episodes that appear from time to time? I think also this idea that you get the benefit potentially of early diagnosis and treatment from testing. That's part of the reason you do it.",

It's very hard from looking at the brief clips here to really make an assessment.It doesn't change the idea that I think testing would be beneficial. And, frankly, as you know, Jim, in the United States, anyone over the age of 65, Medicare asks that they get a cognitive test as part of their annual wellness checkup. For everybody over the age of 65, that would be President Biden and former President Trump. So, that should be part of the regular testing. SCIUTTO: Let me ask you this. He says he has not had a cognitive test recently. He did claim in that interview that the job, in effect, is a cognitive test, but has not had one for a number of months, going back to his last annual physical in February.

It can improve very quickly as well.In fact, the clinical trial from Dr. Dean Ornish showed that within 20 weeks, five months, people had reversal of signs of cognitive impairment. So they got better, but at the same time, people got worse during that same time frame in the trial who were not on the program.

They're pretty detailed. Usually about an hour, a physical exam, a significant patient history, oftentimes talking to family members as well to see what's going on.The cognitive testing is all sorts of different things, matching of patterns. A sniff test smell can be one of the first things to sort of give you a clue that something's going on. Blood work, looking at genetic risk factors, trying to piece it all together. But ultimately, you're trying to figure out how is someone doing in terms of their processing speed? How are they doing in terms of their executive judgment? How are they doing in terms of their memory? And if all those things look good, at a very minimum, you now have a baseline.

He said it speaking to voters, to reporters earlier today on the tarmac. Whatever you or I or anyone else says, it's his decision.

You know, he talked about the 200,000 jobs that were created. So he's actually now doing what people said. People said, put yourself in the cat bird seat or in the hot seat and answer some questions. He did. He didn't do anything to hurt himself. He actually underscored some stuff that people haven't been talking about. So his back's against the wall. He doesn't throw a staff on overboard. He doesn't hurt himself today. And he started to remind people about what he's achieved. I think on the whole, this is going to help him.

But when you listen to sort of the rationale for these members of Congress who are coming forward, they all have respect for him. But they wonder if he is the best person for that. One thing I didn't hear in the interview tonight was sort of an acknowledgment in his rally speech in Madison. He used his age. He said, you think I'm not old enough to, you know, support abortion rights and things but in the interview, he was very defensive of his age once again. So it's still something he's working through, but it's all about President Biden, all about Joe Biden himself. He thinks he's the best person. Democrats increasingly may not think that. So that is what he'll have to reconcile. And if he's insulated or not, he's about to get a sense I think next week when NATO leaders come to Washington and when members of Congress are back.
