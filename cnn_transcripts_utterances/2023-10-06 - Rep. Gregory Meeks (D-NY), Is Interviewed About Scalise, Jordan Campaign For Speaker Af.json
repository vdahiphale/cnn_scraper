This is CNN News Central. Insanity and a circus, yes, that is how you can describe this show. That is also how some Moderate Republican lawmakers are describing plans for a televised debate of sorts between the leading candidates to become the next House Speaker. Jim Jordan, Steve Scalise, Kevin Hern, you see them right there. They're all expected to participate. While that is swirling around the chaos of this past week in the House Republican Conference, a new endorsement has come in the race overnight. Donald Trump putting his full support behind Jim Jordan. CNN's Lauren Fox back on Capitol Hill for us. She's joining us now. Lauren, how is Jim Jordan reacting to this endorsement that came in overnight?",

Obviously, there's still a question about whether or not this really helps him in the race, given the fact that he already had large sloths of the conservative bloc in the Republican Party and many members of the House Freedom Caucus behind him.Those are the same members who might look to Donald Trump as a potential arbiter of who should be the next speaker. I do want to get to some new breaking news we have from our colleague, Melanie Zanona, that Jim Jordan is reacting to some of that backlash from the \"Fox News\" debate, saying that he first wants to talk to his Republican colleagues before he sits down for that forum. So that now puts into question the timing of that interview with Bret Baier. There's also, of course, questions on whether or not this could have an impact on his ability to win over some of the moderates, some of those members who were close allies of Kevin McCarthy. But our colleague Manu Raju caught up with Jim Jordan earlier today about the Trump endorsement. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I appreciate the president's endorsement. He's the leader of the party. He's going to be our presidential nominee, and I think he's going to be our next president. So I appreciate that. But we're focused also on, you know, the key thing is our colleagues and I'm talking with, you know, we got from Freedom Caucus to people in the middle to committee chairs to Jeff Van Drew, who was Democrat four years ago. We got all kinds of cross the board support, and we're just going to keep working. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just in the last day, we've seen this horrifying Russian attack on the Ukrainian town of Hroza. More than 50 people killed, an attack on a grocery store, civilians here. And one of the leading candidates for House Speaker Jim Jordan says he does not want to pass a new aid package for Ukraine. What are your feelings about that? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Devastated. Look, it's on the wrong side of history. Most of us have read history, and some of it took place in the 1930s. There was individuals then who were hesitant in wanting to intrude into the World War II, where you had Adolf Hitler. And millions of people died as a result. We've got to keep our commitment that we've made to our allies and to President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people. And guess what? It's really an investment for us because we don't have to have feet on the ground. So I would hope that, you know, and I believe solidly that the overwhelming majority of individuals in Congress will vote to keep funding Ukraine. So and I hope that the moderate Republicans do what they need to do to stand up and make sure that we get a bell on the floor so that we can make sure that we continue to fight and fund and help Ukrainians who have put up a gallop fight and are winning the fight.",

It is them who are responsible and dysfunctional, and they continue to be dysfunctional, and it hurts the American people.And so it is clear from what we are finding out now and listening to now, that this party of Donald Trump and that Donald Trump and Bannon was behind everything in regards to the removal the Republicans' decision to remove their own speaker, that's who did this. So they're dysfunctional. I'm concerned about them continuing no matter who the speaker is, to be quite frank, in that regards, if they continue to do the same thing that McCarthy did time after time, cater to the MAGA Republican extremists and there's a lot on the line here.",

The realities of the fact that already, in my opinion, Vladimir Putin has committed war crimes as you saw the devastation that took place yesterday. And there would be nothing to stop him from not only continuing the assault in Ukraine, but also to move in on some of our NATO allies. It is in our best interest as a country to support Ukraine, its troops, give them the artillery that it needs so that they can continue to win. Look, Ukrainians have already gained the ground back that Vladimir Putin had taken previously. And all of the gains that are being made now, even though they may be slow, are being made by the Ukrainians. They will win this war. That's why Putin is going to North Korea and the Iranians to try to get ammunition, because it is them that is wary and losing out with reference to their ammunitions. We need to stick to it.

Let me read to you this new reporting, first from \"ABC News.\" Months after leaving the White House, Trump allegedly discussed potentially sensitive information about U.S. nuclear submarines with a member of his Mar-a-Lago club, an Australian billionaire. That billionaire is Anthony Pratt. He was interviewed, we've now learned, by federal prosecutors, and he's listed as a potential witness for them in the classified documents case that they're building against Donald Trump. According to Pratt's accounting of what happened here, back in 2021 at Mar-a-Lago, he told Donald Trump that Australia should start buying its submarines from the United States. And that is when Trump allegedly leaned in and told him these two critical facts the supposed number of nuclear warheads that U.S. subs routinely carry, and exactly how close they supposedly can get to Russian submarines without being detected.In e-mails and conversations after that encounter, Pratt then relayed the information to a lot of people, six journalists, 11 employees, 10 Australian officials, and three former Australian prime ministers. Joining me now, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst and former Deputy Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. Thanks guys for being here. Andy, what's your take on this? Because if these are the two options, this is serious or this is short of that and just another round of Donald Trump not respecting protocol, where do you think this lands?",

And as evidence of that, I would point out the fact that the vast majority of classified information is classified by executive order, right? That's the President decides what's classified. He can then decide what's not classified. But not with nuclear defense information, that is classified by statute. Even the President can't declassify it. It's that serious, right?However, despite the seriousness of it, we have yet another example of Donald Trump treating our nation's most important secrets with disregard, irresponsibly, and in a way that could arguably be criminal, although he's not charged with this episode yet.",

You could still get this episode admitted as evidence of the former president's repeated conduct, irresponsible handling of information. There's all kinds of ways that a crafty prosecutor could get this in front of the jury. It could also, excuse me, be relevant in sentencing. If the former president's convicted, you could put this in front of the judge as evidence of related conduct. So we have not heard the last of this one, I'm afraid.",

And you can see this is the building that was hit by that strike. We were, of course, already reporting about it yesterday. But what happened here in the meantime was that this area last night was, of course, full of debris. There were a lot of dead bodies that were laying around here as well. That's all been cleared since then.But unfortunately, the teams that were working here, they very quickly came to the conclusion that there were no more survivors that could have been found here inside this building. It was hit by a very heavy missile. So this very quickly turned to a recovery operation and then a clearing operation. In fact, we have sort of nightfall coming in right now, but I think we pan over there. You can see that is pretty much what is left of the structure of that building. You can see up on top of that, there is a sort of box that seems to be for ice cream in there because, of course, this was a restaurant and also a cafe here where there was a funeral wake going on when that missile hit. One of the interesting things that we've learned, John, is that the missile that was used in this strike here appears to be the same type of missile that was then used in that attack you were just talking about on the city of Kharkiv, both of them Iskander missiles, very heavy missiles with a heavy warhead, obviously normally used on the battlefield against armored formations. And if you use them on a building like this, you get the kind of results that you see here. Folks that we've been speaking to here in the town tell us that pretty much every family here in this small village has lost someone in this attack. You were mentioning about every six resident was killed in this attack. We believe that the ratio is actually even worse than that because a lot of people had left when the war started. About 150 people may have still been here. So about every third resident actually killed in this attack, John.",
