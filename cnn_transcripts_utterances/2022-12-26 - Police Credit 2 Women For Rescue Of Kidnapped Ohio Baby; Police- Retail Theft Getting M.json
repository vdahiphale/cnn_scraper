And you've written many books, so you are an overachiever, I know, but this is the latest one, \"Myth America: Historians Take On the Biggest Legends and Lies About Our Past.\" All right, you took at the -- this is an 845-page document, so a lot to read. You compare this report to Watergate. Can you explain? JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, AUTHOR, \"MYTH AMERICA: HISTORIANS TAKE ON THE BIGGEST LEGENDS AND LIES ABOUT OUR PAST\" (via Webex by Cisco):  Sure. There was a roadmap put together by a special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, in 1974. And he basically handed off this documentation to the House Judiciary Committee, which was the evidence that led toward impeachment. And Watergate was a crisis of the presidency. And I talk about what happened after Watergate. What happened after Nixon resigned. And we had almost a decade of political reform that tried to correct the political system from what was exposed. HARLOW:  Yes, and I think that's the question now, and you raise a good point. I mean, what happened after was a pardon. And so, I say that because -- I'm talking about Nixon -- that brings up what one of Trump's lawyers now, Tim Parlatore, said on CNN this weekend, calling the criminal referral by this committee to the Justice Department, quote, \"worthless.\" He's saying it doesn't matter one bit. What you're talking about here is the history of what happens in terms of reforming the system.",

So that is extremely important and it's an important part of the January 6 report.But you also have to look at how politics works. After Watergate, we reformed campaign finance. We reformed ethics rules. And I think this crisis has revealed all sorts of vulnerabilities in our electoral system that really need to be addressed over the next few years.",

All of the Republicans are not on the same -- on the same page with this.So, do you see reform being a real possibility? For example, the Electoral College reform.",

It makes it harder for the vice president to ever try to tamper with the election results. It makes it harder for members of Congress to challenge the results from the state. Well, it just passed.And we need to think of a long-term project. Not everything has to happen in the next year but reform has to happen in the next five or six years. And I think more is possible, especially if Republicans feel they are suffering, as a result of former President Trump, at the ballot box.",
