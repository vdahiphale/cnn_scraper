They are, in that building, getting ready for Special Counsel Robert Hur's testimony. Hur finds himself on the receiving end of questioning today when he appears before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee. Hur investigated President Biden's handling of classified documents. He decided against bringing charges against the president. But the special counsel did deliver that political bombshell in his report last month, providing a less than flattering assessment of President Biden's memory. Priscilla Alvarez joins us now live from the White House with more. Priscilla, how is the White House planning to respond to what unfolds on The Hill today?",

And again, the White House, when they pushed back on this, they took issue with the way that the president was characterized. And the president himself was clearly irritated in a press conference that occurred in February, just after its release. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The photo was our first look supposedly at the princess in months, and it set off an internet frenzy. A senior editor at \"The Verge\" pointing out Metadata shows it was shot on a standard Canon DSLR camera and that it was edited twice on Photoshop for Mac. Other users claimed that they found the original image, replacing Kate with a sad Oompa Loompa from the disastrous and viral \"Willy Wonka\" experience in Scotland, which Kate was also apparently found missing at. That was another conspiracy. The user claims it was really Kate's children who were photoshopped to hide their real identities. Taylor Swift, Robert Downey Jr, Mr. Bean. Stephen Colbert claims he found the original. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": Today, Kate admitted that she had edited the photo.
