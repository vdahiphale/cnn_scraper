All of them adult residents there in the city of Hampton. They are three men and one woman. At this point, it is too early to say exactly what the motive is according to investigators. However, the police chief there in Hampton was asked if they believe that the suspect in this case may have a direct link or related to the victims. And the chief said at this point they don't believe that that's the case. Though he certainly (INAUDIBLE) by saying that it's still preliminary. Their massive focus right now is tracking down that individual that you see there on your screen. Again, this photograph shared by authorities in the suburb of Atlanta, a man identified as Andrew Longmore. Finally Jim, investigators are saying that he was last seen driving a black GMC Acadia 2007. And the license plate on that vehicle, Georgia license plate DHF 756.

We're seeing extreme record breaking heat across much of the country right now, massive flooding in the northeast. In your view, what is climate change playing in terms of a part in pushing these weather events to the extreme? Of course, lots of years we have heat waves.

That is pretty wild to think that we're see that much less cold.And what we're seeing across parts of the southwest, Death Valley has the potential of seeing the all-time highest temperature ever recorded on earth. And if you look at these climatological records, they have been around since the 1800s. But we have a picture into the past that goes back over 100,000 years by ice cores and by ocean sediment. Scientists can look at that data and get a pretty accurate picture of what things were like back then. A lot of people tell me that climate has always been changing and I often say in return the North and South Poles had palm trees but not when humans inhabited the earth. It was long before we're here. It is the dramatic warming that we're seeing. And you mentioned the flooding.

And as I said, you know, for Speaker McCarthy, this -- you know, I don't know if it's job security over national security, but it is really important that we get the work done of the American people. And I think that that's why the fund-raising numbers that you have seen for the Biden-Harris campaign are what they are, is because people know that this is about caring about their families, not just about what happens in a party in, you know, a political party in congress or in Washington. So it's important that we get this done. And we will get it -- we must get it done. But I'm also concerned about a government shutdown in the fall over appropriations.

Meanwhile, as potential indictments loom in Georgia, Trump is seeking a new court order that, if granted, would throw out evidence collected by a special grand jury and disqualify the district attorney from presiding over that case. Former federal prosecutor and host of the podcast, \"It's Complicated,\" Renato Mariotti, joins me now. Renato, a lot to discuss. What do you make of the federal prosecutor's latest interviews with the secretaries of state in Pennsylvania and New Mexico? We were talking to the secretary of state out in Arizona in the previous hour. He was a little reluctant to get into some of the specifics, which I guess you can kind of understand where he might be coming from on that. But what do you think is at the heart of this? Is it this attempt to gin up these fake and phony electors back in to 2020? Do you think that's what's going on here? What do you suspect? RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR &amp; PODCAST HOST, \"IT'S COMPLICATED\": That's right, Jim. So I think what this suggests to me is there is going to be charges related to that fake elector scheme. If anyone remembers, there were essentially false electors that were put forward in an attempt to try to overturn the result of the election and certify electors that had not been duly elected in those states. There were essentially false forms filled out that suggests there were the valid electors for the states. Those were false documents that were going to be presented to the United States Senate. In fact, there were very concerted efforts to get those before the United States Senate, ultimately, to have Mike Pence send that back to the states or delay. So I think that is going to be either a conspiracy to defraud the United States or potentially some false -- you know, some charges related to false statements in a federal proceeding. But either way, this really suggests to me that there is going to be charges related to that. Because otherwise, I don't see Jack Smith going down the road of talking to the individual secretaries of state.",

This is his inner circle. Is this a case that we could see charges in the case soon?And I guess, you know, on the flip side of this, I mean, it does look as though, if he's talking to secretaries of state, if he's talking to people like Jared Kushner and Hope Hicks, I mean, that's still a pretty wide net that they're casting at this stage of the investigation. Might that also suggest that we're not that close? I hate to ask both sides of the coin here. (CROSSTALK)",

We saw at the January 6th committee there was some from Trump's inner circle that they told him he actually lost.They told him there was no hope of overturning the election, there was no legal path forward, that sort of thing. That's what I think those interviews were there for. So this way, essentially, Smith has them locked in, they can't take the stand and say something different. They essentially lock out defenses for Trump. That's why I think they were interviewed. And I will say, Jim, typically, when there is testimony coming out of a grand jury, that usually tells me there are weeks to go before an indictment. However, Jack Smith proved me wrong in Mar-a-Lago when he had witnesses at the grand jury and returned an indictment literally a day later.",

And Jack Smith is going to focus like a laser on pushing this case forward. He's not explicitly making the argument that this trial needs to happen before the election. But he's certainly doing whatever he can to speed it forward. And I think that's implicit in his argument. My guess is the judge will set a trial date sometime next year and suggest that she's open to reconsidering that date as circumstances change.",
