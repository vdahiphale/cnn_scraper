Authorities were motivated to keep looking, for weeks, after footprints a dirty diaper, and a bottle, were found in the Amazon. Colombia's president said the kids survived like, quote, \"Children of the jungle.\" They're currently in a shelter home, run by a welfare agency.

Lawmakers are putting the U.S. Military at the center of a political fight. Abortion, transgender health care, and diversity, are all now part of a major defense bill. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen is here to respond. And, for 13 years, a string of murders went unsolved, until now. The burner phones and the pizza crust that helped police catch the suspect, in the Long Island serial killings. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, the Special Counsel is expanding the January 6th investigation. Jack Smith, going into all seven battleground states that Trump lost, and where he fought the results, to gather more evidence. We have learned exclusively, tonight, that two more top election officials have met, with the Special Counsel's team. Pennsylvania Secretary of State, Al Schmidt, a Republican, was interviewed, back in March, a source tells CNN. He was asked about the impact of voter fraud misinformation, as he was serving, as Philadelphia's City Commissioner, at the time. And according to a second source, New Mexico's top election official, Democrat, Maggie Toulouse Oliver, was also questioned, in recent months. That's on top of the other officials that we already know about. Arizona's former Republican House Speaker, Rusty Bowers, broke the news, right here, that he had been subpoenaed, by Jack Smith. We were also the first to hear from Michigan's Secretary of State, Jocelyn Benson, after learning that she too had been subpoenaed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, what does it signify, to you, as we learn more about this investigation, where it could be going, as it comes to an end? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: So, it's so interesting, because if you do think back, two weeks ago, there were questions, about just how broadly is Jack Smith looking here. Is he looking only narrowly, at the sort of submission of fake electors? And we now know the answer. He's looking at everything. He's looking at all seven states. He's focusing on all the different aspects of the pressure campaign, the pressure campaign, on state and local officials, pressure campaign, on Mike Pence, the submission of those fake electors certificates. He's doing what prosecutors have to do. He's getting all the information. Then, he's got to sit down, to winnow it down and, figure out is any of this criminal",

And the military does not, in any other case, reimburse, for travel expenses, for elective procedures.Now, I didn't like -- I did not like the idea of this amendment. These are not issues that I believe we should be voting on, right now, without some consideration, of what we can do, to protect women, and show that we're pro-women, which has been my frustration for the better part of the last seven months. And Kaitlan, in fact, I filed an amendment, this week, for the bill that said for the same amount of funding that we would -- the military would spend, on travel reimbursement, for women, traveling out of the state that the same amount would be spent, for women, who chose to have their baby, or giving them prenatal care, maternal care, doula care, et cetera, just trying to show that there's a balancing act here, and we can be pro-woman, and pro-life. And the amendment was ruled out of order. And I have deep frustrations about the way things went down, this week.",

So, I wonder what goes through your mind, and maybe the mind of others, who are at the Pentagon, now, when you see this bill being loaded with all of these social policy provisions, from Republicans? ADM. MIKE MULLEN, FORMER JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: Well, I think it really hurts the military, from a reputation standpoint. It hurts it from a readiness standpoint. It hurts it from a recruiting standpoint. And it hurts it from a retention standpoint. This bill, as you've said, Kaitlan, normally passes with significant bipartisan support. I think it is reflective of the political environment, and actually, to continue to politicize the military, and put it right into the middle of all the politics, actually is something that we -- those of us, who served, and those who are leading now, want to stay as far away from as possible.
