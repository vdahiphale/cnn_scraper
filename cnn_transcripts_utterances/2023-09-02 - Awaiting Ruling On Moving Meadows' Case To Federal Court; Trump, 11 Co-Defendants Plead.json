Good evening.We begin with a pivotal week in Georgia's election meddling case against Donald Trump and 18 co-defendants. More developments are looming. Any day we could see a key ruling on Mark Meadows, Trump's former White House chief of staff. Meadows is requesting that his charges be moved from Georgia to a federal court. Former President Trump and 11 of his co-defendants have entered \"not guilty\" pleas. We've learned Trump's trial will be seen both online and on television assuming it stays in Fulton County. The presiding judge there says all hearings and trials in his courtroom can be livestreamed and televised. That also applies to Trump's co-defendants. Joining us now to talk about this, CNN senior political commentator and former Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger, who also served on the House Select January 6th Committee. Congressman, great to see you. Hey, let's jump right in to this. And I do want to get to the January 6th news and the latest on Donald Trump's many legal troubles but we're about four and a half months from the Iowa caucuses. Trump is out to this massive lead over his Republican rivals. We're showing this to our viewers -- a brand-new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll shows Trump is the top pick with 59 percent -- 59 percent of Republican voters supporting and the rest of the field is way behind him. What do you make of that?",

When Donald Trump was charged with this stuff, if the people -- because even the rest of the people in the polls not named Donald Trump, generally have the trust of the GOP base. But the GOP base is choosing somebody else. Had all those people come together and said look, this is not our party. This is not ok.You know, as Chris Christie said, we can't normalize this. I think you'd be seeing a very different number. But instead, what you see is the vast majority of Donald Trump's opponents go out and say this is a witch hunt. This is a politically-motivated attack. And so if the people you trust are saying that, you're going to believe it because why would you believe otherwise? The people you trust are saying it's politically motivated, and you're going to rally behind the guy that's being attacked. And that's what's happening here. And that's what -- it's the shame of not having courage in running for office. It's the shame of leaders who are too scared to tell the truth. And you know, we're going to see a Republican Party with Donald Trump as the nominee, it sounds like.",

So I guess from a tactical perspective, I can understand that. But there is a chance Donald Trump could win.We said in -- I said in 2016 literally the night before the election, there's no way Donald Trump's going to win. After the election, I kind of woke up saying there's no way Donald Trump actually won. And I think that's the danger we have right now, which is why I've been saying we have to have this what I call kind of an uncomfortable alliance between the left and the few sane on the right to defend democracy. Frankly, probably support Democrats in 2024 instead of Donald Trump. So it's a real risk out there and I think that high -- those polls show Donald Trump is tied, I'd take that very seriously.",

But it was part of like the whole January 6th Committee. One of the things I was doing it for was because I think history had to set the record straight. There were too many conspiracy theories out there and I think our committee did that. I think this trial will do the same. And it will make it very awkward for those members of the House, members of the Senate, you know, anybody in the GOP defending Donald Trump when this evidence is being put out there.

In 1866, when people talked about rebellion and insurrection, there were dozens of laws and hundreds of presidential orders proclaiming the southern states in a state of rebellion and insurrection.There was no ambiguity about it. There were lots of laws that the Confederacy was in a rebellion and an insurrection. So you didn't have to go to court to say, is Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, are they insurrectionists? They had been branded as such by multiple statutes, multiple presidential orders. Today, you'd have to do all of that from zero. So some would go to court. And by the way, who put the secretaries of state in charge? That's not how it was done in 1966. Then the Union Army was occupying the south and they could say, if you were a former Confederate officer and you were trying to run for office, you had previously taken an oath to the United States, the Army would stop you. We don't have that system today. We don't have a definition and we don't have a means of execution. And if we try to invent both on the fly, we're going to discover it doesn't stop with Trump.

Eventually four and five lines with ropes and hand lines and the gator never really took off. I think a gator this size is used to standing his ground. He's probably 60 to 90 years old and he's used to eating whatever messes with him. So he had no reason to run. Ultimately, about an hour into the fight, he swam under a bunch of trees and that's where we were for about two and a half more hours before he finally gave us the opportunity to get more lines in him that weren't caught in the tree limbs.
