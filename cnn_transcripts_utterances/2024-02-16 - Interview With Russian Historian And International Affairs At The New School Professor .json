Hello, everyone, and welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. It's news that stunned the world. Alexei Navalny, Russia's most famous opposition figure, has died while in jail. That's according to the country's prison authorities. A chorus of world leaders are calling for accountability, from the NATO secretary general who says Russia has \"serious questions\" to answer, to U.S. President Joe Biden, who praised Navalny for bravely standing up to corruption and violence. He said that he was outraged, but not surprised. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Make no mistake. Putin is responsible for Navalny's death. Putin is responsible. What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin's brutality. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Even though we knew that Alexei Navalny was in deteriorating health, there was something immortal about him given everything that he had overcome and survived, and yet decided, once he was rehabilitated, to go back to Russia where he clearly was a true patriot of the country in every sense of the word.

People were saying similar things about him, that his murder would change the trajectory of Putin's power, of his control over the country. And we've only seen it clamped down. Recall, Nina, when Navalny returned in 2021, there were mass protests on the street after he was initially arrested. And now, you see images of people taking to the streets, not in Russian cities at large, but, you know, mostly in neighboring European capitals. Do you think this impacts Russia at all and specifically Putin's hold on power?",

And in fact, Boris Nemtsov's death in 2015, it impacted because -- and I was talking about the torturous and murderoussystem is that every time something like that happened, actually the state gets tougher. So, the more blood it spills, the more blood it wants. So, in this sense, after Nemtsov's death, the state got tougher and tougher on its critics. So, that happened. And I expect that to happen again. But also, I mean, you say neighboring countries, not just in neighboring countries, I mean, there are images pouring from Moscow and Yekaterinburg and other cities where people bring flowers. In effect, you so already that FSB, the security forces, the Amva (ph) did -- the internal forces, they already warned people against any oppositional movements. Anything, anything. So, I would imagine that soon enough if there is more and more outpouring of support and condolences, people will start getting arrested. In fact, I was going to this opposition meetings when Navalny returned, and they were indeed massive. And very quickly, I mean, I think they would allow us to protest for about an hour and then people would be just taken into police stations in giant numbers. So, that suggests that the state is still an incredibly weak, despite -- you know, still, despite all the clampdown, it shows the absolute weakness of that state. It doesn't mean it's going to collapse tomorrow, but it means that the more Putin expands his power over people, the more he gets paranoid, but also the more protests is brewing somewhere underneath. And that's why he's going to clamp down more. But he's also less safe than he was when he would allow a little bit of opposition to exist, because that's how you get the steam out. So, if I were him, knowing Russian history, I would be quite worried.",

And we rememberthat Trump said, well, you know, maybe Putin killed people, but we also kill people. So, for him it's not such a big deal. And hence, for his wing of the party, Trump's wing of the party, it may not be such a big deal. So, yes. But perhaps, maybe not. But as for Putin taking advantage of this or not taking advantage of that, I think logically yes, it would be a really horrible thing for Putin before the elections, Navalny was not forgotten, but it was sort of quiet and under the rug. And, you know, he was somewhere behind the Arctic Circle and not every day he would be remembered. And one time, there was another opposition figure journalist of Novaya Gazeta, Anna Politkovskaya, who was similarly killed in 2006 and Putin said, well, she was more important to me alive than dead because now she's a martyr. I think that logically, rationally it is the case, but in a paranoid mind of a person who has been in power for 25 years, the dead martyrs are still better than live martyrs because they cannot -- the image of them, he thinks, is not as important when there's a live figure leading the potential protests. So, in this sense, I think where Putin is concerned, just yet another opposition is dead and there is so many still remain. And so, if they disappear, then he's going to rule forever. But that's how dictators think. That's not how rational politics is done. Putin is a dictator. And therefore, he thinks in Stalinesque terms, in dictatorial form terms, which has nothing to do with rational explanation of what happened and how to react to this.",

And let's not forget that, actually, when Yulia Navalnaya was out there in the plenary, after she spoke about her husband and what needed to be done to hold his killers accountable, she got a massive standing ovation. You can imagine everybody here is with her, and Navalny has been a cause that not just her, her family, staff and the others, not just many Russian people, but the whole world has been looking at him personifying the quest for freedom and democracy in Russia. And, clearly, that struggle has a long way to go.",

Perhaps she can continue his fight for change in Russia, anti-corruption, for democracy in the country and a regime change herself as well. She is somebody to be watched very closely. Christiane, fascinating interview with Secretary Clinton. Thank you. Well, as we've mentioned, when Navalny fell ill on that flight after being poisoned, it was Germany that gave him medical treatment and safe refuge. So, it's no surprise the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had strong words today in Berlin upon hearing the reports of Navalny's death. He and the Ukrainian president presented a united front. And of course, Volodymyr Zelenskyy knows as well as anyone what Vladimir Putin is capable of. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Putin doesn't care who dies as long as he retains his position, and that is why he must not keep anything. Putin must lose everything. He must not retain anything and must be held accountable for what he has done. OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator):  We now, if we didn't already, know exactly what kind of regime this is. Anyone who voices criticism, who stands up for democracy, must fear for their safety and their lives. This is no longer a democracy and has not been for a long time now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're coming upon the nine-year anniversary of his murder in Moscow, just steps away from the Kremlin. I don't know if we have it. If we can put it up. There it is. I tweeted it today. It's a photo of Boris Nemtsov standing next to Alexei Navalny, both of them joking, laughing, smiling. And I really view this photo as a representation of what Russia could have been with either one of these men at the helm of the country, or at least prominent figures that are allowed to speak publicly and to campaign publicly and not behind closed bars and not as martyr's post-death or murder. What are your views now as we assess what the picture, the bleak picture looks like going forward, at least in the short-term for Russia, in terms of anyone else being able to fill those voids? PETER POMERANTSEV, AUTHOR, \"THIS IS NOT PROPAGANDA\" AND SENIOR FELLOW, AGORA INSTITUTE, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY:  So, I would add many more pictures, many more pictures of dissidents and journalists killed within Russia. And then the tens and hundreds of thousands of people Putin has killed in Syria and in Ukraine. The greatest hope for putting an end to Putin's regime lies with Ukrainians and with us in backing Ukrainians inside Russia. For the moment, we see no signs of resistance. It is Ukraine that is fighting for its own life, for our freedom, and for theirs.",

One of the biggest threats to his control over the country last summer. Obviously, he then died mysteriously, as we know, it was blown up in a plane -- in a bomb explosion on a plane. We have this -- I'll put it in air quotes, \"election next month.\" There had always been this question since Navalny's return. I'm not sure it's a really productive question to have asked, but was it worth it, especially knowing what would happen a year later, and that is Putin's full-scale invasion into Ukraine? Of course, Navalny, being a true patriot of Russia, said that any change would have to come from somebody who was inside the country. I'm wondering if you still view that that's the future the country faces, that if there is any real change, that it will come from internal pressure and not from any sort of outside views or pressure that can come on the Kremlin?",

He starts his expansionist wars when he sees that there is some danger to himself internally. And at the moment, the biggest way to stand up to that does come from the outside. Let's not keep on waiting for the miracle of, I don't know, the bravery of Navalny or the craziness of Prigozhin. We are the ones who have agencies. Secretary Clinton was just talking about the struggles that Ukrainians have with ammunition in the France, we can easily replenish that ammunition if the U.S Congress passes the aid bill. But actually, it is Putin who will face a shortfall in ammunition in just one year. Yes, in just one year, according to analysts. And it's a much, much, much more fragile system than it looks from the outside. And it's up to us to put pressure back. And then maybe the new generation of Navalny's will be able to rise up. I don't know. But I do know that at the moment, the agency lies with us.",

And perhaps he's betting that Congress will not act and that there will be a change in leadership in the U.S as well with the upcoming elections. Mikhail Zygar, Peter Pomerantsev, thank you so much.

I don't want to spend too much time talking about him, but I do want to read to you and to ourviewers about something you just referenced and why he wasn't asked about the war. He was asked in a separate summit a few days after his interview, whatever you want to call it, with Putin. He was asked why he didn't talk about freedom of speech in Russia or Navalny or the assassinations, the multiple assassinations coming down at the hands of the Kremlin and Tucker's response was, \"Every leader kills people, including my leader. Some kill more than others. Leadership requires killing people.\" And I raised this not just because this is a jaw dropping response, but it echoes something that we heard from Former President Trump when he was then Candidate Trump, I believe, in 2015. And that is, you know, we have killers here in the U.S. too. How dangerous -- speak to how dangerous comments like that are in response to what we're seeing perpetrated by the Russian regime on a daily basis. KARA-MURZA:  These comments are indeed very, very dangerous, and they are absolutely despicable also. And I believe that this is why Vladimir Putin gave this interview to Carlson, because he did not need a reliable journalist. He needed someone like Tucker Carlson who repeats and reiterates the messages put out there by Former President Trump. He needed someone with a large audience and someone who would help him get out his message about his claims on Ukraine being somehow legitimate and about him not really being a killer, but, well, you know, he's a good guy who really wants peace. This is despicable. And the only thing I can say about Vladimir Putin is that this despicable atrocity of a man who calls himself the president of the Russian Federation should be stopped. He has to be stopped, and that is the only way war will be stopped and repression in Russia will be stopped.",

But if in fact it is, does thenews of his death worry you about the safety of your husband, Vladimir? And when was the last time you spoke with him? Do you know how he's doing? KARA-MURZA:  I believe that the news about Alexei's possible death have affected every single family of political prisoner in Russia. And because we all know what kind of repressive methods are being used by the authorities against those who refuse to be silent. And we know that these people are subject to all kinds of torture on a daily basis. And the lives of these people behind bars are indeed in grave danger, as is the life of my husband. Last time -- well, just before New Year's -- at the end of December, Vladimir was allowed a 15-minute phone call with our kids. We have three kids. So, that's five minutes each. And I was standing there with a timer because I couldn't let any one of them to speak to their father for longer than five minutes because that would have taken time away from the other two. And of course, I did not speak to Vladimir either because I didn't want to take the time away from the kids. That was the first call, the 15- minute call in over half a year. Vladimir, you know, on the 14th of February, we celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary. That was not the way we planned to celebrate it. But here we are. And Vladimir put in a request for a phone call with me, and the prison authorities responded that this was not an exceptional circumstance that would allow such a call.

And I am praying really, truly, Evgenia, praying for you all to be reunited very, very, very soon. My last question to you. In terms of the proper or most effective response to the now alleged reported death of Alexei, you heard from President Biden saying that would be Congress finally signing into law that legislation that provides some $60 billion in aid that Ukraine desperately needs right now in its war with Ukraine. Would you agree with that? KARA-MURZA:  Absolutely, and it should have been done yesterday. It should have been done without Alexei Navalny dying for this. Because Vladimir Putin committed similar crimes in the past and got away with it every single time. Now, for two years, a war of aggression is being led in Ukraine and people are dying on a daily basis. Civilians are dying on a daily basis. And Vladimir Putin is using all kinds of absolutely war techniques that are forbidden by, you know, everywhere in the civilized world. So, Ukraine has to be victorious in this war on Ukraine's terms, and that is crucial, because maybe that will send a clear message to the Kremlin that Vladimir Putin and his government would no longer be allowed to get away with committing such atrocious crimes. The only thing this regime knows how to do is to steal, kill, and lead wars. And this regime has to be stopped if we want peace to be restored and if we want repression to end.",
