We begin this hour in Nashville where a key vote is likely tomorrow on one of the lawmakers expelled from the Tennessee legislature. The Nashville City Council could vote on whether to send Justin Jones, you see right there, right back to his seat. He was one of the three state Tennessee lawmakers, all Democrats, targeted by the GOP supermajority for their loud but peaceful protest on the House floor.They were demanding gun reform after the Nashville school shooting that left three 9-year-old children and three adults dead. The two expelled lawmakers, Justin Pearson and Justin Jones are black. Gloria Johnson, who was white, kept her seat by a single vote. Let's go to Nashville right now and CNN's Isabel Rosales. Isabel, the Nashville City Council would have to suspend its rules to vote tomorrow on Jones. What are you hearing at this point? Does it sound like they might have the votes to put them right back into the state house?",

That's 27 council members out of the overall 40 council members. I spoke just a couple of hours ago to one of the council members, Jeff Syracuse, and he tells me that he is confident that there is enough support there to push that vote through.What he's not so confident about is a vote that happens right before that appointment, and that is a vote to suspend a council rule that prohibits a nomination and an appointment from happening during the same meeting. Just two council members could object to that rule and if that happens, if they fail to suspend that rule, that means that it could take more than four weeks until they are able to nominate Jones back to his seat. And if it succeeds, well, then they can do that appointment tomorrow. Political tensions are rising, Jim. We're hearing from the chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party who says that political threats have been made against Memphis and Shelby County, threats of withholding state funding for key projects should they reappoint former Representative Justin Pearson. We heard from Pearson during a powerful sermon delivered at his church earlier today, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The exercises began only a day after Taiwan's president completed a trip to the U.S. and Central America and met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.Chinese officials are calling this show of force a, quote, \"serious warning to the Taiwanese people.\" Taiwan's defense ministry says it's closely monitoring the situation. And let's talk about this now. CNN military analyst and retired lieutenant general Mark Hertling joins us now. Great to see you, general. You know, Chinese officials say these playing drills were due to Taiwan's, quote, \"collusion with external forces.\" I suppose we're used to chest beating coming out of China, but how concerned should the U.S. be about these exercises taking place right after a meeting with the Speaker of the House?",

What you're talking about, you know, they're calling them drills, these three-day exercises, but they have about a dozen ships and close to 70 aircraft in the area. And what they really are not so much drills, but the navy is seeing them as rehearsals.They are conducting deployment operations, freedom of navigation operations in the straits between China and Taiwan. But they're also sending ships to the eastern side of Taiwan, and that kind of looks like I think to most naval experts as an attempt to blockade the island. So, I think we're seeing the potential for expansion of the kinds of things China is doing against Taiwan because of the speaker's engagement with the president of Taiwan.",

I'm not going to talk about it here, having worked on the Joint Staff in the Pentagon, how these things could have gotten out, but it's horrific.Everyone -- every country knows every other country conduct intelligence operation against everyone, friend and foes alike. But when it's leaked to an open press, it's really problematic because it really generates a lack of trust between nations, both friends and foes, particularly friends. When you're also talking about a situation like we are in a shooting war between Ukraine and Russia, and some of the information about our intelligence assessment gets out, it can be troubling.

So, the Masters will survive the departure of anybody. Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, whomever it may be.But Tiger Woods is compelling. There's no question. He makes the cut. He had no real chance to win, but just making the cut was an achievement, all things considered, coming back off horrendous injuries from an automobile accident, which must be said was entirely his fault and only by good luck did it not involved anyone else, any other innocent person. But it was thought for a long time that he might never play competitively again. So, the very fact that he's been able to compete at some level is kind of amazing. And he has a huge fan base and he has tremendous star power, so they're going to put him on camera anytime he takes a shot, but this is the third time that he's withdrawn from a tournament this year.

But then subsequent to that comes the car accident and those gruesome injuries and he himself has said that he doesn't think he can ever approach his past competitive level, so.And if he had played through to the end because they suspended play yesterday with a terrible weather, he would have had to have played, I think 27 holes today on that bed ankle.

The question is, do they do it intelligently?Baseball is supposed to have a pleasing, leisurely pace, not the plotting lethargic pace it still often had in recent seasons. So, I've been in favor of this for a long time and baseball did its due diligence. They checked it in the minor leagues and then they superimposed a pitch timer as they proposed to use over classic games of the past, games people remember and have enjoyed. And seldom did the pitcher or the hitter violate in the '80s or '90s what would be the ruling today. Now, have there been a few little moments of confusion where the batter didn't make eye contact with the pitcher or the pitcher wasn't quite sure what the -- where the timer was, yeah, there have been a few. But as of a couple of days ago, they were averaging only around one violation per game, not just per team, but both teams overall. And it's achieved the desired results. So, I'm all for it.",

They're going to have to figure that out.One thing that's interesting about this sort of a side note, but Max Scherzer of the Mets, three-time Cy Young award winner, but 38-years- old, has said that the pitch timer has not given him enough time to gather himself between pitches. You know, there's an exertion like if you're going to throw it max effort. There's a recovery time and you might be used to something closer to 30 seconds than 15 or 20 seconds. And he's felt like he hasn't been able to gather himself to exert himself to the fullest and maybe now we're looking especially for older pitchers. You know, the pitch limit generally has been when you get to 100 pitches now, in modern baseball, we're going to take you out.
