As we wait to learn how Israel will respond to Iran's massive missile and drone attacks today, Israel's war cabinet met behind closed doors. Sources telling CNN it got heated as they discussed the timing and the scope of any kind of response.We're going to turn to Colonel Peter Lerner. He's a spokesman for the IDF. Colonel Lerner, thanks for being with us. What can you say came out of that war cabinet meeting today? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESPERSON, IDF: Thank you, Anderson. Good to be here. What I can say is that of course the idea presented to the government expected -- (INAUDIBLE)",

      "sentences": "Yes. Anderson, as we are working on those technical difficulties, waiting to get an update from what is happening in Tel Aviv, we're also seeing what is happening right now inside the courthouse here for the other major story we are following as we are still waiting on the actual jury selection in Trump's first criminal trial to get underway.Technically, it's 11:30 a.m. here on the East Coast, and not one prospective juror has actually been brought in the room to be questioned by the prosecution and by the defense because they are still arguing over what those jurors, once they are decided what they can hear and also whether or not Donald Trump has violated his gag order. I've got CNN's Paula Reid and Kristen Holmes here with me. And, Paula, the gag order is a notable thing because right now they're technically on a break. Donald Trump has just exited the courtroom. He didn't say anything as he left the courtroom. But what they are arguing is that with comments he was making about Michael Cohen, we were just talking about the central role he'll have in this case, if that violated this gag order. Is this something that the judge is going to decide yes, or no, Trump did violate it? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: So, it appears that this break may be for the judge to take a moment and decide what to do. Now, it's certainly not a surprise that Trump would violate a gag order. We've seen him do it before. But the challenge for the judge is what do you do now? We're not even half a day into jury selection at the outset of a five to six-week trial, how do you keep Trump within the bounds of his gag order without making him a murderer, or disrupting this case? So, the prosecutors here said that they were going to seek to have Trump held in contempt for these comments where he referred to -- they argue he referred to Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen, two key witnesses in this case, as \"sleazeballs.\" And there are two examples right now that we just heard in the past 15 minutes of social media, potentially getting Trump in trouble. One, prosecutors argue that they want to bring in tweets where it appeared Trump was pressuring Michael Cohen not to flip. And then, of course, these more recent social media posts where he appears to be attacking witnesses, which is a blatant violation of his gag order.",

But right now, the big question is, what are they going to do about this gag order because this is going to be a reoccurring issue every day throughout this trial? Because as we know, Trump does not stay within the bounds of gag orders. And even though every other defendant knows you can't attack witnesses, you can't attack the prosecutors, here, Trump can say whatever he wants about the judge or about the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, but he is not allowed to attack witnesses, jurors, or family members of court personnel.",

A 99 percent interception rate is an exceptional success.The 170 explosive drones that Iran launched against Israel, they never even reached Israeli airspace. The 30 cruise missiles Iran, Iraq, and the Houthis launched also didn't reach Israeli airspace.

The judge, the prosecutors, and Trump's defense attorneys are now debating the testimony of former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. CNN's Paula Reid is outside of the courthouse in Manhattan. Paula, what exactly are they debating when it comes to Michael Cohen? REIDNow, of course, Cohen, Trump's longtime lawyer, consigliere, famously flipped on Trump. He pleaded guilty in a separate campaign finance case at the federal level. And here, prosecutors are saying they want to bring in evidence about his plea -- about his plea deal with federal prosecutors. But Trump's attorneys argue that that should not be brought in because Trump is not charged with campaign finance violations. Now, the tricky thing about that, Jake, is the reason that this falsifying documents case is being charged as a felony is because the district attorney argues this was all done in furtherance of an effort to influence Trump's chances in the 2016 election. So, they're going back and forth right now about just how much evidence can be brought in a byte -- about Michael Cohen.
