Hurricane Milton no longer ahurricane, but still packing ferocious storm winds and wreaking havoc, destructive heavy rain, multiple tornadoes, and there's still more to come. The sartre survivors, first responders are looking through floodwaters and rubble, and the authorities say there's so much more damage to be searched. And a new wave of air strikes at central Beirut, Israel's security cabinet has voted on a response to Iran's missile attack. People trapped amid floodwaters with homes washed away and businesses destroyed. So far, we now know eight people have been killed by Hurricane Milton. It's no longer in Florida. It's a post-tropical storm and yet, a hurricane or not, its path of destruction has left residents there facing long and undoubtedly painful roads to recovery. The first responders are working to rescue those surrounded by high water after record-breaking rainfall. More than a 100 people have been rescued from Tampa Assisted Living Facility, I'll tell you about that in a second or three. Milton has been spawning what the hurricane director called supercharged tornadoes, at least, nine of them rip through St. Lucie County, according three, in a span of just 25 minutes. Now, that's where five people were killed, and officials say more than 100 homes damaged, if not destroyed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEITH PEARSON, SHERIFF, ST. LUCIE COUNTY, FLORIDA:  That's an understatement that the roof were torn off. We're talking about entire modular homes that were lifted off their foundation, you can't even recognize it, it's just a 12-foot pile of rubbish, and you know, I just pray that these are seasonal homes and the residents who are up north are not there. Everything is replaceable. Life isn't. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he said that he would call on the House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring lawmakers back to Washington to actually do that. Mike Johnson has resisted that effort up until this point, but that is sort of a new development from the President there. But also, of course, very forcefully pushing back on the former President Trump on these disinformation campaign that he says was un-American and he says that he should have the decency to just tell the truth about what's going on, specifically about how much money people are eligible for if they are affected by the storm. There has been a swirl of disinfo about only being able to receive $750, but the President in there, very clear that, that money is meant as a bridge. It's meant to help people pay for prescriptions, for diapers, for baby formula, stuff that they really need in the immediate term, but that there is a lot more money available to them should they need it.

In one of them, it appears an entire residential building has collapsed and they're talking about mass casualties. At this point, the Ministry of Health is saying there's a preliminary death toll of 11 with 48 wounded there, fire trucks and ambulances cramming those two areas, and it's important to keep in mind, Richard, that these are areas that people considered safe. So, many of those who fled from the southern suburbs, from south Lebanon, from the Beqaa Valley have taken refuge in this -- these exact areas, the parts of central Beirut that aren't associated in any way with Hezbollah, and therefore, this is -- certainly, this kind of strike in the heart of Beirut raises fears and certainly increases the tensions that are already at a boiling point when it comes to this kind of strike. And as I said, this death toll of 11 is preliminary at this point, and given the size of the building and the fact that it's utterly flattened, the fear is that the death toll will continue to rise, Richard.",

We don't want Hamas, he says, all we really want is God, and if this suffering just keeps going on, he said, then just drop a nuclear bomb on us and be done with it or find a solution. Look, I think what you saw in that school was a level of desperation, anxiety, accumulated stress being vented by one person there who was looking for a couple of his cousins. But turn the chapter, turn the video to the hospital where the wounded and dead were being bought in, and this is very, very gruesome and hard to watch video. There was a tiny girl lying on her back on the floor in the hospital where all the other patients were around her, and she stood out because she was so tiny, so frail. Her clothes were burned off. The doctor said she had third degree burns. She was peppered with all sorts of little pockmarks from bits of flying debris and masonry. She was half covered in gray dust from the building. And she's trying to reach out for doctor -- to the doctor, and she's saying, doctor, doctor, I love you. And she says -- he tells her -- that the doctor says, it's OK. It's OK. What's the matter? What's the matter? And she says, doctor, am I going to die? Am I going to die? And he says, no, you're going to be OK. You've got some injuries. You'll be OK. You'll survive. You know, the image of that girl was just very harrowing and she was not one of the worst injured. It's perhaps the hardest part, so to see the ambulances unloading the bodies and remains of people. And then, of course, the wife afterwards, who comes looking for her husband, and she tells everyone his name. Where is he? Where is he? He's the rock in my life. He's the father of our three daughters, and she names her daughters. And then, she sort of says, God is great, God is great. And quite literally faints in front of the crowd. They're very harrowing images. And of course, this is the day when health officials in Gaza say more than 42,000 people were killed. But the IDF has said very clearly that at that school, they believed there was a terrorist command and control center, that was in Central Gaza. Richard.",

And most of the deaths happen on the East Coast of Florida, where a lot of these tornadoes hit. We'll walk around real quick to show you some of the damage out here in Fort Myers Beach. Now, to give you some context and perspective, some of this damage that you're taking a look at here was a result of Hurricane Ian, which made landfall on here in Fort Myers Beach back in 2022. And so, a lot of these businesses have remained untouched. But as you can see, the sand, the debris, the fencing that used to be outside of these businesses was all blown away by the storm surge out here. We're talking about a storm surge. About five and a half feet of flooding because of this storm. That number, though, is a lot less than what was expected. Because here, the biggest concern going into the storm was that we were looking at anywhere between eight to 12 feet of storm surge. And while that part of Fort Myers Beach really hasn't been touched, I can tell you, having covered Hurricane Ian and the recovery, this out here was rebuilt, and you can see what it looks like now.

I'll tell you, the biggest threat to homeowners right now outside of these storms is just getting homeowners insurance. It is insanely expensive to get coverage.
