The reelection of U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock. CNN projects the Georgia incumbent will defeat his republican challenger. First time political candidate Herschel Walker. Warnock's victory in this runoff election gives Democrats a 51-49 edge in the senate but it is a critical advantage as democrats will now have a majority in all of the senate committees. Here as a part of Senator Warnock's victory speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): I want to say thank you from -- thank you from the bottom of my heart and to God be the glory. After a hard- fought campaign or should I say campaigns? It is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy. The people have spoken. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, there were five states, Kasie, as you know, that decided the 2020 election by shifting from Trump in '16 to Biden in '20. They were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. With Walker's loss tonight, republicans have lost all seven republicans in those states who are nominated for governor or senator with Trump's specific endorsement have now lost. And they've lost in a very consistent way by having the suburban areas move sharply against them. It wasn't just Gwinnett and Cobb, it was Oakland and Michigan, Delaware, and Montgomery and Pennsylvania, Maricopa and Arizona and Dane County in Wisconsin. So, there's a consistent pattern here of these big populous, thriving population centers in the metro areas rejecting the Trump era definition of the party and their increased trends in the rural areas not being quite enough to overcome that.",

That's Donald Trump's politics. If he were going to rural America and say, I'm going to help save rural hospitals.You know, one-third of all the rural hospitals in America are under risk of closing. That's a crisis. There's a crisis on the farm. God knows there's an opioid crisis in every part of America, but it's hitting rural America. If he were going to them with ideas and solutions for their very real problems. That'd be one thing. Instead, he's going with grievance. Look at Mr. Walker running ads, attacking trans kids, of which I think in high school athletics in Georgia, there are two and we know that trans kids have spectacularly higher suicide ideations and self-harm. And that's just -- it has failed politically. But I also think morally it's wrong. It's better to come to voters with something you'll do for them than just I hate the same people you hate.",

The reality is that Warnock, Laura, actually -- I mean, we keep calling it a close race. Yes. Almost every race in a competitive state in American politics right now is close. But this margin was pretty significant for a state that is a swing state at the end of the day.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: It was and it's still is Georgia. And I know we were just talking about all of the shifting demographics in Georgia, but it still just became a swing state in 2020. So, because of that, I think that there are a lot of things that democrats can learn from this election cycle and carry on into 2024. I mean, one thing we haven't talked about yet is abortion. And when I was down there in Georgia, yes, it was the runoff. But a lot of female voters that I was talking to mentioned abortion access and mentioned that issue. And so, I think that that is going to be something that especially as we potentially see in '24, a number of states bring up abortion access ballot measures that democrats could potentially use which they did a number of states this cycle to try to bolster turnout.",

Instead, most incumbents won their elections.The House did not swing very far. I mean, yes, Kevin McCarthy's party is going to be in charge of the House. But it's by, you know, barely, and kind of by the basically the same majority that Nancy Pelosi held, you know, four or five seats, or so. And then you have the senate again, basically evenly split the hand the democrats won seat.

      "sentences": "You know, what I wrote it in mid-October, Kasie, was I thought that it was becoming a double negative election. And I think that produced the environment that gave us that result. On the one hand, you had a majority of voters who were negative on Biden's performance and negative on the state of the economy. In fact, in the exit polls, we saw that worn out and normally that would produce big gains for the party out of power.But that first negative was, I think, curtailed and limited by the second negative, which was that there was a substantial number of voters who viewed the Trump error Republican Party as a threat to their rights and to democracy itself on abortion and other issues. And that they were reluctant to entrust them with power, despite their doubts about the democrats. And, you know, that led to this extraordinary set of results which included democrats narrowly winning independence in the national exit poll, no party holding the White House is one independence and a midterm since at least 1982. And democrats, of course, won them by even bigger margins in the swing states. And the other thing I think it's really important to recognize, though, is that this really was two different elections in the blue and swing states than it was in the red states. Because, you know, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, in states where Colorado, Washington and states where abortion is still legal, there was a clear and unmistakable signal from voters that they wanted it to remain legal. And you saw overwhelming percentages of voters who identified as pro- choice voting for Democrats. On the other hand, in the red states that have actually banned abortion like Florida, and Texas, even Georgia, Iowa, with the sole exception of Arizona, we didn't really see much of a backlash. So, in some ways, what this election did was deepen and widen the chasm between red America and blue America. The challenge for Republicans is that when you look at the Electoral College, the states that lean democratic really leave them I think, with an uphill climb for 2024 unless they can change the dynamic and the suburban communities that we were talking about.",

He came in with low expectations, we gave him the benefit of the doubt. Six years later, he failed to deliver.We now have the benefit of options. There are other Republicans that are going to come forward and stand up to him. It might be a fractured field to begin with, but between these legal challenges, January 6th, the constitutional comments, the diners with anti-Semites, people are saying that, it is time to turn the page.

And as he points out, he was already the presumptive nominee in 2016 before he had reached 50 percent of the vote in any state.What happened in 2016 was that Trump consolidated the half of the party who are non-college Republicans, many of them evangelicals, much more than anyone else consolidated the other half of the party who are college educated Republicans at the point that he had effectively ended the race in 2016. Because he was still winning only about a third of college educated Republicans. So, in that sense, he is not in that position right now where you see in polling only about a third of college educated Republicans say they want him again or say they would support him. The question is whether anyone can consolidate that piece of the party more effectively than (INAUDIBLE) Cruz and Al did in 2016. And I think that that will be the biggest question. One thing I'm trying to puzzle out of my head, I'm not trying to preempt (ph) it, maybe Alice does. If you think about most of the candidates who could get into this race, I think more of them are more oriented towards that college side than the blue-collar side that really helped Trump. You think of Hogan or Youngkin or Pompeo. And so, it might be that the field faces the same problem, not only a lot of candidates, but a lot of candidates fishing primarily in the pool other than the one that Trump is going to be strongest in.",

We already know, and we've seen, we've got so much evidence that we've been talking about all night that shows that he cannot win general elections anymore based on his time in the White House and other issues.But when it comes to winning Republican primaries, they are in this position. And all these other candidates, to Ron's point, would potentially split up the other types of Republican voters. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWHOUR AND CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Right. And as we talk about whether or not Republicans are saying collectively, we don't want to turn a page, one thing that I think is important here is that when reporters were asking Republicans after the meeting with Kanye West and the white supremacists Nick Fuentes, whether or not they would condemn it, a number of Republicans eventually came out and said that they condemned it. But that they still wouldn't say that it was disqualifying or that they weren't going to support Trump. The same thing with the latest truth social tweet from Trump where he says that we should terminate the constitution. Republicans again said, I don't agree with that. That's not OK. We defend the constitution. But then, you go the step further of, OK, are you done with the former president? Are you going to not support him? And they do not take that step. And McConnell, you know, the Senate minority leader, has said before, that he would potentially support Trump if he were the nominee again.

Some regulations with regard to elections were implemented due to COVID in terms of drop boxes and how people vote with COVID. Now, that we have gotten through COVID, some of the election regulations changed.

HUNT:  Yes. No, I mean -- look, I'm glad you made that point.

He knows more about Georgia elections than anybody, even more than the secretary of state. So, when he says that, I believe it. But I guess because he's a minister, it made me think of Genesis 50:20. Man meant it for evil, but Got meant it for good.",

Authorities have announced a sweeping set of new guidelines. They largely scrap the controversial health code system and allow people to quarantine at home. And for more, we want to go to CNN 's Anna Coren who joins us live from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Anna. So, protests clearly played a significant role here, in easing these strict COVID measures. So, what is included in the new guidelines and what will this mean for China's zero COVID policy?",
