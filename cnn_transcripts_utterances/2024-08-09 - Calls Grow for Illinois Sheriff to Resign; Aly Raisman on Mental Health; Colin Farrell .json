It just felt special really amazing and something I'll never forget.I just love the way that Simone is so supportive of Rebeca.

So, it makes me so happy.And I love how, now with social media, it allows so many more athletes to be out there and to be known. And we get so much more access to the athletes.

I talked a little bit about what Simone Biles has gone through, what Noah Lyles has gone through. Talk about -- if you can talk about how healthy a development is to have star athletes like this, people who are in ads, who are role models, who are talking about this openly. It's so different. I'm not going to date myself too much, but I mean, we just didn't talk about this with the superstars of the '80s and the '90s in the 2000s.",

I suppose I may not be alone in saying that most people have never heard of this before. What should they know about it? AMANDA MOORE, CEO, ANGELMAN SYNDROME FOUNDATION AND NINE-YEAR-OLD SON JACKSON HAS ANGELMAN SYNDROME:  Yes, you're definitely not the only one. And obviously, the last couple of days have been quite remarkable for our very little rare disease to be able to get the exposure that we are getting. And to put it simply, Angelman syndrome is a rare neurogenetic disorder that occurs in about one in 15,000 people worldwide. And it's caused by a loss of the function of the UBE3A gene, which is in the 15th chromosomes. So, that's to put it simply.",

You see that that drive and that resilience in their eyes and the things that some of us -- it's so easy for us to, you know, take steps for them. They work really, really hard. And some of our families are still really working hard.So, to have that exposure is unbelievable, especially for what the foundation's really going to be focusing on. It's an issue, not only for those affected by Angelman syndrome, but so many more, you know, there's 7,000 rare diseases in the world, many people struggling with the services, and to have Colin and the foundation to come out as a voice and come along with other organizations working on this is remarkable.",

A lot of times us as families are going to the doctors and we're instructing the doctors on the standards of care of Angelman because it is so rare and so unknown. So, I think really understanding all the rare diseases. There's a lot, and I know that's hard for the health care system, but really being able to go to the doctor and be a mom and not a doctor would be ideal.But when it comes to the work that Colin and their foundation is doing, this is something that our families think about from day one of diagnosis. When Jackson was diagnosed, the fear of long-term care, long-term support, it resonates. And then, the people who are experiencing it now, it's heartbreaking to know, you know, after they transition out of maybe the educational system, there's little to no services left for these individuals. And the long-term opportunities of care are not there. So, it's things that we've been raising awareness and advocating for for years, and we will continue to do so. But to have his voice on such a high platform, we're so hopeful of what that's going to bring for our community, especially our older individuals.",
