President Biden and top White House officials are demanding that Israel take concrete steps to protect civilians or face the consequences of a shift in U.S. policy toward the war.Now, one day later, Israel has unveiled some new action. Two IDF officers have been fired as a result of the Israeli military's preliminary report on the deadly attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy. And Israel is opening two entry points for Gaza aid deliveries. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says of that move that the real test will be the results. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is tracking all of this from Jerusalem. Jeremy, tell us about this initial report from Israel and the steps that are being taken.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, in six months of war, we have never seen the Israeli military carry out such a thorough and public accounting of its actions, of its killing of civilians in the Gaza Strip, as we are now over the killing of these seven aid workers. Six of whom were foreigners in this Israeli military strike earlier this week.The Israeli military in its report today on its findings of its investigation saying that commanders involved in these strikes violated military protocols and made errors in decision making. They lay out a timeline of how this all unfolded, saying that it started when an Israeli drone picked up what they say is a gunman on top of one of these aid trucks that was part of this convoy. Once the convoy alongside three vehicles with these seven staffers arrived at a warehouse, from there the Israeli military commanders began making very wrong and very deadly assumptions, believing that the gunman was actually in one of these vehicles, that rather than humanitarian aid staffers, they believed that Hamas militants were inside these vehicles. That, of course, is despite the fact that the World Central Kitchen logo was plastered on two of these vehicles. The Israeli military saying that its drones did not pick that up at nighttime. They also misidentified a bag that one of these aid workers was carrying, believing that it was a weapon. And so, what happened next, over the course of four minutes, three Israeli drone strikes carried out on these three separate vehicles, killing all seven of these workers. The Israeli military, for its part, has now dismissed two of the officers involved, reprimanded three more. Questions now about how they will take the lessons learned from this and apply them in the future as they say they will. They have yet to actually provide details on any substantive policy changes, Brianna?",

Where are the investigations of the strikes that killed a hundred journalists? Where are the investigations of the sniper fire that has killed children? Where are the investigations of the executions of doctors and patients at Al-Shifa Hospital? Where are the investigations of the torture of prisoners under Israeli custody? Where are the investigations of the destruction of universities? Where are the investigations of the pillaging of private homes? Where are the investigations of the attacks on churches and mosques?

And charities like Anera, the second largest distributor of aid in Gaza, the recently suspended operations, have been very clear that it is impossible to distribute food and medicine appropriately when there is fighting going on, when there is still conflict. So it is not enough to admit humanitarian assistance to Gaza. There needs to be an immediate ceasefire.",

And given that the U.S. continues to approve arms transfers of various types to Israel on an almost daily basis, knowing what is going on, on the ground right now in Gaza, there is no reason that these cannot be stopped or suspended or used as leverage. But of course, there are also laws that apply here.For example, we are not allowed to provide military assistance to a country that is restricting U.S.-funded humanitarian assistance. With Israel's admission that it is going to open these two new crossings, that is essentially an admission that they have been restricting humanitarian assistance. So there is much more that the U.S. could be doing, even if a deal was signed many years ago.",

      "sentences": "Well, before we even talk about conditioning military assistance, we need to talk about following our own laws. Laws like the one I just mentioned, that we can't provide assistance where humanitarian assistance is being restricted, we can't provide assistance to units that are credibly alleged to be involved in gross violations of human rights.Once we have done that, I think there are clearly sets of arms that are being used in Gaza, such as 2,000-pound bombs, which are inherently indiscriminate. These are bombs that destroy entire city blocks. We also know that the IDF is using firearms in ways that are deeply inappropriate to, for example, as The Guardian has reported in the last few days, sniper attacks against children. So there are certainly a whole range of lethal weapon systems that the U.S. could be using both as leverage over Israel and anyway should be restricting, given Israel's use of those weapons in the current conflict.",

It is very much business as usual, and New York City officials have been asking that of the public to go about their day, being that so far, preliminary reports indicate that there were no damage, no - at least no noticeable damages, and also no injuries. So at this point, we're at the assessment stage of this really quite historic incident from earlier this morning when that 4.8 magnitude earthquake was registered.Now, in terms of what the city has also said, they are encouraging people to certainly remain vigilant because of the possibility, albeit very low possibility, of any potential aftershocks. So, so far, we haven't noticed that. In terms of what we're hearing from New Yorkers and tourists alike, some people noticed it this morning. If you're like me, we were on the subway, so I didn't really feel that earlier this morning, but it's certainly something that people are talking about throughout the day now, Brianna, as we get ready to send things back to you. That just gives you a general sense of this event. It really isn't so much a destructive one, but more a potentially disruptive one as they continue their assessment of some of the bridges and roadways in and around New York City.",
