      "sentences": "Many who struggle to pay for their Thanksgiving dinners rely on food banks to get their meals. Now last year, more than 53 million Americans needed food assistance to get by, according to Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks and pantries. And now many of those food banks say that they're seeing even more people coming in for help.Joining us now is Trisha Cunningham, the President of The North Texas Food Bank. Tricia, thank you so much for being with us on this Thanksgiving. Many food banks are reporting that inflation has hit them really hard and of course, more families are needing assistance. What are you seeing?",

We're distributing at levels even higher than the pandemic.During the pandemic, we were probably providing access on average to a little over 10 million meals per month. That is now up to 12.3 million meals per month. Just because people can't make ends meet.",

      "sentences": "This is very different. During the pandemic, what we saw was an immediate shift, immediate job loss. People that were in the gig economy did not have their jobs anymore, and they had to turn to foodbanks because they were making it from week to week. What we're seeing now are many people that were making it not only from week to week, but they were able to make it very comfortably.But if you look at the fact that you see transportation costs and rent, typically makes up about half of a budget. Now it's eating into about 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent of budgets, which leaves less money for food. So there's many more middle class families that are needing assistance that have never even needed it during the pandemic.",

Food insecurity is very complex, but feeding people isn't. As long as we have the resources, we're going to continue to provide those meals on the table. And we have a whole host of food pantries and local communities that are right there ready to serve. As a matter of fact, this year we changed our holiday distributions to be more community based, so it would be easier access for all the many people that now need food assistance.",

      "sentences": "You know, the best thing for us right now is to be able to donate funds. Food banks can typically turn that dollar of resource into multiple meals because we will try to leverage the best that we can in our supply chain to be able to provide the maximum benefit of that dollar of resource. So that's the best.But, obviously, giving food is another thing you can go and do. Go to a food bank website. Ours is ntfp.org, and we have on there a list of the type of items that we need. Every food bank has that across the country where you can see what you could do. Maybe a one item specific drive, maybe for peanut butter, that makes it easier for food banks to bring it in, check it, sort it, get it kitted, and get it out to their feeding network, which we have about 400 partners in our community. Advocating is a great way as well. If you don't have the resources to give money, you can always let your legislators know that they need to be supporting hunger policy. We have many programs available to individual families as well as food banks during the pandemic that are no longer there. And so it's created a bit of a hole in many food banks like us. We're working on a deficit budget right now because we also don't have the donations coming in that we had during the pandemic. So we've got to be able to get to more sustainable method to be able to serve the needs that are heightened in the community. And then finally volunteer, and not just during the holidays. We need volunteers after the holidays as well as we need them during the holidays.",

So this is a challenge to overcome.OPPMANN (voice-over): Guides spearfish to attract the sharks, but are careful to use the minimum bait necessary. They say they've never had an attack involving a climb or guide, and that people who come to dive here gain a new perspective on sharks. It's the myth of the shark being dangerous, a man eater that is aggressive, he says. Then you manage to see a shark a meter and a half away from you. And when you come out of the water, they say, this is the best I've of my life. The sharks we swim with are undeniably powerful and also incredibly beautiful. At the top of the food chain, but never seeming to threaten us. (on-camera): And they said, a shot of adrenaline in your arm. They were not kidding. I wouldn't admit to being afraid, but they were very impressive creatures. (voice-over): Creatures that there are now more and more reasons to try and protect. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Yes, Ronaldo scoring a penalty in Portugal's 3-2 win against Ghana today, making him the first man to score in five different World Cups. He's also now the oldest and youngest goal scorer for Portugal at the World Cup.And what do you know? When he was 21, he started with a penalty. And at the age of 37 today, he got another penalty. There's a lot of drama going on with Ronaldo at the moment. I think he and his team will be glad they've got this first game out the way and it's a win. And hopefully they can go on at least he's hoping and win the World Cup, which is the one trophy that alluded him.",

The Americans beat England back in 1950, which was a huge upset they drew when they played in 2010. You know, these players all know each other. Five of the American players play in the Premier League, so I would expect it to be very competitive. And it is projected to be the most watched game of soccer in U.S. broadcast history.Of course, it's coming on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States. So a huge television audience, a lot of excitement around this game. And who knows what will happen. England started off with a big win against Iran, winning 6-2. The Americans lost a winning position against Wales in their opening game. So the Americans really looking to get something more out of this match.
