But this is someone who's saying on the stand, do I hate the defendant? Yes. Yes, I do.That's remarkable, right? The jury is going to hear that. And that's really going to paint how they hear everything she talked about this morning. Now, really why this is significant is because this is a preview of how they're going to cross Michael Cohen. Stormy Daniels does not make or break the prosecution's case. Michael Cohen will. And if you think that reading a couple of tweets about an orange turd, right, that's a little shocking. I mean, we're going to get hours and hours of that during the Michael Cohen cross.",

And that's where you're going to be with Michael Cohen.And to be clear, we've been talking about how the prosecution is trying to get in front of this particular cross. They've been trying to get in front of everything related to Michael Cohen over the course of the entirety of this trial. I think the only thing that's agreement on at this point is that everybody agrees that Michael Cohen isn't the greatest guy in the world and probably doesn't have a great reputation. That's been by design. I think what's fascinating here is you understand and it's been clear throughout as they've gone back and forth in defense of the prosecution, they got an audience of 12. Right. And it's not -- it doesn't matter necessarily what this means for the specific allegations or for what Stormy Daniels testified this morning. It matters how jurors perceive this as they walk out once this is all over with. And I'll also be fascinated to see if the prosecution comes back after this. They have to have the facts.

But they're also trying to argue that she has some sort of motivation to get him convicted because she wants to see him behind bars. They're going to have to go to that.The fact that she hasn't paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars that a court has ordered her to pay. Well, that's just a fact. There's only so much you can do there. But we we've just gotten started with cross. So they're absolutely going to have to likely do redirect to try to rehabilitate some of the things that are coming out of her mouth. Her demeanor also not great. She's combative. She's almost yelling for different than what we saw this morning with prosecutors who she knows and she's more comfortable with.",

As we're watching what is happening here, some very contentious moments, Sarah, with Stormy Daniels facing cross-examination. I wonder what you think, especially as a former communications official in the White House, where always top of mind, I think, was how the president was feeling about what was being said about him.

Look in other witness testimonies, he has been kind of falling asleep or as he put it recently, just closing his beautiful blue eyes and taking it in. But he hasn't been as engaged.But with this testimony in particular, he has been much more engaged and infuriated by it. And I think that that's very clear. And the jury is probably taking notice of that as well. Look, I believe it was reported that Trump even kind of hit his one attorney at one time to get her attention, to try to get her to object to something. And so Donald Trump is definitely not happy about how today's testimony went. A lot of those, you know, personal details that came out during Stormy Daniels' testimony and the salacious nature of it all, I think that that goes both ways. And maybe the jury is seeing that clearly they have some sort of history and that he's upset by her sharing these things. Or it could go the way to that as the defense is arguing that he's upset because of his wife and how he wanted to hide this affair from her or, you know, as Donald Trump claims, it didn't happen. But I think that he doesn't like not being in control. And so being in this courtroom today for this testimony has been extremely difficult for him.

Daniels responded, and I'm quoting her now -- I've been making money by telling my story about what happened to me. Necheles, the attorney, then asked: That story has made you a lot of money, right?

Who's to say what else will come up in the minutes or hours to come?Number one, her personal finances and credibility in terms of how she's spoken about her finances. One of the things that came up a moment ago was, Did you or did you not tweet that you had enough money from your film career to buy a ranch? And there was a back and forth over whether she did or didn't. And then she ultimately said, Well, I rent a ranch now. But it's an inconsistent statement about sort of her financial situation at the time. Also, they're returning repeatedly to this question of personal bias against the defendant. And this has -- it's been a thread throughout the cross-examination. Did you call him names in social media or elsewhere? And moreover, this final point that they've hit. Her statement that she would, you know, go to jail before paying Trump any money. That speaks to two things. Number one, she's willing to flout a legal obligation, which is a credibility question. But also, too, bias against the defendant. Now, again, all this is to be said, it's all about how the jury regards it. And they may have trusted the testimony before. Because she made the core point that she did have sexual relations with that man, Donald Trump. Which is sort of the core legal point that's being made here. But all of these separate points are hurting her credibility. And we'll see what the jury does.",

About her chuckling.Like, that would just land differently in front of a jury if a male questioner was the one doing it than a female one.

I'm back now with Phil and Paula and some themes sort of coming out of these questions. REIDNow, the first is this is a theme that the Trump folks have tried to push. And moments ago, Susan Necheles, she argued that, look, Stormy Daniels has been making money off of having had sex with Trump for over a decade. But Stormy Daniels argues that no, now she owes Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. She's at risk of losing her house. And she tells folks in her documentary that it's hard for her to find work. So that has been a theme throughout this trial. Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, and whether they are benefiting off of what they have said vis-a-vis the defendant. This other idea is whether she's being honest. And here Susan Necheles appeared to catch her in a lie when she asked if she told Gloria Allred that she had had sex with Trump. Stormy Daniels said that she did tell Gloria Allred that. And then Susan Necheles brought up Stormy Daniels' book, read from it, and appeared that that wasn't true. So they sort of impeached the witness right there on the stand, really undercut her credibility. And, again, this is contentious. Stormy Daniels is upset. She's at times cocking her head, firing back at the defense attorneys. This is not going well for Stormy Daniels. But I'd say it's pretty much what we expected.",

Now, right now, Daniels says that she was asked what I thought about all this stuff, and I thought that it was BS. She paused before softly using the expletive. Now, right now, Susan Necheles is trying to get Daniels to talk about when she told E! Online that all of this was, again, BS. And they're trying to go through her contradictory statements where in the past she had denied this affair. Now, she will say that she did that because either in one case she was intimidated, she thought there would be retaliation from Cohen if she did not.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:58:58] BLITZER: Welcome back to our special coverage of former President Trump's Hush Money criminal trial. Today, the woman at the center of this historic case, the adult film star Stormy Daniels, has been on the witness stand for several hours. She recounted in vivid detail her alleged sexual encounter with Trump back in 2006. So much detail that the Trump defense team called for a mistrial. Judge Merchan rejected the request but did acknowledge that some of the prosecution's questions were unnecessary. Right now, Daniels is facing searing cross-examination questions from Trump's defense team. At one point, she was asked -- and I'm quoting now -- Am I correct that you hate President Trump? Daniels responded, quote, Yes. Trump's lawyer followed up by asking: And you want him to go to jail? Daniels responded -- and I'm quoting -- I want him to be held accountable. It's been a very dramatic day of testimony. I'll be back in two hours, 6 p.m. Eastern, in \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\" CNN's special coverage of this trial continues right now on \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper.",
