He says then an order was presented to the minister of defense who signed it and he was relieved of his post. He is essentially then accusing them of this being a sort of treasonous act of essentially sabotaging themselves by removing him at such a critical moment in this war.But it's extraordinary because we have not heard this level of dissent from such a high ranking official in the Russian army. And it comes in the same week where we saw another top commander in the Russian forces in that region, in Zaporizhzhia, killed -- according to Ukrainian sources -- in Berdyansk, where the headquarters of the 58th army is. So this is two generals on that southern front in a week.",

And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.President Biden is in Helsinki where he will soon arrive at the presidential palace to meet with Nordic leaders and officially welcome Finland into NATO. It's a symbolic visit and a message to Russia on the heels of the NATO summit. And the Screen Actors Guild has voted to recommend a strike after talks with major studios and streaming services failed. Some 160,000 actors are expected to hit the picket lines joining writers in Hollywood asking for better pay and benefits. U.S. stocks soared on Wednesday after new inflation data gave investors hope that there could soon be an end to interest rate hikes. June's Consumer Price Index showed annual inflation in the U.S. slowed with the figure marking a sharp cooldown from the same time last year. CNN's Matt Egan has details from New York for you.

      "sentences": "Bianca, Inflation continues to chill out in a big way in the United States. And that is great news. It's great for consumers, for central bankers, and also for the White House trying desperately to boost the president's poll numbers. And what a difference a year makes. At this point last summer, Americans were getting crushed by 9.1 percent inflation, the worst in more than four decades. Today that metric now stands at just 3 percent. The smallest annual increase in prices in more than two years.Now yes, that is still a bit too hot. It is above what economists consider healthy, but it's also a massive improvement. We've now had a full year of cooling inflation. And one of the biggest drivers lately is gas prices. If you recall last June gas prices, they hit record highs in the United States. The national average surged past $5 a gallon. But this June inflation report shows that gas prices have actually now plunged by almost 27 percent from a year ago. Of course none of this means that inflation is totally cured. We've seen rental and housing costs still go up rapidly. So are prices at restaurants and to a lesser extent grocery stores. But still there has been real progress here no doubt. And the White House took a victory lap with President Biden responding to the June inflation report by saying, quote, that's Bidenomics in action. The best part of this inflation cooldown is that so far at least, it has come without the long-feared collapse in the jobs market. The Federal Reserve has spiked interest rates to put this inflation fire out and yet unemployment remains surprisingly low and hiring remains very strong. This latest inflation report likely will not deter the Fed from raising interest rates later this month. But the latest data, it could give the Fed room to wrap up its inflation fight before long -- Bianca. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well today we learned police confirming that they are interviewing possible accomplices to this escape.The second thing that we learned on Wednesday is, I asked police if they had any confirmed sightings of Burham so far into this investigation, and police said of a number of reported sightings we believe that many are indeed accurate. And that's why police say they still believe that Burham is in the larger northwest Pennsylvania area. And then the third thing that police said on Wednesday, was that they believe a drone may have been present during the time of the escape last Thursday. Take a listen to what one of the lieutenant colonels said specifically about the new piece of evidence. LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: I'm not a big believer in coincidences, but what I would tell you is that just prior to the escape, there was a drone flying in that area. It could be that there is a perfectly innocent and reasonable explanation. It could also be that it was somehow connected to his escape. And we intend to find out more about that.",

Saying that they've discovered a mass grave of around 87 people in the Darfur region and they believe that these people were killed by the Rapid Support Forces militia according to information that the U.N. has received. And that they were buried in a mass grave.Now the context to this is absolutely horrifying. Because you'll remember, Bianca, that 20 years ago Darfur went through a genocide that killed around 300,000 people and displaced millions. And history seems to be repeating itself with the same militia group at the time, was Janjaweed militia that evolved now into the Rapid Support Force, which is led by one of the generals leading this deadly conflict in Sudan. So the world seems to be watching powerlessly as this situation repeats itself. And the Masalit tribe, which is one of the main non- Arab communities in Darfur have been targeted once again in this deadly conflict. Now as you say, Egypt is holding a summit on Sudan this morning in Cairo with some of the neighbors including Chad, Ethiopia, Central African Republic, Libya. These countries are severely affected. Many Sudanese have flooded into these countries. Chad in particular is at breaking point, one of the poorest countries in the world having to receive thousands, hundreds of thousands of people into their country. And they are at breaking point.
