      "sentences": "First, the explosions behind me that you're seeing lighting up Russian-occupied -- the Russian-occupied area of Donetsk overnight, Ukraine's army reportedly unleashing heavy shelling to reclaim their land.This is happening as President Zelenskyy is now raising the alarm for a potential nuclear disaster. He says Russia has now placed objects that resemble explosives on two reactors in Zaporizhzhia. Plus, did Chinese President Xi warn Putin against using nuclear weapons when the pair had a friendly face to face meeting in March? There are reports that he, in fact, did. The Kremlin, though, denying that. CNN's Scott McLean is in London following all of the major developments. Let's start with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. It is the largest in Europe. What are you learning about what Zelenskyy is saying and how Russia is responding now?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Sara, look, both times are essentially accusing themselves of trying to set up some kind of a false flag operation and sabotage operation. The Russians say that they are no threat at all to this power plant. In fact, they say that it's the Ukrainians who pose the threat. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said earlier today, quote, there is a great threat of sabotage by Kyiv, which can have catastrophic consequences.The Kremlin has also previously pointed out that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency are on site. And it was actually last week that the director general, Rafael Grossi, put out this statement saying, in part, I instructed our experts at the site to look into this matter and request the access they need for doing their job. Until now, they have not observed any mines or other explosives, but he stresses this part, further access will still be needed. Now, President Zelenskyy also hasn't come up with any evidence, or at least publicly shared any evidence that there are, in fact, explosives sitting on top of this nuclear power plant, as you said, the largest in Europe. But he is repeating something that his military has said earlier, and that is that they believe that any explosion here would make it look like this was Ukrainian shelling, but wouldn't be powerful enough to actually cause any consequential damage to the actual power plant itself. But this, of course, is risky business when we're talking about nuclear power. The Ukrainians say that they're doing drills to prepare with their emergency services. The Russians say that they're ready as well. All of this is sort of this giant buildup, the safety mechanisms that are in place at the site. And we have this satellite image that kind of illustrates this. At the top there, you see those reactors in a row. They're actually built to withstand, at least in theory, the impact of an accidental plane crashing into them. How they would react to weapons of war, though, we don't have a clear answer on that, though. And also keep in mind that at the bottom of your screen there, those dark triangles or those dark rectangles, those are cooling ponds used to store spent fuel rods, and they have no protection at all. And so, again, not a lot of margin for error here. One other thing to mention, Sara, and that is that President Zelenskyy's logic here in accusing Russia of this potential sabotage or false flag operation is that because there was no widespread global response to the collapse of the Kakhovka Dam in Southern Ukraine, he believes that that will only embolden Russia. Though, to be clear, there is no clear evidence as to who or what was behind that dam collapse at this point. Sara?",

That is worth pointing out, especially since that that is a city that has been under Russian occupation since 2014, and it is now seeing this increasing intensity of Ukrainian strikes.Obviously, the Russians have had their own strikes into Ukrainian territory. One village that was or one town, I should say, that was hit yesterday was hit while there was a funeral service for a fallen Russian soldier. As a result, more than 40 people were injured, including two babies under the age of one. Broadly speaking, Sara, the Ukrainians say that they are having some success around Bakhmut, that very highly contested city, but elsewhere, they say that it is, frankly, a pretty tough slog to actually move the frontline forward.",

We know from our intelligence reports that Kremlin was conducting all those surveys. 18 or 19 regions of Russia firmly supported Prigozhin's actions, 21 regions of Russia firmly supporting Putin. Some of the Russian regions were in the balancing. In the meantime, without knowing for sure who to support. We all see this process that shows half of the Russian population is in serious doubt.

He had his arms crossed and just said mostly one word answers when the magistrate judge and his appointed public defender addressed him in the courtroom today.Now, as you said, the judge read out a number of charges, including murder, violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, and other firearms offenses as well, including owning a firearm without a license, and then attempted murder as well. And when it got to that point about setting bail, the magistrate judge said that public safety in this instance is clearly an issue here, and there is no set of conditions in which the defendant in this case would not be considered a flight risk. So, bail was set, of course -- set with no bail. He is being held without the possibility of bail at this particular moment. And, Kate, this all stems back to that July 3rd shooting that happened 8:30 at night, five people ultimately killed. The district attorney, Larry Krasner, he actually spoke with CNN This Morning.

The only permanent solution is for police and community to work together, for legislatures to really do something to try to get a handle on these guns that are on the street, particularly assault weapons. So, it's going to really -- it's not easy. It's complicated, but we can fix this if we all sit down and come up with reasonable solutions, some solutions short-term, some long-term. But we need to have the conversation and put in place those things that are going to have an impact. We can't keep doing this every single day.

DeSantis, I thought he would be doing better by now, and it's apparent that he's having really hard time translating Florida into the country at large. He's wildly popular in Florida, and it is one of our three biggest states, but nonetheless, it's not translating very well. He's been a bit of a bit of stumbles. One has a sense he hasn't quite found his footing or his voice. But he has six months before the primaries.
