But with the world's gaze fixed on Gaza, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas warns that we shouldn't turn a blind eye to the threat from Russia. And conflict and politics collide in America. \"The New Yorker\" Susan Glasser explains how the Israel Hamas war is fueling tensions going into the 2024 elections. Plus, navigating college while under the poverty line. Michel Martin speaks to bestselling author Stephanie Land. And finally, remembering the man behind some of the world's most beloved books, Christiane's conversation with veteran publisher, Stephen Rubin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in D.C. sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. The families of the estimated 237 hostages believed to be held captive by Hamas are demanding answers about where their loved ones are and when they will see them again. Today, they continue their march towards Jerusalem after setting off from Tel Aviv four days ago. And in New York, the face of one hostage, nine-year-old Emily Hand, lit up Times Square on her ninth birthday. Her father told CNN that he just wants his daughter back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They've been named as 65-year- old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old Noa Marciano. Israel is doubling down on its claim that the medical center sat above a Hamas command center. The IDF released this image, which it says shows a tunnel shaft that's part of that network. CNN has not been able to verify that on our own, although we geolocated this to the hospital complex. Hamas denies operating out of Al-Shifa. Well, whilst the eyes of the world are trained on Gaza, there's fear among Ukraine and its allies that its fight against Russia is slipping down the global agenda. Watching all of this closely is Estonia, on the front lines of Russian aggression. Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, dubbed the Iron Lady of Europe, met U.S. House Speaker Johnson in Washington this week. Upon her return, she spoke to Christiane from the Estonian capital of Tallinn. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And there, you know, Russia was ashamed that it's Russian soldiers because they were afraid of the western response. But as the response was weak, then the next time, it's already bolder. It's like, yes, we're going to attack a neighboring southern country and we don't even hide it. So, I would guess on the basis of this pattern, then the next step will be even more bolder than that. And yes, it might be also you know, testing the NATO in some way. In NATO, we have the Article 5 that says that attack on one means attack on all, and that means we all have a skin in the game.",

So, we have to keep in mind what is of interest to a dictator, keeping the cronies around him happy, that means the oligarchs, and keeping the power structures, the army happy because they keep in human in power and make the deeds that he wants them to make. So, I think in terms of those two elements, there are oligarchs who are not happy because we are sanctioning their property and already talking about using that property for the benefit of reparations in Ukraine.

All of this is playing out as the prospect of a dark, divisive 2024 presidential campaign becomes even clearer. Just over a week ago, chilling Veterans Day promised from Trump to root out communists, Marxists, fascists, and radical left thugs that live like vermin. It's a quote. We've also had, this week, allegations of a physical altercation inside of Congress. A week ago -- a week away from the big U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving, what to make of this moment as war, politics, and dangerous rhetoric collide? Here to discuss is Susan Glasser, staff writer with \"The New Yorker.\" Susan, it is great to see you. So, let's start at the bottom. And that is the very childish behavior that we have seen from several members of Congress. Congressman Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, accusing former Speaker McCarthy of intentionally elbowing him in the kidneys. McCarthy replied, if I really wanted to hurt you, you would feel it. We also had a potential fight, that was defused by Senator Sanders between a Republican senator and the head of the Teamsters Union. I mean, a lot of this transpiring, as I've described with the backdrop in the intro to you. You've been covering Washington and politics for a long time. With so much on the line now in the U.S. and around the world, what do you make of this rather childish, immature and very inappropriate behavior we've seen?",

But what was missing, notably missing from this stopgap spending bill, which the president incidentally signed this week, was something that was really important, a top priority for this administration and for Democrats and for many Republicans, and that is funding for aid to Israel, Ukraine, and then Taiwan and even border funding. This is something the president had been hoping to accomplish before the end of the year. What do you make of the predicament this administration finds itself in in getting that aid in time?

President Biden's major foreign policy priorities at this point are all wrapped up and their fateis linked to Congress, which, as we've just seen, is just a hotbed of dysfunction right now. Biden has asked Congress to send him $105 billion supplemental bill that would pay for some of these foreign policy priorities as well as the border. The vast majority of that money in that bill, $60 billion out of the $105 billion, would be for Ukraine. There's a real urgency to that. In fact, there was a Pentagon spokesperson who quoted this week is saying they were down to their last billion of previously authorized funds. Joe Biden has said to the Ukrainian people, the United States will be there as long as it takes. He's repeated that quote over and over again, as long as it takes. And yet, honestly, we can't guarantee that we'll be there past next week in a meaningful sense. And so, the U.S. has made this extraordinary commitment. This is, by some measures, the largest such military assistance the U.S. has given since the end of World War II and the Marshall Plan. This is an incredible foreign policy priority to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, and yet, its fate is completely up in the air. There's still a bipartisan majority, I should say, it appears, in both the House and the Senate to get this money. The problem is the leadership in the House and the growing momentum behind the kind of what you might call the pro-Trump, anti-Ukraine forces in the House. Getting that to a vote on the floor, nobody sees the pathway to that at the moment.",

And you speak to any expert, yourself included, this is what the Russians and Vladimir Putin are banking on. They are hoping to see another Trump presidency because they think that would really impact the direction this war takes. That's just one of the issues that the president -- the former president has said that he will implement if he is re-elected. Let's talk about some of the other plans that he has been transparent about if he wins, and they include rounding up migrants, placing them in massive detention, purging tens of thousands of government workers and replacing them with his loyalists. And then, of course, using the Justice Department to harass political opponents. And we'll get to his language that he's used in just a minute. But just on the policies themselves, what do you make of the fact that he's being, again, transparent about what he plans to do, yet we're not seeing much pushback from Republicans, even though he's running for the nomination against him, and we're not seeing much impact in the polls right now.",

You said that, all government assistance programs operated on the assumption that every person who walked into their office brought with them the possibility of scamming them in some way. We were asked detailed questions about our assets, what kind of car we drove, or if we had a burial plot, not because the government cared, but to determine if there was money hidden that we didn't disclose, it was ridiculous to imagine that anyone would try to pull a fast one by spending hours at a government assistance office in the middle of the work day so they could possibly leave for the couple hundred bucks a month for food. But this was how I spent hours and sometimes entire work days of my life, convincing authorities that I wasn't a criminal. These invasions of privacy caused me to fidget and squirm, but I submitted to them like everything else, because it was another means to an end.

And there's two reasons for that, I think is, you know, the states receive block grants and if those grants aren't used, then they can use them for other things. And the less people who sign up, then the more progress is being made and things are better and, you know, see, we don't even need these programs. And there's always the welfare to work thing. You know, you mentioned Bill Clinton and welfare reform and that has been the assumption since the beginning of welfare programs, it seems is the people who are on government assistance programs are choosing not to work and that is hardly ever the case.

And all 15 of them, male, females, old, young, editorial, sales, everything, every single one of them fell in love with it. So, we knew -- in my mind, that's a microcosm of the world out there, and we knew we had something special. Then we met him. And, oh my, God. He was so charming.
