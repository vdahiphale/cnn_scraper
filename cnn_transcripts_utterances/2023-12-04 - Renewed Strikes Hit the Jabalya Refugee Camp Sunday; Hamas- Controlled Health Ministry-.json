Driven by artificial intelligence, incorporating geospatial intelligence, and bringing together a whole technical suite, here's what this lets us do. It means if you're a business and you want to ensure that your supply chain is carbon neutral, you now have an independent verification system that uses A.I. to let you understand your carbon footprint. If you're a government that wants to make sure you're hitting your targets, you now have an ability to go and make that the case.

The more fundamental problem is this, Paula. We're not entirely surethat the private sector standing by itself is going to be able to deliver the kind of solutions at the scale we need in order to address the climate challenge that we have in front of us. It means that we have to move A.I. capacity out of these private companies and move them into communities at the front lines. One of the incredible conversations we had at COP was to bring in indigenous leaders who are looking at how they address illegal poaching or illegal logging, and using A.I.-based tools that will let them actually go out and be be more effective in that work. But to do that, we need to upscale. We need to move A.I. capacity out of private companies and into the public sector.

If we are able to move away from some of the tabloid headlines I know we've all seen about A.I. and Silicon Valley companies and focus on real meaningful tangible outcomes, there's a different story ahead. We've recently been working with the United Nations on a project called VISA (ph) that incorporates all kinds of data sources, from telecom to geospatial, and lets us do geospatial knowledge about how we do disaster resilience at scale. And what I'll tell you, Paula, is for the communities that are facing the worst possible outcomes of climate, these kinds of A.I. tools are going to deliver impacts not over a decade, but over the next year. And when we see projects like Visa (ph) taking shape, that gives me a lot of hope. You know, it's a time when we have to, and a moment of global stock-take, acknowledge that we're not as far ahead as we need to be on climate response. But these tools could accelerate.
