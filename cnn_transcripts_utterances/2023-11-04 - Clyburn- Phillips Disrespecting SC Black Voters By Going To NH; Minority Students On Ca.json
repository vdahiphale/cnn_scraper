      "sentences": "First of all, Arab American frustration with President Biden is a major political problem. Some leaders say that if he refuses to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, they are willing to campaign against him. And that could hand the Oval Office back to the man who proposed the Muslim ban, Donald Trump. Today, can the President maintain his support for Israel and keep his 2020 coalition together or is this a moment of political reckoning? Plus, Congressman Dean Phillips pins his presidential hopes on New Hampshire and immediately runs into trouble in South Carolina. One Democratic leader even accused him of disrespecting voters, that Democrat Congressman, Jim Clyburn, will join us.And when your college kids are coming home from break eaten up all your food in a couple of weeks, take a second to check in on their mental health because a new study says that students in the minority on campus are more likely to suffer depression. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. We begin with Israel's war with Hamas and the outrage in response to its bombing campaign in Gaza. This morning, the Israeli military admits that it struck an ambulance just outside the hospital. At least 15 people were killed according to the Hamas Foreign Health Authority. Now it denies IDF claims that the ambulance was being used by Hamas. They say the ambulance was part of a medical convoy. Egyptian sources say that more than 700 foreign nationals are expected to evacuate southern Gaza today. Now among that group, nearly 400 Americans like this 11 year old. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not clear how many Gaza residents have access to the internet to see it. The Israeli military has repeatedly called on civilians to evacuate as they intensify assaults on densely populated areas in Gaza City and in northern Gaza.Well, now here at home, the first national poll of Arab Americans since the Hamas attack shows a massive rejection of President Biden and his handling of the war. Just 17 percent of Arab Americans now say they'd vote for Biden in 2024. That's down from 59 percent in 2020. A quick math for you, a staggering 42 point drop according to the poll by the Arab American institute. Now, if Arab American turnout reflects those numbers next year, that could jeopardize Biden's reelection because and we know this. Arab Americans live in all 50 states, but more than two thirds are in just 10 including the swing states of Pennsylvania and Michigan, two states crucial to Biden's 2020 win. Now, Biden won Michigan by about 155,000 votes, just shy of three percentage points. A poll out just days before the Hamas attack showed Trump within one percentage point of Biden. The largest concentration of Arab American communities in the country is just outside of Detroit. Let's go to Pennsylvania. You know, the -- the President's been there over and over. Pennsylvania was so close on election night that it was called three days after for Biden, after those votes were cast. 82,000 votes separated Trump and Biden in Pennsylvania in 2020, out of more than 6.8 million votes cast. And two polls released just before the attack showed Trump ahead in Pennsylvania. Can prize -- President Biden maintain his support for Israel and convince dejected Muslims and Arab Americans that he is worth supporting in 2024? Let's get perspective now from Edward Ahmed Mitchell. He's the National Deputy Director of the Council of American Islamic Relations. Good to have you in studio.

I'd be surprised by that given how hostile some Republican leaders are to Muslims. I think you might see the independent vote rising in 2024.But again, the next few weeks are critical. It all depends, I think, on how this plays out, you know, in Gaza because we cannot.

But I wonder, would there be as passionate a conversation that you're looking for without these protests? I mean, we look at 2020; the -- the protest across the country about race and policing created many conversations.

So I feel maybe the solution forward is professors have to reclaim the narrative. That's the best that we can do and on a very local level, class by class syllabus by syllabus. We have to be able to present our students with these complex, unpleasant, dense arguments, which is what we are trained to do and I'm with you on that.

Jury deliberations will resume on Monday in the trial. Now McClain was walking home from a convenience store when police responded to a call about a suspicious person. In body cam footage, police wrestled McLean to the ground, put him in a chokehold, and then paramedics injected him with a powerful sedative. Officer Nathan Woodyard was -- is charged rather with reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.This is the third of five trials related to McClain's death. One officer was convicted of negligent homicide while another was acquitted of all charges. The City of Fort Worth could settle a lawsuit brought by the family of Atatiana Jefferson. Police officers conducted a welfare check, shot Jefferson through the back window of her home, and her nephew who was eight at the time watched his aunt died. The city says that a $3.5 million settlement would be placed in a trust for the boy. But a lawsuit filed by Jefferson's estate will continue. Former Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean was convicted in Jefferson's death and sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. President Biden again called for gun reform while visiting the grieving community of Lewiston, Maine. Now the president the First Lady, they left flowers at a memorial to 18 people who were killed in a bowling alley at a restaurant there. The President called on members of the Lewiston community to embrace the survivors of the shooting spree. And he also said that he still has hopes that Congress can pass comprehensive gun legislation. No state has a larger share of black voters than Mississippi; more than 36 percent are black. And next week, Democrats are hoping their votes can help elect a Democratic governor for the first time there in more than two decades. Republican Tate Reeves is the Governor right now. The Democrat, Brandon Presley, is running against Reeves. Now the latest reliable poll conducted back in August had Reeves up by 11 points. But there's one big change that could help the Presley campaign. This year for the first time thanks to voters, a candidate must win with the majority of the popular vote or else face a runoff. Now up until 2020, the way Mississippi elected statewide officials dated back to a Jim Crow era system. Candidates need to win a -- a majority of the popular vote and a majority of the State House districts, kind of like the electoral college. Well, a lawsuit filed in 2019 argued that, \"The architects of this system for electing candidates to statewide office had one goal in mind: Entrench white control of state government by ensuring that the newly enfranchised African-American citizens who at the time constituted a majority of the state's population and some of whom had been elected to statewide offices would never have an equal opportunity to translate their numerical strength into political power.\" Well now the calculation by Democrats and the Presley campaign is that this renewed political power for black Mississippians levels the field in their favor. Presley has been pitching himself with a message aimed at black voters. He's campaigning on black radio stations and historically black colleges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've been talking a bit about this during the break, because I find it fascinating that there is not just the feelings of depression and anxiety between black and Hispanic and Asian students at predominantly white schools, but white students at HBCUs. Explain that. JANANI THAPA, ASSOC. PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA'S COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Absolutely. Victor, thank you. So we when we did this study, and the study was done in 2021, during COVID, we were collecting data from all student. We reached out to about 45,000 students from a predominantly white university and historically black university. But how we looked at the data is so let's look at students that are minority context specific. So as you said, a black student in a white university would be minority, but a white student in a historically black university would be a minority, and we do find higher odds of anxiety among white students in a historically black university. So yes.",

And especially during COVID, one of the reasons why we saw majority of our students of our all of our survey participants had some form of depression and anxiety and I think most of what we saw during our study was we were doing our study during COVID.So they were in social isolation, not hanging out with their, you know, friends as they were talking about their day to day activities, assignments, requirements. So that must have mattered and research backs up their social support and the academic achievement pressure does matter. And one thing that we also found in our study is first generation student for example also report higher rates of depression. So the college campus and adjusting to the new life of college campus is a fact and when students are coming in new to the college without having a family member who has gone through the college and talking about college life, but not having that at home does matter. So, what -- how can we support students we are there in college campuses as faculty, staff and administrators and that is our priority, but at home to also talk to your child about how call is life is how they are adjusting, how -- who are they hanging up with the feeling of belonging --",

I'm trying to fill in the picture. And that means diversifying the voices and broadening the perspectives. So when you come here, you should expect new faces. You should expect an angle that you've not considered when you watch this show. And also stories that you have not heard other places, I want to take you some places that maybe you've never heard of. Often the stories in the places impact and are places of people of color. And you know, I'm going to try some new things, some new approaches, and I hope you liked them. Here's one.
