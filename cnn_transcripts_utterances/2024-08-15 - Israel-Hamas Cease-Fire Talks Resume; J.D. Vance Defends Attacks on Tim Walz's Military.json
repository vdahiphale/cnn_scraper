All right, Nic, stand by. Jomana Karadsheh is covering all of this for us. Jomana, the United Nations commissioner for human rights announced today the death toll in Gaza has now passed 40,000 people. The majority, he says, are civilians, including, of course, women and children. Do these talks right now that are about to take place where you are in Doha, Qatar, spark any hope within Gaza?

And the only path out of all of this is this agreement. And at this point, expectations are low, but as these talks have gotten under way, we have gotten this announcement coming from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, what is being described by the U.N. as the horrific and grim milestone, more than 40,000 people have been killed over the past 10 months of war. And while we can't verify these numbers, we have all seen that constant stream of images coming out of Gaza day in and day out over the past 10 months that show you that it is the civilians there who continue to bear the brunt of this war. Israel says that this is a war against Hamas, it is doing what it can to avoid civilian casualties, and it is Hamas that embeds itself within the civilian population. But the question that everyone keeps asking, where do these civilians go when they are trapped in there and they have nowhere safe to go to? Even designated safe zones have not been spared the bombings in Gaza. And you look at those figures, Wolf, the majority of those killed in this war have been women and children, nearly 17,000 children. And when I speak to people inside Gaza and you ask them if they have hope when it comes to these talks, people tell you they no longer dare to hope, because they have been here before, and every time they have seen these hopes crushed. The level of hopelessness and desperation that you hear in people's voices there, I -- it's very hard to even begin to describe the number of people, Wolf, who have told me they wish they would die so they don't have to live through this anymore.",

Vance is hitting at Tim Walz, but is serving at the behest and is serving as the vice presidential nominee to Donald Trump, who made up a bone spur story to avoid the Vietnam draft, a man who has said in interviews after that that his personal Vietnam was avoiding sexually transmitted diseases while he was being a playboy in New York and others were risking their lives. So I don't understand how you can open the door to that when you are on the ticket with Donald Trump. I mean, it's just insane.

And, clearly, with what we have seen in the past few days, Trump is not comfortable with the people who are telling him to focus and be disciplined and all those things that candidates or normal candidates should do. So we're going to have a little bit of a fight in the Trump camp. And that's the let's be smart and focused and disciplined camp against the let Donald be Donald camp.

So I think the incursion shows that Russia is not as strong, not as fearsome as some in the West have seen it, and it's time to crank up the military pressure. Using these long-range systems would do that. Go after the airfields, go after the production facilities for these glide bombs, and take the heat off Ukraine, put it on Putin, and that's the shortest, best path to resolving this conflict successfully.",

So they don't have the A-10s and the F-16s forward. They have drones, and they're using the drones for reconnaissance and to engage enemy forces.
