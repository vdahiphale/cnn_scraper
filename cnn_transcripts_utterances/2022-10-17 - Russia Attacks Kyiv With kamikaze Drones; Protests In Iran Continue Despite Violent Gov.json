There's been a massive increase of migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico.

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR: In Panama, they're the target of an air and land military operation. In Colombia, the country's Coast Guard is trying to intercept them in the ocean. And in Guatemala, national police in riot gear tried to stop them, but they lacked the numbers to do so. From South America to the United States trying to stop yet another wave of migrants seems to be a losing battle for all the countries involved. It seems like more than ever, migrants are willing to face any risk and pay ever increasing amounts of money to reach the United States. In Panama the number of migrants who continue crossing the perilous Darien jungle is increasing. By the end of September, over 134,000 migrants had crossed the Colombian border into Panama, already surpassing last year's total of 133,000. This Marine Corps captain in Colombia says that smugglers used to charge $1,000 per person to cross from the Colombian San Andres and Providencia islands to Central American countries like Nicaragua, and the mount that he says has now increased to 4,000. The influx of migrants is not only increasing, the nationalities of those seeking to reach the United States have also changed in the last few years. This Guatemalan immigration official says they routinely detain migrants from countries as close as Cuba and Haiti and as far as Senegal, but these days most seem to be Venezuelan nationals. This man in Caracas who chose not to reveal his identity because he works for the government of Venezuela, says he's desperate to leave his country. He says his government job pays about $5 a week, which forces him to hold two other jobs to make ends meet. He says he's decided to leave.

For example, people noticed how Xi Jinping paused several times during the speech to clear his throat, sipping water. That got noticed, drawing attention to the issue of his stamina, which, of course, is important given the extraordinary amount of power concentrated in his hands, and the growing list of major decisions he has to make, making his job increasingly physically demanding.

He talked about fighting COVID, fighting corruption, fighting separatists in Hong Kong and Taiwan and without naming the U.S. fighting unilateralism and hegemony. Really indicating he's unlikely to back down from any of his hardline policies and positions, including on the increasingly unpopular zero COVID policy.

About 200,000 homes are either damaged or destroyed and 1.3 million people are displaced.Authorities say this year's rainy season has been heavier than usual. But the federal government also says many state governments were ill prepared. They're being urged to move people to higher ground if needed, and to have more tents relief supplies ready. We're keeping a close eye on Typhoon Nesat which is moving on from the Philippines in the South China Sea. Right now, top sustained winds are around 140 kilometers an hour, about as strong as a category one hurricane. It could strengthen further in the next 24 hours before approaching southern China and Vietnam later this week. All right. Let's take you to meteorologist Pedram Javaheri for more on this.

I would say this time tomorrow, but fortunately, that is over open waters. Notice what happens once you get into say Tuesday into Wednesday. Wednesday into Thursday and beyond that into Friday. Quite a bit of dry air expected to move into the storm system. And also areas of the island of Hainan (ph) right here across the southern southwestern areas, the topography this the landscape takes the mountainous up to 1,800 meters high. That'll help hinder the system as well. But we do expect to see this system weaken once again, it's a mid week. That could bring in initial impacts there across portions of southern Hainan but notice the cone of the forecast could take it as far south as Deneng (ph) population very high, of course. Could take this far north just Hanoi, Population even higher. So quite a ways left before we get there, but we know the population density, especially on the northern trajectory, could be problematic. We'll follow this as it progresses, but right now, it's should spend the next couple of days over open water, Laila.",
