They're extending hours for things like spray parks and swimming pools. They've launched, activated their cooling centers.

Remember, coral reefs are so paramount in protecting a natural barrier, per se, for the Florida coastline, from storm surge and hurricanes, but they also provide billions of dollars in tourism for people and the state as well. Now, unfortunately, they continue to bleach and die because of theabnormally warm water temperatures. The Coral Restoration Foundation found 100 percent coral mortality in some of the coral reefs in the southern Florida Keys. Now, 90 percent of excess greenhouse warmth is actually absorbed within our oceans. And it was ever so apparent this week with our water temperatures skyrocketing to near global record temperatures. We had a reading of 101 degrees in Manatee Bay earlier this week. That has since cooled off because we've had rain. But that's a real problem because that allows for a complete shutdown of our ecological -- fragile ecosystems, namely the corals, but it's also changing fish behaviors, including sharks as well.
