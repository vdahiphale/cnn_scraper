Stand by for the latest on their condition as more than 200 other civilians remain in captivity and in danger right now.Also tonight, new scenes of far-reaching destruction in Gaza, Israel wrapping up its air war against Hamas, as sources say, the U.S. is urging the Israelis to hold off on a ground invasion so more hostages can get out and more desperately needed aid can get in. And here in Washington, House Republicans are about to meet behind closed doors to hear from nine members now vying to be the next speaker. GOP lawmakers back to square one as the speaker fight drags on and the House enters a third week of paralysis. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the breaking news on the release of two Israeli hostages and how it figures into this war against Hamas. CNN journalists are working the story in the region as well as here in Washington. First, let's go to CNN's Erin Burnett. We're learning this live from Tel Aviv right now. Erin, what are we learning about these freed hostages?",

She has been released along with Yocheved Lifshitz, who is 85 years old, a photographer. And actually, she was one of the founders of the kibbutz where both women were abducted from, that is, Nir Oz, along the Gaza border. Both of their husbands are still held hostage. I can tell you the latest we have right now, though, is that in ambulances, our CNN teams are reporting, we're seeing arriving, from Rafah, from Gaza, from the Rafah crossing into Egypt soon after this hostage release had been negotiated. And obviously there's speculation that perhaps these two women could be inside them. They're being taken to medical facilities to be evaluated and their families will be waiting for them there. The Israeli government, interestingly, Wolf, is specifically thanking the Red Cross for this as well as Egypt. Egypt is the main facilitator. You will remember for the American hostages on Friday that the facilitator was Qatar. But in this case, thanking Egypt and the Red Cross, and also specifically, interesting, Wolf, thanking the IDF and Israeli security forces as well, which is something just to take into consideration the implication, obviously, that there is a direct Israeli involvement in these negotiations.",

Do your work. Get ready. We will need you. And, of course, this comes as Israel today stepped up their assault on Gaza, more than 300 strikes over last night. Strikes continue now. They say they've killed the Hamas commander of the rocket launching unit, as well as five Hamas aerial array commanders, they call them. They say some of those were directly involved in the attacks of October 7th. They say they've killed five of those Hamas level commanders since this war began 17 days ago, Wolf.",

Lee, that the Israeli military has told the Biden administration that there are still American Hostages who are alive Among those 200-plus hostages still in Gaza. So, that is certainly encouragement for the Biden administration. Meanwhile, Wolf, we have been told that as a result of this hope that more hostages can get released, that the U.S. has been encouraging Israel to not go in. Israel, however, says that they are ready to go and they are -- excuse me, they are -- the U.S. doesn't want to be seen as being told be -- as telling Israel what to do. So, there are big questions now about what happens next. Hamas is certainly being pressed to release bigger groups of hostages. But even if Israel delays, they're certainly not going to wait forever.

We can imagine that the Israeli officials will be asking them the same things as well as to these two ladies who have -- these two women who have just been released today that are certainly going to inform what Israel knows about how Hamas is keeping these hostages.And, of course, as they prepare for this ground invasion, that intelligence could prove to be absolutely critical because we understand that these hostages are spread out all across the Gaza Strip, being kept underground, in tunnels and in bunkers.

That brings the total to just over 60 trucks in the last three days. But to give some perspective to our viewers, in a normal 16-day period, there would have been 7,000, more than 7,000 trucks of aid that would have gone into Gaza.And that's in a normal 16-day period, which doesn't take into account, of course, the punishing bombardment you heard from Erin earlier, more than 300 strikes yesterday. Some Hamas commanders were killed in those strikes, but also hundreds of civilians, Wolf. And the images that we're seeing coming out of Gaza hospitals are just horrendous at the moment. One of the most crucial things that they need, desperately, of course, is fuel. Israel has cut off the electricity in Gaza. Therefore, all these hospitals are reliant on generators, and generators at the moment are powered by fuel. But fuel can't get into Gaza for the moment, because this is one of the real sticking points. In all these efforts and all these diplomatic talks to try to facilitate the continued flow of humanitarian aid, fuel is the tough one. The Israelis are concerned that Hamas will end up taking the fuel and using it. They don't want to see that happen. But without fuel, it's not just even about generators, it's about desalination. We spoke to a doctor who talked about people drinking brackish water at the moment. That's leading to a huge uptick in preeclampsia in pregnant women in Gaza. And so you're having all kinds of knock-on effects and still no sign, really, that there is going to be a continuous, sustained humanitarian corridor, and that crucially fuel will be able to get into Gaza anytime soon, Wolf.",

He, his wife and their one-year-old son are American citizens from Massachusetts who were visiting relatives in Gaza. They have tried unsuccessfully so far to get to Egypt through that Rafah border crossing, which remains closed for evacuations. Abood, thanks, once again, for joining me. As you know, Southern Gaza, where you are right now, just faced one of the deadliest and most intense days of bombardment since this war began. How did that affect you and your family? Is there anywhere at all where you believe you could be safe? ABOOD OKAL, U.S. CITIZEN TRAPPED IN GAZA WITH WIFE AND ONE-YEAR-OLD SON (voice over): Yes, thanks, Wolf. No, we don't think there's any place that could be considered safe. Quite honestly, we left Northern Gaza Strip specifically looking for safety, following the IDF instruction. And since we've been (INAUDIBLE) lost, very close to that Egyptian border in anticipation that we would be evacuated by the State Department. We've only seen the airstrikes increasing both in intensity and frequency over the last couple of days and specifically last night and tonight. There was an airstrike just a few moments ago before we got here, that was pretty loud, close by, and it's become the normal here. And we constantly smell basically gunpowder, debris, black debris and black powder. We see that every morning when we wake up on our phones on the floor. We certainly can cough it out in the morning. And that has had an impact on us. My son has been increasingly becoming more attached to us. He wakes up having nightmares at night. And one of us, either Wafaa or myself, has to be with him constantly day or night.

They will have another secret ballot election and tonight is really about hearing from all of the different candidates. And so far, there are nine different Republicans who have jumped into the race. That includes Tom Emmer. He's a member of leadership. He's the House majority whip. He also ran the NRCC for several cycles. He hasn't worked down to tamp down perceptions that he's not close enough to former President Donald Trump. And there's Byron Donalds, a member of the Freedom Caucus, very well liked among conservatives. But he's a softer member, there is some skepticism about whether he is ready to step into the job. There's also Kevin Hern. He's the head of the Republican Study Committee, another very large conservative caucus in the House. But all of these members are going to have to work to get 217 votes on the house if they become the nominee and right now, there is an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion.
