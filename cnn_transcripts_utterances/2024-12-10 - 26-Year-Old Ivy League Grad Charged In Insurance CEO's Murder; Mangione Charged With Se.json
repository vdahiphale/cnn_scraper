We're getting new details about the investigation into a privileged young man charged with murdering one of the top business leaders in America, including how he was reported missing just weeks before the shooting.Plus, vibe shift. Last week, Pete Hegseth's nomination was on life support, and today, once skeptical GOP senators appear to be rally behind Donald Trump's pick to run the Pentagon. And I will speak with a former hostage who spent 51 days in Hamas captivity. Her husband remains a prisoner. She will share excruciating details about the treatment she endured and has a message for both President Biden and president-elect Trump. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We do start with breaking news. And we want to show you new images just released by the Pennsylvania state police of 26-year-old Luigi Mangione sitting inside a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania yesterday. Just before police took him into custody, he appears to be eating a hash brown right before he was captured. And at this hour, Mangione is behind bars in that Pennsylvania city. And in just over an hour, there will be an extradition hearing to determine when he will head to New York. He has been charged in New York with one count of second-degree murder and multiple other charges of illegal gun possession and forgery. Mangione is part of a wealthy Baltimore family known for its philanthropy. He graduated from an elite Baltimore prep school and the University of Pennsylvania. Police are still piecing together a theory of why he may have gunned down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. His family and friends say, they are stunned and distraught. Here's what his former roommate told CNN last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) R.J. MARTIN, LIVED WITH LUIGI MANGIONE, SUSPECT IN CEO KILLING: I'm beyond shock, it's unimaginable. You know, I was roommates with him, friends, hiked, went to yoga. He's -- you know, did his best to be athletic. And unfathomable, knowing the kind, you know, person that I saw and knew. I remember he said he had a back issue, and he was hoping to get stronger in Hawaii. So, he's always focused on trying. When he first came, he went on a surf lesson with other members, and unfortunately, just a basic surf lesson, he was in bed for about a week. We had to get a different bed from that was more firm, and I know it was really traumatic and difficult. You know, when you're in the early 20s and you can't, you know, do some basic things, it can be really, really difficult. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the hallmarks I've been speaking with other agents that I worked with in the domestic terrorism division. This is the hallmarks of somebody who believes in -- on their movement.Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma City conducted the bombing, and he was completely separated from the other people that died in the building. He understood that that was just, you know, a complex. And to the fact that he was targeting the federal agents in that building, he understands -- so, you know, Luigi was looking to kill the CEO because he wanted to begin the movement. And he was talking in the plural sense, these parasites. He believed, when individuals get so into their belief, they believe that they will begin the movement, they believe they will begin the onslaught. And unfortunately, we're seeing that online. We're seeing the posters targeting other CEOs. The conversation of, hey, it was, you know, OK, because of what they're doing. He believes in this movement. He believes in it. And when he shut down, when he disappeared a few weeks ago, he was just preparing. He was preparing for his attack. He was preparing for the things. It doesn't matter. Ted Kaczynski is someone who he really idolized. He was a brilliant professor at Harvard. So, some of these people who are extremely intelligent, extremely brilliant, want to move forward a cause which they believe that only they can start the movement and start the fight against what the ideological belief. And hopefully the FBI is also looking at this as a domestic terrorist attack. But unfortunately, there are no federal statutes to charge for domestic terrorist attacks.

If you are by yourself, you prepare for it. It's very difficult to detect these type of attacks. Director Wray from the FBI always said that this is the most difficult investigation for the FBI, because there isn't anybody else in his circle. Oftentimes, if you have a larger amount of circles, you have somebody who may reveal some information, but he was a lone wolf. This is the -- you know, the poster child, the epitome of a lone wolf attack, and that's why it was difficult for him.

But why would he keep the gun and the driver's license, the very same one he used to check into the hostel in New York, where he knows they're on to him now.Why would he keep those unless he was still in the operational mode, a gun that still had ammunition in it. He still had the silencer. Was there another target? And another thing about that note. That note basically starts off address to law enforcement as if he's no longer there to answer these questions. This is a goodbye note, a resignation note that, yes, when I write this, or when this is found, I'll be in custody. Or is it that he's going to be dead? Is he expecting that he may be killed in the course of his next attack. Was he going to take his own life?

Because what Joni Ernst did, starting last Friday, basically, when she actually said, he's going to face some tough questions at the hearing and he's going to go through this process. That was an indication, she wasn't trying to sort of kill this nomination the way Matt Gaetz's potential nomination was killed there before anything got started.This was her getting on board with the notion that this would move forward, above that, there were going to be tough questions coming his way. I thought it was really interesting to hear him in the hallway there say, note her role in combat, given what he said about women in combat roles. The fact that he noted that, and then, of course, we saw some earlier comments from him today about trying to clean that up. I thought that was really intriguing, given Joni Ernst history. I just want to make one other point here, Dana. Joni Ernst is what we say is in cycle, like you know right now. So, she's up in 2026. She's also a name that's been floated as a possible alternate defense secretary nominee. So, she has her own politics that she's dealing with here, which is why she's perhaps, you know, more susceptible to some of the Trump ally pressure that's coming her way.",

Right.BARRON-LOPEZ: -- NDA, but also whistle blowers, you know, may fear retaliation and attacks from Trump's orbit, because we have known that when people have come forward publicly in any capacity against the president-elect, that then they face threats, they face attacks. And so, I think that's something to be watching here, does anyone come forward, especially as he goes to a hearing. And I think that's what some sources in Trump's orbit are concerned about, which is, if he reaches a confirmation hearing, do people start to come forward because they think that he's not qualified. AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, \"WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": Well, and, you know, I think that -- you know, I thought that Senator Cornyn's statement about, we need to do some vetting. I mean, it shows that, obviously Trump has been much more organized this time around. But in some ways, there has been a lack of discipline in the people that he's chosen. Because when you look at Pete Hegseth, and all this roll out, which is pretty disastrous, anyone would say, and then you have allegations of drinking problems. And look Pete Hegseth can say, look, these are anonymous sources, what have you. But he's also saying, I'll give up drinking once I get the job, which is that a great like -- I mean, if I were hiring someone, they're like, I'll give up drinking. Then that's going to be a concern for me. Why not give it up now. What like, is this an issue? BASH: And again, those are all going to be questions. I want to go back to something that you said because, and that is about these \"anonymous sources.\" It is so important to underscore that we don't know for sure if the woman who we're talking about here in 2017 is sort of chomping at the bit to come out in public. But what we do know is that she is under a non-disclosure agreement. So, even if she wanted to, she can't, so she has to be anonymous, basically by law. One person who wasn't anonymous was Christine Blasey Ford. I'm kicking it back a little bit to the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing. And the reason is because our amazing team here looked at some of what he said during his hearing and some of what Pete Hegseth is saying now.

If there is more information to come, and that includes somebody putting their name on something, that changes the calculus of where we are in this. That's why I think this hearing is going to be so important. If there's no new information that comes at that point, you could see this being on a more glide path towards a nomination. If it does, I think that's a totally different equation. It is clear that the Trump team, and if you speak to them, they will say this to you privately. They could not give another scalp here, right? That would -- that would set this whole transition. This is a major, you know, A.G., already Matt Gaetz gone. If that happened with the defense secretary now also, before it gets to a confirmation hearing, they were going to be on such a back foot to get through the remainder of this transition. That was a major concern, which is why I think you see a lot of this rallying around him at the moment. BARRON-LOPEZ: And I think there's a little bit of concern of who they may go after next. If Hegseth were to fall, then the Trump team is worried about whether or not Gabbard or as well as RFK, Jr. -- RASCOE: But I think, do we also want to think about, or will senators think about how Hegseth will be as a secretary of defense.
