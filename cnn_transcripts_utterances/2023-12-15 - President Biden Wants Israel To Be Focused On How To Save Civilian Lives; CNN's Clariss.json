CNN team witnesses firsthand, the humanitarian catastrophe that's unfolding as the U.S. ramps up pressure on Israel to limit civilian casualties.Putin carefully choreographed what the Russian President said in his first big news conference as the war on Ukraine began. And China shows off its home-grown passenger jet hoping it will soar like Boeing and Airbus. And we begin in Israel, where U.S. and Israeli officials are looking ahead to what comes next in Israel's war with Hamas. This hour, the U.S. National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, is expected to meet with the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog. Now, this meeting comes after Sullivan says he had a, quote, intense, detailed conversation with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and that the country's war cabinet in Tel Aviv on Thursday. Now, the U.S. wants Israel to shift from a high-intensity phase to a more precise, targeted approach in the coming weeks. And following the talks in Israel, Sullivan is scheduled to meet with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank later on Friday. Prime Minister Netanyahu vows Israel will keep fighting until Hamas is completely destroyed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  I told our American friends, our heroic soldiers have not fallen in vain. Out of the deep pain of their having fallen, we are more determined than ever to continue fighting until Hamas is eliminated, until absolute victory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Clearly, a disagreement over how long this particular phase of the war should go on, and yet really attempts to paper over those cracks from several American officials and Israelis who've been speaking out about those series of meetings that Jake Sullivan's been having with the war cabinet, but also with Mossad leaders, about exactly what's happening inside Gaza.He's been fully briefed, we understand, about the situation, the aims, the priorities, what's happening on the ground by Israeli officials. But that disagreement is really not so much we're told over timeframes but over the intensity of the war. What the American position is, Kristie, is that they'd like to see the Israelis move towards much more targeted, intelligence-led raids against Hamas rather than the sorts of bombing campaigns that we've seen over the course of the last few weeks. We had heard from the Israeli Defense Minister that this phase of the war was likely to go on for many months. What we're hearing from American officials is that they hope and believe that the Israelis may well shift to that more low intensity form of campaign sooner and possibly even before the end of the war. But this is, of course, we keep being reminded part of a constant back and forth between Israelis and Americans and again efforts to suggest that there is very little between them when clearly there is a difference of view over that shift of strategy, Kristie.",

And basically what we're hearing is that the Americans, and I think it's no secret already, we've heard the comments made by the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and even the President himself would like to see Israel de-escalate.

So, this is going to be a continued question and cloud that will hover above the decision-making apparatus that's making these decisions throughout the conflict and the war. Let's also just throw into the mix, Kristie, is the fact that there are mounting calls for many of the leaders, not only on the security side, but also on the political side, to step down in the aftermath of the intelligence debacle and the massive failure that led to those Khamas attacks on October 7th.

The Turkish version of the call says that Erdogan pushed Biden to withdraw the U.S. is unconditional support of Israel as a way to get a cease-fire. And that the U.S. has a historical responsibility to do that. And the difficulty here, Christie, is that the U.S. and Turkey see Israel and Hamas fundamentally differently. I spoke with Erdogan's chief advisor for security and foreign policy this week, Akif Cagatay Kilic, and I asked him about unconfirmed reports for example that the Hamas leader was actually in Turkey on October 7th and he said he might have been. But again, this is not a problem for Turkey because they don't view Hamas as a terror group. They think it's better to engage with Hamas.

[02The quality there really is very, very good. So the long term prospects for China to emerge as a major player I think is very good indeed. They are planning to have a larger version of this aircraft with 50 more seats, taken the capacity up to 240. They're also planning a smaller version of the aircraft, more like 120 seats. So, they are planning more versions. And I think as time goes by, more and more people are going to be very impressed with the aircraft, much the same way as we are with the car industry. The Chinese carmakers are making big inroads around the world as people sort of, try and like it, and word of mouth gets around. And people are really happy with the quality of the product.",

And it's also priced a little cheaper as well.So it stacks up very well, the big issue as I mentioned earlier is after sale support and spares if the Chinese can really get behind this aircraft and prove to potential buyers that they are absolutely committed to it with support, then I think it's going to certainly get into the Boeing and the Airbus market for the A320 and the 737 and start to eat away at it.",
