Those are the markets and these are the main events: Poor tech earnings spur wider fears about the state of the economy. The new UK Prime Minister delays a closely watched budget. And devastating floods leave Nigerians with no access to safe drinking water. Live from New York. It is Wednesday, October 26th. I'm Alison Kosik, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Big tech stocks tumbled today as weak earnings fan fears of a global slowdown. The tech heavy NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 were both dragged down. The Dow has been less affected though. Shares of Alphabet are down more than eight percent after a third quarter miss on weak ad sales. Microsoft is down about seven percent on disappointing Cloud revenue and weak guidance. Their results, still concerns about the tech sector's ability to withstand high inflation and rising rates. Investors will soon have a better picture, Meta releasing its third quarter results after the closing bell today. Amazon and Apple report tomorrow. I want to bring in Rahel Solomon. She joins us live now from New York. Rahel, great to see you. So, let's talk about these earnings. Microsoft reporting its worst quarter in two years; Alphabet missing estimates in revenue even falling at YouTube of all things. I'm curious what your read is on their results and what you think that these results have to say about the broader economy?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting, Alison, because we haven't seen ad revenue fall for YouTube, as you pointedout, since Alphabet actually started breaking that apart. So that was certainly something that raised a lot of eyebrows. And I think you can view these results a few different ways. On the one sense, it signals that it will remain a tough environment for the tech players, right? I mean, we're going to hear from Meta after the bell in a few hours. And you can see Microsoft, Alphabet still solidly lower. But we're also going to hear from some of the big heavyweights tomorrow, like Apple and Amazon. And so there are a lot of sort of ways you can read this just in terms of what this means for the tech players, but also what this means for the broader economy. And Alison, we tend to think of advertising and marketing budgets, in times of economic uncertainty, in times of economic anxiety. That's one of the first places you start to see companies pull back, that's one of the first places you start to see belt tightening. So, it certainly doesn't make you feel great when you hear a name like Alphabet saying that it is seeing digital ad pull back on areas like for things like mortgages and loans. And of course, Alison, you know, what's happening in the US housing market where we have seen housing sales really fall quite significantly because of higher interest rates. So, at a time when it felt like maybe it was more isolated to the housing industry, you're starting to see the spillover effect, right? You're starting to hear digital ad players like Alphabet say, \"Oh, but by the way, it's impacting us, too.\" And yet, we've also got corporate earnings this week that were actually solidly positive from some of the consumer names. So names like Visa, Kraft Heinz, GM, Coca-Cola, UPS, they all came in actually much stronger than expected. And so Alison, I feel like it's one of those things where any given day you get one data point that signals trouble is just right ahead, and then you get another data point that suggests well, maybe things are actually fine for now.",

So you do see companies are reporting that their sales growth is slowing. Most companies still have either stable or rising sales, but you've got a much greater fraction of companies reporting declining sales. And at the same time, you can still see that labor market resiliency. They are still hiring, they're still giving out wage gains. And as long as that's true, consumers are going to stay on track. They might slow their spending, they might become more price sensitive, but you know, it is a very strong self-reinforcing dynamic when consumers are getting jobs and income. So over the next 12 months is a long horizon and I think that if we go into a recession, it would be that gradual deterioration in the willingness to hire and pay new employees that would eat into the consumer. What we've seen is consumer resiliency so far.",

But, you know,you look at the Fed Minutes, the most recent one, they show some cracks, and even some whispers that the Fed may actually pull back a bit despite data showing that the hikes so far haven't yet been shown to be effective, meaning the Fed may slow down the speed and maybe the size of these rate hikes.

      "sentences": "Yes, so even the most hawkish member of the FOMC, everybody on the Fed Board is on the same page with you raise rates to a certain level,and then you stop and you hold them there and let that restraint take its effect on the economy. There are lags from when you tighten policy to when it has its full effect on the economy. We don't know exactly how long they are, but we know that the economy has not yet absorbed the full impact of Fed tightening. And so if you keep going, you're almost guaranteeing a recession, and of course, that's a source of anxiety for respondents to our survey, given how fast the Fed has been going. So, I do think a slowdown in the pace of tightening is quite possible, not at the November meeting coming up, but maybe after that, because rates will already be high and we are starting to see the leading indicators of a cooldown. You cited the housing market, it is experiencing a very rapid contraction that will spill into broader areas, furniture spending, home improvement, willingness to spend, as there is a negative wealth effect from both declining stock values and declining home values. All of that takes some time to feed into consumer psychology and spending plans. So, the Fed, you know will likely stop. It has signaled its plans whether a little bit higher or a little bit lower that it's going to hike through Q1 and then probably hold there for a while, and we've seen a few other indications from financial markets that the Fed is getting to a restrictive stance. Markets are the leading indicator and we're seeing in the earnings reports you were just discussing, some signs of cooling, some signs of pressure, that again, are a reflection that policy is having its intended effect and inflation, even though we haven't seen the decisive evidence we would like that it is cooling, is very likely to cool over the next year.",

Again, the Fed can maybe exercise a little bit more patience in letting that play out. There was a term we used to use in the 90s called opportunistic disinflation, which is you use -- you let that inflation come down over time, but you don't necessarily drive the economy into a recession to get to two percent quickly, because that could be counterproductive to its other mandate, which is maximum employment. So there is going to be harder decisions on how to balance those risks going forward. Again, the next meeting is sort of a done deal, but December and into 2023, balancing those pressures is going to be a harder judgement call.",

He had only 24 hours to prepare to face the House of Commons and the Conservative benches behind him are full of cheers and support for the new Prime Minister, as energetic and boisterous as I've seen them in a number of years. Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party and Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party both sincerely celebrated the fact that Britain's new Prime Minister is of Asian heritage. Starmer didn't waste too much time on celebration and pleasantries though before he started asking hard questions. To begin with, revolving around Sunak's reappointment of Suella Braverman as Home Secretary. So far his most controversial appointment since becoming Prime Minister. That's because Brotherman was fired as Home Secretary six days before her reappointment. She was sacked by Liz Truss for a security breach. So there have been questions raised and eyebrows by the Labour Party and other opposition parties as to whether or not there was some kind of deal made behind the scenes between Sunak and Braverman. But in terms of giving his party more confidence and more enthusiasm for the Prime Minister and the direction of the party, Sunak seems to have delivered. It was interesting to see him go up against Keir Starmer, as both politicians have some similarities in terms of their communication style, known for being serious, having a good grasp of the brief, and detail. Watching them go toe to toe, it seems that Sunak may be able to get his wish, which he said at the beginning of this Prime Minister's Questions, which was to have serious grown up exchanges with the leader of the opposition.

It's down to hard work in terms of procuring LNG from elsewhere -- Qatar, the USA -- a lot of money, it has paid a very high price to do so. And also some luck, Alison. You know, it's a really mild October at the moment, people aren't switching on heating in their homes across the continent yet, and also reduced demand because the EU has made it very clear that people need to do that now, certain measures in different Member States to do sort of their end. The other issue when we look at storage, though, is it really reveals Europe's limits, and I think that's what we're seeing really in the price in terms of near-term contracts and that is because, lots of LNG vessels are just floating off the coast of Europe, actually unable at this stage to offload. There is a lack of LNG infrastructure. There is a lack of storage facilities for it to be able to maximize beyond this point. So, that is why we are seeing that gas price where it is now.

Storage facilities will likely be entirely depleted, and it will be worse depending on how cold the winter is. So, then you have to look further afield. So next winter actually could be a much worse situation for Europe than this one and you have to also think beyond what we're seeing now in terms of procuring more LNG, the investment that is needed in technology like hydrogen infrastructure, more LNG terminals, more regasification facilities, more storage facilities would be really useful. And also policy, and this is something the EU is working really hard on right now trying to work out how they can reduce prices for the entire bloc, whether that is through joint procurement, whether that is through capping gas prices, and how you do that or whether maybe EU-wide subsidies, particularly if gas is powering electricity as opposed to heating.

And so, our company definitely is in a leadership position today, in terms of having some of the largest ready to go into production resources and infrastructure in the United States and Canada. We've completed over half a billion dollars of investments in acquiring new projects, again, in the West, and now more than ever, there is really a need to diversify away from Russian state on supply chains of nuclear fuel of uranium, and this is really the movement afoot here that we're noticing. Again, most uranium mines in the West were either shut down over the last decade, or simply, no new development took place. So this is the position we find ourselves in, right, where all of a sudden our energy supply chains are being stressed due to geopolitical uncertainty. And there is a really important need to have to ramp up quickly the supplies of uranium and to your point, and you've pointed out very correctly, there is incredible demand for small modular reactors to be built.
