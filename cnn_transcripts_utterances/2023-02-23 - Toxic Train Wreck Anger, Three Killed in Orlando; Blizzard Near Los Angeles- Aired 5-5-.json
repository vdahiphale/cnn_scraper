He met with the Russian president and foreign minister and head of the Security Council and he paved the way for a possible summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. That according to \"The Wall Street Journal\" could take place in April or May.On Wednesday, the Russian leader Vladimir Putin said that the relationship with China was reaching new milestones. And wanting to double town on that that sentiment, they said it stands the test of the changes in the international climate. It is mature, it is resilient, it is rock solid. And it is also under a lot of scrutiny right now. That's why on Wednesday, we heard from the Pentagon spokeswoman saying that they are warning China of consequences if China proceeds with giving lethal support to Russia during this campaign in Ukraine. China has repeatedly pushed back and countered those allegations, but the fact is ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, China and Russia have been moving closer together economically through the purchases of Russian energy, even more transactions taking place inside Russia. Large scale military drills taking place, one taking place right now this week. And also politically, Russia -- China refuses to condemn the Russia invasion as we near the one year anniversary of it.

So people from today and through until Saturday being encouraged to stay at home and protect themselves. But it is around Bakhmut and Donetsk that the fear is the most intense because of course what we've been seeing are intense shelling that continues. Ukrainian authorities convinced that the aim of the Russian side will be to try and take a whole of the Donbas by the end of March to show that they have achieved some of its objectives that it set out just over a year ago. But what we're also seeing is continued support from the Western alliance this morning in the visit of the Spanish prime minister who vowed to stay on the Ukrainian side until peace has been restored. I think it is important to note that these visits, the American president and Spanish prime minister, they are provocation and also function as something of a shield, Christine.",
