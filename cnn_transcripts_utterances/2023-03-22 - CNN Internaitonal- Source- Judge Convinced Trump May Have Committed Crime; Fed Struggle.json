Sources tell CNN the Justice Department has convinced a federal judge that it has evidence that Donald Trump used his own attorney to cover up a crime in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation.And later today, the Federal Reserve is set to decide on another interest rate hike. The decision comes as global markets are hoping to recover from a banking crisis that's kept investors and consumers on edge. A grand jury in Virginia has indicted seven sheriff's deputies and three hospital workers over the death in custody of Irvo Otieno, a 28- year-old black man. New video shows that officials were pinning him to the ground and the moments leading up to his death. Otieno's mother says the deputies and hospital workers, quote, smother the life out of her son. She and the family's attorney spoke to the media following the indictments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, just as an explanation, this 2005 Disengagement Law was a huge issue here. This is when Israel, unilaterally, pulled out of Gaza and evacuated the thousands of settlers there and also did the same in parts of the northern West Bank.Now, other parts of the occupied West Bank, of course, have plenty of settlers. But this part of the northern West Bank closer to Jenin and Nablus, which of course have been hotspots of violence over this past year and a half, those were also evacuated. And this has been something that the settler leaders in this new right wing Israeli Government have really been pushing for, that they will bring back the settlers to this part of the northern West Bank. So what the parliament passed was they actually passed it in the early hours of the night, overnight, and it was even not even passed with a full Parliament present. But essentially what it said is it repealed part of the Disengagement Law saying that Israeli civilians should be allowed to return to that part of the West Bank because since the disengagement law, it became a closed military zone and Israeli civilians were forbidden from entering the area. Now, this was celebrated roundly by settlers saying that it was righting a wrong and that they couldn't wait to have the Israeli flag flying once again. And then what we saw was the reaction from the Americans, which was rather harsh. They summoned the Israeli ambassador to the State Department. This is something that, according to reports I'm seeing, that hasn't happened in Washington. It's something like more than 10 years. I'm still double checking if an Israeli ambassador has been summoned since then, but that just goes to show you how unusual it is. Now, the State Department came out very strongly against this. And also what's interesting to hear from them is not only the protests against the settlements, but what they are noting as well from the State Department podium, the spokesperson saying that these -- the amendments are also inconsistent with Israel's recent commitments to deescalating Israeli-Palestinian tensions, just a few days ago how Israel reaffirmed its commitment to stop discussion of any new settlements for four months and to stop authorization of outposts for six months. That's referring, of course, to the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh Egypt, where the Israelis, Palestinians, alongside the Americans, Jordanians, and Egyptians were having a summit to try to calm tensions in the region, especially ahead of Ramadan. And this is a constant theme we're seeing with this Israeli government. On one side, you have these types of amendments being passed. You have ministers making controversial statements. And on the other hand, you have parts of the Israeli government engaging and trying to calm situation down. It's not clear who the real Israeli government is in all of this. Bianca.",

Otherwise besides the -- how she was acting towards photographers, she was fine. She was stoic. She was nodding her head a little bit when things were said that she agreed with and, of course, shaking her head when things she didn't agree with or spoken about in court. So she didn't say a whole lot. Didn't show too much emotion. But, yes, she did a fine job in there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
