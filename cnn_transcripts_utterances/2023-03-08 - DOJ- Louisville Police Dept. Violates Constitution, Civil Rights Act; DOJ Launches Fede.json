This conduct is unacceptable. It's heartbreaking. It erodes the community trust necessary for effective policing. And it is an affront to the vast majority of officers who put their lives on the line every day to serve Louisville with honor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's going to be -- it's going to be enforced by a court. A judge is going to be essentially helping to oversee the changes that the local police department -- State Department is promising to make. Obviously, they're -- some of the -- some of the changes, they say have already begun.For instance, they've abandoned some of these no-knock warrants. They have already begun on some of these remedial measures. They have changed the use of these specialized crime units. They started using mental health experts to go on some of these police stops -- or police calls rather so that -- to try to -- try to avoid some of these instances where things escalate into violence. All of this is going to be overseen by a third party. This is something that police departments often try to avoid. But it could, could make this police department a lot more responsive to the community that it serves. And this -- that this report really does paint a very, very ugly picture, something that you know, frankly harkens back to 60 years ago in some of the cities in the south during the Civil Rights era. We got a reaction from Tamika Palmer, Breonna Taylor's Mother. I'll read you just a part of it. It says what was confirmed today is that I should still be able to pick up the phone and reach my eldest daughter, Breonna. It took us having to fight day in and day out for years simply because I deserve justice for my daughter's murder to kickstart this investigation, but today's findings are an indicator that Breonna's death is not in vain. Certainly, those are words that you have to believe others in the community who have suffered this abuse by this police department, at least according to this report, I'm sure are also saying, Bianna and Victor.",

The same held true after the arrest of Eric Garner. We see it happen in a lot of the larger police departments such as Chicago after the death of Laquan McDonald.What the federal government does with this -- with these consent decrees is they make a series of recommendations. However, there's not a lot of teeth attached to this. When I say not a lot of teeth attached to it, meaning the recommendations such as training and additional resources will be introduced. But ultimately, the onus is upon the municipality to pay for it. In many instances, the municipality just doesn't have the money to pay for it. Therefore, it becomes a more challenging narrative moving forward. And in many instances, these consent decrees don't accomplish anything.

So, when we have a new police chief just introduced as the head of the organization, the goal is to fracture that cultural socialization within a police department and rebuild it with policies that are sound and better assist or serve that community. Another challenge that we have in policing is there's no national standard in policing.We have certain laws such as Graham versus Connor, which invoked the precedent in terms of the use of force, but a lot of the substantive issues that exist. And these police departments are different from one department to the next. And a lot of that is attributed to laws or more or less the budget that manages that police department. So, we now have a chief that's going to come in. And I think the best that that police chief can do is predicated on the elected official. If the mayor gives the police chief the green light to do certain things, then the police chief can do it. But if you have the elected official that somewhat hesitant, then that's when we have greater constraints. And this is a national problem in all police departments.",

Now, they could be looking at $1.6 billion of damages, it could be even more. But what it means from a 30,000-foot view is that this is a precedent for the First Amendment in cable news.Moving forward, you would expect Fox to be a lot more careful about the things that they allege to their hosts, and about what they communicate internally to each other now that they've seen that they can be deposed, and their text messages can become public. And hopefully, that means that they take more, you know, rational approach to this type of coverage. But you know, it all comes down to what this trial goes in April. And remember, they have Dominion, many lawsuits, not just against Fox, but against others. This is the first one that's going to trial. And so, if Fox loses this one, could be momentum for Dominion to pursue others.",

He gave it to the biggest conspiracy theory for January 6, Tucker. And I think if you look at why, he either made a promise, there's some grand plan and he knows Tucker is one of the really has probably way more power than he does, quite honestly. And he's also now his buddy on speed dial. So, yes, there's going to be something here. And it's not a narrative he can win, you know writ large, can't win this with the country, but he can try to win it with the 30 percent of the Republican base.
