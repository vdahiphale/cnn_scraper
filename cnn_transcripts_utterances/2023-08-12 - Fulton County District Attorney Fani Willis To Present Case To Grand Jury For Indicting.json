From Washington D.C., I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And first on CNN, we are following major new developments in what could soon be Donald Trump's fourth indictment. Just a short time ago I spoke with former Georgia Republican lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan, who told me that he will testify in the next 48 hours before a grand jury in Atlanta. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has subpoenaed Duncan to testify about efforts by former President Donald J. Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Duncan is now a CNN political commentator. And here is Duncan and what he to me earlier today about the subpoena and his plans to testify. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I have no expectations as to the questions, and I'll certainly answer whatever question is put in front of me, and certainly don't want to go any deeper than that to jeopardize or compromise the investigation.But look, for me, this is a story that is important for Republicans to hear, Americans to hear. Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions and the surrounding cast of characters around him. We watched a series of events happen here that were tragic and untruthful, and he's got a chance to present these facts and say, hey, I didn't know what was going on, or I think what reality is going to be is they knew exactly what they were doing. And I think the interesting part to this indictment, it's different than the others, is that there's heavy signaling that there's going to be 12-plus co-conspirators. And these folks don't have the same level of loyalty they had with Donald Trump when he was trying to change the election outcome in 2020. And so it's going to be interesting to see which way they go. And these are serious charges that are being signaled, racketeering, conspiracy, RICO. These are things really garnered for the mafia or the mob. So we'll certainly see this get ratcheted up in the next few days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It could be a two-day presentation of the case. And she is expected in that presentation to bring in some key witnesses, and those witnesses have been told that they would be given a heads-up, 48 hours notification before they need to arrive, before they need to appear.That's the news today, Fred, that Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor, got that notification. It appears that all systems are go. Of course, this would be President Donald Trump's fourth indictment, and this would be -- he was already charged federally for his attempt across the country to subvert the 2020 election. This would be a state prosecution for specifically what he and many of his allies attempted but failed to do in Georgia, the peach state, which he lost to President Joe Biden by about 0.2 percent of the vote.

It is an indictment comes next if the grand jury agrees with that, and grand juries generally do agree with prosecutors who bring charges like this and ask for indictments.[14:05:01] The Georgia case is significant for two reasons. Number one, it is a state case, so that even if Donald Trump were being elected president, he can't pardon himself for a state prosecution. So in terms of the January 6th cases, Georgia stands alone. Of course, the second part of Georgia and Fulton County is that they do have a policy of generally granting cameras in the courtroom. So that while the Jack Smith cases are unlikely, will not be televised, this one in Georgia stands to be. So it is the window into January 6th that the American people may really see the most vividly.",

So it isn't immediately clear to me that Trump will ask for cameras to be excluded from the courtroom. But the likely outcome of this is Fulton County does generally allow cameras in the courtroom, and so I think you go by legal precedent and probably assume it will be televised.",

So that phone call that you mentioned, the infamous phone call between President Trump and Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, where he begged and pleaded with the secretary of state to just find enough votes, one more than we need, so that I can win the state, that's what got this investigation started.But over the past three years we have learned so much more about the rest of the plot to essentially -- there's no other way to put it -- steal the election from Joe Biden and hand it to Trump. There were so many other elements about the fake electors and the breach of an election system in Coffey County, Rudy Giuliani giving bogus claims of fraud to the state legislature.

This still goes back a mile.And Fredricka, as we started to see about an hour ago, an hour plus last time that we were with you on Honoapi'ilani Highway, these families in some instances are being turned around because they're being told by Maui police that there's a traffic jam that started because too many people were being let into the disaster zone. So as we walk here, just to give you a sense of how many drivers, some of whom have been waiting for 12, 13, 14 hours, you have people, Fred, who left their homes Tuesday evening, not knowing if they were going to survive the inferno. And they've been seeing pictures on the news, unable to confirm if what they left behind is still there. So zooming further in, you see emergency sirens, just people who are waiting in this line who are at their wit's end. They're so emotionally strained, you can only imagine.

As we just sort of juggle what we have here, it's easier said than done letting people into the disaster areas, because first responders, the municipal agencies in Maui, are saying that if you're trying to get anywhere to the historic town, you need to walk around with this kind of mask, heavy duty P-100 or P-95 mask -- of course, this one is without it's filters for the moment -- because of the toxic air, toxic particles, that if they get into your lungs, they could potentially form a sort of acid.So it's not as simple as solving a traffic jam. Of course, they have the layer of making sure that people are safe, and then potentially warding people away from areas where there may be human remains.

Depending on the person's condition, if the doctor needs additional labs, we have some point of care labs that we do in the van. We have medications. And so it's like a one-stop shop for people.Up to date, we've served about 4,000 people, so imagine if you had two or three vans. Our vision is to really expand. Words cannot describe the feeling that you get providing care for someone who otherwise wouldn't be alive if your mobile health van wasn't there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Many of them suffer from abandonment issues that they don't talk about. And the biggest problem is that they don't talk about it. So what I wanted to do was do a short film that we could use withmentoring programs so it would give them a sense that they could go and talk about it with their mentors, so that way they could begin to heal, if that makes sense.",

And I connected with it and I just felt like it's important that we talk about mental health, try to get individuals involved in understanding that -- because I was a professional football player and athlete, that we all need assistance. And I just want to be able to help people help themselves.I think, overall, we need to raise more awareness about opportunities for definitely minority communities to seek mental health. It's important that we all have a balance in life. And for myself, if I didn't listen to a teammate in the locker room in 2002 in Atlanta, I would have probably never went to counseling. But I learned over the years the impact that going to counseling helped me. It helped push me forward. But also having fluent individuals around me, knowing that they go to counseling. So to really just talk about the opportunities that everyone needs counseling, and we need to make sure that low- income communities have access to that.",
