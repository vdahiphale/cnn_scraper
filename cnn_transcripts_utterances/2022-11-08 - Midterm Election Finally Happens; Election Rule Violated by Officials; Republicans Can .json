You know, Hilary, as we look at what's playing out around the country it's interesting to see some of these historically solid blue areas and district. Things have changed. Part of that is because of redistricting. Part of it is because of the candidates and also because of the issues.Focusing on the state of New York, there are some of those seats that are more of a contest now. Is this, what do you attribute that to? Is it issues? Is it redistricting? Is it challenges from Governor Hochul at the top. She's facing a much tougher race than anticipated.

The people most vulnerable right now are actually running in districts where it's, you know, 50 percent completely new voters.So that is a big piece of this. But these governor races are important, and because they really tend to focus more on local issues, I think the national message for Democrats has been somewhat muddled. But when you try and do the local message, just like in Pennsylvania, the top of the ticket does matter. So, with Governor Hochul evening up with Congressman Lee Zeldin some of these races are going to be a little more precarious. Just like in Pennsylvania. I think Charlie would agree that the Democratic candidate Josh Shapiro who is running strong is actually going to help John Fetterman a little bit. You have the opposite in states like Arizona where the Republican candidate is really strong, that's going to hurt the Senate candidate. So, the top of the ticket does matter in these states because it matters whether who your vote is, you know, how you're getting your vote out. HILL:  I do want to pick up, you said the Democratic message was slightly muddled. I think you were a little bit more direct over the weekend. You were talking to Dana Bash and you said, listen, the Democratic Party, very simply I'm paraphrasing you here, but just didn't listen to voters who were very clear that the economy was the number one issue.",

If you're aligning with Republicans, you are, you know, aligning with fascists or you know, you're -- you don't care about your country. You have no patriotism.

You know, a lot has changed. You know, if you asked me six weeks ago, I thought the Democrats had a lot of optimism to hold the Senate. Now I'm starting to think, you know, I think Republicans have reason to be optimistic to gain control of the Senate. So, things are moving quickly.

Erica Hill will be back in just a moment with more U.S. midterm election coverage.But first, here's some other stories we're following. Well, with the war in Ukraine looking likely to continue well into next year, U.S. officials are urging their Ukrainian counterparts to soften their declared position on no negotiations with Vladimir Putin. A source close to the discussions says the White House is not trying to pressure Kyiv into peace talks, but rather is worried that a war without the possibility of a negotiated and would lose public support. The White House wants Ukraine to hold the high moral ground and make their desire for resolution known publicly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  No one has suffered more than the Ukrainian people. No one wants to see this war end more than the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government. So, it is neither our place for us to pressure the Ukrainians, nor would we need to do such a thing. They have every incentive. It is the Russians that are sending a very different signal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Not only do we have this now research center in St. Petersburg for the Wagner group, but you know, and for those of us who spent sort of 2016 and 2017 trying to understand his connection to the internet research agency, that troll factory which was sort of interfering in U.S. elections.He was later sanctioned by the U.S. for this. To hear him say these things is really sort of mind blowing. This is what he said in his Telegram post. He said, I will allow a certain ambiguity, gentlemen, we interfere -- we interfered, we interfere, and we will interfere. The joke being of course, that he said he would allow ambiguity and then didn't. So, it is sort of unclear whether he's joking or not, but still very interesting to hear him openly admit this, and of course coming just ahead of the midterms in the U.S. This is what the White House response to that was. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We also know that part of Russia's efforts includes promoting narratives aimed at undermining democracy and sewing division and discord. It's not surprising that Russia would be highlighting their attempted efforts and fabric -- fabricating a story about their successes on the eve of an election. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It seems like he might want to now take credit for some past, and apparently current action when it comes to the sort of manipulation of information as well as of course, the actions of the Wagner group raises questions, of course, John, about his future plans should there an opportunity to jockey for power somehow in Russia.

The leaked videos that we've seen emerge on social media of him, you know, acting on behalf of the Wagner group, recruiting prisoners in Russian prisons.
