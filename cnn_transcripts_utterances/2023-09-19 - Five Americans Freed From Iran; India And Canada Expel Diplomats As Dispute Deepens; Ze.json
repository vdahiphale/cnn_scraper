Homicide investigators say two mass suspects described as heavier set males fled on foot and then possibly in this 2008 Silver Toyota Camry.

VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTERThe Indian government has now expelled a senior Canadian diplomat without naming this official and wants this official to leave India within the next five days. So, you can see that the tensions are building between the two countries. And this comes after a very strong statement from the Ministry of External Affairs here in India. And I'm going to read out an excerpt from there where they have refuted and rejected the allegations made by the Canadian Prime Minister and the Canadian Foreign Minister. And it states and I'm going to quote them here. Such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten India's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Now, this is something that India has repeatedly been stating officially at least to Canada that they are condemning and they want Canada to take some action and rather strong action against anti-India elements in Canada, specifically the Khalistani members and leaders there. And there's a huge diaspora as we know of Indians in Canada and a significant percentage of the Indians there are from the Sikh community. India has repeatedly asked for action against anti-India elements based in Canada. And now, you know, the prime minister came out and spoke about this person Hardeep Singh being a part of the community there, being a citizen of Canada but for India, this man is a declared terrorist and an absconder and was declared a terrorist back in the year 2020.

And Iran is shifting more to the east to the great powers in Asia, Russia, China and it's made things just more complex and more difficult.

Speaking to 60 Minutes, Zelenskyy highlighting the sacrifices Ukraine is making. We're defending the values of the whole world, he says. And the Ukrainian people are paying the highest price.
