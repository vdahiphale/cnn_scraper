When we had that moment for him, that was in the first 20 minutes of that debate. In the second debate, Joe Biden made the point about COVID, where he said, Donald Trump turned COVID from a tragedy -- from a crisis into a tragedy.

One is to set expectations.The other is to send a message to the candidate, you know, whether or not you work for the campaign or work tangential to the campaign. And so Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the things he said is he says, you know, I think Donald Trump's going to come out as a unifier because that's the side of him that America doesn't see. And of course, I said, they don't see it because he never does anything to, you know, indicate that he's a unifier if you read a social media account.

An 11-year-old captured it all as the house that had been evacuated for a few days, luckily, began to crash down. There you see it going, almost the entire house with all the contents in it.Now, more than 20 river gauges in that region have reached major flood stage.

And you think of all of the areas that have kind of built up in those last 20 years.Look at this video here that you can see from South Dakota. Again, just all of these areas underwater that normally would not be. And it's pretty widespread, too, because it's not just one or two rivers, creeks and streams that are dealing with excessive amounts of rain. It's a lot of them. You have 21 river gauges at major flood stage, 24 at moderate and over 60 at minor flood stage. Now, most of them, again, are focused around that Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota area. That's why you still have some of these flood warnings, in effect, focused right around a lot of those rivers, creeks and streams. But the water has to flow somewhere. So in the short term, most of the concern is a little bit farther north. But all of that water is eventually going to flow southward down towards the Gulf of Mexico, meaning that a lot of these other river gauges are going to start to see their levels begin to increase this weekend and even into next week, because many of these have not yet crested. Take, for example, the Mississippi River at St. Paul, still on the rise and not really expected to crest until we get into this weekend. And if it does reach those levels, this is what we're talking about. Could be the first time in 20 years they've seen levels this high. So, again, you're talking about an excessive amount of water. Now, in the short-term, we are finally going to get some drier conditions. That cold front is now starting to slide farther south and east, taking with it the chance of severe thunderstorms. So you have got some areas across the northeast, the mid-Atlantic, back down into the south that are looking at the potential for hail, damaging winds and even tornadoes today. That strong line of thunderstorms right there sliding from Missouri southward, but at least allowing areas farther north to get a little bit of a break.",
