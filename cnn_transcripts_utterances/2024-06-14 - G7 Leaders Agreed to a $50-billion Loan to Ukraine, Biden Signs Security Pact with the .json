The FDA, as any possible decision restricting their regulatory authority, would have an enormous impact on many industries, including, of course, the pharmaceutical industry. And of course, depending on which way this went, it also could have had an impact on anyone seeking office this year. Right now, they have effectively preserved the status quo, but because the justices did not decide the issue and instead just sort of tossed it out based on standing, it is possible, even likely, that this issue could return to the high court in the coming years. Now, for anyone who has concerns about Mifepristone, but does not have standing to bring a lawsuit, here is Justice Kavanaugh's advice for them. Quote, \"citizens and doctors who object to what the law allows others to do may always take their concerns to the executive and legislative branches and seek greater regulatory or legislative restrictions on certain activities\". So now all eyes on another abortion case before the justices as they release most of their key opinions over the next few weeks.

Now, volunteers are carefully moving the eggs to cooler parts closer to the islands rainforest, and away from the hot sands.",
