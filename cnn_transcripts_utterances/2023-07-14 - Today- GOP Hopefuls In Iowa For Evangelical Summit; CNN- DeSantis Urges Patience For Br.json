Interestingly enough, Kim Reynolds has been appearing with him, the governor, at several of his events. Now, she has pledged to remain neutral. That's what made President Trump so angry. But she has pledged to remain neutral, but has said very positive things about him. He's looking to make some big inroads today and throughout the weekend here in Iowa. Dana?",
