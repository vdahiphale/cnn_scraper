We have something called pretrial services at the federal level, what is that? It's a probationary wing. What they will do is they will do a deep dive into his prior history, including everything, finances, health, family, et cetera. They ultimately, that is pretrial services probation issue a report and recommendation. That's significant. That goes to the judge.While that's happening, what ends up happening is that your lawyers are preparing a memorandum with the recommendation as it relates to sentencing. I suspect that that'll be inclusive of all kinds of people who know you, know what you're about, whether it be clergy, business people, colleagues, et cetera. Thereafter, prosecutors submit their sentencing memorandum to the judge. And then you of course, have the sentencing date where you go in. There'll be oral argument with respect to what's appropriate. And there are these things at the federal level called sentencing guidelines. I know we talk about this with respect to 25 years, 10 years on this, that, not at all. The federal sentencing guidelines include the offense level with regard to the offense for which you were convicted, in addition to your criminal history. Let's remember, he's a first offender, no, you know, no criminal history to speak of. And the nature of this allegation is not violent. And so all of that will be happening in the ensuing weeks and months.",

Let's remember, this is a very sympathetic case, jurors themselves questioning whether it should have gone to trial saying it's a waste of taxpayers money. So I don't think the judge will ultimately hold that against him. Obviously, there'll be some explaining to do. That was gut wrenching testimony, et cetera. It's not an offense for which he needs to, right, go to jail. That's obviously up to the judge. But what I'm speaking about is regarding mandatory minimums. So it's very discretionary.

Another whether of course, a psychiatrist or medical health official could have testified as to addiction. While that's happening, the matter will proceed. The judge will pronounce sentence. I suspect that there could be what we call a stay pending that appeal.And then I'll also look for, John and Kate, the timeframe. Timeframe is very important. Why? Dad is in the White House. Daddy said, I'm not going to pardon my son, has not ruled out a commutation. What's the difference? If you're given prison time, do we delay the prison time. Then there's that other case and I'm looking for a timeline on that other case, California tax case, because the timeline of that and should he be convicted and his father not be in the White House that presents other problems his father could be, we just don't know.

They sound a little bit not as if they would be the central issues of such an important meeting. But of course, they are fundamental to so much that concerns all the leaders here. And that is migration. Migration itself comes up on another day. But you'll have the leader of the African Union here, Prime Minister from Kenya. You'll also have leaders from Tunisia and Algeria here as well.And why does Africa matter so much? It's just across the Mediterranean, of course, from Italy. Italy on the forefront of huge migration waves coming out of that continent. So what can these developed democracies with powerful economies do to help the African continent and the people there and perhaps, in essence, persuade them not to migrate towards Europe? So that's one issue. Then you have Ukraine coming up. And of course, the central focus there will be getting agreement on how to fund a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, which is going to be paid for by frozen profits from frozen Russian assets. That looks likely U.S. and E.U. will sort of underwrite that. Then you get into the issue, as I said, of immigration. And you have a central and important issue for President Biden, the Indo Pacific region, China, in essence. AI, that's also going to be a big topic here. And the Pope coming in Friday, AI will be something he'll want to talk to these world leaders about. So a packed agenda for President Biden. And of course, the specter if you will, of Donald Trump, a potential president. Donald Trump attending the next G7, that's what these leaders will have on their minds as well.

We think it was 56, 56 different entities from our department to the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers, the state DOT under the leadership of Gov. Wes Moore, county, city. All of the first responders from the divers looking for victims to the people making sure that traffic was handled and managed safely, all adding up to this moment where less than 100 days after that shocking event, more than 50,000 tons of concrete and steel have been cleared out of the Patapsco River. The channel is open. The port is up and running. Those workers are working.Now, obviously, we've got a long way to go in terms of part two, which is getting a new bridge up to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge that was destroyed. And more and more of the focus is going to now turn to that, although we've been working on that from day one as well and already got $60 million out to the state. But again, my big lesson, my big takeaway here is the power of teamwork. I have never seen this many different organizations, agencies, responders come together since I've had this job to deal with a crisis touching our transportation system.

We released $60 million to help get that process going. We're side-by-side with Maryland DOT in their work. They're already engaging the procurement and the design.
