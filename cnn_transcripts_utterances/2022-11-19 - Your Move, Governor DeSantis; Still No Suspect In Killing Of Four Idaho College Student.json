That's item number one.You know, and then when we talk about the timeline, and you were talking about the whole Christie Obama thing, understand that, you know, he just got reelected, so, let's just do the math. We have term limits in Florida. So, basically, he would leave office in '26. So if he waited, he would be out of office for two years. And you know, the thing about it is, is that having the governorship is a good place to get a lot of attention, media attention and other things like that. So, you just wonder how it would be. I mean, the thing about, you know, Jeb Bush, who was one of the ones who was vanquished by Trump, he had been office -- at office for about eight years.

Among them, \"Disney fired Actress Gina Carano after she compared the treatment of conservatives on social media to Nazi persecution of Jews. The company called her post abhorrent and unacceptable although co-star Pedro Pascal wasn't sacked for likening Trump supporters to Nazis. A Virginia high school teacher fired for refusing to use a student's preferred pronouns. USA Today editor demoted for tautologically tweeting, people who are pregnant are also women. Southwest Airlines fired a flight attendant who made anti-abortion posts on Facebook, and a Texas hospital fired a nurse for objecting to a mandatory course that required her to admit she's racist because she's white.\" Joining me now, the piece's coauthor, Jed Rubenfeld, is a professor at Yale Law School and a First Amendment lawyer.

Berkeley and Stanford law quickly followed suit even though all have ranked high on that list for decades.Since 1983, the media company has been compiling best lists of universes and colleges using data submitted by each school. The schools' deans criticize the list methodology and how the results perpetuate disparities. In a statement, Harvard Law School dean John Manning said that the ranking method is -- quote -- \"work against law schools' commitments to enhancing the socioeconomic diversity of our classes, to allocating financial aid to students based on need, and through loan repayment and public interest fellowships, to supporting graduates interested in careers serving the public interest.\" Joining me now to discuss is Jeffrey Selingo.

JEFFREY SELINGO, AUTHOR, \"WHO GETS IN AND WHY: A YEAR INSIDE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS\": It's a huge piece of it, right? The score they get on LSAT, the scores students get on the LSAT really play into the rankings.
