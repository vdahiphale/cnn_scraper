I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with our out of this world lead and the once in a generation phenomenon across the United States right now, parts of the northeastern United States are still experiencing the solar eclipse, which passed across the U.S., plunging parts of 15 states into darkness. Mexico's Pacific coast was the first to experience what's called the totality. That's when the moon fully blocks out the sun. Huge crowds gathered along the path of the totality in cities from Mazatlan, Mexico, to one of the largest watch parties in the United States at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, all the way to Niagara Falls, New York. And all that travel is expected to provide a $6 billion impact on the economy according to some analysts. If you missed today's eclipse, you might not need those special sunglasses again until August 2045. That's when NASA says the U.S. will experience its next total solar eclipse. But we're going to bring the highlights from coast-to-coast. Lets go straight out to Derek Van Dam, live on Mountain Mansfield in Stowe, Vermont. And, Derek, the path of totality passed over you, but people in your area should be able to see the partial eclipse for another 30 minutes. What are you seeing right now?",

It was awe- inspiring as a meteorologist to have these things come together in this way was so special and for the thousands of people that join me here on top of Mount Mansfield in Stowe, Vermont, I think they've got quite a treat because it was perfect, ideal eclipse viewing conditions and once in a generation experience.

And then that will raise the question of -- well, was Donald Trump acting within the scope of his job? Of course, Trump's team will say he was the president. He had very broad job responsibilities and DOJ will say, no, we've charged with crimes that go way beyond. So I think the Supreme Court is going to be focusing on that specific issue.
