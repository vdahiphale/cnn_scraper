I'll talk to a top Biden campaign official about the latest strategy for taking on Donald Trump.Plus, trials and tribulations. Stormy Daniels is back on the stand tomorrow after dishing salacious details about her alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, right down to his satin pajamas. But does her testimony ultimately help or hurt the prosecution. And from vice presidential hopeful to admitted puppy killer. Kristi Noem political stop seems to be tanking as the Trump veepstakes enter a pivotal stage. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, 20,682 votes. That was Joe Biden's 2020 margin of victory over Donald Trump in the critical swing state of Wisconsin. Four years earlier, Trump took the state by about the same amount. Now for context, 20,000 people feels less than a quarter of the Green Bay Packers' Lambeau Field. Is it why Joe Biden is in Wisconsin today. For the fourth time this year, he's unveiling a 3.3 billion. That's right billion-dollar investment by Microsoft with a not-so-subtle shot at Donald Trump. Now back in 2018, then President Trump was in the exact same spot to announce a huge manufacturing facility by Foxconn. Trump said it would be quote, the eighth wonder of the world. Instead, it was mostly abandoned. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Milwaukee. Jeff?",

If it's an investment in infrastructure, talking about building a new bridge and superior are replacing lead pipes here in Milwaukee.The question is, are voters feeling these economic achievements of the Biden administration? It really is a match between job creation and inflation. And talking to voters here, you get the sense, they still are not feeling this economic success.

He thought he would restore order. But the economy he said his driving his decision this year. He is sort of finally remembers the Trump policies. Of course, these are two voters.But Dana, taking a bigger look at this. Both campaigns realize that Wisconsin will come down to just a sliver of votes. That is why President Biden is in Racine County, just south of me here in Milwaukee, making that big announcement. This county has been through a whipsaw of a political elections that have had local political fallout as well. I recall being here with the former president as he was announcing that Foxconn development, it just shows that presidents always do not have the power to deliver on these. The question is, will Biden get credit for that? So certainly, an important visit. One of many that both candidates will be making here to battleground Wisconsin.",

Those are all personal profits. Now, campaign advisors insist that this has been on the schedule for weeks. They also point to the fact that last week Donald Trump campaigned in both Michigan and Wisconsin. I will note the week before that on Wednesday, he played golf at Bedminster. I also do want to point out that on Saturday, he has a rally, but this is interesting. It's in Wildwood, New Jersey, not exactly a critical battleground state. He lost it by roughly 16 points in the last election. But it is home, the area that he's going to be in a representative Van Drew -- Jeff Van Drew who turned from Democrat to Republican, while Donald Trump was in office, which Donald Trump still talks about to these days.

Thank you so much, Kristen, for that reporting.Here for now -- for more reporting, I'm now joined by my great political panel, PBS's Laura Barron-Lopez, Hans Nichols of Axios, and CNN's Eva McKend. Hi, everybody. Nice to be here on a Trump trial daybreak. Hans, I want to start with you and the story that you wrote for Axios this morning. And the headline is Biden hits Trump with a major Microsoft announcement in Wisconsin. Talk about the significance of this announcement that he's going to make. And as it -- as I mentioned, to Jeff sort of contrasts with -- for the voters there in Wisconsin with the promise that Trump made there. HANS NICHOLS, POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: Yeah. Well, let's be clear. Biden is also just making a promise, which he's going to have to deliver on that, right? And that's part of the challenge. And he'll get credit for the construction jobs. And those are the easiest ones to do when you do. They're doing an AI facility in conjunction with Microsoft. But the overall strategy from the Biden campaign is inch- by-inch, town-by-town, step-by-step. And that's what you see the president doing. Now, there are criticisms within the Democratic Party of that. Remember that Ron Klain sort of tape that was leaked out saying, you know, he -- like he's running for Congress. He's just talking about bridge announcements. On the other side, if you're a politician, you say, would you rather go out and bring gifts and talk about job announcements? Or would you rather be stuck in court? I think we all know the split screen that -- that any politician would want. What's interesting about the split screen dynamic, is it -- this split screen isn't actually the kind of most accurate way to describe it because it's a split screen. But Biden's background is always going to be changing and Trump is going to remain static. And that's just a challenge at the campaign and the Trump campaign is going to have to work around.",

And it goes on and on and on.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: That's right. And the president is going around highlighting this part of his economic agenda, which is that he's adding jobs. He's trying to make sure that other parts inflation are going down, costs are being driven down. And while he's doing that, Vice President Harris, another thing that Donald Trump doesn't have right now a VP to go around campaigning with him, is going around in making the case on abortion. And I was just in Wilmington, meeting with Biden aides. And they were saying that ultimately, they really see three big things that they're going to be making the case on economy, which you see the president doing, abortion which you see Vice President Harris doing. And then also they're that larger umbrella of extremism and democracy. And they say that they hear from voters, a big fear, especially in suburban white communities about the potential for political violence.

They're not really familiar with it. And those young voters have said to me, well, I survived the first Trump term.
