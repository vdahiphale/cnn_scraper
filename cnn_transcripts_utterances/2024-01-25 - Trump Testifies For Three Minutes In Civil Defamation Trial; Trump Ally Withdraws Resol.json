      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.Donald Trump takes the stand, again, breaking the court rules, again, and scolded -- being scolded by the judge, to keep quiet, yet again. His testimony over, in just three minutes. Also tonight, that was fast, after a Trump ally proposed declaring him the presumptive nominee, just two states into the Republican primary. He just withdrew that plan, after there was major backlash. Also tonight, in the U.S., an unprecedented trial is underway, for the mother of a teenage school shooter. Will the parents be responsible, for their son's deadly rampage? I am Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump has said a lot of things, about the author, E. Jean Carroll, in the court of public opinion. Has already gotten into legal trouble for it. Today, he said it for the first time in front of a jury. And after roughly three minutes, on the stand, it was over. That's how long it took for Trump to testify in his own defense, today, with many restrictions, I should note, at the defamation trial brought by E. Jean Carroll. Trump was not allowed to say that he didn't sexually abuse her, or that she lied about it. That was already decided. But here's the exchange that did happen, in court. His attorney, Alina Habba, asked, \"Did you deny the allegation because Ms. Carroll made an accusation?\" Trump's answer? \"Yes I did. She said something that I considered a false accusation -- totally false.\" That's when Judge Kaplan quickly cut him off, and told the court to strike everything that Trump said, after the word, \"Yes.\" That's because a different jury has already found that Trump did sexually abuse Carroll. Trump was also scolded, by the judge, today, before he even got on the stand, telling him to keep his voice down. He was overheard by reporters, in the room, while the jury was not there, saying things like, quote, I never met the woman. Now, the defense has rested, and the jury is set to hear closing arguments, tomorrow, we could get a verdict very soon. And we are told Trump is planning to be there. I'm joined, tonight, first off, by an attorney, who previously was part of Trump's legal team, on several matters. Jim Trusty is back here, on THE SOURCE. Jim, thanks for being here. Donald Trump going on the stand for, for just about three minutes, do you think that hurt or helped him, ultimately here?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, look, for the trial, probably no real noticeable effect. The bottom line is, you got to remember, it's a damages trial, not a liability trial. So, we're really kind of getting far afield from assessing his credibility.He got that comment out, about not doing it, which theoretically, a jury will disregard, because they were instructed to. But at the end of the day, I don't think it's going to be a major factor. I think they're probably more interested in some of the other testimony that was brought out, like the prompt complaint witness, who basically a friend of E. Jean Carroll, who had some pretty negative things to say, about Ms. Carroll's love of attention, love of the limelight. That's the kind of stuff that could have more of a denting effect, in the amount of the award. And I think that President Trump's testimony, the only way it really turns south, is if they get resentful of the notion that he's still fighting on liability, which -- and Judge Kaplan's in a position to kind of underscore that. And they heard the deposition testimony, which included those denials. So that's about the only thing they -- that could turn south. But I don't think it's going to be a major factor. They're going to do what they're going to do. They're pretty hard to predict, when it comes to damage awards. But we're way past liability. It's not the fight anymore, at this point.",

I don't think it's going to happen here. I don't think it was a heavy dose of it, today. But that's the risk of kind of fighting the liability, when you're at the damages stage.",

And so, I think there was a lot of stuff, from his deposition, that which he embraced today, that you could already argue, whatever you want to argue from. So, it was a little bit of window-dressing to a case that was already kind of out there, for the jury to consider. Again, I just don't think it's a big tipping point, most likely for the jury, when it comes to damages. It would have made a difference, if you're talking about liability, but not for damages.",

I'm not saying that. But it's not a good look for the system.

That doesn't really go towards compensating Ms. Carroll, for any damage to her reputation. As to punitive damages, it is relevant. I mean, he at no point expressed any remorse or acceptance of responsibility. He's still denying that he engaged in any of this conduct. And juries do take that into account, with punitive damages, if they need to -- if they accept already that he did these things, but he's not showing remorse? That tends to up the punitive damages. He also didn't denounce any of those tweets that were sent. They're pretty vile, the evidence that's come in, of people saying that Ms. Carroll should be raped, that she should be killed.

Then when you get past the foreseeability question, and these are all jury questions, based upon the evidence, you get to the issue of were the parents on notice, of the proclivities of this child, the mental health maladies, what he was doing? Could he really, at one day, and one time, engage in something like this?

A California woman, in recent days, was even arrested, after she stole a car trunk full of 65 Stanley cups. So, what is behind this craze? Is it really worth it?
