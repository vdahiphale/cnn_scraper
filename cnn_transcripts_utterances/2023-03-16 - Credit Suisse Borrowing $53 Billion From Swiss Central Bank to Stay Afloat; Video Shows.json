Originally, she was supposed to talk about the budget, but you can bet there will be plenty of questions amid concerns over the U.S. banking sector. Yellen set to strike a calm, confident tone as she tells Americans that banks are sound and their deposits are safe. We're going to bring you those remarks live.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is a big moment for the treasury secretary. I mean, Janet Yellen, she knows that confidence is a fragile thing, and, clearly, it has been shaken by the bank failures in recent days. So, she's got to go out there and reassure the public that the money in the bank is safe. In her prepared remarks, we know that Janet Yellen says that, quote, Americans can feel confident that their deposits will be there when they need them. And she points to what she describes as, quote, decisive and forceful actions that U.S. officials took over the weekend when not one but two banks collapsed. And she points out that deposits in those banks were safe, notably even above the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit. So, that's the message from U.S. officials. I think if you look at the market though, the market is telling a little bit of a different story. We the U.S. stocks are opening lower, and look at the bank stocks. Now, the first line there are regional banks, the top line. First Republic Bank, that's a San Francisco-based regional bank, down 30 percent this morning, a 10 percent loss for Western Alliance, PacWest down 20 percent. These are very significant losses on top of what's already been significant losses. Clearly some concerns there remain about those regional banks.Credit Suisse is up but not all that much despite the fact that last night, we had the Swiss National Bank, the central bank there, swoop in with this $50 billion lifeline for Credit Suisse. JPMorgan is out with a report this morning saying that they don't think that this emergency support is actually enough, and Credit Suisse is still going to need to be taken over. So, markets are clearly on edge and we have officials on really both sides of the Atlantic scrambling to try to put out this fire.",

But from the point of view of our tech sector, our life sciences sector, remember, the U.K. has the third largest tech economy in the world after the United States and China. We are Europe's largest life science industry. We have got Europe's largest T.V. and film industries.So, we have a budding Silicon Valley happening here in the U.K. And I think what we realized is that we need more diversity so that those very important companies have more choices to where to bank, how they can get scale up capital.

But that's not about the stability of the financial system.

And that, of course, is very challenging for families who see the prices of their mortgages go up, for businesses who see the price of their loans go up, but it is the lesser of two evils because it helps bear down on inflation.

      "sentences": "Yes, Erica, really remarkable footage here. So, essentially, what we are seeing is the vantage point of the drone, and we're looking at the Russian fighter jet kind of speeding up towards the drone, releasing a whole bunch of jet fuel, kind of spraying it on to the drone, and then the video cuts out. And that, we're told, is the moment of impact. That is when the Russian fighter jet hit that drone. And then you come out of it, the video reemerges and you can see that that propeller, which was intact at the beginning of the video is now damaged. And that is a result of the direct hit by the Russian fighter jet on this drone.Now, this video really directly contradicts the Russian narrative of events. Just remind viewers, the Russians have been saying repeatedly over recent days that the fighter jets did not make physical contact with the drone and that the pilots were acting in a very professional manner. Well, now, we're seeing that actually this video appears to back up the U.S.'s version of events, which is that the pilots appear to act recklessly and dangerously and directly kind of harassed the drone, ultimately hitting it. Now, it is unclear at this point what is going to happen to the wreckage of this drone, which did fall into the Black Sea. We are told that the Russians have arrived at the site of the crash, but it is unclear whether they are going to be able to obtain any of the debris or wreckage because the depth of the sea there is very, very deep, it's about a mile deep. And the U.S. itself does not have any naval assets in the area that would allow it to readily go and collect the debris itself. Finally, we should note that out of all of this, we are told that this was a direct order by officials within the Russian Defense Ministry for the pilots to actually take this action and directly harass this drone. So, this wasn't just some rogue pilots that made this attempt to intercept the drone, this was actually a tasking that came directly from the Russian Ministry of Defense. Jim, Erica?",

So, of course, she had been scheduled to appear there before the Senate Finance Committee, M.J., to talk about President Biden's budget, which we heard a lot of at the tail end of her remarks. As Jim noted, though, she did begin by talking about what is on everyone's minds, and that is, of course, these bank failures and the action that was taken over the weekend. What more is the White House expecting from this appearance this morning on the Hill and specifically in terms of the questions that she may be getting?M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Erica, you are absolutely right, that this was a hearing that was previously schedule for the treasury secretary to talk about President Biden's budget, but the timing of this has become so key, and you heard her right off of the top addressing the health of the U.S. financial market and talking about the failure that we saw in recent days of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and she was very clear at the top saying the words, our banking system is sound. And she said that the actions that the administration took in recent days should reassure Americans that their deposits are safe. She, of course, was referring to the sweeping emergency actions that we saw the administration take over the weekend. One backstopping all of the funds of the depositors and also the Federal Reserve creating this sweeping emergency lending program, but the reality for this administration, including for Janet Yellen, is that all of those actions have clearly not been enough to reassure investors and markets. And right now at this moment in particular, something that U.S. officials are watching very, very closely, of course, is the situation with Credit Suisse. Now, U.S. officials have tried to emphasize that they believe that situation is separate from the situation that is confronting U.S. regional banks. They are also hoping that with some time, there will be a little bit of calm restored after the news that there has been basically a $54 billion infusion of cash from the Swiss National Bank, but that's a situation that is quickly unfolding, but, again, U.S. officials are again trying to use a testimony like this, and every other sort of U.S. official I've spoken out about this really trying to urge calm and really trying to emphasize that there are not going to be more dominos to fall, that there is no reason for people to panic right now.",
