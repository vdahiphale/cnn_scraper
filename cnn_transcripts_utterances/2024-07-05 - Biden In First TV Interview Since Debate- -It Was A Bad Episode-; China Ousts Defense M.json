Of course, they're also looking to tamp down some of the very serious doubts from within top official, from top officials within his own party about him remaining on the top of the Democratic ticket. A come November. Now, President Biden came here to Wisconsin, and was quite defiant, insisting that he would remain in this race and also saying that there are some in the party who wants to push him out, that he didn't say specifically who, but we know that there have been a public and private calls among Democratic officials for the president to consider stepping aside in this race. Now, Biden's team was well aware of what a high stakes moments today would be with this campaign rally and also that interview. They know that every moment and the president's schedule that his words are closely dissected and watch as people are trying to ascertain whether Biden can, in fact, serve a second term in office. They are hoping that some of these public like messaging events, will really help turn the tide towards Biden, even as there are serious expressions of doubt within his party. Now, I will note the president spoke here for about 15 minutes using a teleprompter. He then moved on and actually spoke without a teleprompter to an overflow crowd to campaign insist that there will be more unscripted moments like that, more for interviews, he will be conducting at a time when his allies have encouraged him to do that, to try to win over these voters. But he is facing serious headwinds from within his own party about whether he should remain in the race.",

I had questions about the wisdom of running for president when you're at 82 years old.And I said at the time that my concerns were not political, but actuarial. I know what the presidency is. I know how crushing the job is. Every single person who serves their ages rapidly. And if you start at a baseline of 78 which is, by the way, I guess with Donald Trump would be if he got elected, you know, you're going to run into problems and so, you know, I take no great pleasure in that having said that, where we are now. And watching that interview, I found it poignant. I don't know that its going to relieve anyone to hear the president and explain what happened and it seemed a little disjointed as it -- not as disjointed as he was in the debate, but its still didn't seem like he had completely grasped what happened and why or why people are so concerned. The issue is not present, said the rally, you know, we're not going to let 90 bad minutes erase three-and-a-half years. I'm one who believes Joe Biden has been a really fine president. I think he's done things that are historically important, but this isn't about that last four years. This is about the next four years. And people are making a judgment as to whether he is up for it.

I think -- I think if we are in the crisis that we say we are in, I believe we are -- is that not a reason to change horses and say, look, thank you, President Biden.

I think it's probably better if Biden continues because he might be their weakest option at this point.But honestly, Boris, after seeing this clip and again, I want to watch the whole thing at 8:00. I'm worried about the president. I think most Republicans look at this and say, you know, is he okay? And what's going on over at the White House? I'm worried about our country. I mean, there's credible reporting today, apart from this interview tonight and apart from all the things we've seen, that the president's having trouble during the day acting independently, that there's three staffers in the White House who essentially take them around and tell him what to do during the course of the day. This is extremely concerning. It ought to be concerning the Democrats and Republicans alike. In this interview, by the way, he said that he was exhausted. So, he said that fulfilling the duties of the office of the presidency made him too exhausted to perform one day on the campaign trail. Now if I'm a Democrat and I'm looking at this situation right now, I'm thinking, is the commander in chief too exhausted by his official duties to lead my party into the election. I think were in a real crisis here because we don't know what's going on at the White House, we're worried about the president. And I also think were in the middle of an unfolding scandal about the people who who've not been honest about the president's condition for the last three-and-a-half years. I don't know what's going to happen. It feels like the Biden family is very dug in and it seems like the president has dug in and he is on the brink I think of running a reelection campaign that ultimately will make his legacy this, he'll leave Donald Trump better and in a stronger position that he found him and that'll be a heck of a thing after 50 years in office for his legacy to be left that way.",

And that is something that's been raised to me by Democrats, that's something that's critical to watch over the next week.One thing they have said that President Biden needs to do is stop anymore defections from taking place like the ones that we've seen, or even more Democrats, like Maura Healy raising questions about whether or not President Biden should potentially continue on in this race.

It can affect them in some of the ways that we saw during that debate.

And I think it was very sustained for a long period of time, specifically, and there was all these different neuro docs who are calling me and texts me and emailing me about this.I think that some of the specific symptoms, the halting speech, sort of the rambling, sometimes it was confused rambling, but also just the voice volume, just speaking very softly and reduced facial movements. Again, he said he had a cold. Could a cold account for some of these things? Yeah, and nobody is saying that these particular signs are diagnostic of anything. But I think what a lot of people have suggested and I think makes sense is that he should get a cognitive exam. It would sort of later rest this site -- this question, are these just episodes or is this some sort of underlying condition that could be diagnosed and potentially treated. By the way, I should point out that in the United States, anyone over the age of 65 is supposed to get a cognitive exam as part of their annual wellness check. That's supposed to happen. It doesn't often happen. It takes a while to actually do these types of exams. But that is sort of standard recommendation for anyone over the age of 65. So it wouldn't be that out of sorts to have had that done. But according to the White House, President Biden has not had a cognitive exam and his doctors have never recommended one.",

Actually, in the primary supported Dean Phillips. So again, I think it's a handful -- most donors or sticking with the president for now to see if he can turn it around. Secondly, by the way, what a lot of donors aren't spending enough time on is what is plan B, right? A lot of donors and I'd argue a lot of Democrats who want the president to step aside or engaged in the political version of fantasy football, you know, coming up with all sorts of creative combinations.
