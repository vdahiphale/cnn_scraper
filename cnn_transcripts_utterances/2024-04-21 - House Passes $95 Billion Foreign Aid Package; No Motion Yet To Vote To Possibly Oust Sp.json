It could get another 90-day extension if the president determines there is progress toward a sale.Not many in Congress see the app as a national security risk but the company argues First Amendment rights are at stake and it plans to challenge measures to ban it. Now, President Biden said previously he would sign off on a previous version of this bill. So, it is likely if the Senate goes ahead and passes it, he will approve this one.

He did not come into the speakership a loud proponent of continuing to provide aid for Ukraine, in particular, but we've seen him come around this issue. We hear him point to, you know, internal intelligence that -- his view that has underscored to him the importance of these tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons for Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression. And he is now doubling down saying that this was the right thing to do.And yes, we have certainly heard from both Republicans and Democrats who are supportive of the fact that he did move forward on this package and bring it to the floor, despite kind of waiting for a few months to decide the right path forward. But again, as you point out, this is also a very contentious issue for Republicans and conservatives are not happy right now. And it's not just Marjorie Taylor Greene, or Thomas Massie, or Paul Gosar. We are hearing increasingly from more Republicans who are upset by the fact that Johnson passed Ukraine with 100 percent of Democratic votes and not even half of Republicans votes. And that is putting his speakership in jeopardy not just -- right now, we're not just waiting to see whether Marjorie Taylor Greene does move forward with the motion to vacate, right now.

There's bipartisan support for forcing the Chinese owner ByteDance to divest from TikTok. And so, by attaching a very similar measure with additional -- more time for ByteDance to divest by attaching it to this must pass foreign aid package. Johnson is really forcing Schumer to bring this to the floor.

So, just as the region is -- seems to be breathing a sigh of relief the tensions between Israel and Iran are easing or at least direct conflict between the two, there is still the Iranian proxies to think about.Now, we have seen that there were four strikes by Israel on Hezbollah targets overnight on Saturday. Hezbollah announced the death of three fighters, and they did launch about 10 strikes against Israel, accusing Israel of attacking civilian buildings in southern Lebanon. Of course, CNN can't independently verify that. But it just goes to show that even as those Israeli-Iran direct contacts appear to have ended, there are still a very real fear of the uh the increase in tensions and in conflict between Israel and the Iranian proxies. Now, when it comes to the aid package that has been approved, Israel of course welcoming it. The Prime Minister welcoming it also. The foreign minister of Israel Katz saying that it does send a strong message to enemies. It will of course go towards those missile defense systems, many of which are along the northern border in Israel just across the border from here in southern -- here in Lebanon. And we know that not everybody is happy with it though. In the States, for example, there were 19 members of the House Progressive Caucus who feared that this package could result in more killings of civilians. That is something we're hearing echoed in the Palestinian corridors of power. The spokesperson for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority President, saying that he worries that this will now correlate to the deaths of more Palestinian civilians, saying, that it could give Israel the green light to broaden the war across the region. Now, there are concerns he says that this could constitute an escalation in this situation. And the situation as we see it at this point, Gaza for example, we know that the death toll has now gone over 34,000 Palestinians. This according to the Ministry of Health within Gaza itself. Many of them women and children. We don't have a breakdown from either side of how many are fighters and how many civilians but the overwhelming consensus is that the majority are women and children. And also, in the occupied West Bank, I have to point out there has been an uptick in Israeli military operations. There was one in the -- in the occupied West Bank which has started on Thursday in one of the refugee camps. It's just ending this Sunday, we understand. The IDF saying they killed 10 fighters.

Subsequently, there was also a presence of not just students but also faculty setting up tents and signs here on the campus itself.The organizers of this event making their message quite clear saying that their hope is that they will pressure Columbia University to devest funds from companies connected to Israel. Now, CNN has reached out to the university to address for more on not just their investments but also to address the allegations that have been put forward by these organizers, but eventually this evolved into an encampment, a large one that the University president declared a disturbance so turned to the NYPD sending them a letter asking for police officers to essentially interject and forcefully remove some of the students who were participating in it. The result was well over a hundred people that were detained, will be issued court summons. But really what this is now is the presence that still remains here on the campus, a peaceful presence of a mix of both current and non-students here hoping to continue with that message from last week here. For protesters, this may be a galvanizing moment to basically reinvigorate their cause, but for universities they're certainly going to -- this speaks to them having to grapple with the reality that we are likely going to continue to see more of these demonstrations from one campus to another both protests and also counter protests. And those universities really forced to walk that thin line between safety and Free Speech. Polo Sandoval, CNN New York.",
