Donald Trump vowing to impose massive tariffs on day one of his incoming administration on goods from two close allies Mexico and Canada. And he's also planning to boost tariffs on China, announcing on social media his plan to implement a 25 percent tariff on all products coming to the United States from Canada and Mexico. He says it's a response to their role in illegal immigration and drugs coming across the border. Trump also announcing a 10 percent increase on tariffs already in place on goods coming from China, quote, until it prevents the flow of illegal drugs into the United States, end quote. Many economists believe tariffs could wreak havoc on Americas supply chains and raise prices on everyday goods for American shoppers. Chinese -- China's embassy spokesperson telling CNN, quote, China believes that U.S. -- China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature. No one will win a trade war or a tariff war. Trump's tariff pledge comes just days after he announced his pick for treasury secretary. The hedge fund executive Scott Bessent. It will be up to Bessent to manage Trump's economic agenda. Prior to becoming Trump's pick to lead the Treasury Department, he had this to say about tariffs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT BESSENT, TRUMP'S TREASURY SECRETARY PICK:  I would recommend that tariffs be layered in gradually, which would the price adjustment would be over a period of time. But I think if you take that price adjustment coupled with all the other disinflationary things President Trump is talking about, that we're going to be at or below the 2 percent inflation target again.

Mr. Bessent campaigned conversation on tariffs raises the question about how willing Mr. Bessent will be to tell the president when he's making a policy mistake. If Mr. Bessent won't, it's not clear who on the economic team will. But if his lodestar is growth, he'll do well for the president and the country. They're basically saying hey, you should.

We're going to tariff you. China, if you're going to allow this stuff to get sold in our country largely produced in China, we're going to add another 10 percent to your chair.

This is why they're implementing these tariffs because of this influx of fentanyl coming into the country.I also think that this is a change because originally it was tariffs, because he wanted to bring more American jobs in the first time around.

I don't think that would encourage Netanyahu to visit. The big test would certainly be if he did visit. The police tried to arrest him. And then America looks on and says, why isn't that government intervening here, and blocking this arrest? So I think as long as you know, this judgment is being made, the governments have said they would abide by it. Its not really going to, you know, that that sort of debate has passed.

Thanksgiving travel expected to set records this week. AAA projects 80 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more over the holiday period. 18 million people are expected to travel by plane. The FAA says today will feature the most planes in the air, with ongoing staffing shortages in control towers. And that does bring us to weather. Rain is impacting parts of the eastern U.S. this morning, while folks in northern New England could see some light snow, as those holiday travelers prepare to hit the road for Thanksgiving. Let's get straight to our meteorologist, our weatherman, Derek Van Dam, for the travel forecast. Derek, good morning. DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Packing our patience this morning. Good morning, Casey. Yeah. So we've got a couple of different weather systems that will impact the country from today and into Thanksgiving, and beyond. I'll explain. So here's the first one right now. So if you're traveling on the roadways, this is where things could get a bit tricky. So let's zoom down to Atlanta for instance. I-75, it goes north and south right through the city, Interstate 85 also dissecting the city as well. It's wet, drove in this morning. This is where the headquarters is for CNN. So, yeah, we felt it. And the roadways are feeling it as well. So, traveling a little further north, here's the heavily populated and very busy I-95 corridor, rain showers now starting to move into that region. This will impact LaGuardia, JFK going forward. So this could cause some trickle down delays through the course of the morning. But notice this is all rain. The snowfall is located just to the north. You got to go into the higher elevations of Upstate New York and into portions of Vermont and into New Hampshire to see the changeover from rain to snow. Certainly, all snow across the mountains of Colorado. This is west of Denver, so the majority of the impacts will be across the mountains. The same cannot be said for Salt Lake City, impacts there. And a lot of snow for the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. So if you are flying today, you saw the cold front moving into New York. This could cause some major delays. So keep that in mind. Double check your flight plans as this cold front moves eastward. We kind of get a break on Wednesday, so maybe a good travel day for eastern seaboard locations, but look what's coming on Thursday, Thanksgiving Day. This is the storm system we've been concerned about. You better settle in to your relative's house because this is where things are going to get interesting. Snow downwind of the lakes and rain for the coastal areas. You can see the precipitation going forward and a lot of cold weather behind this as well. Temperatures are going to take a nosedive behind this system. And by the way, anyone who's keeping track, Macy's Day, Thanksgiving parade on Thursday morning in New York City, looks to be wet and breezy.",
