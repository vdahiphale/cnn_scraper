That means more people requiring more frequent and advanced medical care which often means more pills. But there's a growing movement in the medical and the scientific community that's urging less pills and more plants. They look at marijuana as a potential life changer for those suffering from age-related conditions like chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety, even Alzheimer's disease. But does cannabis really work for seniors and is it safe? Over the next hour, Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes us around the world as he speaks to skeptics and advocates who are studying cannabis. Sanjay also meets with older users who say their quality of life has improved because of marijuana. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): April 2023.

Now when the endocannabinoid system is working well, doctors call it homeostatic. A healthy balance. But here's part of the problem. This starts to change and diminish as we age.
