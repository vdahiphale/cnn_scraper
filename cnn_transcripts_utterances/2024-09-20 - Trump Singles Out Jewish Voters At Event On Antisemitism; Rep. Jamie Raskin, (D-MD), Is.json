      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper. This hour, a stunning admission from the acting head of the U.S. Secret Service about his agency's failures during the first assassination attempt against Donald Trump back in July in Butler, Pennsylvania. Now he's pledging everyone who dropped the ball will face penalties. We'll tell you more about that in a second.Plus, with just over six weeks until Election Day, a controversial new rule from Georgia Republicans about hand counting ballots despite warnings from election officials, poll workers and even some of the state's Republican officials. But leading this hour, the fallout spills into a second day after CNN uncovered disturbing and inflammatory comments by the Republican gubernatorial nominee in North Carolina, CNN's KFile found Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson's posts on a pornography message board for more than a decade ago, before he entered politics, Robinson called himself on that board, a Black Nazi, whatever that is, and expressed support for reinstating slavery, even buying a few slaves himself. Now, Robinson is ignoring multiple calls for him to drop out of the race. He insists he's not the one behind the posts. Republicans are voicing concerns that this scandal could impact other candidates in the state. Let's go straight to CNN's Alayna Treene who's looking ahead to Trump's visit to North Carolina tomorrow. And Alayna, Trump has full on embraced Robinson in recent months. He helped him get the nomination. He even called him, quote, \"Martin Luther King on steroids,\" unquote. So how is Donald Trump and his campaign? How are they dealing with Robinson's racist, sexist and bizarre comments on the pornographic message board?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Jake, I think the timing of Donald Trump going to this rally in North Carolina tomorrow is absolutely remarkable. I will say that in my conversations with people close to the former president. They had actually been prepared for a damaging story about Mark Robinson to drop this week. And before that even did, before the CNN KFile investigation even landed, they had not invited Robinson to this North Carolina event on Saturday, which is notable in and of itself, because Robinson has been at all of Donald Trump's recent North Carolina events, and even as Donald Trump's team has tried to distance the former president from them, and not just after the story, they have been doing this for months because these aren't the first inflammatory comments we have heard from Robinson. Remember, he has mocked the victims of school shootings.He has tried to disparage the civil rights movement. So Donald Trump's campaign has really been trying to distance Trump from him for a while now, but Trump himself, just last month, was the one who called Robinson up on stage at a rally in Asheboro. So, this is something that is going to be difficult for the former president to run away from. And of course, his comments praising Robinson in the past is part of that. Now we did learn today, we got an exclusive look at a new ad that the Harris campaign has been putting out his launching today in North Carolina, trying to tie Donald Trump to Robinson. They are really seizing on these comments and this new story. And mainly trying to highlight Robinson's anti-abortion rhetoric in that effort. I want you to take a listen to some of that ad (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DONAD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And he's been an unbelievable lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson.

Nicholas Fuentes, a neo-Nazi Holocaust revisionist, he of course, saw very fine people on both sides of an antisemitic riot in Charlottesville, Virginia. And now he's setting up the Jews to be blamed for what seems like his likely defeat, since he's not running a real campaign putting any issues out there, he's continuing just to engage in name calling and character assassination against different people, but he wants to be able to blame it on the Jews, and says it will lead to the eradication of Israel.

And when the Colorado Supreme Court had several weeks of hearings about this, and I think five or six days of fact finding they ended up determining that Donald Trump was disqualified from the Colorado State ballot because he had been impeached for inciting an insurrection against the Constitution, and they considered him disqualified under Section 3, the 14th Amendment, which says, if you've sworn an oath to support the Constitution and you violate it by, quote, \"engaging in insurrection or rebellion,\" you shall never be allowed to hold federal or state office again.Now, up until now, ballot access for a candidate has been controlled by the state, and the state was simply interpreting a constitutional command which is supreme over every part of the U.S. government, and yet the Supreme Court said, no, it's not up to the states, and we the Supreme Court, despite the fact that our job is to interpret the Constitution, we're not going to interpret it, we're going to leave it up to Congress. So, in that minor passage that was completely distorted and fabricated, in essence, by Lee Zeldin, what I was saying was the Supreme Court is kicking it to Congress to decide at the point of an election whether or not someone is disqualified by section three of the 14th Amendment.

They are the least swinging vote group in America. The vote for a Democrat between 60 percent and 70 percent, they're a very small percent of the population.His re-election will not hinge on the Jewish vote.

You remember a local officer popped his head up onto the roof, saw the shooter and thought he was radioing to all the law enforcement on the ground that there was a potential threat there. That message never got to Secret Service a -- agents on Trump's detail. And that's really been a critical question throughout this two month investigation being conducted by the Secret Service. I mean, look, this really boils down to a problem, as described by the acting director today, about an inability of the Secret Service and local law enforcement to communicate directly. He said that some standard communications or protocols were not in operation that day, raising more questions about why they were standard were they not being used when the former president was there for a rally. And he also raised concerns about sort of the complacency. He used that a direct quote, a complacency amongst some members of the former president's advanced staff, both in their interactions with the Trump campaign and their concern -- and raising their concerns about the site itself and some challenges that came along with it. Take a listen to what the acting director said today about those interactions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD ROWE, ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICE: While some members of the advance team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols. With respect to accountability, the mission assurance review has identified deficiencies in the advanced planning and its implementation by Secret Service personnel. These employees will be held accountable. And this agency has among the most robust table of penalties in the entirety of the federal government. (END VIDEO CLIP) COHEN: So it seems to be speaking about a specific group of individuals at the secret service that will be held accountable. As he says, what that accountability looks like remains to be seen.",

And you are looking right now at images of what's called the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica. It's better known as the Doomsday Glacier because of its threat to our coasts. Scientists are assessing its risk of collapse. They sent a torpedo shaped robot called the Ice Fin to the iceberg where it showed images of warm ocean water able to funnel through deep cracks in the ice.The Doomsday glaciers collapse could cause the Earth's sea level to rise anywhere from 2 to 10 feet, potentially devastating coastal communities, from Miami to London to the Pacific Islands.

But every decade that can avoid that it means more time to certify themselves, the mangroves to grow and for people to get ready, because this is sort of baked in now. This is a result of six years of research teams from the U.K., U.S., around the world using that Ice Fin torpedo that you showed them, and seeing the disturbing trend now that warm water from the southern ocean is getting up and under this big the world's widest glacier.It's the size of Florida, a mile thick. That's a chunk of ice. And just by itself, it would raise sea levels by 2 feet. But it also is like a cork in a big bowl of ice, and it holds back a lot of that land ice as well. So what they've seen about it, it's been shrinking for the last 80 years, accelerating last 30. They say specifically, it'll get faster and further coming up. But again, it's all about buying time and coming to grips with the idea that the coastal cities we've built for a different earth from a different age are not going to hold up to what is happening at the bottom of the world. It is so far away. It's so -- so disconnected from that. This is ancient ice, snow that fell before Jesus was born, building these massive glaciers. But it's now melting so fast. There was a heat wave last month Jake in Antarctica. It was the temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the winter. And so these are just the physical results. These are the laws of chemical dynamics and the more key traffic conditions (inaudible). But already this is baked in. People should get ready (inaudible).",
