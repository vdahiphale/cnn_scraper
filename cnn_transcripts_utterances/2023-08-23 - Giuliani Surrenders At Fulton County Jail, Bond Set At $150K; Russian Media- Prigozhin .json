I'm Erica Hill, in for Jake Tapper.We are following several breaking stories, including the possible death of Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin who attempted, of course, a mutiny against Vladimir Putin exactly two months ago. Russia state media claims Prigozhin was on the passenger list of a plane that crashed and burned this afternoon. Videos on social media do show plane pulling out of the sky. State media claiming all 10 people onboard were killed. But it is important to note, CNN does not currently have confirmation that Prigozhin was, in fact, on that plane. We are also following this other breaking story of Georgia, where Donald Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani was just released after being arrested in Fulton County. He stopped to speak with reporters outside of the jail. We'll bring you those comments, but also let you know that Sidney Powell, another former Trump attorney, surrendered at that jail just moments before Giuliani. They, of course, are just two of the 19 people charged in this 2020 election case in Georgia. CNN's Nick Valencia is outside the Fulton County jail, and he was right there as Giuliani got out of the car to make some remarks. Nick, you were able to get in a couple questions. What did Giuliani tell you?",

First being who paid for his private jet down here because we were told that he had been trying to get people to help him pay for his legal bills? Listen to him and what he told reporters as he exited the jail after being arrested and surrendered.

Russian state media reporting that notorious warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin is likely dead. Prigozhin, of course, is the leader of the private Russian mercenary group Wagner, and was a key ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Prigozhin's army helping Putin to carry out some of his bloodiest crusades in Ukraine, especially in the eastern city of Bakhmut, which earned the title of the human meat grinder. And then Prigozhin, as you recall, now turned against the Russian ministry of defense, claiming it offered insufficient ammunition and resources to his battalion, slamming Putin's generals and that led to a failed armed mutiny to Moscow in June exactly two months ago. CNN's Matthew Chance starts us off from London on this. So, Matthew, besides what Russian state media is reporting, what other verifiable information is there at this hour in terms of that plane crash and who may have been in board.",

This Wagner operation has been taking place not just in the Central African Republic where it really sort of all started when we were there, but also in Mali and Libya. It has strategic importance. It has commercial importance.And so, the question becomes what is the succession plan? Is there a succession plan? There have been rumblings that the Kremlin has indeed been working on a succession plan and that they have set up another kind of rival PMC to carry out this type of work, particularly in Africa. But, the real problem is that up until the war in Ukraine, Wagner had something that the Kremlin does not, they had plausible deniability. They didn't even officially exist on paper. And that meant that they could go along and work with whatever kind of leader and participate in massacres and do all the kinds of things the states can't really do with impunity, basically. So, if the Kremlin is hoping to continue these operations, it will have to think very carefully about how it goes about doing that because it will have lost that veneer that Wagner gave it of plausible deniability or distance from some of the massacres that we know Wagner operatives have been involved in the past.",

How is he wandering around casually, coolly, popping up in St. Petersburg, traveling to Africa, back and forth to Belarus seemingly without a care in the world. Either this man has extraordinary amounts of chutzpah, which partially I'm being a little facetious. But partially, I do think that's part of it, and part of the image that he cultivated, or did he possibly have some sense from someone in the security services that he had been pardoned or forgiven.We know that he did sit down with President Putin in the days after the mutiny. We don't know exactly what was discussed at that meeting. But did he leave it under the illusion that potentially he could live out his life and die of old age. It's hard to believe that he could seriously think that because Prigozhin understands fundamentally that Putin does not accept traitors, that he does not accept betrayal. And by the way, Prigozhin was the same way in terms of espousing that very, very hard-line ideology. So, this is a question honestly, Erica, that I think will keep people talking on Twitter and online for many, many years, trying to unravel and really fundamentally get to grips and understand why exactly Prigozhin believed that he might get away with this. And frankly, that was a question that was asked just after the mutiny as well. How on earth did he think he was going to be able to pull this off?",

And also the state of the war at this point, whether there needed to be something to maybe shore up Putin's image.How much of all of that do you think could have potentially been a factor if, and a big if, obviously, there was -- this was a planned attack because Prigozhin was on that plane, and because someone wanted him gone?",

      "sentences": "So many people are looking at these videos, Erica. In fact, the former managing director of NTSB tells me an airplane like this does not come out of the sky like this without some sort of help. Look at the video of this airplane free falling here. You can see what appears to me to be vaporized fuel trailing behind them.This is what's really interesting. And when you take it a layer further and if you slow the video down, and bring up a still here, this is a little blurry but this is the airplane you can see the fuselage here, you can see one wing here, what is missing is the other wing. That is where this gets really eerie. And investigations in the U.S. typically investigators would go through and rule things out. Was this a mid-air collision? Was this something like a structural failure where the airplane broke apart mid-flight? Was this another type of emergency or was this airplane shot down? And that is the thing that investigators will really to look at here if this is in fact a transparent investigation. We'll get to that in a second. Let's look at the flight path because there's some more real interesting clues here. This is the data from FlightRadar24. And that data says that this airplane was a 28,000 feet going 590 miles an hour on a northwesterly heading, going northwest from Moscow to Tver, then it suddenly stopped. That says that there is something that really went awry here. The airplane was leveled it wasn't climbing or descending. It didn't suddenly fall out of the sky on its own. So when you start piecing things together that is when things really get interesting. So now the real question here, is will Russia play with international agencies and manufacturers worldwide who may have a stake in this? This Embraer airplane was built in Brazil. The avionics likely come out of the United States. Usually, they would be party to an investigation like this. Will Russia bring them into the fold or will they be shut out? That is going to be something that will be very interesting to follow here and if they're shutout, it may lead to the worst possible scenario here that this plane was potentially shot down, Erica.

There was a coup attempt two months ago to basically go after Putin. It was one of the biggest threats he's faced as a leader in the time that he's been a leader of Russia. And then add to that fact that Putin is KGB. He's the KGB agent who has used vengeance to go after those who have in any way crossed him.

Now, he's a criminal defendant with a mugshot.Now, before he went to surrender at the sheriff's office, his legal team was here at the Fulton County courthouse meeting with the district attorney and negotiating the terms of his release. He has a $150,000 bond. He has to post a percentage of that in cash. He's also subject to certain restrictions in order not to be detained. Among those restrictions, he cannot talk about this case with any of his codefendants. Former president Trump is, of course, one of his codefendants in this case.

I mean, that's -- part of the reason why he's not showing up at the debate tonight is because he is so far ahead in the polling and part of that is a surge we saw -- something, you know, Ron DeSantis laments after his first indictment.And so, they certainly do try to juice it and essentially get as much out of it. He's likely going to speak after he turns himself in tomorrow before he gets on the plane to come back to New Jersey. And so, I think when you see that, there's certainly trying to use it. But the other part of this is he's facing four indictments. The legal fees are really piling up that they understand that this is going to be potentially extremely protracted case, they don't know what the future will look like. His attorneys in Georgia, of course, are the ones who are going to be there with him tomorrow. So, certainly, it does weigh on him in that sense. And I think it changes the political calculus, which is, you know, what he has -- what he has said privately and acknowledged privately is that this campaign has a lot to do or mainly almost everything to do with the fact that he is running because of these legal troubles as legal insulation. And so, that's a big part of it, too. Like yes, he enjoys it, yes, to the sense he raises money from it, it boosts his poll numbers but also he feels that he has to essentially because this is his main source of protection when it comes to these trials.",
