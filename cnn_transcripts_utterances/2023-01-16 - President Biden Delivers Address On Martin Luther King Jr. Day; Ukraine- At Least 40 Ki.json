      "sentences": "Hi there, John. Well, look, officially, this is still a search and rescue operation that's going on here. However, the Ukrainian authorities they do acknowledge that as the time goes on, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that they are going to be able to find anybody under this debris who might still be alive.The Ukrainian president says that they are going to continue to search but certainly with as cold as it is and the time passing. They also say that hope is fading very quickly. The Ukrainian say that one of the reasons why the destruction here has been so extensive why this building was essentially annihilated as the Russians use a very powerful cruise missile to hit it. It's called the KH22 and was designed to take out aircraft carrier strike groups. It's got a 2,000 pound warhead and is obviously a very dangerous weapon. Now, the Kremlin has come out and they've denied that they were behind all this. They said they don't target residential and civilian areas. They say they believe that it was a straight Ukrainian Air Defense rocket that hit this building. The Ukrainians not having any of that by the way. They say that they track this rocket, this missile all the way from the Sea of Azov to right here where it hit. The Ukrainian say that at this point in time, they do not have air defense weapons capable of taking a cruise missile like that down, which is why they're calling for more capabilities from the U.S. and from partner nations, of course we know that the Ukrainians are already training on the Patriot air defense missile system, which they hope could give them a chance to take down something like this before it strikes a building like the one you see behind me in the future.
