The judge says Trump did participate in the January 6th insurrection but the ban doesn't apply to presidents. Our Evan Perez has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Judge Sarah Wallace is ordering that Donald Trump's name will appear on the ballot in Colorado. This is a ruling that she just came down. The bottom line for the judge is that the 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which is what these voters were seeking to have enforced, they say -- the judge is saying it's not clear that this applies to the President of the United States or that this President of the United States is covered by that section of the 14th Amendment. It's not clear that the framers, the writers of the -- of that section of the Constitution intended for that to apply to the President of the United States. I'll read you just a part of what the -- that -- the 14th Amendment says. It says that anyone who previously had taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an officer of the United States or as an executive and a judicial officer of any state to support the Constitution of the United States shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof is disqualified from holding office. And so that's what these voters were seeking to have enforced, to have the former president struck from the ballot in Colorado. And the judge says that really -- she can't really enforce that because it's clear to her that, if the framers of the Constitution have intended for that to apply to a President of the United States, then they would have made that much clearer. And so in her view, it does not apply and therefore the president -- the former president will appear on the Colorado ballot. Now this is in line, we should say, with some other challenges that have come forward. There are voters who have brought similar challenges in Minnesota, in Michigan; another sort of fringe candidate has brought a federal lawsuit in New Hampshire. All of these had been tossed aside for exactly this reason. It's not clear that you can bar the former President of the United States simply because of what happened on January 6th. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He has a commanding lead in the polls at 43 percent. And they saw this as an opportunity to try and cut away from some of that. But one big thing that was talked about a lot on Friday was their faith. And at one point some of the candidates shared very personal stories.

But at one point she did say, if she were still South Carolina governor and a bill similar to Iowa's heartbeat bill, which bans most abortions after six weeks, if that kind of bill was brought to her desk as a governor, she would sign it. And so, I think that raised many eyebrows in the room on Friday. Now just one more thing I think really important to point out here, the big elephant in the room on Friday. Donald Trump was not there. He was invited to the event but he chose to skip it and instead host his own rally on Saturday in nearby Fort Dodge.

The whole town has subsided in some areas by more than a meter. And it has ripped the pipes apart.But it is a ghost town at the moment. All the inhabitants have been evacuated and they are only allowed back during daylight to retrieve some of their belongings and so forth. So it's a very uncertain situation at the moment. We have no idea when the people can return to their homes. And this is probably a rather long-term scenario.",

And strain builds up in the crust. And that may happen over a period of up to 700 to 800 years of time.Then we will enter a volcanic active period. So for every eruption we have during the volcanic active period, we have strain relieved. And for every eruption, we will progress toward a dormant period again. So the problem is that this period lasts typically on the order of a few hundreds of years as well. So we have just, by 2021, entered an active period. And that's the status that we're in now.",

There's questions about when he hurt that wrist. He had to leave the Ravens game Thursday night in the second quarter after throwing a touchdown. But there was video of him wearing a sleeve on his wrist getting off the bus when the team got to Baltimore. The NFL is investigating whether the Bengals were in compliance with the league's injury report policy because Burrow was not on the injury report heading into the game. In the NBA in-season tournament, the Lakers putting themselves in position to win their group. LeBron scoring a game high 35 points against the Blazers. L.A. won that 107-95. They could clinch their group with a win at home against the Jazz on Tuesday. It's been exciting so far, Kim, and it will be interesting to see what happens with that tournament. LeBron, maybe he'll be in the first ever in-season tournament finals.",
