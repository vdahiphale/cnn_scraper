He'll make the official campaign announcement at home in South Carolina on Monday. And as noted, we are told the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will officially file his paperwork midweek next week.Here you see the leading names already in, about to get in, and several others who promise decisions relatively soon. Our great reporters are back at the table with me. Let's start with Senator Scott. Everyone else. You have Trump, you have well behind him in the national polls, DeSantis. And then you have everybody else way, way back, and they're trying to find their piece of it.; The New York Times saying this about Senator Scott this morning, \"There is little evidence, so far, that Mr. Scott's message strikes a chord with the populist base of the modern GOP, which for the last several years has been led by a former TV star who likes to fight.\" Again, back to the same conversation we're having about getting at DeSantis and Pence's idea about limited conservative. That's the challenge for these candidates. Which Republican party are you competing in? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Are you appealing to?",

And to be clear, Tim Scott's message is quite different here. I would say even more than -- or not even more, but also it's different than DeSantis as well. While, you know, as my colleagues wrote us, while Trump is talking about, you know, needing to reform law enforcement agencies, he's attacking law enforcement agencies at time with his rhetoric and sowing sort of distrust as well. Tim Scott's message is much more kind of sunny language, Ronald Reagan esque, in a way. So is that also going to appeal to a base that has actually been engaged by Trump's language, which I don't think anyone would describe as sunny.",

He announced he's running for president.And Republicans there were very eager to hear his message, so intrigued by his biography. My question for Senator Scott, though, is biography enough of a message, or does he need something a little bit more than that? And he does have a hopeful, optimistic view. I don't see a lot of demand for that necessarily. But without a doubt, he is going to do this. And I think he's going to have -- you know, he's the only senator running, so he'll have some other support from senators as well. So, you know, Monday at start.",

You can change these numbers by winning Iowa, or surprising in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina. Scott from South Carolina. Nikki Haley, also from South Carolina, the former governor, the former U.N. ambassador. So let's listen to a little bit here. She got into the race. She says, I'm the alternative to Trump. You don't want to go back. She's trying to figure out her place, especially with DeSantis getting so much attention. This is about January 6. Donald Trump calls it a beautiful day. Nikki Haley says, no. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I will say about January 6, I will continue to say it was a terrible day. It was not a beautiful day.

Not just to have a portfolio that had somewhat intractable issues such as the border voting rights, given the current state of Congress, but also when you have an issue that is right in front of the White House to also bring her to the table and have her involved. I have been reporting on the VP for the past, you know, since they came into office now, and I do know that talking to people close to the White House, her allies as well, there does seem to be a bit of a shift, especially after the Roe decision. She's similar to this, had been very outspoken on Roe. Even when officials in the White House were deciding whether to curtail his trip, which they have done, there was discussion about potentially sending the vice president or the secretary of state in his place. That has not happened yet. But you're seeing the conversations about bringing her to the table.",

That's something that on Capitol Hill, many people were like, wow, she can really deliver and land a message which is really important.And I think you did see her start to do this a lot more during the midterm. She went out with a number of House Democratic candidates to try and talk about abortion, have these roundtables in more swingier districts. So it's interesting that they're finally kind of in some ways putting her out there more on messaging that she seems to feel more comfortable with, not immigration, border, all these other bigger things. KANNO-YOUNGS: That being said, absolutely, there were some around the White House that also wanted to see this. I mean, I would often hear they wanted the vice president when the cameras are off behind closed doors, the one that's direct and often almost cross examines her aides to go out and show that. But there were some that thought oftentimes there was a certain cautious approach as well. I do know that talking to some of her allies, at least in the first two years, that there was a concern of being sort of pigeonholed into issues based off of her gender or her glass ceiling kind of breaking role. This one isn't just that, though. This also involves legal expertise. And when you listen to her talk about the abortion -- about abortion, about Roe, she's not just talking about it just like that, but also talking about the legal precedent and what it could set moving forward.",

She would fill out his term.But look, one thing has changed dramatically since the beginning, and that was the Dobb's decision. They could not have anticipated that necessarily. So this gives her a huge space, and as you said, she is natural on that. So there was a reason that Donald Trump, way back in the day, was concerned about her candidacy. She didn't take off in 2020, but she has some raw talent there, and sure intellect, of course, but she's a wild card in this general election. No doubt.",

At the same time, though, there's a new Republican demand for sensitive information from the Pentagon.On hold for now is a House Republican threat to hold the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, in contempt of Congress. That's because the State Department, after months of saying no, will now allow the Republican chairman and the lead Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to view what's called a dissent cable. That cable containing internal State Department debate and, yes, disagreements about how the withdrawal played out. This is video from August 2021. You'll all remember the attack at the Kabul International Airport left 13 U.S. service members dead, along with 170 Afghan civilians. Let's get some insights on this standoff now from Mitchell Zuckoff. He's a professor at Boston University and author of a great book, \"The Secret Gate\", a detailed account of the final days of the U.S. Mission in Afghanistan. Mitch, let's start with the dissent cable. A, what is in it, based on what you know and why is it important and groundbreaking in away, that these lawmakers get to see it?",

But it's more complicated than that.So the dissent cable and the dissent channel at the State Department, it's described by diplomats as an almost sacred vehicle for speaking truth to power. So our far flung diplomats around the world have a way to know that when they face a significant concern, their concerns will be heard and read by the 7th floor, by the secretary's office, and they will be responded to. And so these are fairly rare, only about 120 of them since 1971. And so the secretary was trying to preserve the integrity of this dissent channel by not just releasing this dissent cable from what happened in Afghanistan. But to answer your question, what's likely in it? It's not going to be some kind of smoking gun, we don't think. It's not a who, you know, who, what and when situation. More likely, what we're going to see is a cable or if we see it because it is classified, that says the 23 signatories. These -- the American diplomats understood that what was happening in Afghanistan, what was happening in Kabul, things were worse than people realized that the Kabul government and the Afghanistan military was going to collapse sooner than people expected when this was sent in July of 2021. And so the other thing it probably almost certainly says is that a nonmilitary evacuation should have started sooner. Now, I spoke last night to a government official, current government official, who said, you know, that's all well and good, but that really wouldn't have made a difference even if the contents of this cable had been followed. Because the catastrophe of August of 2021 simply would have been the catastrophe of March 2021. The difference would have been the airport would have been cold instead of hot. But the real meaning here and the real thing we have -- sorry.",

But there was confusion. Couldn't get chain of command issues to whether or not they could take that bomber out.
