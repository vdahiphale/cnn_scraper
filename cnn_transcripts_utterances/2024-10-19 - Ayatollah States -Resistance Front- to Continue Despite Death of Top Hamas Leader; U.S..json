Meanwhile, Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Tehran and its allies will continue their fight against Israel.

They are putting pressure on Hamas to return to the negotiating table in a serious fashion. This is one of the hopes that's been expressed to CNN by Israeli officials. But there are of course, against that to be balanced fears that the return of his remains could lead to a rallying of his supporters. And of course, the question of whether a burial ground too might eventually be used as a focal point for support and further protests.

But after that, he picked up once again.And look, it was a typical stump speech where he talked about immigration. He talked about the economy, he talked about specifically wanting to reinvigorate the U.S. auto industry here in Detroit. But one thing that was interesting that I was watching for was whether he would address some of the comments he had made when he was in the city last week, speaking to the Detroit Economic Club. He had actually insulted Detroit while being in the same city. He didn't do the same thing on Friday but he did almost try to clarify some of that. He said, quote, \"You know Detroit has such great potential. But Kamala and the Democrats have been wreaking havoc on this place.\" He went on to say that they would make -- he would make America -- or, excuse me -- he would make Detroit great once again. And his team had put up some signs around saying, \"Make Detroit great again.\" So clearly leaning into that message and certainly not running away for it. Now just to take a quick step back and give you sense of how important Michigan is to the Trump campaign, not only because it has 15 electoral votes but also because, out of all of the so-called blue wall states that also includes Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in addition to Michigan, Trump's campaign is actually the most confident about this state. And that's why you've really seen him aggressively campaigning here, particularly in the leadup in these final few days until November 5th -- Alayna Treene, CNN, Detroit, Michigan. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This was the first full encirclement of Taiwan by China's Coast Guard, Taipei says, including using a 12,000-ton vessel, one of 17 vessels that Taipei says it detected around it's territorial waters during the drills. They also say China's Coast Guard intruded into restricted waters near Taiwan's outlying Matsu Islands. Now this is not the first time this year that China's Coast Guard has been accused by Taipei of playing an increasingly large role in intimidating the island. It was back in February when China's Coast Guard actually boarded a Taiwanese tourist boat, checked everyone's ID and detained them, giving people quite a scare and sparking an online frenzy here about the role of China's Coast Guard, something that Taipei has long referred to as a gray zone tactic, nonmilitary but nonetheless, coercive and intimidating force sanctioned by Beijing. In addition to the Coast Guard activities near Taiwan, they posted a propaganda image showing the track of the vessels that encircled this self- governing democracy that appeared to be in the shape of a heart. In fact, Chinese propaganda even referred to Taiwan as sweetheart, seen as creepy by some locals here in Taiwan. Taiwan's Coast Guard has called the Chinese Coast Guard actions harassment, not law enforcement. And they say that this is being stepped up at a time that Beijing is trying to put pressure on Taipei while falling short of triggering an actual military confrontation. The Taiwanese Coast Guard even said they intercepted a Chinese smuggler near the outlying Kinmen Islands, another suspected gray zone tactic that they say this island and the world needs to be on the lookout for, because it's not just happening in Taiwan there have also been confrontations between China's Coast Guard and other Coast Guards particularly in the Philippines over disputed shoals there -- Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei.

I think what the Democrats are hoping for is that there's greater levels of enthusiasm, which sometimes polling can't really capture.

They think that four years ago they were better off. And maybe they just find it appealing that he tries to present himself with this sort of macho, super great business owner image or business man image. And that resonates better with them. We can see that, among African American males, Trump is doing much better than Biden was four years ago, than Clinton was and of course Obama was. We can see this with Hispanic males. And Hispanic American males have been drawn to Trump in spite of the fact that he said horrible things about the Hispanic community.

I will continue to love you for the rest of my life.\" Prosecutors in Argentina are continuing their investigation into the death of the 31-year old.
