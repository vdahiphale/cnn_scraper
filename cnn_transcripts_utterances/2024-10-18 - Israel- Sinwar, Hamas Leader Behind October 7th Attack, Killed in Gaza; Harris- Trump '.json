We will warn you now: we're about to show graphic video of what are believed to be his remains. They were found in Rafah in Southern Gaza. Sources say Israeli forces discovered Sinwar's body during a routine operation after a battle with several militants near a building. Hamas has not commented on his killing, but Israel says Sinwar's identity was quickly confirmed through dental records and then DNA testing. CNN, though, cannot confirm those details.

He wasn't responding to pleas and to requests to resume negotiations from the Qataris or from the Egyptians, the two countries that have been mediating these talks over the last year. There are still 101 hostages who are being held by Hamas somewhere in Gaza. And as the Israel Defense Forces revealed yesterday, after Sinwar's death was announced, that his DNA traces were discovered in that tunnel where six of the hostages were recently executed also in that same area in Southern Gaza in the Rafah area. So, the fact is that the hostages are still in Gaza. We need to get them back. And possibly, his removal from the stage could open the door for a possible deal. Now, the question, really, here is going to be, are the Israelis willing to be flexible? Are -- is Hamas willing to be flexible? I think Israel is.

Because they did want to see Israel press ahead with the offensive.And they were very excited yesterday with the news that Sinwar was killed, saying that this proved that the continued military campaign and pressure was successful. But we have to keep in mind that this war has always had its complexities. And because of the existence of the hostages in Gaza, it was always going to be difficult to define exactly what victory is. Was it going to be the depth of Sinwar? Yes, he's been killed, and that's great, that the leader of this terrorist group is out of the way. But we still have 101 people in Gaza. So, we can't yet celebrate victory until we get our people home. And if we had just gotten the people home in a deal, but Sinwar was still alive, in control of Gaza, we would have faced the same problem. We also wouldn't have been able to define victory, Paula. So, the -- the issue remains that we need to find a way that, on the one hand, brings the people home, prevents Hamas from reconstituting itself and retaking control and keeping its control over Gaza. And that requires more than just a military campaign. It requires a deal with Hamas or what's left of Hamas to get the people back. And it also requires working with our international allies here in the region, as well as the Americans and the Europeans, to prevent Hamas from being able to continue to govern the Gaza Strip.",

He was in Brussels Wednesday, where he spoke at a summit of E.U. leaders and a meeting of NATO defense ministers the alliance has promised to allow Ukraine to join.

When police announced Payne's death, they said they were directed to the hotel after a 911 call where they were informed about an aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

When I contacted a spokesperson with the Buenos Aires Police, he declined to clarify those details, instead referring me to the prosecutor's office in Argentina. The prosecutor's office said that Payne's fall could have been accidental, due to the position in which the body was found and from the injuries of the fall. Prosecutors say he may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness. Payne's tragic death has sent shockwaves through the world as millions of fans mourn. To a younger generation, One Direction was like the Beatles. For many young fans, this is the first celebrity death that they have ever experienced. Like other generations, who were gutted over the sudden deaths of stars like Heath Ledger or Kurt Cobain. That is what a big deal Liam Payne was. His family said in a statement that they are heartbroken. The members of One Direction released a statement saying, quote, \"We are completely devastated. In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly.\" Memorials have been planned by fans, including one at Hyde Park in London this Sunday at 2 p.m. A tragic ending to a life lost too soon and certainly one that will spark a conversation about mental health, substance abuse, and the pressures faced by so many young stars in the spotlight.

His cause was to reverse his people's expulsion from their land. By the time of his release in 2011, Sinwar had spent 22 years in jail. His freedom was a seminal moment, traded with more than 1,000 other Palestinian prisoners for just one IDF soldier, Gilad Shalit, snatched five years earlier. It was an object lesson for Sinwar, but he had emerged to a changed reality. Gaza, now cut off from the world by Israel's blockade, rising to become Hamas's overall leader in Gaza.

SINWAR (through translator): I say to the leaders of Arab and Islamic countries, there has to be as strategic change in your path. It is ending normalization, closing the embassies, and supporting the resistance. ROBERTSON (voice-over): During fighting in 2021, the IDF bombed his house. A week later, at a rare press conference, he goaded the IDF to take a second shot, saying he would walk home. He didn't hide, and neither did his fighters ahead of their October 7 attack, their training in plain sight, like Sinwar's comments, misread by the IDF. Opening the door to a war that has become his legacy. Israel's response resulted in the unparalleled killing of tens thousands of Palestinians and the destruction of Gaza. Internationally, it raised a previously unseen, potent pro-Palestinian lobby. If that was Sinwar's strategy, it was succeeding but at great cost. Ultimately, he will be judged in Gaza.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIHAM ZAYID, DISPLACED PALESTINIAN (through translator): When I look at her, I think I might lose her, because there is no medical care here these days. We've gone through it all. I hope God will heal her. SULIMAN AZAB, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): The hardest thing is feeling alone. I feel like no one is helping me. I feel alone and lost in life. We were forced to live in tents with no food or water. We didn't know how to manage. I have five children: three boys and two girls. We had a child during the war. It was a big struggle, especially in terms of milk and other necessities that were unavailable. After the soldiers withdrew from our area, we returned to our house, but we were shocked. The house was in a terrible condition and on the verge of collapse. Still, we decided to stay in it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I thank you for joining us again on what is a sobering morning, especially given all we know that is happening in Gaza.I do want to return to the killing of Yahya Sinwar. You know, in your conversation with my colleague, Christiane Amanpour, yesterday, you suggested that Sinwar will be seen as a hero by some Palestinians. Can you explain to everyone why some may still feel that way, given all the suffering we have seen over the last year? DR. MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI, PRESIDENT, PALESTINIAN NATIONAL INITIATIVE: The issue here is that many Western media outlets -- and I don't negate the real changes in the last few months == most media outlets keep demonizing Palestinians and look at Palestinians from a racist perspective. And the Palestinians who struggle for their freedom are described as terrorists. If -- what is terrorist? Who -- how can you describe a person as a terrorist, even civilians? I= In this case, the largest and the biggest terrorist will be Netanyahu and his government who killed 52,000 Palestinians. Yes, Netanyahu would be -- Yahya Sinwar would be perceived as a hero, because he died fighting for his people. That's how he will be perceived. And all the lies about him from the side of Israel were discovered. They used to claim that he's hiding in a tunnel sending other people to die. Now he was killed in a fight, open fight on the ground. They used to claim that he and his fighters are hiding behind civilians, taking them as -- as human shields. That was not true. He was fighting face to face the Israeli soldiers. And finally, they used to say that he's hiding behind Israeli captives, which was not true. But Doctor -- but Dr. Barghouti, he has -- he has indisputably, claims himself to be the mastermind of this attack. While we listen to the parents in Gaza, who continue to suffer, just trying to feed their children every day, do you not have to ask that, for Sinwar to still be portrayed as a hero. Can you explain why those parents, some of them, may still feel that way?",

And the real aggressor here and the real responsible side for all the suffering of the Palestinians now in Gaza is the Israeli aggression, which doesn't stop and actually continues. On the other hand, it is very important to remember that the story here did not start on the 7th of October. If you look at the life of Sinwar himself, you can find a lot of things. First of all, he was a refugee. He was a descendant of a refugee family that were displaced in 1948. Then he was occupied by the Israeli army in the longest modern occupation, the longest occupation in modern history of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And he was subjected to oppression. And then he was imprisoned for 22 years for participating in resistance. This is his story, and it's, in a way, a story of the people. So, the 7th of October was not the beginning, was not the cause. It was the result, the outcome of ethnic cleansing, of long occupation, of oppression. And of course, we don't want violence to continue. But I want to tell you that Sinwar himself was convinced with nonviolence. I personally debated that with him. And for five years, Hamas stuck to nonviolent resistance. What was the result? Israeli more aggression.",

But I do want to get to the point of, now that we have the sober light of the next day, given that he is dead now, do you believe that this could make a ceasefire more likely?

Yet, paychecks are shrinking, from more than 1,000 U.S. dollars a month in 2018 to less than $950 a month in 2023.
