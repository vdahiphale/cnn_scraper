And through our own research, using social media and so on, have gotten some firsthand witness testimony from others who were in the bomb shelter with our son. And what we learned from them is from about 7:30 in the morning when they got in there, very quickly thereafter, they came under heavy fire, gunfire, and grenades.

Look, our Israeli counterparts just a day or so ago said the same thing that we're saying. But we haven't seen any direct evidence that Iran participated in these particular attacks.Now, we do know -- of course, there is a degree of complicity here, Poppy, because they have been supporting Hamas for years. Tools, training, resourcing, certainly rhetorical support in just the last 24 hours. But no specific evidence that they were participating in this, resourcing this, planning these series of attacks.",

In 2021, I think the administration relied heavily on Egypt in terms of being, kind of, a middle person or is somebody, an interlocutor in the situation that was happening then in the Middle East. I know Qatar has offered or played a role in, at least, in early-stage discussion related to some of the hostages. How does that work from the U.S. side? What's the involvement of the U.S. and the administration?",
