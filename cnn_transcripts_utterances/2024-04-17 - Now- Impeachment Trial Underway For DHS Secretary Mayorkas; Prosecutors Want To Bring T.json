In just 15 minutes or so, I'm going to be join live by the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, who is fighting for his political survival and facing growing pressure from his far-right flank. Speaker Johnson announced this afternoon, he's sticking with his plan to put funding for key allies such as Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine on the House floor this Saturday after members have had 72 hours first to read the legislation. At least two hard line Republicans say this move, putting this on the floor for a vote, will cost Speaker Johnson his job. Now, there are some murmurs that Democrats might be willing to step in and vote to keep Johnson in power. Is that something that Speaker Johnson would welcome? Nothing is going to be off limits when he joins me live ahead. On the others side of the Capitol, the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is looking as if it will meet a quick demise. The trial in the Senate officially began just this afternoon, according, but the Democratically-controlled Senate has already voted to dismiss one of the two articles against Mayorkas with a vote on killing the second one set to start any minute. Mayorkas, as you know, became the very first cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years. In a vote led by House Republicans, but not even the entire Senate Republican conference appears on the same page, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, told \"Axios\" today, quote, I don't believe there's a constitutional standard met, unquote. Let's go straight to our reporters covering all the drama happening right now on Capitol Hill. CNN's Lauren Fox and Melanie Zanona. Melanie, first to you, the Senate showdown going on over U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas impeachment trial, the first cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years. Melanie, are there any signs to suggest this trial is going to go forward the way Republicans wanted to?",

All he's doing is putting this on the floor, but they are frustrated, they are mad, specifically because this package, despite the fact that it's divided into three parts, really does look a lot like the Senate-passed supplemental package that passed back this winter it, and that is because it includes about $95 billion, and $61 billion specifically for Ukraine. Now there's about a $10 billion loan aspect to this, but even that is forgivable and the administration can make that decision unilaterally. So what hardliners are arguing here is that Johnson is not fighting in hard enough. Now the reality for Johnson is that there was no Ukraine package that he was ever going to be able to put on the floor of the House that was going to satisfy someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene. Of course, the difference now is that Greene has an ally in Thomas Massie and other conservative who was already vowing to vote with her to oust Johnson if she moves to do that on the floor. Now, she has not said precisely when or even if she is definitely going to move to try to vacate him from his speakership.

But in a brand new filing, I have right here, prosecutors are gearing up for the former president to potentially take the stand as he has pledged he would do. They are doing so by highlighting Donald Trump's past, quote, misconduct and criminal acts, so that they can question him about them. This is part of what's called a Sandoval brief, I believe. Joining us down to discuss, former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams and Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who is the former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan -- in the Manhattan district attorney's office. That's the office prosecuting Donald Trump, but she's not part of the prosecution. So, Karen, let me start with you. So, Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the hush money case, he's ultimately going to get to decide if prosecutors can bring up any of these past legal issues. And again, this isn't the prosecution being jerks. This is -- if they're ever going to break going up, anything, if Trump testifies and they want to impeach his credibility and they're going to bring up previous legal acts. They have to file this so the prosecution is just doing this as required by law. That said, let's dive in. The first item on their list is Trump's recent civil fraud trial from the New York attorney general where the judge found that Trump did falsify business records and lie about the value of his assets, and the judge ordered him to pay $355 million.
