      "sentences": "Hello and welcome everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. It is now Monday morning in Israel. Hamas claiming to be holding more than 100 people hostage in Gaza, including high ranking Israeli officers. An announcement coming just hours after the militants launched a major missile attack on Ashkelon in southern Israel. You're looking at aftermath of that strike.Israeli police say an apartment building there received a direct hit. The death toll in Israel is now past 700 people. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowing vengeance with Israel responding by pounding Gaza with airstrikes. The Palestinian health ministry says more than 400 Palestinians have been killed in those strikes. And we need to tell you this next image is disturbing. Some of the first known victims of this assault were at a music festival. Israeli officials say at least 260 bodies have been found at the venue near the Gaza border killed by Hamas forces. Joining me now is CNN Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward, good to see again Clarissa. Tell us what you've been seeing and hearing and what you expect over the next 24 hours. Where could this head next?",

      "sentences": "Well, Michael, it really, it just hasn't stopped for a moment. It's pretty extraordinary. We hear drones in the background, we hear very loud booms, jets overhead, series of bright orange flashes from that direction as there has just been an endless onslaught of strikes on the Gaza Strip.When we arrived here in Ashkelon, earlier in the night around midnight, or just after there was a large barrage of Hamas rockets. Most of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome, but a couple of them did get through, one of them reportedly hitting a bus stop the other one, hitting a building not far from here. So make no mistake, there has been a steady uptick in the tempo. I think the question now in terms of what happens for the next 24 hours is, are Israeli forces able to effectively eliminate the remaining Hamas militants who have been able to infiltrate across that border and really cause a lot of chaos and mayhem and bloodshed here, not just on Saturday, but all throughout Sunday, as well. At least seven skirmishes reported between those militants and Israeli forces. We were actually driving near the Gaza border and had to turn around because of a firefight between the Israeli military and alleged Hamas militants. So clearly, this is the priority of the highest order. But of course, very closely behind it, if not equal to that is the quest for Israel to try to return these scores of hostages. We don't know how many are alive, how many might be dead, where they're being held, or how they will be returned. Michael?",

Israel is still counting its dead. You spoke about before the 260 or 270 bodies that were picked up just at that rave that took place outside of the Gaza Strip.

Every -- every life in the world is precious, but Israel will have to fight to get those people back and will have to pay a painful cost.

Israel thought that it could throw economic incentives that occasionally it will have rounds of violence with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, they'll hit us will hit them. And that'll happen every couple of years. And will -- Israel will, you know, Palestinians will come from Gaza into Israel for work, and the world's will invest money in the World Bank and infrastructure in Gaza.And we'll be able to contain that situation, that situation cannot be contained. As we saw on Saturday and even yesterday, as these pockets of terrorists were still fighting inside Israel, what they have carried out is a murderous rampage that cannot be contained. And unfortunately, they forced Israel's hand, it has no choice now, but to go into the Gaza Strip, and hurt and weaken Hamas. The overall, the bigger picture of the two-state solution is one that unfortunately, Michael the Palestinians have consistently rejected any prospect of a of a resolution for the last 30 years since the Oslo accords were signed just in September of 1993 in that famous signature and peace ceremony at the White House, and have embarked once again on a palace -- on a terrorist war against Israel and Israel is forced to defend itself.",

And Israel wants to make sure that Hezbollah does not enter into this conflict, because if they do, Michael, the amount of firepower that Hezbollah has, because of what Iran has given it, is astounding. It's something that we cannot imagine, it's over 100,000 rockets and missiles of all ranges and warheads and types and sizes that can strike anywhere inside Israel.

And let's remember, Netanyahu has made a name for himself throughout his career, definitely over the last 15- 16 years during which he served mostly as Prime Minister as Mr. Security. Well, he's not looking like Mr. Security right now. After the failures that led to this intelligence, just drop of not knowing what Hamas was preparing, their ability to invade Israel to cross off the border defenses, and the slow military response, Israel is now regrouping.

They've -- they've been striking what they say are hundreds of Hamas targets. They're striking what they say are senior Hamas leaders. We've obviously seen some several buildings being destroyed in Gaza. We know that the death toll there has been rising as well.

Hands appear to be bound and in captivity.And Hamas claims the hostages are distributed across the strip Israel believes to be used as human shields. Still, Israel's military is pressing on. With air assaults already underway, the IDF says it is preparing for a potential ground incursion and that all options are on the table. [22:40:00] 1000s of Israeli reservists have been called up for the task. Israel's army telling Gazans to clear the way for operations, ordering families to leave their homes and providing locations for evacuation. But with the conflict shortly engulfed the whole of the strip, for most there is no way out. Gaza is largely isolated from the world by an Israeli air, land and sea blockade and Egypt's southern border closure. Electricity, which is mostly provided by Israel was cut off to the enclave and internet disrupted. Unclear how long services will be severed. And with Hamas leadership reportedly going underground, the 2 million people living in the 140 square mile territory have nowhere to turn. Fears that an unprecedented attack on Israel could yield unprecedented bloodshed in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So every strike carries the risk of more civilian casualties, more than 400 people killed, according to the Palestinian health ministry with hundreds more wounded and again, this is expected to take some time and Prime Minister Netanyahu nowhere near that goal of breaking the back of Hamas.It was only a few hours ago that the group claimed it was able to fire yet another barrage of rockets at Israel. And it claims that on Sunday, it took more hostages. I mean, this is horrifying, of course for the families.

But what shifts exactly? Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu has said and you heard in that soundbite that he will devastate Hamas, that he will turn it into an island of ruins, a really terrifying statement there that he will go everywhere in Gaza. But it's not simple, Michael, as you know, Hamas is deeply entrenched in that enclave. They have absolutely prepared for the aftermath of this attack. There are no Israeli troops, Israeli troop presence so far on the ground and then you have to remember of course, those hostages that means a ground incursion, air assaults, any military action carries the potential risk of putting those hostages lives in the crosshairs. And then there's the 2 million people living there in Gaza with nowhere to go. Yes, Hamas leadership can go underground.

Settler extremism and so on.They've just basically kept a lid on things with incursions and arrests in the West Bank and left Gaza alone in many ways, deprioritized it? Would you agree with that? WRIGHT: Absolutely. Iran, sorry, Israel has basically tried to circumvent the tensions with the Palestinians, both in the West Bank and in Gaza. It's been focused very heavily on its domestic crisis and the political polarization. But it also has given more attention to the region, bettering relations with Arab states, trying to engage in a kind of shadow war with Iranian forces in the region. And it hasn't paid attention to the issue, the root cause of all the conflicts in the Middle East since 1948. And I think that's a strategic mistake.",
