But he does have a reputation for giving stiff sentences. We anticipate hearing victim impact statements. The attorneys will make their cases on what the sentencing should be, and then Alex Murdaugh will go to prison for the death, the murders of his wife and his son.

One thing they talked about last night, this is going to be a major piece of the cleanup here, there are two tracks, at least two tracks that run through there. Today they have already started as there is heavy equipment on the south tracks right now. They are going to start pulling up those south tracks, excavating those hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic material under those tracks, lay down new soil and then put those tracks back on and then do the same thing on the north side. That is going to take some time. Testing for dioxins is also being to happen. This is something that people asked for. EPA and the state's environmental protection entities have been testing for the chemicals that were on the train but they had not been testing for dioxins. Dioxins form when you burn plastic materials or other materials. It is harmful to humans and people have been very concerned about that. EPA now has a plan to test for dioxins, which is difficult to do because they are everywhere all the time, but they're going to test a very wide area to see if they can figure out if there is a higher level here. But all of this is going to take time. The tracks themselves, officials saying it will take to the end of April before those south and north end tracks are pulled up, the soil removed.
