And the tactical teams, local law enforcement tactical teams are now gone. And now notably, this movement happen moments after Trump posted on Truth Social, saying he was shot in with a bullet that pierce the upper part of my right year. He said he knew immediately that something was its wrong. He heard a whizzing sound shots and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. He said much bleeding took place and then he realized what was happening. And when we saw with that video of the former president being shot as he was speaking, it was shocking. But what wasn't shocking is what Secret Service did in the immediate aftermath immediately getting him to safety. The U.S. Secret Service trains and prepares for this exact type of scenario. And about seven days in advance of any movement of a Secret Service protectee, whether that's a president or a former president, first lady, Secret Service teams get there in advance and they plan for this exact type of thing. They know exactly where the nearest trauma center is, where the nearest hospital and know the exact motorcade route to that hospital.

We walked over here from the rally location.This is building behind me is just outside where the rally was and we came over because we noticed this very massive police presence. I counted at least a dozen police cars, one ambulance, some of the police cars were with the sheriff's office, some were with state troopers. I spoke to one off for certain asked him what was the focus. Why is the police so heavily focused on this area? They would not tell me the exact reasoning. And so, we're standing by here to see what exactly is happening here. And then for your question, Anderson, just about the rally, I've spoken with many people. We were inside, but I've spoken with mentally attendees who were inside as well. All of them telling me how shaken up they are, how harrowing that experience was. It was very chaotic inside the venue at the time, I can tell you. It was very unclear what was happening. Donald Trump has just a few minutes into his remarks when we started to hear loud banging from the right side of the stage. And that's when everyone was told to get down. People were screaming. I know you have some video of that, but -- very, very scary experience and also just to -- I forgot something want to share with you. So we know from three sources that the shooter was from outside of the venue, and so we're kind of scoping out the scene outside of the perimeter of the rally to figure out as much so we can -- Anderson.",

The people that I've spoken with said they'd seen some of the snipers pointing their guns outside of the rally. So again, we know that the shooter was from outside. It's very clear how far.We're trying to get as much information as we can.

There are photos that are circulating that appear to show a body on top of a roof. Again, that matches what the Secret Service has said in their statements, just in the last few minutes saying that a person fired multiple shots at the former president from a location that is from a raise location outside of the venue where the rally was happening. Again, that seems to match what Alayna is watching right there behind her. So that's what we know at this hour. Anderson, The other thing that I think this raises obviously, is the ongoing investigation. They're going to -- they know exactly who this person is by that by now and they're going to do the necessary work to figure out everything about that person's background, to find out any political beliefs, obviously, any anything that could explain the motivations given the fact that we do not have a suspect alive now at this point according to the Secret Service.

Tonight, this nation faces once again the consequences of lawlessness, hatred, and unreasoned in its midst. It would be wrong. It would be self deceptive to ignore the connection between that lawlessness and hatred and this act of violence.That was Lyndon Johnson in June of 1968. A few years later, another presidential candidate was attacked. In 1972, George Wallace was gunned down. He survived, but he was paralyzed. We have had very violent political contests before, and it's something we ought to remember. We are capable of this as a nation. The people who do it, of course, are outliers, but they are a product of the extremism and the anger and the hatred that sometime pulses through our elections. So, tonight is a terrible reminder of another period in our history. But it's something that seems to be bred in the bone and I can understand Scott's anger and sadness. I feel it, too. I feel it for everyone. I feel it for everyone in our country because the gunman attacked democracy. When you use a gun to eliminate a choice for the American people, you are shooting democracy. You are playing god. And this is not the first time it has been done in our history. I hope it's the last but one cannot say, but it is one of those moments when we are reminded that our democracy is fragile, and that we as a people need to come together, understand that our past has been violent, and recognize that we have to stand up now and try to end the violence.

There was a small crowd gathering here as well, pretty peaceful, some supporters, others just coming here to see what is going on. But we understand from the spokesperson for the New York City mayor, Mayor Eric Adams, that the mayor has been briefed on the situation, that he is praying for the safety of the former president, but out of an abundance of caution, as I said, they have increased police patrols here at Trump Tower and elsewhere around the city that. Those other areas include 40 Wall Street, also Foley Square, which is also known as Federal Plaza. That's an area where a lot of people tend to come and protest.

What's going to be really interesting -- and this is how were going to know whether it was hit by ricochet or a fragment, or a graze wound is what did they recover from that wound? Is there a piece of a metal jacket from around that was fired that they have that they took out of the president where that cut is above the ear, or did the projectile continue on?

And also JFK, Donald Trump himself is also one of those. I mean, I've been to dozens of these rallies. This is outside obviously, the security perimeter is different, but you go through Secret Service security to go into any rally like this. You go through a magnetometer. You have that instance. I should note what I'm hearing from a lot of them its questions about the security here and what happened and how something like this could happen because it does seem on thinkable I think. And the House Oversight Chair James Comer just put out a statement saying that he has reached out to Secret Service director. He is requesting briefings.

And then he's whisked off stage. He pumped his fist as you can see here in this photo right now, I was told that as he was taken down into the motorcade before he was taken to the hospital there in Butler, Pennsylvania.

You can see it in the photos the people who were there took in the videos that they took.You see the counter snipers on there. You can see them anytime Trump is somewhere, you often see them. I think also the question and what were hearing tonight, you've mentioned the Republican convention that is starting in Milwaukee on Monday, where Trump and many of his surrogates were slated to travel to as soon as tomorrow, we are told it is still expected to go before and well see if that changes as the as the night progresses and as this investigation is getting underway. But security was already an issue there. The footprint, the RNC wanted it to be wider than what it was.

In fact, just a few moments ago, a statement plus sent out from the top senior advisors to the Trump campaign. Let me read a part of that.It says: President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th president of the United States. As our party's nominee, President Trump will continue to share his vision to make America great again. That assigned by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, as well as the chairman of the Republican National Committee. So, Wolf, the convention is on, but this will be no ordinary convention. This is no ordinary moment in our political discourse here, 115 days remain until the end of this campaign, and they are entirely different now than we thought just a few hours ago. A few examples are these, the Biden campaign has suspended its advertising. They are not advertising in Pennsylvania or other battleground states. The president, of course, we saw earlier tonight saying that this type of political violence has no place. Former presidents have weighed in. We've heard from a former President George W. Bush, former President Barack Obama all saying that -- with President Bush calling it a cowardly attack, President Obama's, and that there's no place for this type of violence in American politics. So, Wolf, we have now, we never know what presidential campaigns will be about. They changed throughout the course of the campaigns. Now, violence and this will be a central part of the conversation here. But Republicans gather in Milwaukee on Monday to nominate Donald Trump. We do not know exactly when he will be traveling there. He was scheduled to go tomorrow. That schedule could change. We shall see. He also has the biggest decision yet of his campaign to announce his vice presidential running mate. We expect that to happen on Monday, if not before then. So, Wolf, this certainly changes the presidential campaign in front of us tonight. But the Republican convention is still going on, on Monday.",

And, Wolf, if we all know Secret Service agents, we've covered the White House and talking with one former one this evening, this is something that is their biggest fear. They take their jobs so seriously, Republican or Democrat, it does not matter. You elect, we protect, that is their motto.

It's really important that -- that the president -- first of all, that President Trump fully recover and that both conventions provide an opportunity for healing.
