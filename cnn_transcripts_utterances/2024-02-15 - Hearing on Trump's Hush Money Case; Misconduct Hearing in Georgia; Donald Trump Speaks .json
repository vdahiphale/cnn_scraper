The so-called hush money case. He's being charged with dozens of felonies related to falsifying business records in an effort to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star, ahead of the 2016 election. We've been focused mostly on the federal trials because the federal trial, that election subversion trial, was on the calendar first.But right now, Kaitlan, this is scheduled for March 25th. And what we're watching for today is, does that stick? Because if that sticks, and the Supreme Court doesn't intervene to change Jack Smith's calendar, then this could be the first criminal trial he faces. Now, the Trump team may also try to drag this out. There are certain appeals, certain arguments they might want to make here to drag this out.

Michael Cohen is the star witness here, Trump's former fixer. And the essence of this case is that the reason it is a crime and the reason that the district attorney believes Trump, you know, should face the consequences here is that because he covered it up that it counts as an illegal campaign contribution, by falsifying those business records that it upgrades it to that. That's a theory that his attorneys have been pushing back on.",

This is a far more serious thing for him because he's facing dozens of felony counts. It suggests that maybe he's taking this more seriously. But let's wait and see, Kaitlan, because we know when it comes to court in New York, he tends to act up. He doesn't follow the rules. We've seen this in the two civil cases over the past few months. He spars with the judge. Something no other defendant in their right mind would ever do. And then when the judge pushes back, he throws up his arms and said, this whole system is rigged. So, I'm really curious to see how he handles this because this is a criminal proceeding. This is serious. Is he here to take it seriously, or is he here to turn it into a campaign and be a loud martyr?",

And there are 14 remaining co- defendant. She is the DA in Fulton County. She's the one who brought the RICO case against Donald Trump and 18 other co-defendants. She hired Nathan Wade as the special prosecutor to oversee the case. Now, it's important to note, Wade has little prosecutorial experience. That will not be at issue today. He's never tried a felony RICO case. That won't be an issue today. What will be an issue today is they have admitted to having a romantic relationship. The problem with that? Well, she is now accused of financially benefiting from it. And there have been a host of different motions filed to try to disqualify her from it, to try to get this entire case thrown out as well. Nathan Wade has earned more than $650,000 from working on this case. And those defendants and co-defendants are trying to seize on the opportunity. Trump has said that Wade has used that money to take Willis on several lavish vacations. Other defendants had the same thing about the issue. It's a matter of extraordinary consequence. And I want to bring in CNN's Nick Valencia here because this is not just a matter of an overall mess, or someone trying to suggest, Nick, that this is somehow salacious details.

We could learn by the end of today if there is a trial date in any of these cases, or if they will be pushed out perhaps even indefinitely.OK, on the other side of your screen from me, pictures from the courthouse here in New York. Let's get back to Kaitlan Collins, who's standing by outside there. We see a huge law enforcement presence there, Kaitlan, not far from where you're standing right now. Is there an expectation that Trump wants to be seen or heard before this hearing begins?",

He did not speak then initially, but then he spoke after he had left.Of course, a lot has happened since then, John. We've seen multiple indictments and multiple moments where he has been inside the courthouse, especially when it comes to this civil trial. That's a big question that we have facing the former president tomorrow where he did choose to speak to reporters. And so that's a key question here. I'll tell you what it looks like outside of the courthouse, when you do see that there is a massive law enforcement presence here, obviously not surprising given the former president is here, but also some protesters are here. Not really more than a handful, a dozen or so. We've seen previously before where there have been a slew of protesters here. So, we'll continue monitoring that as well. And, Paula Reid, you know, when we look at this and the nature of this case, I think one thing that stands out is even if it doesn't pose the biggest threat when it comes to if there's a prison sentence or what the ramifications are, this is very sensitive for the former president because of what it involves. And, obviously, we covered the Trump White House together.",

Here, you know, this alleged affair with a porn star. Maybe questionable business practices. I say that because just about a block away, of course, we just went through a month's long civil trial were he -- his business, the Trump Organization, and former President Trump, were found liable for fraud. And actually tomorrow we're going to hear about the penalties and whether they can even still do business in the state of New York.So, this case brings up a lot of those issues and it brings back people like Michael Cohen, his longtime personal attorney, consigliere, turned nemesis, right? Michael Cohen testified before Congress, which became the genesis of a lot of the cases that we've seen here in New York. And Michael Cohen does not miss an opportunity to insult or speak out against the former president and his family. He could potentially be testifying in this case. So, like you said, it's very sensitive. The allegations go back to 2015, 2016, 2017. And it's likely something that the former president would not want to have dredged up in the heat of campaign season.",

I mean the fact that Paula and I are sitting here as Trump is preparing to go inside to find out what the date of this is going to look like. Laura in Atlanta, waiting to see the outcome of that hearing there in the state charges in Georgia against Trump, but also the decision looming tomorrow. You know, we look at this big picture of all of the legal cases and legal issues surrounding the former president, which he is spending a ton of money on, it's a really critical 48 hours that we are in right now of what we could see the outcome of several of these cases for a former president who, even before he took the White House, had spent decades, you know, abating lawsuits and that. And we could hear from him inside this courthouse any moment when he walks through those two double doors that you see there.",

He is the lead prosecutor in the case. Now, the allegations here are -- some of which are admitted to, is that he has a relationship with Fulton County DA Fani Willis. A personal relationship. And what has been alleged by some attorneys from the defense is that he was hired in some way to benefit her and that she has somehow benefited financially from the payments he has received in this case. And today one of the things they will discuss is when that relationship started and what's taken place since their personal relationship started. Over at that table right there you are looking at some of the many attorneys who are there for the defense clients. Remember how many there are there. This room you're looking at right there was filled with attorneys. With us now, CNN's senior legal analyst, former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Elie Honig, CNN legal analyst -- hang on one second here, guys. Donald Trump has arrived at this other ring that we're watching today. The courthouse in New York. Let's listen to see if he talks.",
