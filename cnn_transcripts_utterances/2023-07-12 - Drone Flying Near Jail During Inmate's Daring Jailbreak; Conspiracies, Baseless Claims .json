But, first, we begin with a nationwide manhunt after a dramatic jailbreak. And tonight, we're learning about a suspicious coincidence around the time of the escape. And the inmate's name Michael Burham. Apparently, he tied bed sheets together to climb down from the roof of a Pennsylvania jail last week. Yes, bed sheets. We're told the murder suspect is a self-taught survivalist who may indeed be hiding in the woods. And as this search intensifies, investigators are now saying a drone was seen flying near the jail just before he escaped. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: I'm not a big believer in coincidences. But what I would tell you is that just prior to the escape, there was a drone flying in that area. It could be that there is a perfectly innocent and reasonable explanation. It could also be that it was somehow connected to his escape. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These are several bed sheets that were tied together in these very specific and kind of tight knots that he had to use to climb down three stories. So, this isn't two bed sheets, this isn't one bed sheet. These are several bed sheets that would indicate that perhaps he was stockpiling them. And then the other thing that we learned today which is significant is that there's some security concerns at this jail. There was a hole in this fence. There was construction going on and there were some issues with the fence.

And that letter estimated, it was a broad range, it said, we'll have about, we think, 700 to 1,200 cases.And he emphasized over and over -- I have part of the letter from Bloomberg -- he said, it's incredibly difficult to predict future cases given the nature and complexity of the investigation.

They're deciding whether to pay their light bill or, you know, use that money for their abortion and their travel. And we're seeing doctors who are so afraid of being prosecuted, even in cases where the abortion would clearly fall under an exception. The fetus had absolutely no chance of surviving. The patient was literally bleeding out near sepsis.
