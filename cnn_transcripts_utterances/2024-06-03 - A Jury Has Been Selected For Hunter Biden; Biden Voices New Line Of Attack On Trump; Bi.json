      "sentences": "Tonight, drugs, a gun, a document, and an alleged lie. Another historic trial. This time, the president's son. So just who are the 12 jurors who will decide Hunter Biden's fate?Plus, President Biden tries out a new, tougher message against Trump, but not to the public. What he just told a group of donors. And it was the foul seen round the world, but it has now become something a little bit more, hasn't it? The new twist in the Caitlin Clark story, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" All right, stop me if you've heard any of these statements before. The case is an unusual prosecution that -- quote -- \"would not have been filed against anyone else.\" It's the result of prosecutors having -- quote -- \"bowed to political pressure.\" And the entire thing is -- quote, unquote -- \"politically-motivated.\" Can you guess which case I'm talking about? No, it's not Donald Trump's conviction in Manhattan, though all of those things have been said about that case as well. I'm talking about Hunter Biden's trial in Wilmington, Delaware which continues just hours from now with opening statements. And all of those things that have been said about the case by Hunter Biden's own attorney, Abbe Lowell, I've just said. Now, the case, though, it could not be more different than the one involving Trump. Hunter Biden is charged with lying about his drug use when he filled out a form to purchase a gun back in 2018 and possessing the gun illegally. In the form, Hunter apparently or allegedly checked the no box when asked if he is an unlawful user of any controlled substance. And prosecutors, they say that was a lie. Now, Hunter Biden's long history of addiction will be central to this very case, and we actually saw that on full display during jury selection today. They've got six men, six women, who were ultimately seated, but only after several potential jurors were questioned about their views on addiction. At least six of those who were seated have a friend or relative or have themselves dealt with substance or alcohol abuse. And there's another pretty big difference. Unlike Donald Trump, who has consistently attacked the justice system, President Biden hasn't said anything along those lines for the case against his son, and say he has been expressing support instead, he says, as a father. Now, he went to Wilmington, Delaware this weekend to be with his son ahead of the trial. And he wasn't in the courthouse, let alone the actual courtroom, but Dr. Jill Biden, the first lady, she was there. And in a statement, the president said this: \"As the president, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\" Now, this trial will -- will publicize some pretty salacious details about Hunter Biden. And if the other historic trial is any indication, its outcome here could either be a political drag or a buoy on his father in this very critical election year. Let's get right to Devlin Barrett. He's a law enforcement reporter for \"The Washington Post.\" He was also in court today for Hunter Biden's trial. Just as you got a reprieve from the other trial in Manhattan, there you are now in this one. You got to tell me, what was it like today? What was Hunter's demeanor during the jury selection? They wanted to delay this trial unsuccessfully, of course.",
