Buildings in Rafah, Khan Younis, central Gaza and Gaza City were also struck including several residential homes.Senior Israeli official tells CNN there will be no ceasefire while trying to arrange hostage release, saying humanitarian efforts cannot interfere with the mission to dismantle Hamas.

It says it's been targeting to both Hamas and the smaller militant group of Islamic Jihad, some of those with militants inside. It says it's been targeting military compounds and observation posts and also anti- tank missile cells.So more than 320 targets, which would seem to tally with our Nic Robertson's reporting that this seemed to be the heaviest bombardment that he'd heard going on in the northern Gaza Strip since Israel started these airstrikes against Hamas following that October 7 terrorist attack. So that's from the Israeli side. We're also hearing from Palestinian doctors and officials at the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip saying that 26 people were killed in overnight strikes. So, no letup in the airstrikes. As far as the ground invasion goes, one other line that we got from the IDF in the last few minutes is that it was also targeting assets that were, in its words, posing a threat to forces in the surrounding area who are preparing for ground operations. So, yet more evidence that Israel is preparing for a ground operation if we needed it. We still clearly don't know when Israel is going to go in. But this drumbeat has been growing louder over the past week. We've heard from the chief of the general staff telling troops that they will be going into Gaza. We've seen this ramping up of air strikes. And we also had, of course, that first clash inside the Gaza Strip between the IDF and Hamas militants, in which militants fired an anti-tank missile towards Israeli troops who were operating an engineering vehicle according to the IDF, killing one IDF soldier, and injuring three. So, we don't know precisely when it's going to happen, but it does now seem that we are closer than ever, that we are on the cusp of the start of this ground operation, Rosemary.",

Then after that, you could possibly see that a fairly major ground incursion into the north of Gaza.The Israeli foreign minister is talking about annexing parts of Gaza after this ends. It's possible that they may say, annex Gaza City and push everybody down south into the southern part of the Gaza Strip. That simply highlights that the problem is, is that before there's a ground war, you would expect that the Israelis would know how the ground war will end and what peace they want after the war. At the present time, we have no idea of the peace after the war. The Israelis are simply saying that they will destroy Hamas. But when Hamas goes, there's probably a dozen other groups who will take their place. So that doesn't seem a terribly useful ground war aimed.

These have now become overcrowded shelters with no privacy, no locks, one toilet for several hundred or even thousand people, situation's very, very dire. So, 20 and 14 trucks are a welcome gesture. But as a reminder, before this conflict, over 100 trucks of humanitarian aid and fuel used to come in. And here, I really must insist on the fuel. No fuel has come into Gaza for the last two weeks.

You should separate the women and children from the men, and you should remove any implement that they might be able to use to kill themselves. So, it also says to force them into compliance with electric shocks.

I mean, Hamas may have plans to take hostages into Gaza but the documents describe having a standoff almost certainly that was supposed to take place in Israeli territory so that they I think were probably surprised at their great fortune that they were able to get so many hostages and bring them back to Gaza where they have to be even more leeway with how they can handle them.",

There are very serious issues with respect to foreign policy. We have the Ukraine crisis, we have the crisis in the Middle East, and of course November 17th, which truly is just around the corner, is when we need to pass a bill to keep the government open, to keep it functioning.And we know what happens if our federal government shuts down. And that truly would be a problem for many Americans. That is not an abstract concept. That would have concrete and really dire impacts. So who is it going to be and how will this person garner the support? I think the person would really again have to explain that it not only looks like House Republicans are in chaos, but it's going to look like this to the voters. And that they are going to have to make compromises. I also think the person will have to be strong enough not to make promises that he or she cannot keep because that really was part of Kevin McCarthy's downfall, he made so many promises to so many people and they were competing and conflicting. He really could not make everybody happy.",
