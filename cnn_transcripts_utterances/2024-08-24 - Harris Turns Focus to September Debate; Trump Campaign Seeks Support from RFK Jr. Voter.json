But it was really a love fest between them last night at this event in Arizona.Still, it's unclear to me that Kennedy is dropping out is going to have a huge impact on the race. I think different polls seem to disagree about whether Kennedy was siphoning off more votes from Harris or Trump. And there's also some evidence that Kennedy backers are less likely to vote overall. Plus, I think Kennedy's poll numbers have really dropped in recent months. Earlier this year, some polls had him at around 15 percent or so. More recent numbers seem like 5 percent to 6 percent. There something to be said about breaking up the two two-party monopoly but you would have thought that, this year of any year, a third-party candidate would have been able to break through.

They have so far indicated that they are unhappy with the bridging proposal that was put forward by the United States, the details of which have been talked about within some of the technical meetings.And you referenced Israel's new position on the Philadelphi corridor, the 8.5 mile border between Gaza and Egypt, that Israel has proposed and provided mapping and details to show that it will put fewer troops along that border. That seems to be part of the technical discussions and the Egyptian interlocutors have said that they will put that to Hamas. Hamas' umbrella position at the moment is it feels that the U.S. bridging proposal shades its support far too much with Israel. Hamas has said they accepted the proposal put forward by President Biden at the end of -- at the end of May, that was -- then became sort of more enshrined, if you will, in a U.N. Security Council resolution later in June. But it's not clear what position Hamas is going to take over this new mapping and dispensation of Israeli troops along there, along the Philadelphi corridor, in a strong part because they absolutely object to any Israeli troops remaining inside of -- inside of Gaza as part of a ceasefire deal. However, what we're hearing from the White House and what we're -- the positioning that we seem to have had from Hamas over recent months is there is an understanding, that there's a ritual sort of three-phase plan, six weeks of hostage release and ceasefire. The second phase, you would have go on to a complete ceasefire. You'd have more of the hostages, the male hostages, released. The third phase, the third six weeks would be the real ramp-up of humanitarian aid. The linkage between a ceasefire to get the hostages released and a permanent ceasefire, the White House is indicating that the aspiration that they have at the moment is just to get those first weeks to stick. And this appears to be something that Hamas understands but, of course, is going to push to get in the first six weeks, push to get that permanent ceasefire. There were so many other sticking points on this deal. But the idea that Israel has recalibrated its position on the Philadelphi corridor, that we haven't heard a final position from Hamas yet, a yes, no or something in between on the U.S. bridging proposal, this is what's giving the room and hope that maybe the talks this weekend can bring a greater level of success.

This is a position that goes back to earlier rounds of hostage taking in the past. But this time, the added factor, that a hostage release would mean a ceasefire, completely contradicts the political aims that I mentioned earlier, that the right-wing and particularly the government does not want to end this war. They would like to continue and make Gaza essentially uninhabitable for Palestinians or at the very least that they can't return to the north and that Israel would start the process of reoccupying. And so they know that a hostage release deal with not only the release of Palestinian prisoners, which I think there's a very legitimate argument that that is a serious threat to security, it's a dilemma that happens in every hostage release. But the added factor of a ceasefire means that it contradicts their political aims. Now the rest of Israelis -- and I should, I should emphasize, a majority at least 50 percent or even a plurality but usually a full majority in surveys consistently, from the beginning of the war, is by Israelis, want a hostage release even when it means a cease-fire. They are prepared to trade that ceasefire for the release of the hostages. But the right wing of the current government led by Netanyahu -- and I should clarify, it's not just right-wing; it's an extreme ultra-nationalist government with theocratic, ultra- nationalist coalition partners. And they have a stalwart support of about one-third. let's say, of the population in survey research -- OK, we're talking about polls -- who are committed to avoiding that ceasefire, advancing those political aims. And as a result, they have taken the position that the hostages should be seen as just a sacrifice, people who were essentially killed like every -- like all the other 1,200 people on October 7th.
