There is no indication, right, that you're at the scene or anything else based on surveillance. You're good to go.The problem with this is the following. Number one, he gives the indication, Mr. Murdaugh, that he is napping, right? Well, it would seem to contradict that you were napping and not there in the event that your voice is there. Your voice is DNA, not actual DNA but it's figurative. So, it connects you and it puts you at the specific scene. What else is problematic? It's problematic that just after -- we have to look at the timeframe involved. Just after that, the son's communicating with a friend, guess what? His phone is not working anymore. That is troubling as well. And so to the extent that you give an alibi that you weren't there, have no clue, you know, nothing to see here and then there is your voice on a particular tape right around the time that it occurs and it goes out and then there is more. You're calling your wife to fabricate an alibi after the fact all of those things are problems.

RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  Well, what we said was either we have got to -- this should be all hands on deck. It's not a partisan issue. This impacts every American family. Look at the interest rates right now, on mortgages, credit cards, and also just look at inflation. When you go to a grocery store, look what it costs you to get eggs or meat and things like that. Constantly increasing our debt is putting our fiscal house at risk. So, what we have got to do is either we've got to reduce our costs, okay, grow our revenues responsibly, not raising taxes or what we've got to do is we've got to have some sort of structure reform so we know we'll get there down the road. So, that's what we propose. I have a variety of things. I think people ought to get back to work. If you don't have young children, you're able-bodied or dependent adults, get back to work.
