The expectation here in the city is that there will be, at least today, between three inches and four inches of snow. That's because the lake here has been unseasonably warm. The City of Chicago has also been unseasonably warm. They have not had a high below freezing since November 28. So, that's the good news, keeping a little bit warmer here in the city.A different story out in the suburbs, Erica, where they could see up to a foot of snow. This winter weather advisory from here until Saturday at one o'clock, the Illinois Department of Transportation says they have up to 1,800 vehicles and pieces of equipment or more to try to mitigate this storm for drivers and residents, Erica. This is just the prelude, because next week, our weather team is reporting that it could get shockingly cold. We are talking a 30 below with a wind shell in some areas of Illinois, Erica.",

Just ahead, retaliation threat, Houthis say Western military airstrikes will not go unpunished or unanswered. Israel hits back at South Africa's claims of genocide in Gaza. The UN's top court calling it profoundly distorted. And unfaltering support, the British Prime Minister's promise to Ukraine, as he visits Kyiv. The U.S. and UK have carried out a series of airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Western military powers hit more than 60 targets and more than a dozen Houthi militant locations overnight. It was in response to months of attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. A Houthi leader called the airstrikes \"criminal and barbaric\", saying that five people have been killed and six others wounded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YAHYA SAREA, HOUTHI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON (TRANSLATED): The American and British enemies bear full responsibility for their criminal aggression against our Yemeni people. It will not go unpunished or unanswered. The Yemeni Armed Forces will not hesitate to target threatening sources on all hostile targets on land and sea in order to defend Yemen, its sovereignty and independence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And U.S. Military officials say there will be further costs to Houthi forces if they don't end their illegal attacks on the Red Sea.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We reserve the right to protect and defend our forces, to defend the global trade that transits through the Red Sea, and to take necessary steps to, again, make sure that the Houthis understand loud and clear that it's unacceptable to the international community to continue to conduct these reckless, dangerous and illegal attacks against commercial shipping and mariners that are transiting this vital waterway.

Some Democrats are criticizing President Biden for not getting congressional approval, which is required by the Constitution. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): He should have come as the Constitution requires to Congress, and that was echoed in a bipartisan way by Senator Mike Lee, Representative Jonathan Jackson, and many other senators and Congress people. The Constitution requires that if there is not an imminent threat of self-defense that he has to come to Congress. And here we know, by your own reporting, that this has been going on since December. He has assembled an entire international coalition. He certainly should have come to Congress so that we can discuss whether this actually could put more American troops at risk. I'm concerned about retaliation in Iraq, and whether it could draw us into a Middle East war. And I believe that he did not follow the Constitution. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The strikes against the Houthi targets in Yemen prompted Russia to call an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. On Wednesday, the Council passed a resolution condemning the Houthi rebels and their attacks on ships in the Red Sea. But, it also is expected to discuss the situation in Gaza at the meeting, which begins in about two hours for now.Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv. I mean, how would you describe this escalation? Because there are those saying that it effectively inserts the UK and the U.S. in the war, and that very much works to the Houthi narrative.",

In fact, the South African delegation there, you can see have been inside the court, have come out to give their reaction to the press. Of course, as you can see, the pro-Palestinian protesters still there. They've been watching those proceedings on that giant screen just behind me.What we heard and I think what we'd expect to hear was a fair amount of indignation in the tone of a number of the barristers representing Israel, to begin with, the first one who explained, as you mentioned a moment ago, that this was a distortion of the reading by this -- of the Genocide Convention by the South African physicians, suggesting that in fact if the Court were to listen to them, it would be essentially turning the 1948 Genocide Convention into an aggressor's charter. Those were his terms. We then heard from a number of the other barristers much more than we'd expected to hear about their self-defense claims, the idea that Israel has been defending itself. We've heard, as we expected to about October 7, government papers, things to demonstrate that they have done all they can to avoid civilian casualties. And that this is about what Hamas has done to its own people. They've also, Max, tackled the question of intent, and this from the British barrister who has been defending them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think some of the concluding remarks were amongst the most interesting. Remember here, Max, that what the lawyers on the South African side are hoping to get is essentially an injunction that would demand that Israel cease its hostages. What you heard from the closing remarks on the Israeli side was that, essentially, going in the direction of the South Africans on this would prevent Israel from being able to defend itself that Hamas' point is to carry on -- carrying out attacks and attacking Israelis on Israeli soil. And that's the entire case.Essentially, it puts aside of shores (ph), ignores the fact that Israel is fighting a war for its own survival. This was the gist of what was said in court today, Max. The South Africans continue to hope, of course, on their part that the International Criminal Court will be convinced of its arguments that they had the suspicion that genocidal acts are being committed is enough for them to rule that Israel must stop, Max.",

The leading Republican presidential candidate is campaigning in Iowa this weekend. But, on Thursday, he spent the day in a New York courtroom where closing arguments in the trial wrapped up. Outside the court, Trump falsely claimed that his legal troubles were caused by President Joe Biden. However, the New York case was initiated by state investigators in 2019, before Mr. Biden came into office. The former President also launched into a five-minute monologue from the defense table.CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid has more on that and the rest of the story (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
