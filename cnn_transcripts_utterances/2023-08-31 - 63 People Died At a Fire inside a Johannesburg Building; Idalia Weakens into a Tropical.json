You are watching \"CNN Newsroom\" and I'm Rosemary Church.And we begin with breaking news and a tragedy in Johannesburg where a deadly building fire has now claimed at least 63 lives, more than 40 others are injured. The fire broke out around 1:30 a.m. local time at a five-storey building in the city's central business district. Firefighters have been working to contain the flames. And CNN's Larry Madowo is tracking developments for us. He's calling in now from Nairobi. So Larry, what more are you learning about this deadly fire? LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on the phone): Rosemary, authorities did not know the cause of the fire yet. They're still working through that. But so far the death toll keeps climbing. 63 people so far confirmed dead, according to the spokesperson for the city's emergency services. And they fear that this death toll could rise as they keep pulling more people out of the building. The reporters on the scene before being charred body, burned body think pulled out of the building it's a horrific scene why at the number so high here this is what it's called about in South Africa a hijacked building, often a building that are not in use and then you can be settlement coming inside of them sometimes partition that makeshift comes inside these buildings often a lot of people camp in very small surrounding sometimes but any big sometimes not even running water or power. But this is quite common in parts of downtown Johannesburg, which is why this is a death toll that keeps rising, at least more than 40 people so far reported to have been injured. And as the day wears on, as the fires put out and days start to go room by room, floor by floor, the numbers could very much increase once a final toll is counted. But a big concern in the country about the fact that so many people were allowed to live in this building, five-storey building. It does appear that it could have been overcrowded. Again, it's too early to tell, but this is a common trend in South Africa that's being seen in this tragedy, Rosemary.",

And often they're, like I mentioned, buildings that are not occupied. They're not necessarily abandoned, but they just don't have occupancy. And you see people coming in, often from low-income backgrounds. Some of them could be undocumented immigrants in the country. They do a lot of business around downtown Johannesburg city center. We were just there a few days ago filming for a story. And it's a very busy part of the city. There are markets, there are taxi ranks, there are all sorts of it's a hub of activity and many of them live not too far from there. In buildings like this one, there was seen this tragedy occurring in. They lived there with their families, often several people sharing a very small space, and that suddenly appears to be the case in this instance.",

The storm is over North Carolina at this hour. It is expected to move out into the Atlantic Ocean in the next few hours. Charleston, South Carolina is one area reporting localized flooding. The city's harbor saw water levels rise to about three meters late Wednesday, the fifth highest ever recorded. The National Weather Service reported a weak tornado touched down in Goose Creek, South Carolina, tossing this car into the air. Several people sustained minor injuries. Idalia made landfall early Wednesday along Florida's Big Bend coast with maximum sustained winds of more than 200 km per hour. In short, property losses are estimated at more than $9 billion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We haven't had a storm take this path at this level since the 1890s to hit this part of Florida. So this is something that is a really big deal and not that you ever want to do but there's parts of Florida that have had these things happen and they've built up infrastructure and in response to it. Well this part of the state hasn't necessarily seen a storm like this in quite some time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, it may be at tropical storm intensity. We don't see any low level circulation, but still has tropical characteristics. So what that means is we're seeing loss of deep convection all the way from the Piedmont of North Carolina and into the outer banks. You can see just this blossoming of deep convection across areas around Wilmington, Nags Head, Oak Island, and into the Raleigh-Durham area. And still lots of activity offshore.All of that is very capable of producing some tornadic activity because it is convective and we have seen some reports of some tornadoes across this region. That's why the tornado watch goes into effect until 4 a.m. local time. Here you can see it better on the radar. And for North Carolina, some of the rainfall may add up to 4 to 8 inches. So it looks like even though this is only at tropical storm intensity, it still has a lot of moisture associated with it. There may be somewhat of a mild storm surge across this region, like Wilmington may see some localized street flooding. We could see some beach erosion as well, but flash flood warnings out for this region as well. There are tornado watches out. It extends into the Outer Banks region, but lies just to the north of Wilmington. Something -- this is a fairly high population areas, even though it is kind of a resort area as well. Well going into Thursday morning about 8:00, still anticipating it to be at 60 miles per hour or about 100 kilometers per hour. It's going to edge away from the coast. It is racing along at about roughly 21 miles per hour and it will continue that. As it pulls away, it's going to take a lot of that tropical moisture with it. That's the good news because this area is going to get that soaked over the next four to eight hours or so. There you can see in the orange, that's a level three flood threat out of four, so significant precipitation here. In Charleston, well, the all-time flooding position was during Hurricane Hugo during 1989. And this was the fifth most significant rainfall and storm surge that they have seen there in quite some time when it makes the top five, and Charleston floods fairly easily, so the storm system didn't help. I'll be back at the top of the hour and we'll bring you another update. Rosemary?",

One resident told us the whole area didn't look very much like it used to look and they were really worried about elderly residents in isolated areas not being accounted for. So the opening of the Cedar Key Bridge was a very important development. Also, the governor saying that by late Wednesday, the number of customers without power had dropped, but they're still frantically working to get hundreds of thousands of people back online, not only in Florida, but also in Georgia. There were reports of at least two weather-related deaths in Florida, two car accidents not related to each other involving two men being killed. At least 10 hospitals had to be evacuated during the storm. According to Governor Ron DeSantis, out of those 10 hospitals in Florida that had to be evacuated at least nine of them will probably have gotten back online by late Wednesday night. Here in Leon County this is the city of Tallahassee, the capital Florida they're still digging out they're still assessing damage still tens of thousands of customers without power and look at some of the violence that occurred courtesy of hurricane Idalia. This is a house on Big Oak street in Tallahassee, and look at it, this is a large pine tree, and look just the force of the storm and look at the root system here it uprooted the entire root system of the tree toppled the tree and in the process look what it did to this fence it just uprooted the entire fence slammed across the yard broke the other part of the fence over there and then was stretching all the way across the street. Luckily crews got here and cleared the street of that part of the tree but again and also what I should tell you is that in this area in Tallahassee there's a lot of Spanish moss and other growth on these trees, which makes them much heavier. You come over here and you see just how close it came to landing on this house, just a few feet from this house. We talked to the homeowners, everybody there is okay, but they were pretty shaken by this event. In places here like Tallahassee, this is still not a safe area. It's not safe to navigate around here. A lot of downed power lines like that one hanging down right there that you see, and there were several downed power lines down on this street. Again, they're telling people, don't try to navigate these streets in a car or on foot, because these power lines, some of them could be live. They could kill you if you step on them. Also, people, a lot of people on the street running generators to get just to function at their homes. A lot of generator-related deaths are often reported in the aftermath of these hurricanes. So just in the process of recovering and navigating your streets or running your generator, you may not be out of danger. Brian Todd, CNN, Tallahassee, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The shelling say the few residents that are left here is day and night About 500 to 600 civilians left in this town from several thousand before the war. So far they say that the counteroffensive hasn't made things much worse in terms of the shelling, nor though they say has it made things any better. (voice-over): It's dangerous every day, says Ior Samsonenko. Overnight, the roof of that house was hit, there was shelling yesterday afternoon, and a building was on fire just the other day. As we inspect the damage done by last night's artillery fire, a Russian drone inspects us, exploding just as we leave. But little phases the local emergency services who've been showing us around.

And it resulted in the first Palestinian to be killed by Palestinian Authority security forces this year. And the reaction from the militant groups has also been harsh. It highlights the widening gap between the official Palestinian institutions and the militant groups, which hold increasing sway and power, especially in the northern part of the West Bank where this happened.Now violence has been surging across the occupied West Bank over the past year and a half, with the Israeli government saying that the Palestinian authorities' lack of action compels the Israeli military, they say, to conduct regular raids across the West Bank to tamp down on militant activity. So what happened was that a gun battle erupted in the town of Tulkarm after Palestinian Authority security forces say that their forces entered the refugee camp there to remove what they called hazardous materials and barriers, including some that were near a school, and that they then came under fire from armed youths in the area. A local journalist told CNN that the forces entered the camp to remove unarmed IEDs that were put in place to target Israeli forces if and when they were to enter the refugee camp. Now security forces say that they took quote \"necessary measures to control the situation.\" Now the man killed was identified as a 22 year old, Abdul Qader Zakda. His brother told CNN that he was an electrician and claimed that he was not associated with any militant groups. But the militant groups have called this, like Hamas said, a crime against our people, and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is associated with the Fata Party, which is the dominant party in the Palestinian Authority, they accused the Palestinian Authority forces of assisting the Israelis and announced that official security forces from the Palestinian Authority were now quote \"prohibited from entering the Tulkarm refugee camp.\" The militants also warned that the Palestinian security forces would be treated quote \"like the occupation,\" meaning the Israeli forces.

Omar Bongo ruled for more than four decades, much of that time spent in France, a critical ally. The elder Bongo, members of his family and confidants, were accused of eye-watering corruption, often linked to OPEC member Gabon's significant oil wealth. Ali Bongo took over from his father in 2009. He's been praised for conserving Gabon's vast forests and taking innovative steps to develop carbon credits to combat climate change. But he's faced growing discontent from many, with violence breaking out after disputed polls in 2016 and an attempted coup three years later. But these scenes have wider consequences. Many fear that Gabon is not the last domino to fall. African Union and international actors have failed to effectively counter recent military takeovers.

KRISTIE LU-STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, this is China's largest residential developer, and now Country Garden is battling a liquidity crisis. On Wednesday, it issued this warning that it would default, or it could default, on its vast debts after it reported a loss of $7 billion for the first half of the year. Now it made a statement in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Let's bring it up for you. And this is what Country Garden said. It said, quote, \"the company felt deeply remorseful for the unsatisfactory performance,\" unquote. Country Garden has nearly $200 billion in total liabilities. It is facing increasing pressure to pay off its debts. And according to the company, it was caught off-guard by the depth and the ongoing nature of China's property slump, especially in the smaller Chinese cities. Look, for the past two years now, China has been stuck in this historic property slowdown, which has resulted in unfinished and uncompleted homes in residential buildings and blocks, as you see there on your screen. It's resulted in unpaid creditors. And the slump has been deepening. You know, we learned in July, new home sales fell more than 34 percent year on year. Chinese officials, they've been scrambling to shore up the market. They've been introducing a number of measures. In fact, the same day when Country Garden warned it may default, the Chinese city of Guangzhou announced that it would relax mortgage rules for home buyers. But analysts say that such measures have not been enough, are not enough, because consumers in China are reluctant to spend money on new homes because of rising unemployment in China and because home prices are falling. And now we have this Country Garden warning of default, and some are fearing that this liquidity crisis, it could spread beyond. It could spread to China's wider economy and even overseas. Back to you Rosemary.",

Raimondo had said she did not expect any breakthroughs during her visit, but she did secure agreements from Beijing to begin formal discussions on export controls and tourism. While visiting a joint venture in Shanghai between Boeing and China, the Secretary told reporters that her talks had addressed numerous complex issues facing both countries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GINA RAIMONDO, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: We were able to clarify in the first meeting that we are not targeting China. We are targeting certain behavior. We are targeting actions and behavior which undermine U.S. national security and we sought to begin clarifying our procedures. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: Raimondo and other U.S. officials also visited Disneyland in Shanghai. The secretary made a point of noting that her email was hacked by China-based hackers prior to her trip. She warned that such actions are a deterrent to U.S. companies wanting to invest in China. Joining me now is CNN Economics and political commentator Catherine Rampell. She's also an opinion columnist for the \"Washington Post.\" A pleasure to have you with us.",

Now, we don't know quite the extent of the challenges that the economy faces, because you can't really trust the official statistics. Some of the statistics have stopped being printed altogether.But some of the problems are structural. There are things like demographic challenges. Some of them, I think, were exacerbated by the government's management of the economy and the regulatory, the broader regulatory landscape. You talked about the COVID lockdowns, for example. I mentioned earlier the seemingly arbitrary interventions in both Chinese companies and foreign companies. So, you know, it's very hard to know going forward whether the slowdown that the Chinese economy at the very least seems to be experiencing will continue. I think the fact that the Chinese government has been so non-transparent about the state of affairs is unlikely to calm concerns from investors and could unintentionally backfire. By hiding some of the bad news, that could actually create more anxiety about the state of the economy and therefore prolong the problems that the Chinese economy is facing.",

You know, you asked earlier about what that means for other countries, some countries have a lot of exposure to the Chinese economy, and there will be some, you know, potential contingent effects.Some other countries may stand to benefit from geopolitical tensions, for example, with China. You know, we've already seen a number of businesses kind of relocate their supply chains out of China to elsewhere in Southeast Asia or to Mexico, for example. You know, that's been a big beneficiary. Mexico has been a big beneficiary of some of the tensions between the United States. and China. So, you know, I think some of the regional effects are mixed. I think there's reason to be more optimistic than may have been the case a few months ago. But I would say cautious optimism is warranted at this point.",
