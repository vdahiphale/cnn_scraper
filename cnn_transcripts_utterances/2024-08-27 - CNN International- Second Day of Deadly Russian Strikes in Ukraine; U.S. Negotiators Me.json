This hour, we speak with RFK Jr.'s sister, Kerry Kennedy, who says she is outraged by her brother's decision to embrace Donald Trump.Voting companies and election officials still dealing with the fallout from the 2020 election lies, they are bracing for Election Day in November, what they are doing to try to prepare. And potentially record high temperatures and humidity expected to smother the Midwest this week, the heat so dangerous some schools are being forced to close just days into the new year. I am Sara Sidner with John Berman and Kate Bolduan in this hour. CNN's News Central starts right now. AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\":  Hi, everyone and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Amara Walker. This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, Russia unleashes a new wave of deadly strikes on Ukraine a day after Moscow launched one of its largest drone and missile attacks of the war. And the debate over debates, 14 days away from the scheduled presidential debate and the two campaigns needle each other over negotiations. Plus, a shocking number of tiny shards of plastic are now inside our heads. We have details from a new alarming study. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is vowing to respond to another deadly Russian bombardment, warning that crimes against humanity cannot go unpunished. For the second straight day, Russian missiles and drones rained down throughout Ukraine, setting off air alarms across the country. At least five people were killed Tuesday and ten others wounded in the latest strikes, including a missile attack on a hotel in the Central City of Kryvyi Rih. It comes one day after Ukraine is calling Russia's largest aerial assault since the war began two-and-a-half years ago. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joining me now, live in London with the latest. Salma, it appears that Russia is stepping up its bombing campaign and clearly, it's in response to Ukraine's surprise cross-border incursion.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, it's absolutely within the context of the Kursk assault. However, this is not necessarily a direct response to that. This is part of a continued Russian strategy that we've seen really since the beginning of the conflict, and that is Moscow targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, hitting power lines, hitting electricity plants, hitting water plants, making daily life extremely difficult for average Ukrainians, weaponizing the ability to just turn on your light or get a glass of water in the morning.And what is so concerning for President Zelenskyy -- he spoke on this just a short time ago -- is yes, of course, he has air defense capabilities that have been enriched by the West, by his allies in NATO, and they are able to take down a majority of what is being fired at Ukraine but some is still getting through. Some of those drones and missiles are still making it through and you're looking at the image, is the aftermath, the impact of that, people killed, homes destroyed, neighborhoods in shock, families sent into bomb shelters. And for President Zelenskyy, again, there is very little, he says, he can do about it now, unless he is allowed to lift restrictions that have been put on NATO -- by NATO rather on weapons. And that includes, first of all, this is President Zelenskyy pleading for this -- first of all, he wants to be able to use his long-range missiles. He wants to be able to use those to strike at targets inside Russian territory. Secondly, he is asking if he can use those air defense capabilities right up to Russian airspace, right near Russian airspace. Now, for Western allies, of course, this would make them cringe, it begins to make them wonder could this possibly result in an escalation with President Putin? Now, the red lines that have been set by the United States, by NATO have been shifting throughout this conflict. So President Zelenskyy will continue to plead with this -- for this and his argument is, if I don't get these rights, if I'm not able to use the weapons in the way that I need to, my people will continue to be vulnerable to this type of Russian assault.",

As negotiators in Egypt meet to discuss the nuts and bolts of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, inside Gaza, the death toll is mounting. The Gazan ministry of health says another 41 people were killed across the enclave in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. It adds to the toll which already exceeded 40,000 since the war began in October. The U.N. says it is temporarily halting aid deliveries because of security risks, after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate parts of Central Gaza.It could also disrupt plans by the U.N. to vaccinate children in Gaza against polio, a disease that experts say threatens to spread fast.

      "sentences": "Well, despite notes of optimism from U.S. officials on the progress of ceasefire negotiations, we are yet to see indications of any significant breakthroughs and frankly, little movement in efforts to narrow the gaps between Israel and Hamas. Following talks here in Cairo over the weekend, working level discussions are expected to continue, focused on the finer details of a proposed agreement. However, there are still believed to be significant sticking points.Hamas has once again stressed that any agreement must include guarantees for an eventual transition from an initial six-week pause in fighting during the first phase of the proposed deal to a permanent ceasefire in the second phase. Israeli officials have yet to provide such guarantees with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June indicating that Israel would seek a continuation of the war following an initial pause. Now according to officials, there also continues to be disagreement on the terms surrounding the longer-term presence of Israeli forces within the Gaza Strip. While Israel has proposed to station a reduced number of troops along the Philadelphi Corridor, a buffer zone between Egypt and southern Gaza, Hamas has reiterated that it wants to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. However, one senior U.S. official has told CNN that negotiators believe Hamas may be more flexible on an Israeli troop presence in Gaza during that first phase of the deal with ongoing debate as to whether parts of the Philadelphi Corridor should be considered densely populated areas and therefore, areas where troops should not be present under the terms of the proposed deal. Now, officials say mediators expect that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar will receive a copy of the latest proposal in the coming days, though the timing of any expected response remains unclear. For now, discussions can continue to try to hammer out those finer details of the proposal and to bring Hamas and Israel to some sort of agreement, but there is no indication that that agreement is in any way imminent. Nada Bashir, CNN, in Cairo. WALKER:  All right, Nada, Thank you. In politics, alliances and friendships can change quickly, case in point, Robert Kennedy Jr. On Friday, he suspended his campaign for president and endorsed Donald Trump. When he shook Trump's hand on stage in Arizona, it came after years of animosity between the two. Kennedy has repeatedly condemned Trump, calling him a bully, while Trump once called him the dumbest member of the Kennedy clan. Those were his words. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is casting doubt on whether he will debate Kamala Harris in two weeks. He is also re-opening an argument with the hosts of ABC News about whether the candidate's microphones are all on all the time during the debate or muted when the other candidate is speaking. The previous debate, the mics were muted. Alayna Treene joining us now from Washington with the details. OK. Alayna, so where do things stand on this debate over whether or not these microphones should be muted. And of course, the question is if Trump will even show up.",

Amid advertising efforts in many locations, the Trump campaign today starts an ad push in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is close to the former president's Mar-a-Lago home. Democrats say the ad buy shows Trump is scared he could lose Florida, a state that he won with more than three points in 2020. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign has released a minute-long ad that talks about her economic plans. It mostly focuses on the steps she will take to help middle-class Americans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down cost. We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, it is for those reasons that this again has become such a priority and so important for observers, but also for the campaign as they work to schedule the interview in now only a couple of days.Now, again, when that interview would happen is still an open question, but it is those details that we'll likely get before the close of the weak.",

I think over the course of the last month, there's -- or months, there's also been recognition that Democrats have often talked about it in quite vague terms. Remember, President Biden often talked about Bidenomics, pointing to how the administration was helping the economy and that it was moving in the right direction.But what I've heard from those sources close to the vice president is that she wants to speak more to the individual experiences, acknowledging that people don't feel overly confident about the economy right now and that there are struggles that they face day in, day out. And that is what we are seeing come through those ads. There was an ad Friday, there was an ad yesterday that was announced, and now an ad today. And when you look at them all together, she covers three issues -- economic opportunity, costs being high and how she plans on lowering them, but also her own upbringing in the middle class. So, this is something that we will hear more about. Of course, this is a part of the $150 million ad buy this month, more of that to come, they are already setting aside nearly $300 million in ad buys between Labor Day and Election Day. So, while certainly not all of those will be the economy, you can expect a lot of them will, with that continuing to be a top issue for many voters.",

MARQUARDT (voice-over):  Durov was flying to Paris from Azerbaijan, where Russian President Vladimir Putin also visited last week. Kremlin has denied that Putin and Durov met. Durov had also created the Russian app VKontakte, known as Russia's Facebook. He fled the country in 2014 after refusing to turn over user data from the app to the Russian government. Russia tried to ban Telegram in 2018, but lifted the ban in 2020. With 900 million users worldwide, Telegram is used by everyday people, governments, and companies to send official messages, but the app's encryption also makes it popular among criminals and terrorists.

And also, look forward to make sure that an incident like this can never happen again.These lawmakers emphasize that there is no place for political violence in this democracy, that too very bipartisan in nature. But the second goal was to demonstrate that they're also taking this investigation very seriously. Today, we saw lawmakers not only tour the Butler Farm Show as a whole and also go to that specific area where former President Trump was speaking at that rally on July 13, but we also saw lawmakers actually climb on top of the AGR building where Thomas Matthew Crooks, the shooter in this incident, ultimately opened fire at former President Donald Trump. Some of the members of Congress actually remarked that it was the first time they'd been here to this site since that shooting and they were stunned at just how close Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to get to former President Trump on that day.

I mean, anytime something happens on the ground, whether it is a strike in Gaza, a rescue operation, anything else, it can have some kind of an impact, if not on the talks themselves, then certainly on the psychology of the populations that are being represented by the different parties at the negotiating table. And this will be a boost, of course, for Israeli morale to see that another hostage has indeed been rescued from captivity.But I think that all of the families of the hostages are pretty clear eyed at this point that they are not counting on additional Israeli rescue operations to get all of their loved ones out of Gaza. They know and certainly, a big portion of the Israeli government knows that it is ultimately a deal with Hamas that will lead to the release of the remaining hostages. And the question is, can that happen quickly enough for more of them to come home alive rather than dead, as we have seen a number of the bodies of Israeli hostages, some of whom died only in recent months, being brought back to Israel in body bags sadly, rather than coming in home alive. We know that those negotiations are still ongoing at a technical level in Cairo right now. The United States has said that there has been significant progress over the weekend towards a deal. But it is still very difficult to know whether or not these talks will actually lead to an agreement that would see dozens more hostages released.",

And according to the Hostages Families Forum, he was abducted on October 7th from a security job at Kibbutz Magen, down in the south of course, close to Gaza.You heard the Israeli government spokesman there saying that his family has now been given the good news, that he is in stable medical condition, and they are continuing to do medical checks on him at a hospital. It is as I say, rare news to speak of a live rescue of a hostage all these months later, the last one was on June 8, when four hostages were rescued from central Gaza. This operation taking place in southern Gaza involving both regular military units and Israeli Special Forces. They have not released further details as to exactly how they managed to gain his safety. But again, you have to go back to June 8, so a number of months to a successful rescue operation, of course, just last week six hostages, bodies were recovered from Gaza. Of course, not the good news that these hostage families want to hear. That leaves the total of 108 -- 108 that are still remaining there. And Israeli government officials have acknowledged that many of those 108, they have not specified a number, are no longer alive. The Hostage Forum has released a statement saying that this is nothing short of a miraculous. They go on to say that military operations alone cannot be expected to gain the freedom of all these hostages, of course, that speaks to the tension ongoing here between hostage families and the government, because hostage families have been quite impatient for a deal, a ceasefire and hostage release deal to gain the release of the other remaining hostages, or at least a large number of the other remaining hostages. But at least today, for one family, there is good news.",

But these are fair questions and they've been consistent ones, and they speak to a larger issue as to how Israeli leaders and in negotiations with their Hamas captors can get to a point where more of the hostages can see freedom all these months now. Keep in mind, we're coming up on a year anniversary of the October 7th attacks, and it would be quite a moment here for Israeli families to still be suffering through that captivity a year later.
