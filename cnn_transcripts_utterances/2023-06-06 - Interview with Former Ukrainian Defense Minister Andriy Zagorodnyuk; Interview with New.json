I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. We begin with the blame game playing out over a dam which has been critically damaged in occupied Ukraine. Both Kyiv and Moscow were pointing the finger at each other after the Nova Kakhovka Dam was partly destroyed, flooding nearby communities. It's a strategically important reservoir that supplies water to Russian occupied Crimea, as well as the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. NATO secretary general called it an outrageous act that put thousands of civilians at risk, causing severe environmental damage. The Kremlin claims that it was deliberate sabotage by Ukraine to choke Crimea's water source and divert attention from the wider battle. What do we know right now? Well, that is that the satellite images show the dam was damaged a few days before it collapsed. What we cannot verify is whether that damage contributed to the collapse or whether it was destroyed deliberately. Andriy Zagorodnyuk is Ukraine's former defense minister and an advisor to the current government. He joins us live from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Let me ask you about the war from a broader perspective and that, is the ultimate goal of the country after the end of this war, after Ukraine's victory, to join NATO, and that is a pursuit that the leaders of the country, that President Zelenskyy, and you yourself continue to make. You write in \"Foreign Affairs,\" this article, to protect Europe, let Ukraine join NATO right now. It is time then to let Ukraine join, not sooner or later, but now. By entering the alliance, the country will secure its future as part of the West, and it can be sure the United States and Europe will continue help it fight against Moscow. Europe, too, will reap security benefits by allowing Ukraine to join the alliance. It is now apparent that the continent is not ready to defend itself and that it's politicians have largely overestimated its security. Indeed, Europe will never be secure from Russia until it can militarily stop Moscow's attacks. And no state is more qualified to do so than Ukraine. You make a compelling argument in this piece, but are you worried that it is one that is falling on deaf ears?

Also, they will understand that the capabilities currently present in Eastern Europe are not enough. And they are helping up to build a very strong Ukrainian army. So, since they're investing money and the resources in this army, why don't they plan that this army would be protecting the whole Eastern Europe, not just Ukraine?

Well, the last time a British royal was in court, get this, it was 1891, and King Edward VII was giving evidence in a gambling scandal. Well, today, it's Prince Harry in the witness box at London's high court, going up against some of Britain's biggest tabloid newspapers. He's among more than 100 celebrities and socialites suing Mirror Group Newspapers, alleging that their reporters unlawfully hacked their voicemail, and deceptively obtained private information. MGN is fighting those allegations and claims bosses weren't aware of any illicit activity. Prince Harry told the court that editors and journalists have \"blood on their hands for the distress their behavior and articles caused him.\" Journalist and royal expert, Bidisha Mamata, and New York Times London bureau chief, Mark Landler, join me now from London. Welcome both of you. Mark, let's just set the scene here and talk about the historic nature of this appearance of Prince Harry.

And I think he really acquitted himself fairly well given the fact that, as you say, royals in general avoid courtrooms, they much prefer to settle trials, settle legal cases before they ever get to trial. So, today was something of a test for Harry, and at least on the opt -- from the optic's point of view, leave aside the legal case, I think he performed relatively well.",

He said, as a teenager and in my early twenties, I ended up feeling as though I was playing up a lot of the headlines and stereotypes that they wanted to pin on me mainly because I thought that, if they were printing this rubbish about me and people were believing it, I may as well do the crime, so to speak. It was a downward spiral, whereby the tabloids would constantly try and coax me, a damaged young man, into doing something stupid that would make me a good story and sell lots of newspapers. Looking back on it now, such behavior on their part is utterly vile. Mark, what are arguments the defense is making in response to these statements?",

So, it's making the narrow argument that it hasn't hacked their phones. It has acknowledged that there were a couple of cases of unlawful gathering of information. I think this had to do mostly with the use of private investigators. And so, at the end of this case, there probably will be some form of restitution to the plaintiffs, including Harry, but I think the Mirror Group's goal is twofold, they want to keep those numbers as low as they can and they don't want to open the door to a floodgate of other people coming to them to either litigate or ask for large settlements based on hacking. So, you know, one of the arguments they are making is you're -- is a classic statute of limitations arguments in the United States, why is Harry waiting for more than 12, 13, 14 years since the phone hacking scandal to bring these charges. Harry's lawyers respond, well, you concealed your methods from us at the time. So, how are we able to know what your nefarious techniques were? And so, you know, they're making a much more, to some extent, a narrow case, whereas Harry is making a broader case, a broader indictment of the effect tabloids have had on his life and on the lives of many other prominent people.",

And by all accounts, the worstmisdeeds, the worst forms of hacking and voicemail interception have been rooted out of the industry long ago because they feared that if they didn't voluntarily curb their practices the government would do it for them. So just some extent, it is correct to say that this is happening long after the conduct itself. But, you know, Harry's point is that the underlying culture of intrusiveness, of remorselessness, of excess has remained even if the papers aren't actually hacking anymore. And so, I think that if he were to emerge victorious, it would be a blow for his case, and it might cause some introspection on the part of the tabloids, but I think it's also worth pointing out that, you know, Harry has become a very different figure than he was even five years ago. He lives in Southern California, he has his own life, he has his own causes. The press here is uniformly gone fairly sour on him. And so, I think that, you know, it was very interesting, but perhaps not surprising, that when Piers Morgan, a former editor of the \"Daily Mirror,\" was door stopped recently and asked about these charges, he gave a very defiant response, I'm not going to be lectured by the likes of Prince Harry about privacy issues.

So, he would have figured on the front pages of tabloids multiple times a week. And, you know, one can only feel sympathy when you think about what that was like for a 14 or 15 or 16-year-old young man to have to deal with. You know, and that, in part, explains why he withdrew from royal duties and why he and his wife, Meghan, have moved to Southern California. I think he felt like he did not want to submit to that kind of a role for -- you know, for the coming years and he wanted to try something different. Of course, as we know, from his experience in United States, particularly as a celebrity couple, the cameras have a habit of following people like that and he's encountered his own brush with paparazzi and attention in the United States as well.

That sort of doesn't make sense to me and, you know, that's kind of where this idea came from.

Well, you know, three or four different appraisers came in and they all had different valuations for that collection. The Diego Rivera, they couldn't even price at all because it was really truly priceless, they couldn't agree to a price. So, what happened was all this kind of, you know, different opinions kind of melded into a decision, which was, you know what, we can't value this art. It's beyond value. It's so important that we actually cannot value it. So, let's just stipulate a base number and some foundations came in and put that money forward, and that was used to pay off pension funds and other debts, and the art was taken off the table, never to be put on -- potentially on an auction block ever again. A trust was created. So, that was a case where actually pricelessness saved a whole city, and it was the ability of the governments then and the foundations and eventually, the museum itself to assign itself a value that could never be stipulated. And so, the success was that everyone agreed that there was so much value, we couldn't put a price on it, therefore, we better never squander it. It's too important.",

I mean, people think they're going to lose money investing, you know, shipping capital from detrimental uses to productive environmental protection, that's a moneymaker these days. It's an old story that you have to accept a concessionary return if you invest in things that are more oriented to environmental protection. You make money in ESG. It is not -- it is in no ways -- some of the opposition to ESG has been that it's not prudent, it's not in the best shareholder interest, when in fact, actually, it is supremely in the shareholder's interest. One, because it's protecting shareholders from potential risks, many of which you don't see yet, like wildfire and flood. And secondly, it's a moneymaker.

Mangroves keep the ocean from banging into the coast. And so, there's a value to that. But since we don't value the mangroves, but we value the coastal property, we cut the mangroves down thinking, well, we'll make more hotels there, when actually, overtime, those hotels get slammed by typhoons. And so, in Myanmar, this groundbreaking study was done, and they were even able to value the labor of elephants in pulling logs out of the forest and put a value on the elephant as a worker, not just as a cost center, oh, elephant, we have to feed it. No, this element is providing tremendous value to the country. Nature, you could say, is the most underpaid and unpaid worker in the history of the world. We don't pay nature anything for its work.

And basically, you know, the shorthand is it's a way to value, securitize, invest in environmental benefits that will be realized somewhere down the line. So, you take a forest, you think, OK, it's just trees standing there. Well, forest tending, taking care of a forest, it's kind of like gardening the forest. You have to take the brush out from the ground, you have to trim the trees, you have to try to somehow make sure a fire doesn't jump from one tree to another. And of course, that requires water. And if there's no water and no rain, the trees become very dry. So, it's a terribly vicious cycle. And in the case of California, the government, the Wildlife Service, was spending a fortune putting forest fires out, wildfire forest out. And therefore, eating into its budget for preventing the fires. So, the Forest Resilience Bond brings together beneficiaries, that's what they are called, of a resilient forest, who are, of course, obviously, the Wildlife Service, everybody benefits if the Wildlife Service can protect the forest, but also local insurers who don't want to pay, and cannot pay, increasingly, homeowners who are burned out, let alone killed and hurt. Tourism operators who require, you know, forests be healthy so the tourists will come. And even hydro power plants. So, the bond quantifies all these benefits and secure investors, private investors, as well as public investors, who said, OK, quantitatively, a forest -- this group of trees in Lake Tahoe, is an example, is worth X, and we'll put several -- we'll put X into it, and the beneficiaries who had benefits later, pay the bond back. So, it's kind of advancing time, in a way, and it's very exciting. And they've gone from a couple of million to 25 or 30 million. I think there's even two funds now, almost 50 million, where private investors have put money upfront to enable the forest to be tended properly to postpone wildfires and bring the benefits of resilient forest into the balance sheet. It's just way you fund -- it's an infrastructure concept. And so, thinking of forest as infrastructure is a breakthrough because infrastructure, you have to maintain, it's just like, you know, a cost.",

They need to really be tied back to the idea of an overall reduction. It's also true though that constantly reducing emissions every year, especially if you are a power plant, how are you supposed to do that if you fix the power plant and it's going to run for 20 years, you know, what other fixes can you make?

President Macron and militaryofficials welcomed veterans to Normandy honoring those who fought for freedom and democracy. Among them is 100-year-old Jake Larson, the last surviving member of the unit that stormed Omaha Beach in 1944. And back in 2019, he shared his memories of that day with Christiane. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE LARSON, D-DAY VETERAN:  I remember when I hit the beach, machine guns were opening up and firing at me. And I found this (INAUDIBLE), what I call a burn (ph) of sand, kind of limestone, that sits in a powder and it was about six to inches inches high, and it was a protection from those machine guns. So, I lay behind it thinking, how am I going to get out of this thing without being shot at me? (END VIDEO CLIP)",
