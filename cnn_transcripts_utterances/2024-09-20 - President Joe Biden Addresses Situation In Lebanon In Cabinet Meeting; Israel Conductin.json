And today, you have this strike that, according to the Israeli military, has now taken out Hezbollah's operations chief, the commander of their special operations unit, the Radwan Force, which has coordinated and carried out many of the attacks against Northern Israel since October 7th. And so you have not only this significant blow that has been dealt to Hezbollah, but you also have a situation that very quickly risks spiraling out of control. And that is because we have to think about, what will Hezbollah's response be? On the one hand, there's no question that after having several dozens of its members killed in those exploding wireless device attacks earlier this week, likely hundreds more who were maimed or blinded in those attacks, and now to have several of its commanders killed, there's no question that Hezbollah has been disabled in some respect or certainly put into disarray as it prepares its next move. At the same time, Israel now also faces the risk of Hezbollah feeling cornered and escalating the situation further. And so that is going to be the question is, where do things go from here? What kind of response will we see from Hezbollah as they now will feel compelled to not only respond to those attacks earlier this week with those exploding devices, but also now to this very significant strike in the Lebanese capital itself.",

Since April, beginning with the Damascus attack through this week, Hezbollah has lost three members of its Jihad Council. And the individual killed today, according to press reports, and his subordinates, were responsible for most of the attacks on Israel over the last 11 months. It is difficult to imagine Hezbollah putting together a crisp and coordinated multi-unit response. But single-unit response involving anti- tank missiles, rockets, are likely to continue in the short term. And that brings us to the main point. Israel's primary objectives are to end the rocket attacks or allow its people to return north. If the rocket attacks continue, then it must continue these strikes in Beirut against leadership to convince them to change their strategy. That's unlikely in the near term.",

Israel has carried out a major targeted strike in Southern Beirut, claiming to kill a senior Hezbollah figure. This is a photo of Ibrahim Aqil, who is listed on a U.S. government web site as a wanted individual. Several other people were killed in the strike on a multistory building in a crowded residential neighborhood in the Lebanese capital. Latest attack comes after a wave of explosions blew up Hezbollah communication devices, walkie-talkies and pagers earlier this week. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been going on for decades and has heated up since the October 7th attacks. But this week's escalations have pushed them closer to the brink of war. In a statement on X before this latest strike occurred, Israel's President Isaac Herzog said, quote, we do not want war, not today, not ever, but we are entitled to the most basic rights of any nation to live in peace, security and tranquility. Time now for The Exchange. Joining me now is Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. And author of \"Blind Spot: America and the Palestinians, from Balfour to Trump.\" Khaled, thank you so much for being with us. So when you look at what Isaac Herzog just said there on X saying listen, we don't necessarily want war. A lot of people actually look at the series of attacks this week, both the attacks on communication devices and also the target of strike we saw today and say, it looks as though Israel is actually trying to goad Hezbollah into a war.

And as long as that war continues, then the front with Hezbollah to the north will also remain open. And we've seen a gradual escalation. I mean, the pager attack, I think, was really unprecedented in the kind of scale, you know, thousands of individuals. And, of course, the airstrikes today, which I wouldn't really call targeted. I mean, we've seen reports of at least many civilians killed and including five children as the reports that I've seen. So we're -- I think we're in a place where you have an extremist government in Israel that is trying to instill what they consider to be a deterrent. Israel's doctrine of deterrence is based on inflicting so much damage and terror on the other side that they will simply stop responding even when they're attacked. And that's a very dangerous approach, as we've seen, that it only -- has only led to more escalation. And so unless there are kind of rational cooler heads that can prevail and sort of talk everyone down, whether it's Hezbollah or its allies or Netanyahu, I think -- I think there is -- there's an urgent need to do something different than what's been done the past 12 months.",

Gaza's been destroyed, but Hamas hasn't. Hezbollah is a much more powerful foe than Hamas in terms of its military sophistication, its command and control in every -- in every way. And so I think the Israelis understand this and that's why we're not seeing a full-on invasion. But I think we've already crossed the Rubicon in the sense that we're not -- we're no longer at the brink of war. Israel and Hezbollah are at war. It's just a question of the scale of that war. Will it be contained or de-escalated? Or will it continue this upward cycle toward something much more destructive?

I think the way out of this, I mean, Hezbollah has said that they will continue to attack Israel, as long as the Gaza war continues.

And so we are in a kind of no holds barred escalatory situation in which both sides have an interest in avoiding greater violence, but also an interest in maintaining what they consider to be deterrent from the other side. Because if Hezbollah simply doesn't respond, then they're conceding to all of Lebanon and frankly to the region that Israel can act with impunity and not expect any sort of response. And, obviously, Israel will make a similar calculation.",

Look, the former president has floated visiting, as you mentioned, who knows if that will actually happen.But one of the things that we've heard from the mayor, Rob Rue, who we just heard from a little bit there, is that it does seem leaders are trying to tone down the political temperature, a temperature of which they really had no control over from the inside on trying to get things handled. And what I mean by that is, for example, we talked about a potential presidential visit or former presidential visit. The mayor said he would welcome any candidate that would instead focus on real issues of immigration rather than continuing to repeat what we have seen to be claims without any evidence. Even the Republican governor of the state, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, who is a Republican, and a Trump supporting Republican, does not agree with the former president on this. He was born in Springfield. And he wrote this as part of an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" this morning, saying, the city hit tough times in the 1980s and 1990s falling into serious economic decline as manufacturing, real commerce and good-paying jobs dwindled. Now, however, Springfield is having a resurgence in manufacturing and job creation. Some of that is thanks to the dramatic influx of Haitian migrants who have arrived in the city over the past three years to fill jobs. They're there legally. They're there to work. And the estimates from the city is that there are between 12,000 and 15,000 immigrants in the Springfield area at this point. And they have filled much needed positions, as far as jobs go, for many of the companies in the area. But, of course, with that rise in population has come some tensions in different aspects of society there.",

Germans are saying they absolutely needs todo this to stop the threat of terrorism, but also illegal migration. Other European countries, though, say that this destroys the very essence of a unified Europe. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The wave of mass migration to Germany started in 2015. Millions of people fleeing the wars in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan crossed into the E.U., welcomed by then German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who boasted that Germany would manage the huge influx of people from abroad. But after nine years, many Germans are saying enough. Following a string of attacks carried out by former asylum seekers, leaving several people dead. Voters are flocking to the right-wing, Alternative for Germany party, AFD, that promises to stop migration and start mass deportations of migrants. Severely sliding in the polls, German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, now says he's getting tough. We will utilize all possibilities to carry out entry refusals within the framework of the law, he says, and we've put a concept for effective entry refusal on the table, where we are prepared to do this with the opposition. While the right-wing anti-migration Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban gleefully posted on X, quote, Germany has decided to impose strict border controls to stop illegal migration. Bundeskanzler Scholz, welcome to the club. Other European leaders have vowed to combat Germany's new border regime. This type of action is unacceptable from the Polish point of view, Poland's prime minister said. After all, I have no doubt that it is the internal political situation in Germany which is causing these steps to be implemented and not our policy towards illegal immigration on our borders. And some migration experts believe Germany is not only putting itself at odds with the E.U., but that these checks will do little to stop illegal border crossings.",
