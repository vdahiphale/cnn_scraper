Those attacks sought to be in preparation for a potential Israeli ground offensive, two sources tell CNN. Now it comes as Israel's defense minister today hinted at a ground incursion while speaking to troops near the Israel-Lebanon border. Meantime, this was the scene hours before in Lebanon's capital.

Now the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is a Palestinian faction that has a presence here in Lebanon, but has not been active for several years. It's not clear if Israel is now taking the opportunity to target not just Hezbollah and others who have been firing into Israel, but all of the factions that are opposed to Israel. Now, many of the people who left the southern suburbs moved to areas like this because they thought it might be safer. Clearly, that's not the case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In 2006, Israel invaded Lebanon hoping it could suppressattacks by Hezbollah in a way that it found impossible, using air power alone. An eerily similar situation to today. And the brutal course of a 34- day war, more than 1000 Lebanese were killed in 2006. Israel's attacks on Lebanon last Monday alone killed around half that number. More than 100 Israeli soldiers were also killed in the 2006 war. Well, it ended with a mutually agreed ceasefire, Israel withdrawing from Lebanon without achieving the goals that it had set for itself. 18 years later, Israel still determined to eliminate what it perceives as an existential threat posed by Hezbollah at its border. It says one of the goals of this war is to allow thousands of Israelis displaced from the far north of the country to return home. At the time, back in 2006 Hezbollah did not have the resources that it has today and some say the prime minister is leading Israel into a new war in pursuit of another unrealistic goal. Well, Ehud Olmert was Israel's prime minister at the time of the 2006 invasion and he joins us now. I do want to spend a bit of time with you reflecting on what happened back in 2006 and the lessons learned. But Israel today has set returning the residents of the North back to their homes as a goal of this war. Do you believe that the action today, the assassination of the Hezbollah chief and many of his commanders and the potential for a full-on war on Hezbollah using ground troops, if that is the decision is the right move to restore security, sir?",

And I know that you've been an arch critic to keep his far-right coalition on board, but many others are supporting his decision to go after Hassan Nasrallah and his commanders and to keep up that momentum. You don't agree that that is where he should go from here on in. What's the alternative at this point? I mean, a ceasefire proposal tabled by the U.S. and France has gone nowhere at this point, a diplomatic solution doesn't seem to be in the toolbox for the Israeli prime minister at this point.",

Well, Jim Sciutto joining me here in Tel Aviv. And Jim, it is unclear yet whether Iran, whether or not Iran, will respond to Hassan Nasrallah's assassination. They have been largely absent safer statements of condemnation and threats of retaliation. If they do respond that risks a wider regional war. What is the U.S.' calculus at this point? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Well, the U.S. priority, really, going back to October 7th has been one, support Israel as it responds to the October 7th attacks, but also prevent this from escalating, expanding into a broader war, and it's pursued that really, on two fronts, one via ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, and also, more recently, a ceasefire deal on the northern border. I think one can say that those diplomatic efforts have failed to this point. Those talks may not be dead, but they're certainly not going anywhere right now in Gaza or regarding Lebanon and Israel. The other piece of the strategy has been to position greater forces here in the region, carrier strike groups, missile submarines, partly as support of Israeli military action but also a message to Iran that if this gets bigger, we have Israel's back. It's not clear how that has contributed to holding back the further expansion or further retaliation say from Iran. We don't know. The perception in the U.S. is that the message has been made clear by having those forces there, that if you expand, if it's Israel, via Iran, the U.S. would defend Israel. The question then becomes, what does Iran do to your point? I mean, it may be and some of this is in their public commentary, that they are concerned, right? That if they were to strike Israel, that they might get hit quite hard and Hezbollah might be making that same calculation right now. What are they capable of doing? So, the military message may be working to some degree hard to calculate what -- how the diplomatic path is just -- it's just not working for the U.S. right now.",

It's not clear what the level of U.S. influence is because the U.S. has pressed not just on those diplomatic efforts, it's pressed on -- for instance, a greater attention to civilian casualties in Gaza. Whole host of fronts where Netanyahu has largely pursued his own strategy and priorities. So, going forward, at least through the election and likely the inauguration, right? Because, if there's a lame duck period that persists, that he might -- Netanyahu perceive that he has he has leeway now to act as he sees fit to the great frustration of U.S. officials.
