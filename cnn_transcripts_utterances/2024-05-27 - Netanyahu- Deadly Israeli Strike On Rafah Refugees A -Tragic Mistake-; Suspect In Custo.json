Some 200 others were wounded in the strike. The Israeli military claims that it did kill two senior Hamas officials.",

      "sentences": "Well, the sights and sounds of this strike last night in east -- in western Rafah are just absolutely horrific. Forty-five people working killed, hundreds more were wounded in a strike that hit a displaced person's camp in western Rafah.This is not one of the areas that the Israeli military had ordered people to evacuate. That was eastern Rafah. So, indeed, many people have been fleeing to this area and the surrounding area as well. And very quickly, people in this displaced person's camp found out that there is truly nowhere safe in Gaza. The sounds of women shouting as flames were just absolutely engulfing this entire camp last night. Children among those killed and injured. Horrific images, including one child with burns all over his body. But the Israeli government and its military, in a very rare admission, are now calling this a \"tragic mistake.\" That's the Israeli prime minister. And the Israeli military is going a step further, saying that they are going to investigate this incident with the Israeli military s top lawyer launching an investigation in a very formal manner. In a statement, the Israeli military actually said that they had conducted a pre-strike assessment and believed that no civilians would be harmed during the course of this the strike. Which was designed, and successfully, according to the Israeli military, to take out two senior Hamas members responsible for coordinating Hamas activities in the West Bank. Now, amid all of this, of course, there is growing international outrage at Israel's actions in Rafah. In particular, just days ago, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to stop its military operations in Rafah. Clearly, that is not something that the Israeli government is choosing to do. But now Qatar, one of the key mediators in these ceasefire negotiations, says that they are concerned that this latest strike in Rafah could hinder further negotiations. For now, at least, though, we expect that negotiations are set to resume tomorrow in Cairo. That's according to an Egyptian official. But it's not clear yet whether the gap between Israel and Hamas has been bridged yet. Major differences, including whether or not this -- these negotiations will lead to an end to the war still very much remain.",

We just saw condemnation today by the top European Union official Josep Borrell.So we're seeing a number of cases of people around the world urging him to stop. And of course, the prime minister himself said that even if there is a ceasefire order, it's not sure in his mind that that would stop the operation in Rafah. So, no, he considers this central to wiping out Hamas. I understand why he views it that way. He's probably right about that. The question is, is it worth the humanitarian cost? That's the cost benefit analysis. And that, of course, would go to the center of these threatened prosecutions as well for war crimes.",

First, Egypt started off this effort in October after the terror attacks, fundamentally, on Israel side.Remember, Egypt was the first Arab state to reach an agreement with Israel, a peace agreement years ago. And so having their cooperation was critical. Now we're seeing firing across that border. And while I don't think this is going to turn into a full-scale conflict, it's pushing in that direction. The second thing to remember, Boris, is that it was six weeks ago that American officials thought they were this close to an agreement on a ceasefire, and the blame for the fact that didn't happen primarily falls on Hamas. But it's hard to believe that if Hamas wouldn't reach this deal six weeks ago that they're going to reach it today. Because I think their leader, Sinwar, among others must come to the conclusion that the Israelis are doing so much damage to their own reputation internationally that maybe it's in his benefit to let this continue on. And so it's a really hard complication -- calculation for the Hamas leadership.",

MATT WINER, HOST, \"TNT SPORTS TONIGHT\": Yes, Boris and Jessica, if there were a Hall of Fame within the basketball Hall of Fame, something set aside for the truly elite players the game has ever seen, Bill Walton would be a part of that. One of the greatest college players ever. A three-time national player of the year, twice a national champion at UCLA where his teams won 88 straight games at one point. He had one of the greatest national championship-game performances of all time back in 1973. Hit 21 of 22 shots and scored 44 points to help beat Memphis State. That was before he landed in the NBA where he was a two-time NBA champion, once with the Portland Trailblazers, still their only title, back and 77. And again, as a sixth man coming off the bench with the Boston Celtics in 1986. He was a league MVP, was a six man the year, very different roles. And despite the fact that he was plagued by injuries, had a great pro career as well. Truly, one of the elite players in the game's history.",
