Either it's all green and everybody's happy, or you're doing the delays at the airport or somewhere where things are backed up.Right now, here in Atlanta, 75/85 behind me, near the connector, with so much traffic. Today, it's been actually pretty light. People are getting on to where they have to go. We know the peak times, anytime before 10:00 a.m. is a good time to travel. But AAA is expecting more than 70 million people to hit the roads this year. That's more than a million more than last year. Some of that has to do with gas prices. Look, the average right now is $3.07. Last year this time it was $3.25. But you can't talk about travel at all without thinking about the airport. And we know the TSA is going to get crushed today. There are going to be millions of more people at the airport. We talked to some travelers at the airport who are getting ready for all the expectations and those long security lines. Take a listen.

I mean he has repeatedly held up tariffs as kind of a magical negotiating tool that can be used against friends and foes alike to get better deals.And look, we don't know how this is going to actually play out. Will he impose these tariffs that he's threatened? Will he be able to bring Canada, Mexico, China to the negotiating table and get a better deal? Maybe. But we do know that tariffs have at least the potential to create confusion and chaos for businesses and to increase costs for all of us as consumers because, remember, tariffs are taxes on imports. And we buy a lot of stuff from a lot of these countries. Look at Canada. We've imported hundreds and billions of dollars of stuff from Canada. Just last year alone, everything from oil and minerals, to cement. And it's hard to see how slapping a 25 percent tariff on Canadian oil will make it cheaper to fill up your tank at the gas station, or a 25 percent tariff on wood and cement, how is that going to make it any cheaper to build homes? It probably won't. It could actually make it more expensive. And likewise, I mean, a lot of people are frustrated with how expensive it is at the supermarket. But we buy significant amount of certain crops, certain food from Mexico. For example, 89 percent of the imports of avocado from Mexico, 91 percent of the tomatoes that get shipped into the United States also come from Mexico. We rely on Mexico for autos and auto parts as well. And then, of course, there's China, where the U.S. imports a lot of different goods, everything from furniture and electronics to toys. And again, the risk, of course, is that the costs end up going up for all of those materials. You see sporting equipment and paint and lamps as well. And look, I think at the end of the day, all of this is another reminder that Trump really means business when he talks about tariffs, right? These were not just empty campaign threats. As one analyst put it this morning, Trump 2.0 is all gas, no brakes. And, John, look, despite all the focus on Trump's cabinet picks, including his relatively moderate Treasury pick in Scott Bessent. At the end of the day, it's Trump alone that is calling the shots, especially on tariffs.",

They're not - and when - when Donald Trump says, and he said this a lot during the campaign, I'm going to impose it on China, tariffs are actually imposed on consumers, right, because it's not the government of Mexico or Canada or China that are going to be paying this. It is consumers when we go to the grocery store. It is consumers when we buy a new house. And the things that people complain the most about, the price of eggs, the price of groceries, the price of housing, the price of cars, those things are precisely what will be the most affected if we, in fact, go into a trade war.",
