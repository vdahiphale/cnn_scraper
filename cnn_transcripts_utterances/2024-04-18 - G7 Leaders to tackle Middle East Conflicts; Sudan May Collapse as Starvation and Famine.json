And we have to remember that when the war broke out with Hamas on October 7th, it came on the heels of about a year of a severe rupture within Israeli society over proposed judicial reform, if you recall, that the prime minister and his coalition were trying to push through. But I don't think that this is all just about what's happening internally, right? Israel today is the country that is most attacked and most threatened in the world. We have five active fronts as we speak, where Israel is being attacked, Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, where you had 18 soldiers just yesterday severely wounded from anti-tank missiles and suicide drones. We have the Houthis in Yemen who are firing still drones and missiles into Israel and, of course, Iran and Iraqi and Syrian militias.

And Israel has yet to retaliate. People are concerned legitimately, I think, that this policy of containment, of not retaliating will only invite Iran to think that it can do this again. On the other hand, there are those within the cabinet who are listening to what the Americans and the British and the French and other G7 friends of Israel are telling us, which is don't retaliate. The interception of those missiles and drones was a win. You were able to do it successfully with this new collective regional alliance which involved the Jordanians and the Saudis and others. That's the big win to show in defiance of Iran that the region stands together. Don't escalate things and focus on what you have to do, which is finish up the Gaza Strip. So Netanyahu is really trying to thread a very difficult needle, I would say, through this whole situation. On the one hand, wrap up the war in Gaza.

But whatever it is, when you don't have that basic trust, which you need between a prime minister and a president, you need between two governments, especially when facing the magnitude and scope of threats that Israel faces, that's going to be a handicap.

In one of the latest strikes, eight children are among those killed at a refugee camp in central Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond spoke with a family of one of the youngest victims. And we just want to warn you, his report does contain graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A moment frozen in time, the bodies of at least four children splayed around a foosball table, laughter and shrieks of joy silenced in an instance. Blood now marking where they stood only minutes earlier. Shahid, no way. Shahid, my beloved. Her cousin screams from behind the camera. Ten-year-old Shahid is one of those children. Her bright pink pants unmistakable in the arms of the man carrying her away. With her family's consent, CNN has decided to show Shahid in life and death in order to give a face to this war's deadly impact on children. At Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, those who can still be saved arrive alongside those who cannot. Amid the chaos, Shahid's pink pants dangling as a doctor confirms what is tragically obvious. But Shahid is not alone. She is one of eight children who died on that crowded street in Al-Maghazi. The hospital says they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. By publication time, the Israeli military said only that the incident is under review. One after another, their small bodies arrive at the hospital's morgue and into the arms of grieving parents. His eyes swollen and red, the father of nine-year-old Lujain recounts his daughter's last moments playing foosball with her friends. This is my eldest daughter, he says. A drone strike hit them while they were playing. They're all children. Hours earlier, Yusuf was one of those children playing alongside Shahid and Lujain when he was suddenly killed in a war he did not choose. His mother still clinging to her son. Neither does this boy who cannot believe his brother is dead. He is still alive, he cries. Don't leave him here. Amid the outpourings of grief, there is Shahid, her blood stained pink pants once again impossible to miss. Dear God, what did they all do? One man cries. What did they all do?

One found Trump liable for sexual abuse.And among the other legal run-ins Trump has had, they also want to focus on a judge sanctioning him for filing a frivolous lawsuit against Hillary Clinton. They also want to be able to ask him about a settlement that the Trump Foundation had with the New York attorney general's office in which Trump agreed to dissolve his foundation. And lastly, they want to ask him about the criminal convictions of two Trump entities for tax fraud in 2022. Trump's side has signaled that they're going to challenge this. The judge said he will hold a hearing over this issue before he rules whether any of this will come in. He said that could be as soon as Friday afternoon if they wrap up jury selection in time.
