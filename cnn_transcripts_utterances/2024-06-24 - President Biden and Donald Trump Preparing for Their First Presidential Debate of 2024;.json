In this case, the emergency exit itself is not going anywhere. Its' simply docked there. Now, they say it's out an abundance of caution the two astronauts who went up on it. So the spacecraft handled wonderfully. They feel very good about this. But there are very serious questions to wonder about this as they try to figure out they work around these spacewalks. They have going on up there. They can stay up there for quite some time. It's not like the clock is running out really fast.But you know there have to be serious questions here about is there any inherent danger and bringing it back do they have the autonomous ability to bring the spacecraft back, this one back without these people on board, and then somehow change the entire schedule to get those two back later on. This is more serious than it appears, although, to be fair, NASA and Boeing are trying to say right now, they're working through it. They hope it's not serious at all.",

They betrayed that oath that they took when they went into office. And we would we would not be in this moment but for Donald Trump. He's the one that put these justices on the court. Regardless of the 18 different positions he has taken over the years, he is absolutely front and center on the road to an all-out national abortion ban.

I think it's a very stark choices as we think about everything from the right to make our own decisions about our bodies to American manufacturing to an economy that is growing and more people who are in work getting paid well. There's still more good work to do, and that's why I'm thrilled to be supporting President Biden. But I think that that's the choice that we have today is the choice between two baby boomers.

He has surrounded himself by incredibly competent, smart people who are leading our country forward.I think that the chaos of the Trump years will come back into focus for people. It seems like a long time ago, but four years ago a lot has happened, and I think that this opportunity is one to remind people, we've got a president who is really seeing the resurgence of American manufacturing, onshoring supply chains, giving people opportunity in this economy to make a good living. At the end of the day, I think that's the most important thing that people will be reminded of in this, in this matchup.
