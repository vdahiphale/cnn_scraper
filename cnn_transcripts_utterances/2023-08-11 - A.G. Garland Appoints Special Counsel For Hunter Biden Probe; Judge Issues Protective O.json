I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. And good evening, tonight. We start with tonight's big story, which was news that we learned, today, regarding the Special Counsel, investigating Hunter Biden. It is the same person, who has been investigating him for several years now, David Weiss, a U.S. attorney, who was appointed, I should note, by former President Trump. But today, we heard, from Attorney General, Merrick Garland, who announced that David Weiss has now asked to be made Special Counsel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(END VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS: And joining me now, for a first exclusive interview, since that announcement, from the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, today, is one of Hunter Biden's attorneys, Abbe Lowell. Abbe, thank you, for being here, tonight. First, just when did you find out, about the Attorney General's announcement, today? Did you have any idea that this was coming? ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S ATTORNEY: I think all of us found out at about the time that you all started finding out, which was somewhere between mid-morning, and the time that the Attorney General spoke. And while we didn't know that was going to happen, given what's been happening, in the case, it wasn't a surprise that there would be some announcement, to see where this case, and the investigation, would go, from here.",

The Attorney General and Mr. Weiss both has said for weeks, months, that he had all the authority he needed, to bring any charge that was merited, at any time that was appropriate, in any place that made sense. And so, the power that a Special Counsel has is the power that he has had. So, from a practical point of view, nothing really changed. His title may change. But you also need to remember the most important fact. And you alluded to it already. After five years of what has to be one of the most thorough investigations, that office has ever done, started by a Republican Attorney General, given to a Republican U.S. attorney, using an experienced career set of prosecutors thought that the only charges that were appropriate, would be two misdemeanor failure to file charges, and a diverted gun charge, for the 11 days that Hunter possessed a gun. And that was after five years of painstaking investigation. So, whatever his title is, and whatever happens next, we're confident that that should be the same conclusion. And if it's not, then something other than the facts, and the law has come into play.",

I am confident that if the prosecuting office follows the facts and the law, as they were prepared to say, they've done, when they came to court, on July, the 26th? That there should be no different conclusion than what they already came. And if, for whatever reason, we end up in a place, where there's something different? We know by the nature of the history of this investigation, that it did not come about, because of any new evidence, any new law, or any new fact.

So, as to what interpretation of the agreement made the most sense? I turn that question to you to answer it. So, there's only a few comp -- possible answers to the dilemma. Either, there was a garbled communication, between the sides? Possible.

But we understand that high-profile subjects of investigations get more scrutiny. But that doesn't change the fact that once the mistake was identified, Hunter wasn't running away from it.

We've had Iniki and Iwa and of course, volcanic eruptions, on Hawaii Island. We've had floods. We've had a few wildfires, but nothing that attacked a town like this. So, it just wasn't in sort of the realm of possibility that wildfires, in West Maui, would essentially jump the highway, and attack the town of Lahaina, within a matter of less than an hour. And if you see these videos, on social media, it's really true. People had to make very quick choices, to evacuate. Some of them, just directly into Lahaina. Harbor, with their families. Five people hanging onto a surfboard, waiting for the Coast Guard. So, there may be improvements that the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency or anyone else needs to look at making, on a going-forward basis. But this was really unprecedented. I do think this is likely to be the new normal, with extensive droughts, that we need to be prepared for wildfires, not just in Hawaii, but across the country. But, right now, we're still recovering. We are -- that there is still -- we're not -- we haven't gotten the fire totally under control. We do not know the death count. And Lahaina Town is also a toxic mess, right now, until we're able to clear the debris. COLLINS: Yes, I mean, we're waiting to learn more about that.
