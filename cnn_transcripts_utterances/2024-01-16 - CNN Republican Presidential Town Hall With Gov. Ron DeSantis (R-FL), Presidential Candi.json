      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to New Hampshire, home to the first Republican presidential primary of 2024 just one week from today.We're live here at New England College for CNN's town hall with Republican presidential candidate and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. I'm Wolf Blitzer. Governor DeSantis is one of three Republicans left standing in the race for the White House. He's here less than 24 hours after his hard- fought second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, where he narrowly edged out former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, but trailed former President Donald Trump by nearly 30 points. Tonight, Governor DeSantis will answer questions directly from New Hampshire voters on the issues that will help determine who wins the Republican presidential nomination. And I will have some questions of my own. In the audience are voters who say they plan to participate in the New Hampshire Republican primary, both registered Republicans and undeclared voters who aren't registered with either major party, but are still allowed to participate in the primary elections. To find tonight's questioners, we cast a very wide net, soliciting help from various organizations, including business groups, parent groups, young professional organizations, religious groups, and conservative advocacy organizations. Guests of the DeSantis campaign and New England College are also in the audience tonight, but they won't be asking questions. We have asked everyone here to be respectful to each other and to Governor DeSantis, so voters in the room and at home have a chance to hear directly from the candidate. Now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Governor Ron DeSantis. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All right. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) DESANTIS: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)",

We weren't sure how the weather was going to be here in New Hampshire. So he said, why don't we dip into South Carolina, make an appearance, and then come up to New Hampshire? So I think what it says is that we consider New Hampshire, South Carolina, to both be important as well as Nevada, by the way. Nikki Haley, for example, she didn't even get on the Nevada caucus ballot. So she has zero delegates out of Nevada. No matter what happens, I'm competing for delegates. And, yes, the party went to a caucus to try to rig it for Trump. But, you know, as Republicans, it's not always going to be fair for us. You got to be willing to fight in all these situations. So we're doing that. So I think all three of those states are all going to happen over the next six weeks. And I think that'll be really, really important. But clearly, the tradition here with First in the Nation, I think is something that's very significant. I agreed to do a debate with WMUR and ABC on Thursday and with CNN on Sunday. I'm the only candidate that actually agreed to come to New Hampshire to debate. And what does that say? We have four candidates for president now, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and me. I'm the only one who's not running a basement campaign at this point. You deserve as a voter to have the candidates come up, answer your questions in forums like this. Have somebody like Wolf moderated debate where you go back and forth. And I think we've gone away from -- and obviously Donald Trump didn't debate the whole time. We've gone away from, hey, let's make -- let people make these decisions to almost like, you know, just let the media coverage determine what's going on. I don't think that's what we want in a Republican form of government.",

It's like, you know, with Hillary, we're not going to get anything I believe in.With Trump, even though he had a liberal past, I was like, you know, maybe we can get some good stuff. And to his credit, he did have some good policies. And I support him, of course, for re-election in 2020, even though we had disagreements. For example, I disagreed with him turning over the government to Dr. Anthony Fauci during COVID. That created huge problems for this country. And Donald Trump and Dr. Fauci plunged our nation into a lockdown. We in Florida dragged this country out of lockdown. We made sure schools were open. We made sure businesses were open. We opposed any type of forced COVID-19 vaccines. And so those are just big-time differences. You know, Donald Trump did not fire Dr. Fauci, of course. I know most Republicans think that should have happened. And his explanation was that while the media and the left would have gotten upset at him, which is absolutely true. But you know what? As a leader, you got to be willing to stand in there, do what's right, and take the heat. I can tell you, when we were fighting in Florida in those early days to have schools open, have businesses open, all that, I was getting an immense amount of pressure from the media, attacked by the left, even by people in my own party. I had a lot of supporters of mine that said, you need to reverse course because they are -- they are filleting you, and your political career isn't going to be long for this world. But you know what? A leader is going to put the interests of the people, their jobs and their freedoms, ahead of protecting his own political hide.

The federal debt recently topped a staggering $34 trillion. Washington's spending as if there are unlimited resources which place -- places our future and that of future generations at risk.

I'll tell you, as commander-in-chief, it'll be meaningful to me, and I will have -- I will have his back.Look, this is a problem, we have to be honest as Republicans. It has not just been the Democrats. Both parties have spent and borrowed and printed money, particularly since COVID. They went on a massive printing and spending binge. And so, you need a president that's going to go out there and is going to be a force for more restrained spending. That means you've got to be willing to use your veto pen to veto some of these grotesque spending bills. In Florida, I vetoed -- I have a line-item veto, which I'll get to in a minute, because I think that would be good for the president. I vetoed 3 percent of the budget one year. That's part of the reason we were able to pay down debt in the state of Florida. So, you have to do that. But it -- it requires leadership. You've got to set priorities. I do think we should have a balanced budget requirement in the United States Constitution. I know they've come close to passing that. But here's why it's good. In Florida we have it. I -- I presume you have it in New Hampshire. You go into a legislative session, it's not even a question you're going to balance the budget. So you have to make choices. You're forced to make choices. Now, it's always in their political interest, the members of Congress, to charge it on the credit card. Because if they reduce spending, some people wouldn't like that. And so you have to do that. So I'm in favor of a balanced budget amendment through the states, because I don't know that Congress would do it. I'm also in favor of term limits for members of Congress, because their -- their number one priority is to stay in office for 30-40 years. That's not the right incentive. And I do think the president should have a -- a line item veto. That means you can have budget bill on your desk, and you can veto individual pork barrel items or any item you want without having to veto the entire spending bill. Right now they pass these massive spending bills, the president's choice is to fund nothing or to fund everything. I don't want your money going overseas to do things like promote transgenderism in Bangladesh, and yet that has happened with your tax dollars, and it's wrong, and we need to put a stop to it.

What is your plan for dealing with deporting, making citizens of or other avenue of dealing with the people who currently are held in limbo as to their status in the United States? BLITZERproblem that's compounded for decades. And so, here's my policy. One, the number of people that will be amnestied is zero. We cannot do an amnesty in this country. That will just invite more people to come illegally. We saw that in '86 when they did that, it didn't work. We are going to deport people who are here illegally and we'll do that through routine interior enforcement. We're also going to do it by empowering states to enforce immigration law. Someone comes across the border in Texas or from Canada and in New Hampshire for that matter, why should -- why shouldn't the state authorities or the local sheriff be able to just deport them back across the border? Instead, they come in. They get turned over to Border Patrol. They get a sheet of paper saying come back for a hearing in two years? That is not a deterrent. So, yes, I support a border wall. But if you don't have interior enforcement, you're going to continue to have this problem. So we are going to do that and we are going to make sure that the rule of law prevails. (APPLAUSE)",

I don't think we can have in the United States. You know, we have situations where just the practicality of this -- New York City had to close a school. You literally have kids told don't go to school because they commandeered the school to be able to house illegal aliens. Talk about putting the American people last, that is not what you want to do. So I don't think we can just have -- if you think about rent prices and housing prices, we don't have enough construction in this country as is. So, you have millions more people coming in. That puts us -- that puts the screws on the housing. So, you have to enforce the law. We're going to definitely start with those Biden folks because I think it was reckless that he led all these people in illegally. And you know what? It's not just people coming from Mexico or Central America. Yes, there's a lot from Central America. They're from over a hundred different countries -- China, Middle Eastern countries, Russia. And you know what a lot of it is? Military age males. Do you think that's going to be a benefit for this country to have those folks coming in that we know nothing about?

Now, I am going to empower the states to be able to enforce immigration law.

And, you know, I was born and raised in Florida, so I grew up playing baseball, but where I grew up in the Tampa Bay area, people are now crazy about hockey because the Lightning have been so good over many, many years. And it's good to -- good to have your question.Incidentally, there aren't very many Floridians who come north in January. Usually the north comes down to my state. I got negative temperatures in Iowa, and this isn't quite as cold, but there's a lot of snow and everything, and I think my blood is starting to get a little bit thicker having done all this. So here's a couple things. One, what I -- when I've talked to young people, particularly young families, they can't afford things like buying a new home right now. Interest rates have gone up. We've had inflation. The average monthly mortgage payment of an average price home today is probably about twice as much as it would have been five years ago. People aren't making twice as much money as they were five years ago. So we're going to get inflation down, and we're going to get interest rates down. And I think that's going to be really, really important. The other thing that we're going to do is we're going to provide help with the student loans, but not the way the Democrats want. I think it's wrong that taxpayers would have to pick up the burden on somebody's student loan, like, you made the decision to do it; to say that a truck driver should have to pay off the loan of somebody that has a degree in Zombie Studies, no, we're not going to do that. However, the universities have facilitated a lot of the -- the debt. Because they're happy if you're going six years to get a four-year degree because you get more loans; they can do it; they -- they grow their administrative budgets. So we're going to have the universities be responsible for backing the student loans. [21:25:04] What that's going to do, that's going to change the incentives. Universities are going to have an incentive to graduate people on time, or even early, and to get them in programs that they're going to be gainfully employed. So, you're going to have less zombie studies. You're going to have more engineering. You're going to have more things that are practical. And I would say this too. And there's some -- obviously, some great colleges in New England, but a four -- a degree from a four-year brick-and-Ivy university is one way you can be successful. It is not the only way. And we need to tell young people that there are multiple pathways, including work force education and the skilled trades. And if you look, what we have done in Florida, we have increased apprenticeships. We have doubled the number of apprenticeships. We're increasing certifications at a high school. You can get certified in aviation mechanics. You can get certified in welding, HVAC, electrical, all these things. There's a demand for this. You have zero debt. You go into the work force. And what we find is, because our state's growing, some of these folks, they work for a few years and then they start their own businesses. So there's great opportunities for entrepreneurship. I was told when I was growing up, if you don't get that college degree, you're not going to be successful. That really isn't true. So let's have a more balanced approach. Let's understand that these skilled trades provide great opportunities for young people. And it's also important for our economy. I want a better industrial base in this country. I want more manufacturing. We have increased manufacturing jobs in Florida by 100,000 since I have been there. Let's do that across this country.",

We're at the lowest level since at the end of the Vietnam War when they got rid of the draft. So some people said maybe you do it.I think the way you solve that -- that problem is to inspire young people to want to join. I do think when they see commander-in-chief hold the brass accountable, because no one's been held accountable for Afghanistan, not one person has been held accountable for one of the worst military debacles in American history. When they see us getting rid of some of the social stuff and the woke ideology, saying, no, it's about mission first, and you're going to be promoted based on merit, that, I think, inspires people to want to join. You know, when you join the military, you're writing a check for an amount payable to the United States of America, for an amount up to and including your life. You don't know where they are going to send you. You don't know what contingencies are going to happen. But you want to know that the people in charge of both the civilian and military levels are only going to do that if it's to pursue the mission. And they're not going to let these other considerations cloud that out. And so, I'll be a president that will do that. We're going to increase recruiting. And I'll also -- I'll be the first president elected since 1988 who served in a foreign war. So I'll be able to say -- you know, John Kennedy said, you can look back on your life with a great deal of pride and say, I served in the United States Navy. That inspired a lot of people. Ronald Reagan said, some people spent a lifetime wondering whether they've made a difference, U.S. Marines don't have that problem. So I'm going to be a voice to tell young people that pursuing a career in the military is a noble calling.",

But we're also going to harness all the resources that are in our country outside of -- of government. And this is a model we've used in Florida. And we're going to use it for veterans. So we -- we have something called the CarePortal. We recruit military groups, charities, churches, businesses, individuals. So you go to the V.A., you need -- maybe you have post-traumatic stress, you need something, maybe the V.A. helps you, but that immediately goes out to all these organizations. So, for example, in Florida, we have an organization, K9s For Warriors, they train service dogs to be matched with a veteran that has post-traumatic stress. The dog understands the symptoms and can help mitigate. And guess what? The suicide rate with those veterans plummets. It may be as simple as an individual that wants to volunteer that -- that lives in your town and they say, you know what, I'll go to this veteran's home, he's having a tough time, knock on the door, hey, I just want you to let you know, I care about you, I thank you for your service, is there anything to do? Can I take you to lunch? That right there could -- could avoid a suicide. So we've got a lot of resources. Every part of this country appreciates the service of our military men and women and the veterans, and let's harness that. So government can't solve all these problems, but what government is it can be a facilitator so that a veteran gets the resources that they need. When I left active duty, I was given a packet with all these veterans benefits, it was bureaucracy. I didn't understand what -- what that was. Let's cut through the red tape, cut through the bureaucracy, and harness all of these great resources that are available.",

And that wasn't always easy for me as a kid. I'd get upset if I didn't get a hit. But you learn how to do that, and you learn how to come back next time. You also learn, it's a combination of individual sport but also a team sport. When you're in that batter's box, no one else can do it but you. You see the ball; you hit the ball; you either do it or you don't. But then, in the grand scheme of things, you know, you need to be able to get runners on base; you need to have people drive people in; you need to play good defense; you need to do that. So it's a combination of individual initiative as well as a team sport. And I've told this story a couple times up here.

People didn't necessarily know. And I've never actually been asked to kind of clear the air on that. And here's what's happened. I think it shows the type of leader I am.In Florida, we saw the COVID stuff being used to deprive people of their rights. And we took a stand against that. We said past protections, you can't have to choose between a shot you don't want and a job you need. And we also -- we're not going to have COVID-19 vaccine passports where you're discriminated against based on your status of whether you decided to take this shot or not. Well, we hosted the Special Olympics one year. And lo and behold, the international bureaucracy that oversees that imposed a COVID vax mandate on the athletes. Well, one, that violated Florida law. But, two, I had families frantically coming to our office, saying that their -- their kids are not going to be able to participate in this. And that was wrong. So we said we're going to enforce the law against you if you discriminate against these athletes. And we ended up getting all of the athletes that wanted to, to be able to compete. And that had a huge impact on people's lives. This summer, I'm walking around the Iowa State Fair, and I get -- I get a big hug from a family because we made sure their son, who had unique abilities, was able to compete in the Special Olympics. That is how you use your position of authority to ensure that people are able to realize their dreams. They wanted to exclude those people based on these ridiculous mandates. I stood up and said, no, not on my watch, everybody gets to compete. (APPLAUSE)",
