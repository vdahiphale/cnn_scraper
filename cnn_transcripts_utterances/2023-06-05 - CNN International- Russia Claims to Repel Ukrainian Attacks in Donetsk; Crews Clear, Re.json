Just ahead, Moscow claims it has repelled a large scale offensive from Ukrainian forces in the Southern Donetsk area. We'll get the latest on what Kyiv is saying.Also ahead an investigation is underway for the cause of a devastating rail crash in India. CNN is on the scene and heard from survivors of the disaster. And China accused the U.S. of provocation after a near collision of warships in the Taiwan Strait. More details in just a moment. Still unclear when, where or how Ukraine's highly anticipated counter offensive will begin or if it's already underway. But Russia claims without any evidence that its forces repelled a large scale offensive in the Southern Donetsk region over the weekend. Ukraine says it has no information about any major attack in the area. Kyiv meanwhile reiterates that it won't be giving Moscow any clues about its military plans with this powerful social media post. The soldier is calling for a strategic silence. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us live in the Ukrainian capital. What's going on Fred?",

      "sentences": "Are there Max. Well, it was late last night when the Russian Defense Ministry came out and said that they had reported that they put it this large scale attack and the sort of Southern region of Ukraine near a place called -- which is sort of towards the Melitopol area of Ukraine.And they say that there that there had been a large scale charge by the Ukrainians involving tanks involving infantry fighting vehicles, and of course, infantry itself as well. They did actually put out a drone video of what they said was that incident, seeming to show some armored vehicles, either running into mines or possibly getting hit by artillery. However, the video isn't very long, and it's very difficult to discern what exactly is going wrong there. Now, of course, one of the things that you mentioned is absolutely correct. The Ukrainians have come out and said that they are not going to comment on this matter. They put up that social media video, basically, with people saying to be quiet that they are not going to talk about their big counter offensive plans. And certainly are not going to make a big announcement when the counter offensive starts. Now, there's a Russian official from that area from the Zaporizhzhia area of Ukraine, who came out today and also said that there was an ongoing attempt by the Ukrainians to break through the Russian lines that the Russians obviously believe that the Ukrainians are trying to push through and get all the way down to the Sea of Azov. Now, if they managed to do that, they would be able to cut off Russian forces from their land corridor to Crimea. That would obviously be a big deal. However, at this point in time, it doesn't appear to be anywhere near there right now. But certainly it does appear as though something is up even though the Ukrainians are not commenting on it at this point in time. Certainly, from what we've seen, Max, over the past days, really and over the past weeks, almost is that right now, the Russians do seem to be on the back foot on most parts of the frontline in Ukraine, and also in Russia as well. You have of course, the Russians really advancing nowhere here inside Ukraine. And then you have those issues that the Russians have been having over the past couple of days in the Belgorod area of Russia, where there have been some cross border attacks by anti-Putin Russian fighters who normally fight on the side of the Ukrainians, but then are on their own. The Ukrainian say when they go into Russia, certainly that situation there seems to be ongoing and the latest information that we're getting is that there has been shelling in that area again today.

Among the crowd here a worried mother, she's still searching for her missing son who was a passenger on the train.

I'm blessed to have another chance at life says Monto Kumar, the 32 year old said the collision felt like an earthquake. Afterwards, I took my shirt and wrapped it around my head and started looking for my friends he says. Kumar says he shared an ambulance with his friend who lost both legs and later died.

As seen by that video released from the U.S. Navy. It's no surprise China is blaming the U.S. within hours of the incident, China's Defense Minister accused the U.S. of provocation and creating chaos in the region.

And we got to talk about all of that both the personal and the professional significance. But of course, as might be inevitable, much of our conversation focused on Ukraine, and a highly anticipated counter offensive. What are his expectations for that? We pushed him here a bit. He's watched this war now for nearly 18 months. And we asked him, what are his expectations? Does he believe Ukraine is prepared? Ukraine has indicated that it is ready and that its military has finished its planning and preparations and has the equipment that it needs. We asked them how confident is he that Ukraine's counter-offensive will succeed? His answer was a very careful one listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GENERAL MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN OF U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: So I think it's too early to tell what outcomes are going to happen. I think the Ukrainians are very well prepared, as you know very well, the United States and other allied countries in Europe and really around the world. I provided training and ammunition and advice, intelligence, etcetera to the Ukrainians who are supporting them. They're in a war that's an existential threat for the very survival of Ukraine, and has greater meaning to the rest of the world, for Europe, really for the United States, but also for the globe.

More than 100 people are suing MGN with Harry and three other public figures chosen as test cases.Now he claims MGN gathered information about him using unlawful methods including phone hacking, and MGN has admitted that one of its tabloids unlawfully sought information about Harry's on one occasion but it's rejected all of his other allegations saying he has no evidence for his claims. It is very unusual to see a member of the British royal family have been cross examined in court in 2002. Princess Anne did appear in the U.K. court to plead guilty to her dogs bit to children, but wasn't cross examined following this extremely rare event. For all the details are Nada Bashir she's outside the High Court in London. I gather some frustration in the court by the judge that Harry couldn't appear on day one. NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, but it was said to be extraordinary that while he wasn't here on the first day of what is said to be a three day hearing, Prince Harry according to his legal representatives arriving late overnight Sunday he spent the day of course with his daughter it was her second birthday Lilibet. He had expected her to appear in court tomorrow to deliver evidence. So we have had a sense in the last couple of hours from his legal representatives as to what that evidence may look like in those opening statements including some 147 articles which have been submitted as part of Prince Harry's came dating in between early 90s. After 2011 published about Prince Harry including private personal details that they say could only have been obtained through illegal means including details of conversations and arguments between Prince Harry and his brother, the Prince of Wales details around his past relationship with former girlfriend Chelsy Davy as well as details around the goings on at Sandhurst during his days of military training.
