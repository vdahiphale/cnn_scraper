We shouldn't have barged into where we weren't wanted, this man says. Putin saved arguably his biggest message for last, announcing Russia is suspending its participation in the new strategic arms reduction treaty after Moscow last year accused Ukraine of striking an air base for strategic bombers. We know that NATO is complicit in the attempts by the Kyiv regime to strike our air bases. And now they want to come and inspect our bases? While Putin says the treaty could be revived if relations between the U.S. and Russia improve, on this day the gulf between Russia and the west further widened. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  So you can see the view from Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. And actually, Wolf, I did reach out to the Kremlin tonight for some comments on President Biden's speech. And specifically what President Biden said about Ukraine never becoming a victory for Russia. I got some pretty harsh words back from the Kremlin press secretary, Dmitry Peskov. He said it is impossible to talk about destroying Russia without nuclear war and said there would be no winners in a nuclear war. He also says that he firmly believes, like Vladimir Putin apparently also does as well, that it is U.S.'s goal to weaken Russia and the disintegration of Russia as well. Wolf?",

He referenced these hard and bitter days that are still to come. And so I think that was equally part of the message of making sure that people do remain united, highlighting that, while also delivering a message back at home to his domestic audience in the United States about why this matters, why it is important, talking about it being a test for democracy. I think that is why you saw him returning to that theme so many times during his remarks today, saying, yes, this is an affirmation that we were right all along about them staying united but also warning about just how difficult the road ahead could be as they are worried that it is going to come to a standstill potentially.

And so they desperately want to get the weaponry that they believe they need in order to try to deal a decisive blow to Russia.

That's exactly right, Wolf. And as several people have said, the Ukrainians want a fast end to this war. They want to strike decisively, exactly what you said, and that can happen. They're preparing either to hit back as an offensive or even to take the offensive before the Russians can strike. But what they need is the weapons. They clearly need it.

You have to take what's taking place in Ukraine and putting it off to the side, when we are talking about the discussion of the new START talks. The ICBMs, the strategic nuclear capability of both the United States and Russia, those are the two parties. Bear in mind, China is advancing their nuclear ability as well. That needs to be a priority. There must be a way for those discussions to take place irrespective of the conflict in Ukraine. It is very difficult to decouple those. But it is absolutely essential. If one is -- if there is codependency here, then we've got a much larger problem. And it is called potential nuke escalation that's going to get out of control.",

But, ultimately, U.S. officials believe it failed because Putin made no mention of it today during his state of the nation address to the Russian country. Now, we, of course, have seen that Putin has launched these kinds of intercontinental ballistic missile tests before including as recently as last April and he has, of course, announced them when they have gone well. However, this time, U.S. official say is a major clue that he has made no mention of this test in the last day or so indicating that it most likely failed. Now, this is also notable because it indicates that the U.S. and the Russians were communicating through a number of different channels earlier this week ahead of Biden's trip to Kyiv. Of course, we learned from the national security adviser that the U.S. did reach out to the Russians to notify them that President Biden would be traveling to Kyiv. Now, we're learning, Wolf, that the Russians also notified the U.S. that they would be carrying out this missile test.

This forewoman, Emily Kohrs, she went on a bit of a media tour today, a mini media tour. She spoke to a number of outlets, including the Associated Press and The New York Times. And when she was asked by The Times on whether she recommended indicting Donald Trump, whether she and the rest of the grand jury recommended that to prosecutors there, that was her response, you are not going to be shocked, you won't be too surprised. It won't be rocket science. It's not rocket science.So a real wink, wink there, although she's not naming names about what the grand jury decided to do or recommended to the district attorney. So, now we wait. The district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, is considering who actually they are going to charge. We also have not seen much of the report of that special grand jury that Ms. Kohrs was speaking about today other than the fact that they are recommending some indictments at very least, perjury, possible perjury charges of people who testified to them, that they believe may not have been truthful.

There are serious risks, to being out there teasing steps that a grand jury might take.Number one, you could spook witnesses or spook potential defendants into not appearing when their time comes. And number two, you could taint the jury pool in Atlanta when people are hearing that all of these indictments and news are coming.

I think to Elliott's point, perhaps he gets charged. We don't know.Clearly, they recommended charges for a number of people. I think that as she indicated, the jury forewoman, we can probably guess who some of them are, it doesn't mean that we would be right but this has always been an investigation beginning, many, many months ago, that Trump has pointed to privately in conversations with people as the one that he is watching, as one that he is most concerned about. And so by bracing, it is going to be what we've seen, should he get indicted, and, again, that's by no means certain or confirmed. But should he get indicted, you will see him attack the prosecutor in ways that we are used to because Trump only has a handful of speeds (ph).

And for the most part, these were legal fees in cases that had nothing to do with politics. It was the investigation in Manhattan into the Trump Organization, representation there. It was the representation defending him in the Justice Department investigation that's ongoing into his possession of hundreds of classified documents and other presidential records, and the list goes on. And it is a huge constellation of lawyers.It is striking for two reasons, Wolf. I mean, three. One is just the sheer volume. One is the fact that Trump is notorious for not paying lawyers on his own, which gets to the third issue, which is that there is some unsettled debate over whether now that he's a candidate, he can still use that PAC money to pay his own personal legal fees.",
