But boy, it's hard to know, of course now, how this will end up but it certainly feels like an all our time covered Donald Trump that this is the absolute, A, worst timing. But B, just so many Republicans are piling on. Yes, we've seen many moments like this before, when people counted him out in the summer of 2015. But this is different. It feels different. It's a different moment and virtually no Republican that I've talked to, really no Republican that I've talked to and wants Trump to do this tomorrow, even some supporters and advocates of Trump, the timing is just terrible. He's doing it for his purposes. Not the party's purposes.",

That's what Donald Trump says, it's all Mitch McConnell's fault, and he wants Republicans to replace them.At the end of that, if you care to read it is yet another racist smear of Mitch McConnell's wife. So Donald Trump says, hey, I'm a racist. I should be your nominee for Republicans again in 2024. So two questions number one, is this. Mitch McConnell actually facing the trouble in the Senate leadership elections, a number of his members have said let's slow down a little bit until we understand this better. Or number two, you had Larry Hogan yesterday. Jake Tapper today has a fascinating conversation with the Massachusetts governor, much like Larry Hogan, the outgoing Charlie Baker, he's not running. And he says Republicans wake up, you want to win, get rid of the extreme. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. CHARLIE BAKER (R-MA): I think the biggest issue that played out in the midterms is something that I've talked about a lot over the course of the past eight years, which is voters, generally speaking, especially in battleground states aren't interested in extremism. They just aren't. They want people who they believe are going to be reasonable who are going to be collaborative, and who represent sort of the fundamental tenet of democracy that it's supposed to be a distributed decision making model and you're supposed to be OK with that. And I think in the midterms, one of the big lessons that the Republican Party nationally needs to take away from it is voters want collaborative elected officials. They don't want extremes.

I mean, as we've talked about the potential for President Biden to continue to fill out the federal judiciary, if there's another Supreme Court vacancy under his watch, that's something a lot of Democrats have talked about, the Republicans wouldn't be able to block that vacancy until the next presidential election.Now, they are concerned, though, that turnout might be down in Georgia with the Senate no longer up for grabs. And so there's really an effort to try and keep this momentum going because President Biden has certainly talked about the importance of having that extra seat for the balance on committees. So it's no longer an even split.
