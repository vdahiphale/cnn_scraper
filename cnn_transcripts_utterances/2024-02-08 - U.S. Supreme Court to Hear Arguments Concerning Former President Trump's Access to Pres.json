      "sentences": "This is one of the days and one of the cases that will define the Roberts court going forward. It's not just John Roberts, though, up there with the other justices asking questions today. They all will be grappling with the history of the 14th Amendment, how it came to be after the Civil War, an insurrectionist ban saying that people could be ineligible to voted for or on ballots if they took part in insurrection. They also will be looking at the future, the future of the presidency and that office, how to define that office. and they will look at the Constitution, of course, what it says about the presidency.But if you step back for a second, Phil and Poppy, there's a big question here that both sides have to tackle. Can states do this? Can Colorado make the decision within themselves by their Supreme Court? And can other states do similar things to take a candidate off the ballot? In this case, Donald Trump on the 2024 primary ballot in Colorado. Trump's attorneys say if states can do this, it will unleash chaos and bedlam across the country. There are others, voters from Colorado as well as the secretary of state, Jena Griswold in Colorado, who will be arguing that, yes, Colorado can do this. They can apply the law in this way if they choose. There have been lots of people who have popped up in the court already to submit their portions of the arguments, what are called amici briefs. And in those briefs, there are people like other states saying, please, Supreme Court, clarify this somehow so that we all know what to do across the country. This isn't just about Colorado. But as we watch the justices today, they're going to look at these really big questions. One person up there, Ketanji Brown Jackson, she previously has had to deal with January 6th rioters when she was on a much lower court. And one thing that she was saying at the time was that \"If there was a more serious offense in terms of who we are as a society and the democratic order that is at the core of our constitutional scheme, I don't know what is.\" That is her commentary on the insurrection of January 6th. I will watch closely to see if the justices go closely to that idea of insurrection and if Donald Trump can apply or be called an insurrectionist in this case.",

I should also just note as a point of fact, you have been arguing cases like this for a long time, not exactly the same, but about access to being on the ballot. You have also at one point represented the national Democratic Party. I'm glad you are here this morning. You say you can guarantee Trump prevails. Why?DAVID SCHOEN, TRUMP'S DEFENSE LAWYER DURING SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: Well, Trump will prevail in the case. If civil libertarians have their way, in my view, every civil libertarian ought to support his position. It's a matter of process. There are fascinating arguments. Katelyn mentioned them earlier, textual arguments about whether it applies to a president or vice president since they are not named. Whether a president is an officer. There's an 1888 case, 2010 case that suggests they are not. Those kinds of arguments are interesting. But to me, the 14th Amendment itself requires that it be overturned. It's a matter of due process. The 14th Amendment incorporates the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, principles. So for example here, either Section 3 is self-executing or it isn't. We have this Griffins case from 1869 that says it isn't, that it requires federal legislation in order to apply this section. Whether that's required or not, he was being -- using this section to circumvent his civil rights is inappropriate. What I mean by that is this. We have a federal statute, insurrection, 18-USC-2383. They had every opportunity to charge him with that. They never did. They never even presented to a grand jury because they couldn't make out probable cause. If they had, he'd have all of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights available, right to jury trial, burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, all of those rights. He doesn't have those with just a made-up process here. And then who decides? Is it just a non-lawyer in Maine, secretary of state? Is it a judge in Colorado? That's a matter of due process, to get notice of what the charges are, what the mens rea is, all of those things. So I say as a matter of process, it's an easy case, and every civil libertarian ought to hope that the Colorado decision is overturned.",

I feel very strongly that committee is a partisan committee that was ethically checkered in the first place.But again, who makes the finding of fact, and under what standard? That's the problem here. What's the definition of \"insurrection\"? Is it just a single judge who decides and makes these findings of fact? I don't think the court has to get into the finding of fact that was made and overturn that finding of fact. I don't think they have to determine, did he engage in insurrection or not?

It's an interesting argument, and that is a finding from the textual language.But why on earth would President Trump's team want to argue that? So that he wins the election and then afterwards they reinitiate this whole process of trying to bar him from holding office, and they say, your lawyer said that that's what the language provides?

We know from the 1983 case, Anderson versus Celebrezze, landmark ballot access case, that states have a lesser interest in national elections because their action affects what goes on in the country. So I would argue it on the process question, a matter of due process. You don't have to look beyond the 14th Amendment to know that this is a denial of rights by circumventing the safeguards that would be if he were charged under 2382. He wasn't.

And ultimately, they were able to reach the crash site. They found the helicopter in Cleveland National Forest, which is just outside of San Diego. But ultimately, they did find those five marines and have now confirmed they were deceased. The CH-53 helicopter has been involved in a number of incidents over the last decade, at least three, including one in 2018 that was fatal. During the training mission, the same type of helicopter, the same model, it crashed in California as well, and it killed all of the marines on board.

And he did when he ran for leader this last time, he did have a challenge to his position.Now, he easily dispatched that and the people that you see commenting about him in the press today are the same ones who voted against him before, ran against him before, so it's essentially the same faction. But the overall issue is true and that is that the Republican conference has moved a lot and has changed a lot in terms of the policy interest. And a lot of that is, of course, driven by the policy views of Donald Trump. So particularly when it comes to Ukraine, I think there's probably 15 to 20 Republicans available to help move this foreign aid package forward, but that's different than it would have been two, four, or eight years ago. And so, you know, he's presiding over a conference that is experiencing the same flow in terms of policy preferences that the party at large has experienced and we see that on display, really, with this vote on funding the war on Ukraine. Of course Johnson has got it just as bad in the House. I mean, he's got a lot more intransigence on foreign aid in the House, I think, than even McConnell has in the Senate, but this debate within the party is raging, really, in both chambers and really all over the country.",

The conference has moved in a different direction than Leader McConnell, and you lost Roy Blunt and you lost Rob Portman, and you lost that crew of what the Republican Party used to be both ideologically and from an institutional perspective, frankly, it became more like the House with actual House members.And when it comes to the House, if you're Natasha, Mike Johnson, do you want to do this anymore? Is there anybody better? Like people -- what I'm trying to figure out is, I don't understand why they would want to replace him. A challenge makes no sense whatsoever.",

Knowing who was actually pulling the strings in terms of who would be in charge.You know, he's talked about being on the phone with Donald Trump a lot these past few weeks, and that is the reality. This is Donald Trump's party. He is pulling the strings from behind the scenes. And all of this results in people who are disillusioned. Again, I really think that this was a missed opportunity for the Republican Party to do the right thing. If you have faith in your policy vision for America, you could allow the Biden campaign to have a win on immigration and say we still have a better vision on the economy, right, on all of these other things. But I think it reflects a lack of faith in themselves that they think they need to tank this opportunity to move the country forward just so they can have a win in November.",
