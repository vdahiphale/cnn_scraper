It's always wonderful to have you on the show.What's going on with this dynamic between Trump and Nikki Haley? Her voters -- people who voted for her in the primary are the ones that Democrats are trying to turn to their side here at the eleventh hour of the campaign when you see Kamala Harris campaigning with Liz Cheney and others. There's clearly an opportunity there but Trump hasn't done it yet. MEG KINNARD, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS (via Webex by Cisco):  Hey, Kasie. It's good to see you. That question about what is going on with this dynamic between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, that's a question I feel like we've all been asking ourselves for many years now, not just these closing months and weeks of the campaign. But it is really interesting to see the candidate who was the last remaining Republican challenger with Trump in that GOP primary race not out on the trail with him. We see plenty of other also rans from that primary but we're not seeing Nikki Haley. But I think also a lot of context is important to really think about in terms of this. She was part of his administration and clearly served as U.N. ambassador for two years, but also ran against him in this cycle. And trying to figure out how close they really are and what that bad blood is like potentially between the two of them is important to think about. And you -- when you consider all the people who did vote for her in the primaries and caucuses, the 93 delegates that she brought in. Clearly, not nearly enough to come close to really challenging Trump there in that primary race. But still, those are voters, some of whom feel like they're without a home at this point with Donald Trump atop the GOP ticket. Some of them are considering Kamala Harris. Some of them may be sitting out. And seeing Donald Trump saying, \"I beat her really badly -- I don't really need her still at this point\" -- I don't think that's hitting really well with a lot of the people who did back Nikki Haley during this contest.",

That's exactly what she's talking about, I think. And so for him to come and to use those words to try to say no, actually I am standing up for women, I don't know that it came off exactly the way that his advisers certainly would have wanted him to. But for someone like Nikki Haley who did campaign a lot about yes, I am the woman in this contest but also I have a perspective that I bring to this race -- she talked about some of her own struggles with fertility and things like that that really only a female candidate can be talking about. But when she's noting it's some of this verbiage and the way that he's campaigning is something that she finds concerning I think some of her supporters probably do too.

A lot of them may have also overlapped with people who supported a Republican like Nikki Haley in that primary contest. And so they're hoping it will show not only just an ability to appeal to a bipartisan audience for Kamala Harris as a candidate but also to make that argument that she's been saying, especially in recent days, I want to represent everyone. I am not just a Democratic candidate; I want to be the president for everyone. We hear that all the time. But that is -- it's the star power but it is also I think that notion of I can be a president of everybody, not just the people in my party. And this is somebody coming out and saying yeah, I don't like what that party, the Republican Party, has been doing either, so I would be willing to cross the aisle and vote for somebody else.

What is going on?TORRES-SPELLISCY:  So, election law is complicated because of federalism. We have 50 different ways to run elections in each of the 50 states, and we also have 50 state Supreme Courts who are opining on election law. So there is this instinct to sow seeds of doubt through the legal system with lawsuits. The Trump side has a pretty bad record with this.
