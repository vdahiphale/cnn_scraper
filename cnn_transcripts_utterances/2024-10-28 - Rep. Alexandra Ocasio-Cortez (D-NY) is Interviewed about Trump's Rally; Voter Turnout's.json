You were - you were stream - you were hanging out with Tim Walz. You guys were streaming. You called it out last night. Fresh eyes on it this morning. When you see that remark and you see now that comedian responding to you guys - I'll read a bit of it for you. I know you've seen it. But for everyone out there. \"These people have no sense of humor. While the vice presidential candidate would take time out of his busy schedule to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone. Watch the whole set. I'm a comedian, Tim. Might be time to change your tampon,\" is what he ends it with. What do you - what does it mean today? What does it do today? REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): You know, this, honestly, isn't really about a comedian. This is about the Trump campaign. This - those comments and that individual saying those things on that stage, inciting an entire arena of individuals who had been previously incited to commit attacks, like the ones we saw on January 6th by people like Donald Trump, none of that was an accident. These campaign events are put together. They are vetted. That language was vetted by the Trump campaign. That - that person was approved by the Trump campaign because he is speaking on behalf of the Trump campaign. And I think it's really important that people understand that when we see everything that's happening, what is being transmitted and said about Latinos in the United States is exactly what the Trump campaign means. He believes that Latinos, as we've seen, are an unimportant, unvalued and unnecessary part of the United States of America. And when Stephen Miller comes on and talks about America for Americans, he's not even talking about U.S. citizens as Americans. Because Stephen Miller kind of flirts with this idea of taking away U.S. citizenship from people depending on his own personal opinions about what being an American means. And so the Trump campaign is very clearly transmitting who they believe is an American and who they - and who they don't, not based on citizenship, but based on ethnicity and based on their opinion of Donald Trump.",

People in Puerto Rico were left without power for up to a year, over a year. So there's really nothing that's an accident about what was said last night. It is an authentic depiction of how Donald Trump believes and what he thinks about Puerto Rico. He even talked about selling Puerto Rico and brought up the idea of selling Puerto Rico when he was president pf the United States. This is what these people believe. And it's not a joke.",

OCASIO-CORTEZ: I don't think so. And I think that that bears out in the data and the evidence, not just a matter of personal opinion. I worked very closely alongside many of my colleagues across the House Democrats caucus, and they are of all different kinds of political opinions. And frankly I think moderate voters and everyday people see right through some of these scare tactics for what they are. They see how they are exaggerations. They see that these are kind of just baseless attacks. And that's made evident by the fact that I'm proud to be able to support, you know, swing district Democrats.

And this is in the polling, right? Remember, 2020 had record turnout. Feelings towards voting. Certain to vote. Back in 2020 at this point, 88 percent of registered voters said they were certain to vote. Where are we today? It's just 81 percent, John. It's a seven point drop. But that's not the only polling metric in which I'm looking at. How about extremely motivated to vote? At this point in 2020 it was 73 percent. You look now, it's just 65 percent. Again, a high single digit drop. Eight points in this particular case. But it's not just the polling, right? Remember, in 2022, the midterm turnout fell compared to four years before that in 2018. And that Washington top two primary, which is often predictive of what's going to occur in the general election, back in August, the turnout there fell versus four years ago. So, when you're looking at polling, when you're looking at these different metrics, all of them look just weaker compared to four years ago. But, to me, the polling here, which is oftentimes quite predictive, is the most important nugget where we see fewer people saying they're certain to vote and fewer people saying they're extremely motivated to vote, John.",

If you look at likely voters, it's still Harris by a point.Now, what's interesting here, of course, if you look historically, normally Republicans actually benefit with lower turnout. If you look at the polling earlier this year, as the Democratic coalition becomes more and more educated, it would have said that Harris would have done better with slightly lower turnout. But in the polling right now, it does not seem to me that either side would necessarily benefit.

At the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, we've spent the last year-and-a-half or so getting law enforcement with election officials, getting them to train together, getting them to learn from each other, finding out how they can help each other so that when people come to vote, they are voting in an atmosphere that's safe, it's secure, it's accessible, and that they get to have their voice heard without any type of coercion or interference.
