ABC News' George Stephanopoulos joins us ahead. And more breaking news this evening, the latest in the attempted assassination of Slovakia's prime minister caught on camera. Good evening. We start with our breaking news about how the former president's attorney is expected to go after Michael Cohen when cross- examination in the New York criminal hush money trial continues tomorrow. Days after legal analysts criticized defense attorney Todd Blanche's initial approach, and the New York Times noted that his questions produced no gotcha moment, aside from a reprimand from the judge at the outset for making the cross about himself. I'm joined now by John E. Jones III, former chief judge for the U.S. Middle District of Pennsylvania, former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin, Norm Eisen, former counsel to House Democrats during the former president's first impeachment. He's also the author of \"Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial.\" He's been in the courtroom throughout, as has our correspondent, Kara Scannell, who has tonight's breaking news. So what have you learned about what's going to happen tomorrow?",

They just want to undercut his credibility. And one thing that they're going to look at are some of the past statements he's made under oath, and that is because he's under oath now. So they want to say to the jury, he has lied before under oath. You shouldn't believe him now.And they got into a little bit of it with his past admission that he has pleaded guilty before Congress. But at the civil fraud trial, Michael Cohen, under cross-examination by Trump's lawyers, said that he had lied to a federal judge when he pled guilty to tax fraud. And he has said publicly that repeatedly. So that is an area they're going to focus on because they want to suggest to the jury that they can't believe the story. So much of this could come down to whether the jury believes Michael Cohen. And so the name of the game tomorrow is really to try to show that he's a liar who can't be trusted. They're also going to focus on the conversations that Cohen says he had with Donald Trump because he's the only one that was involved in those conversations and the only witness to testify that Trump knew and approved this repayment scheme involving - calling it a retainer. No other witness has testified to that. So it's kind of a twofold thing. They want to say that he shouldn't be believed and to just raise questions about any of these recollections that he's had of conversations with Donald Trump.",

He knows that he has to cross this hurdle. The whole predicate of the Trump campaign, and you saw it reflected in that tweet, is that Biden is old and enfeebled and incapable of being president.[20:15:01] And the debate is the hurdle that he has to cross. He needs to dispel that notion in that debate and they need - they know they need to take care of that - to take that opportunity. But they also, I thought, negotiated very, very wisely. Trump was eager for it. He kept saying, I'll debate him anytime, anywhere and they took him up on it. And now they've got a debate that's not going to be in Roman coliseum, but in a television studio without an audience, which disadvantages Trump. And it's early, which gives you a chance to, uh, recover if the debate is not good. We - some of us who are old enough to remember, remember 1980 when Jimmy Carter debated Ronald Reagan once, and he did it a week before the election. The debate didn't go well for Carter and the race was over. I think, Biden understands that history. So getting early debates and getting them out of the way is also very wise, I think.",

I think that when you, when you speak to the people inside the Trump campaign, they honestly believe that Trump will fare better against Biden in these debates than he did in 2020. Obviously they mock Biden's age and ability at every single turn of Trump's campaign. He does it going into the courthouse even, which was notable that Biden referenced that there because he doesn't often talk about Trump's legal cases. And for him to do that in this video was remarkable. But they feel quite confident about it. I do think it's a question though of - sometimes Trump sets the bar so low, as he did with the State of the Union, as he did with the 2020 debates.

We saw a bump from Mitt Romney coming into that first debate of about 4 percentage points. Hillary Clinton saw a bump against Donald Trump about five. Joe Biden saw a bump about four. And I think that sort of, to me, illustrates in my own mind, Donald Trump saying, I really want these debates. But the fact is he's actually fared quite poorly in them. And there's a lot at stake for Donald Trump in these debates because although he's ahead in the polls right now, I'm not quite sure we recognize how tight this race really is in the states that matter. Look at those Great Lake battleground states. Look at those polls that came out from The New York Times-Siena College this - earlier this week. And what we see in those states are very close races, Joe Biden up by a point in one state, Donald Trump up by one another, and up by three in Pennsylvania. So essentially, if we see the bumps that we saw in the prior years and apply them to the polls right now, Joe Biden might be trailing right now, but he may be coming out of those debates, if he does well, leading in the race.",

But on the other hand, you're glad that it does. It is sort of the physical embodiment of harm reduction, something that we've talked about a lot. I will tell you, Anderson, just over the past few years, you've seen drug usage actually go down in the United States. But at the same time, the drugs have gotten stronger. They've gotten deadlier, and they are easier to obtain. I mean, Keith was telling me these kids, they'll get the drugs off social media and they'll pay with Venmo, which is I guess no surprise then that the number of overdoses among adolescents has doubled over the last several years.
