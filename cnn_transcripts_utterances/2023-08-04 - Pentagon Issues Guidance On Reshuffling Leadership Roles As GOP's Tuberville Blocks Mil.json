The defense secretary clearly say, yes, it is affecting the military and affecting other military functions and its ability to lead and move forward. Austin said three and four-star officers and admirals may have to stay in their positions longer. And if possible, do the job above them, do the job in the line of succession above them as they have to fill both roles. We are seeing that. Look at this picture right here. This is a picture of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military's senior officers. Today, with the retirement of the chief of staff of the Army General James McConville, there is another vacant position, right in the bottom left. The picture on the bottom right, that was General David Berger, the commandant of the Marine Corps. He retired last month. And, Jim, there will be another photo vacant in a couple weeks when the chief of the Navy retires. So this problem affecting the military, even at the very top and moving on down.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, U.S. and European officials told us that they absolutely believe that the 2024 U.S. election is playing a significant role in Putin's thinking about how he focuses on the war.They say he wants to wait out the U.S. and European support to Ukraine. He is looking to next November in the hopes that the U.S. people elect someone who is willing to cut off aid and is not going to the same level of funding, the same kind of weaponry we have seen the Biden administration give to Kyiv. One official who is familiar with the intelligence but it pretty bluntly, that Putin is looking for people like former President Donald Trump to take control next year. And he said to us, quote, \"Putin knows Trump will help them and so do the Ukrainians and our European partners.\" Even though we did not see anything explicitly to that effect, you have to assume everyone is thinking it. So while there is no specific U.S. intelligence assessment on his thinking about this, these European and U.S. officials are incredibly worried that this means Putin is not going to relent. He is not going to stop his attacks on these civilian targets we have seen. He will not be willing to come to the negotiating table until he sees what happens next November. Another key factor in this, Brianna, is the Ukrainian counteroffensive, which has not yet made significant gains. Officials say that without those gains, he is likely to be even more confident that he can carry on for another year or more -- Brianna?",

They are trying to go after secrets within the Pentagon, obviously, and our federal contractors. To that extent, we have to do a better job of promoting cybersecurity, not only at the Pentagon, but also in the private sector and making sure that those who are subject to attacks or victims of attacks are willing to share the information about it so we can all be protected.",

And that makes all the sense of the world because they are fighting a war so we do not have to. And the cost of not supporting them far exceeds the benefits of letting them go. So, to that end, I think we have to continue to support them. I am concerned about reports that Vladimir Putin is somehow interested in Donald Trump becoming president as part of his battlefield strategy. I am concerned about what he and the Russians might do to interfere in the upcoming election, not only in the general election, but perhaps even in the primaries on the Republican side.

Around 15,000 workers have been staging rolling strikes as early July. CNN has reached out to Taylor Swift's team for comment. Also, it appears Tupperware is here to stay. The company just reached a deal with its creditors allowing it to reduce its interest payments and secure new financing as it works to pay back more than $300 million in debt. Four months ago, Tupperware cautioned it was close to going out of business. Today, investors sent the company's stocks surging up 47 percent. And this just into CNN.

All of this has come up because the prosecution has pushed back on Kohberger's alibi, saying this is not enough evidence and they want more.
