The surprise snowstorms are also bringing high winds, streaming across the southwest, and more snow tracking across the Pacific Northwest. The storm system isn't just spreading snow, it is also spreading panic as resources grow scarce. Cities in the San Bernardino mountains are facing food and fuel shortages because of dangerous conditions on the roads. Two more bouts of heavy snow are expected in the Sierra Nevada mountains and across Northern California over the next few days. It will take some time for snow to melt in the city of Truckee where snow banks seem to be taller than vehicles. California's highway patrol is warning residents to stay off the roads if possible.

In December, there was also a similar accusation of covert drone attacks by Ukraine from Russian officials who say that those drones were able to strike inside an airbase inside Russian territory, leading to damage, leading to loss of life. There are few other indications of what President Putin might perceive as intelligence failures from the Kerch Bridge blast to the assassination of the daughter of a very top Putin ally.

Certainly, many of them will be turning to emergency food resources and the incredible work by food banks, food pantries, and that charitable food system. But to give you some perspective, the scale of the SNAP Program is simply incomparable to the charitable sector. For every one meal that charities are able to provide, SNAP delivers nine. And so, there is going to be incredible stress and hardship as folks are looking to try and make ends meet. And one of the best things that people can do is to contact their eligibility worker, might be their state, might be their county, depending on where they're located, and try and maximize their SNAP benefit. One thing that folks haven't had to worry about during the emergency allotments is making sure that all of their expenses are accounted for. Their shelter costs, their dependent care costs, their medical costs. And so, making sure that all of those costs, those receipts are on file can help actually maximize their underlying SNAP benefit and mitigate this hunger cliff.",

But this is, again, a situation that we've never been through. The magnitude of the loss of economic benefits to the SNAP program provides is really something we've never seen.
