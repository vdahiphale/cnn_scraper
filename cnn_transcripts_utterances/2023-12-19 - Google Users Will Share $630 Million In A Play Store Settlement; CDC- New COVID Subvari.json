      "sentences": "Yes, well, Brianna and Boris, this is a really important story. Basically, consumers are going to get refunds, as you said, but also Google is going to have to make some changes to its App Store business that could potentially lead to lower prices for consumers when they pay for in-app content or subscriptions and things like that.But just starting with the refunds, for example, we're talking about, again, $630 million being distributed across 102 million consumers, Android users of Google's Play Store. And, you know, that could mean just a few bucks per person, but Google and the states who are part of the settlement said that, you know, everyone who's involved will get at least a couple of dollars and maybe more depending on how much you bought from the Play Store. So that could mean, you know, whether you spent a lot of money on in-app subscriptions or bought lots of apps, you might get a little bit more than $2. Now, Google is also going to have to make some changes to its business. And one of the biggest changes is that it's going to have to allow apps and app developers to give you the choice to choose a different billing method. So, until now, you've had to go through Google's own proprietary billing system. And, of course, Google charges a 30 percent fee for that, right? And so now you're going to be able to choose a third-party payment provider when you buy stuff on apps or buy subscriptions and things like that. And so theoretically, this could mean lower prices for in- app subscriptions, lower prices for in-app content, and that could be a real benefit to consumers. And also, for app developers who have long said that Google has, you know, charged exorbitant fees for in- app content that they then have to pass to consumers. So overall, this could be a huge change to Apple's business, and it could be, you know, really good for consumers.",

But the bad news about it is that it appears to have some kind of advantage over previous variants. And that's how it's really taking over here in the United States and around the world.If you look at the CDC's estimates of the prevalence of this variant over time, you can see it was just about 4 percent of new cases as of early to mid-November. And that's jumped to more than 20 percent just in the last month. And that's continuing to increase. And the expectation is it'll become dominant both here and worldwide over the coming weeks. And so, you know, the thoughts about this are that it can better evade our existing immunity than previous variants. And that's really how it's getting this advantage -- guys.",

One of the big quests right now is to be able to take heavier things up there for moon bases, for an attempt at Mars. So, when they put the New Glenn rocket up next year, they'll have a couple of different launches that are scheduled for that to prove its capability, to show what it can do out there. That's a bigger step, and that's more of the serious side of space aside from the tourism. So, a big day for Blue Origin.",

Mark, are you surprised the U.S. was able to avoid a recession or has been able to avoid one so far?MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well, it was going to be tricky. I didn't think the economy a year ago, if we had forced this conversation, we probably did. I would have said no recession, but it's going to be pretty darn close. And we need a little bit of luck and some reasonably deft policymaking by the Fed to get through without a recession. And we got a little bit of luck, and we got some reasonably good policymaking and navigated through without an economic downturn. But there's a bunch of reasons why I think the economy kind of hung tough here. I think at the very tippy top is the fact that consumers, you, and I as spenders, kept on spending. And as long as that's the case, the American economy will continue to move forward. And that goes to lots of jobs. That goes to low unemployment, below 4 percent unemployment for over two years. That goes to the fact that people were able to, particularly high-income households, middle- income households, were able to save a lot of money during the pandemic because they weren't out shopping and spending. And they could use that to kind of tide themselves over in the period of high inflation. Stock markets at a record high. Housing values at a record high. A lot of good things came together to keep consumers in the game. And again, as long as consumers do their part, the American economy will continue to move forward. And just one final point, the American economy is not only key to you and I, but it's also key to the rest of the world. The U.S. economy, U.S. consumers driving the economic train all over the planet.",

So, you know, what are you seeing there as we understand that a lot of Americans are not looking at these numbers and celebrating and saying, yes, I feel great, because they don't.",

And I think, Brianna, and again, I think there's a bunch of reasons here. But at the top of the list of the reasons for the poor sentiment is that people really got nailed by the high inflation, you know. And that goes back to the pandemic, which disrupted supply chains and labor markets, and the Russian war in Ukraine, which caused oil prices, food prices to go skyward.And that really undermined purchasing power of American households and consumers, particularly low-income, low- and middle-income households. And here's the thing that really, I think, is why people are so upset, is that most Americans -- I'm old enough to have experienced the high inflation of the 70s and 80s. I remember that. But most Americans aren't. They've never experienced anything like it. And the other interesting thing about inflation, you know, the rising prices, is somehow it feels unfair. It's unjust. I mean, how could it be the case that I'm paying so much more for the same thing that I bought a month ago or a year ago, that someone's got to be ripping me off? And so that makes people really upset, and I think that's, you know, what we're seeing in the sentiment polls. One final point. If I'm right, if my diagnosis is correct, that means, you know, as we move forward here with inflation back down and incomes rising, you know, the economy is doing well, that people will feel increasingly better. Not next month, next quarter, but by this time next year, if we're having this conversation, I suspect people will be feeling -- not only will the economy be OK and good, but people will recognize that and feel it.",
