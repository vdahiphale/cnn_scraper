Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani's former translator set to plead guilty to stealing almost $17 million and faces up to 33 years in prison. And a Triller thriller, the video sharing app looking to capitalize on TikTok's torment. We'll speak to the CEO later. That conversation and more coming up. But first, breaking just moments ago, the U.S. House has voted to kill Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post. Just minutes after Greene began the process of removing Johnson from the speakership, the House voted to end her effort with Democratic support. We'll have more on all the details on that and the implications in just a moment's time. But for now, a clear warning from President Joe Biden. The U.S. president telling CNN in an exclusive interview with Erin Burnett that he will not supply certain weapons to Israel if it targets the population centers of Rafah.

Have those bombs, those powerful 2,000-pound bombs, been used to kill civilians in Gaza? JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers. I made it clear that if they go into Rafah -- they haven't gone into Rafah yet. If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem. We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently. But it's just wrong.

And I think the key issue here is that what the Israelis aredoing is they're cutting off access to Rafah. They're cutting it off at the border. They moved their tanks and other elements of their infantry into the area between the Egyptian border and the Rafah proper. So, in that southern part right there. And they've also done things where they've moved forces in from Israel in -- on the east and some even from the north. So, doing that allows the Israelis to, in essence, encircle Rafah. So, yes, the operation has started in that sense. How far it will go then, of course, is the next question. And I think what President Biden was referring to is that this was not a maximalist style operation, but instead, a much more curtailed, much more constrained operation at present. And what he's doing is he's warning the Israelis not to go in with a maximalist approach.",

So they - - whatever's in their inventory, they will probably use against Rafah. But they are clearly being warned by the United States now openly not to use those kinds of weapons. And it would certainly be in Israel's best interest, on a diplomatic level, not to do that militarily. That might be another issue because their goal continues to be to eliminate Hamas. And the only way they see that they can do that is by using the same tactics that they used before in other parts of Gaza.

But yet, more dysfunction, I think, in Congress, which maintains at least the house speaker for now, and that attempt we move on from. OK. Let's move on. In Rafah, on Wednesday night, this was the scene at the Al Kuwaiti Hospital, where officials say four people lost their lives after Israeli airstrikes on a neighborhood in the western part of the city. The hospital says about two dozen people were hurt, most of them children. The international aid organization, Medecins Sans Frontiers, is now relocating and suspending some of its operations in Rafah in anticipation of a full-scale Israeli assault. MSF is warning of a new wave of suffering that will result. It's also calling on Israel to immediately reopen the Rafah Border Crossing so that lifesaving aid deliveries can once again enter the strip. Avril Benoit is the executive director of MSF in the United States and she joins us now. Avril, fantastic to have you on the show with us.

And so, that border crossing is absolutely essential to lose it, for it to be closed, even for one day is devastating. And overall, I would say the mood in in Rafah, generally with our staff who are prematurely discharging patients from the hospital, just to be able to clear people out so that everyone can evacuate, it's grim.

And the U.S. must make sure that all that military support, all of the funding and the political backing, blocking of ceasefire resolutions at the United Nations, U.S. has no interest in being more complicit than it already is in the suffering that's befallen the civilians in Gaza, including so many thousand children. And so, we appreciate the words, the tone, it carries the sense of urgency, the sense of concern. And what we really need to see is more of the action of the concrete examples of things changing. And that's one of the reasons that, from the beginning, we've been calling for an immediate and meaningful and sustained ceasefire, because that really is the only way to stop the suffering, to stop this killing.

But it is urgent. Lives are on the line in Rafah. We have 1.7 billion million people estimated to be displaced right now in Gaza. They're all being pushed to an area to cram into spaces where there really is no space. There's no infrastructure. There's no plan to be able to look after them properly. And there is no way with the one-by-one destruction of health facilities that we can make up for the health services with a few field hospitals intense. It's just not going to work.

They did get some accountability when former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 25 years in prison earlier this year. But now, it appears they will also be getting their money back. The company said in a proposed reorganization plan that it has recovered around $15 billion in assets that were associated with FTX at the time of its collapse. And now, it expects that about 98 percent of its creditors will be paid back in full plus interest. Now, they won't necessarily see the gains that they would have seen had their money been invested in crypto somewhere else, as we've seen crypto prices rise over the last couple of months. But they will at least be paid back the money that they initially invested in this exchange. The plan does still need to be approved by a bankruptcy court, but if it is approved, that could mean that FTX gets to resolve these issues with its stakeholders without costly litigation, which of course would be good news for this embattled company, Julia.",

The judge ultimately found there was not enough evidence to prove she had benefited financially. Hong Kong's Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted an application by the government to ban a protest anthem called \"Glory to Hong Kong.\" The ruling overturns a lower court judgment that had rejected such a ban, saying it would have a chilling effect on free speech. The ruling comes amid a sweeping national security crackdown by Beijing. China's defense ministry says its new aircraft carrier, Fujian, completed its maiden sea trial on Wednesday. The ministry says it conducted multiple tests of the carrier's propulsion and electrical systems, all of which have met expectations. This is China's third aircraft carrier and the country's first homegrown carrier.

And now, that it's upon us, we're ready to tell our story and it couldn't happen at a better time. We were going to tell it anyways, but with TikTok being out of the way, it's going to be a lot easier story to tell.",

So, there's two options, either TikTok is sold and someone else buys it, or ultimately it goes offline.What are your ambitions to monopolize in an either scenario? Because one of those is a tech giant in the United States buys it, a Google, for example, and then they put their technology to plan. That's a pretty potent competitor once again, Bobby.",

There's too many smoking guns in here for them to allow them to sell it. And it also makes the CCP look weak, right? They've come out and said, we'd rather close this thing than to sell it to anyone. And who's going to buy it anyway? It's like, what are you going to do with it? It's banned by the U.S. It's metadata that belongs in China. All the talent is CCP developers. You're not going to get the Chinese government to keep building and stealing data and monetizing it for you. So, what are you really getting? An app that's banned? A name? You know, Facebook tried something similar to this. It failed. Others will try. The reality is, is that there is no other like app like this than Triller. They're just -- the only alternative. Instagram is very specific user base. Snap has a very specific user base. And these people already have those accounts. The biggest growth will be on Triller. You come to Triller to discover content just like you do on TikTok. You don't go on Instagram to discover content. You don't really use Snap Discovery. You know, you go there to see your friends or send messaging. We will benefit the most from this. And we are now strategically positioned with the financial partner to get this done. And the deal risk right now is virtually nonexistent. This merger is going to happen. And it's just a matter of days or maybe even a few weeks to have this completed and to really start to tell our story.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, that's a great question. And the one thing you should understand is these large creators, especially the largest creators, arealso shareholders in Triller, right? So, they're going to be seeing a monetizable event by us entering the public markets. So, it's very easy for us to go back to them and say, OK. guys, we're ready now. Your investment is ready now. Move your TikTok business over to Triller. You can continue on the other platforms because they're for different purposes. But we already have the top of the influencer sphere. Where we're going to focus our creator fund, which will be announcing shortly to new figure creator fund, is to really attack the middle and the bottom of the long tail, is to bring over the smaller content creators and to develop our own stars, right? Triller has created a lot of stars, but other people are taking credit for it. So, what we plan to do this time is to create an ecosystem for not only emerging artists, but for large creators, but for commerce, for social selling, for all types of different systems, including, but not even limited to, you know, subscription-based services and SaaS services to where you can roll in our AR products and our Fangage products and give creators a tool by the new product we have coming out called the Hustle Engine, which will allow them to literally control all their social media into one space. And depending on what platform they want to use, they'll be able to tell that story. So, what you're going to see in the next revolution of social media is exactly what we've been building for the last three years. It would have been nice to have a three, four more months, but you know what? It's go time and we're ready for it. So, once this merger is done, I think you'll see a lot of things changing with us.",

The problem is, is when we were strapped for cash and capital, we had to deploy those capital resources to other places than licensing and gathering new licensing and publishing. And so, now, those problems go away very quickly. We've been in active conversations with them. They're very eager because not only have we helped emerging artists grow on Triller, we've helped big artists, you know, increase your streams. We've helped touring. But we also tell the story and we're also in their backyard and they want to see us succeed, right? There's no American music label that doesn't want to see Triller succeed. It's just not possible. And then if you also look at the major labels, they're also all investors in Triller. So, our problem is not a national security problem, it's not a problem that can be fixed, it was a money issue that has now been resolved, right? And we're consistently having those conversations to bring those to further fruition and further resolution as we, you know, take this next chapter.",

And certainly, within the business community, there's real concerns about the changes that we're seeing in Hong Kong and for some, they don't now differentiate between what's happening in China and what's happening in Hong Kong.
