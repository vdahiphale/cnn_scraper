Bodies are on the ground and there are fires in parliament. Citizens are furious over new tax measures. Within hours it will be morning in the Northern Mariana Islands. Julian Assange is appearing in court there after reaching a plea deal with the United States. Donald Trump and Joe Biden are preparing for their first debate on Thursday. They've got starkly different styles, that's no surprise, but who is likely to have the upper hand? Let's begin in Nairobi in Kenya, the city is reeling from a day of chaos and violence. Protesters have been clashing with police. The protesters are angry over proposed tax increases and the rising cost of living. And the President William Ruto, earlier, demonstrators stormed parliament as lawmakers were discussing a controversial new finance bill. Other buildings including Nairobi City Hall were also set ablaze. Our teams on the ground, CNN teams have seen police firing live rounds into the crowd as well as using teargas and water cannons. We know of five people so far killed and dozens of people have been injured according to the rights groups in the area. The President William Ruto is expected to address Kenya in just a moment. He's going to speak to the nation. Larry Madowo is in Nairobi. This seems to be deteriorating despite the best efforts, if you will, of you know, the President to say he'll meet protestors, he's willing to listen, but think that they're not listening or not, and things are getting worse.",

And they did succeed in shutting down Nairobi, one of Africa's busiest capitals reduced to just violence, looting, and teargas and water cannon for most of the day, it felt like a war zone. And these are the residue of the police that are still left here making sure that no protesters come back at night and try and access parliament again, because they did get to the floor of the national assembly earlier, they did burn a part of this back here, a city hall. This is the office of the governor of the Nairobi City County that was set ablaze in two different sections. There's a fire that claimed one carrot- side(ph), there's shell of that that's still out there, and they were expecting this statement from President William Ruto any moment now, it's in this hour that the statement is supposed to happen. And he's speaking on the backdrop of this security presence where hundreds of police officers were trying to protect Kenya's parliament, and protesters still made their way inside them. Police having to use the live rounds and at least, five people killed as a result of that.

But also what's true is that the police did respond in a deeply violent, heavy-handed, militarized way. We saw police use live rounds outside parliament, shooting at protesters who were unarmed.

Is it the pugilistic shouting, interrupting Donald Trump that we saw in the first debate last time, or in the hope of some Trump advisers, is it a more restrained, more presidential version of Donald Trump who shows up down there in Atlanta? And when you talk to Biden advisers, they are preparing for both of those opportunities in this extensive, almost week-long debate camp out on the mountainside in Maryland.

Of course, none of this is true, but it does just tell you the expectations that the Trump people are setting.

When you talk to the Biden team, they are thinking about ways to try and get under Donald Trump's skin to try and bring that version of him out a little bit. They think that that will only benefit them by comparison if Joe Biden is able to put on sort of a presidential, more restrained attitude. By the end of the day, Joe Biden has a temper as well. They think that if, you know, Donald Trump goes after his family, goes after some of these things that are very personal, I think, that that could demonstrate some anger as well from the Biden side.",

But Saeed Jalili, a conservative candidate and Iran's former chief nuclear negotiator, ripped into moderates and the nuclear agreement they negotiated with President Obama, but then President Trump walked away from. The result was that at the end of eight years, they themselves even said that not just the enrichment, but the whole nuclear program stopped, and not only did the economic situation of the country not succeed, but the economic growth became zero and negative.

And Nairobi City Hall was also set on fire. They were protesting against legislation to raise taxes, which is coming as much of the population is struggling with escalating costs of living crisis. At least five people have been killed and dozens of people injured, according to rights groups. Earlier, the Kenyan president, William Ruto, addressed the nation, calling for today's violence turning -- a turning point and promising that security is his top priority. In a separate development, a source tells CNN that a Kenyan police contingent has arrived in Haiti. At least 200 security personnel and around 12 high level Kenyan officials have reached Port-au-Prince. According to the source, a Kenyan led multinational force was requested by Haiti to deal with out-of-control gang violence, leading to a breakdown of order. The U.N. authorized the force last year. China says its lunar probe mission was a complete success. The uncrewed module returned to Earth hours ago, according to state media, and it brought samples from the far side of the moon for the first time in history. Ivan Watson takes a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Floating back down to earth, China's lunar module returning from a mission to the furthest reaches of the moon, named after the Chinese moon goddess, the Chang'e-6 spacecraft lands safely in the deserts of China's Inner Mongolia, and makes history. BRAD TUCKER, ASTROPHYSICIST/COSMOLOGIST, AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY:  So, the only country that's landed on the far side, that side facing away from us, is China. So, the fact that they've landed now two missions on that side of the moon and one of which has actually returned stuff back to earth, is a pretty big deal. WATSON (voice-over):  For Chinese leader Xi Jinping, this marks a giant leap towards what he calls his eternal dream, establishing China as a dominant space power. The probe collected up to two kilos of dust and rocks, which could help scientists better understand the origins of the solar system. Treasure drilled from the South Pole-Aitken basin, a 4- billion-year-old moon crater not visible from earth. To do this, China had to create a way to communicate with its robot on the other side of the moon.",
