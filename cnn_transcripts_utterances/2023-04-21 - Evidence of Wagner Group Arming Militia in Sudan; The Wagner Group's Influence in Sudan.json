He's a Senior Research Fellow at the University of London. And he's also the Former Africa Editor for BBC World Service News. Great to have you on the show! It is a complex story.

I mean, I'm sure that some ofyour guests are holding their head trying to work out what's going on by this time, because there are so many people involved. But really, it's quite a simple issue. If you look at Vladimir Putin, he's been working through the Wagner Group in Ukraine. But he also works through the Wagner Group in Africa. And the Wagner Group is a perfect system, because it's a mercenary group, they send in Russian mercenaries. And they pay for it by extracting minerals. Now, Sudan, and the area around here has been the source of wealth and gold for many, many years. I mean, like hundreds of years, if not thousands. And that is the source of the wealth. So you have the money available through the gold and you have a keenness by the Russians to get involved. Now their regional players then our Hemetti or -- who is fighting the Sudanese army, and he is in league with Haftar, as you say, who is in Eastern Libya. So you put together Haftar, who has the base in Libya, you put the weapons in the hands of Hemetti, who's fighting the Sudanese army, and you pay for it by the gold, which is extracted by various companies airlifted then, to Russia. It's a simple reaction. Now, they are also regional players that I can talk about, but that is the triangle that's taking place.",

And this would give Vladimir Putin and the Wagner Group a huge influence in the region. The French used to have a strong influence in West Africa that they've gradually reduced their influence and have pulled their troops out or pull their troops back. And you can now see demonstrations, which may be organized because I mean, the Wagner Group is extremely good at publicity. But they've organized what you see Africans going around with flags, I mean, literally Russian or even old Soviet flags, to show their allegiance. And that is how things are developing. And I just don't think one should underestimate the Wagner Group. They and Hemetti, that's the Rapid Support Forces RSF, they have hired PR people who are also putting out information, tweets, Facebook and all the others push their line on issues.
