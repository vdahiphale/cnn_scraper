And that happened after suspected drone strike caused a massive fire at a fuel depot in Sevastopol last weekend.Meantime, Moscow is blaming Ukraine and several western nations for an apparent attack on a pro-Kremlin military blogger about 400 kilometers east of Moscow. The Russian state news agency said the Zakhar Prilepin was wounded after his car was hit by a roadside bomb on Saturday. Investigators say they later arrested a suspect who reportedly confessed that he received his orders from Ukraine. The Ukrainian Security Services neither confirming nor denying its involvement in the blast east of Moscow. Now, Prilepin was a Telegram channel -- had a Telegram channel with some 300,000 followers. Another pro-Kremlin blogger was killed in an explosion in St. Petersburg last month, but Ukraine claims it did not have any role in that attack. Ukraine, meantime, says its Patriot air defense system has gone head to head with a Russian high-tech missile. Ukraine obtained the U.S.- made weapon to protect its skies, and as Sam Kiley reports, the patriots have reportedly delivered what Kyiv calls a slap in the face for Russia.",

They say it was knocked out of the sky by a U.S.-made Patriot missile.Now, the country here in Ukraine only has one battery of Patriot missiles, and the missiles themselves were assumed to be incapable of hitting a hypersonic missile, a missile that travels many times the speed of sound and was assumed to be simply too fast for these batteries. Now, by confirming this kill, as it were, of an incoming missile, this is a major boon to the morale the Ukrainians. But when they get up to full capacity, they will only have, it's understood, two batteries of patriots, one from Germany, and the other from the United States. They are saying that they desperately need more aerial defenses, particularly after the recent attacks that have been focused very heavily on Kyiv and in anticipation of what is likely to be a Ukrainian summer offensive against Russian positions, in which control of the air space is going to be absolutely critical. So, they are continuing to demand or beg the international community for more of these air defenses, and at the same time, continuing to fight very, very bitterly on that eastern front around Bakhmut, where the leader of the Wagner Mercenary Group Prigozhin, has said he will be pulling his troops out on May the 10th because, in his words, they're being starved of the amount of ammunition they need in order to preserve their lives. He claims that they're close to capturing the city and that he'll be handing over operations there to Chechen fighters under the Russian flag, effectively under the Russian Ministry of Defense, a very dramatic development in his ongoing complaints about the conduct of this war by the ministry of defense and the generals under Putin.

He's at a very different stage of life. Obviously, his mother became queen when she was in her mid-20s.But I think, on the other hand, we've got to know the king as Prince of Wales and all the good work he's done through the prince's trust and other charities. And, of course, part of the international appeal is baked in, in the sense that the king is the king of 15 countries. He's head of the 56-nation commonwealth. But also, there are particular and special relationships that the monarchy has with certain countries. And, remember, the king himself has traveled widely. For example, he's been to the U.S. over 20 times. He went on a famous 12-city tour of the U.S. in 1977.

But as Rafael Romo reports, misinformation is encouraging many migrants to think that come Thursday, they'll just walk right into the United States, which U.S. authorities say is just plain wrong.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice over): Yofre Perez says his plan is to press on all the way to the border and beyond. He wants his own American dream. The Venezuelan migrant has already made it as far as Mexico and returning home, he says, is not an option. We're already here, and we can't go back, Perez. We have to press on as far as we can get, as far as they let us get. As many other migrants wait in Mexico for an opportunity to cross into the United States, legal or illegally, that is he's driven by hope and determination but confused by the rampant misinformation about what's happening at the southern U.S. border. Migrants Perez are part of an expected surge prompted by the fact that Title 42, the Trump-era policy that allowed border authorities to quickly turn away certain migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic, is expiring on May 11th. Migrants like Linda Sarmienta, who comes from Honduras, say there are many doubts in the migrant community because she's heard that the end of Title 42 means that she will be able to enter the country while other people have told her that it will make it even more difficult to seek asylum. U.S. officials, especially Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, have been clear about the fact that the border will remain sealed. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  The border is not open, it has not been open, and it will not be open subsequent to May 11th. And the smugglers who exploit vulnerable migrants are spreading misinformation. They are spreading false information, lies in a way to lure vulnerable people to the southern border.

For example, there is a proposal put forth by Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. He gave the president and the administration a series of executive actions that he could take on his own to alleviate this crisis. And some of these actions were streamlining deportations, increasing the penalties for smugglers and traffickers, and also pairing up some migrants with states that have a labor shortage.So, there are some potential solutions there, but to give you an idea of how overwhelmed cities are across the country, since you mention that, right now in New York, asylum seekers and migrants who are paroled here from the border, they get a court date to return for 2033, ten years away, 2033. In Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, I believe they're looking at court dates in 2027. So, that just goes to show how overwhelmed our border is right now, the failure of our administration to respond to it, and that's one reason why President Biden has a very low rating on the immigration issue. I think only 39 percent of Americans approve how he's handling this issue. And those are pretty much similar to the ratings that past presidents have because no one is willing to take some of the bolder steps necessary to deal with this very contentious issue. NEWTON:  And, you know, given how highly politicized this issue is, and I recognize that, and you've pointed out so well, but it's not mattered, the administration now, it's not mattered for several years. You've just pointed out the absurdity of an immigration system that is really broken. A decade, a hearing in a decade, is not going to do anybody any good. Do you think the solutions, though, do lie within South America themselves, or Latin America, to be able to go into those countries and really see some stabilization and then perhaps pair that with a guest worker program or some kind of pathway to enter the United States?",

You know, this goes to the question of who is the villain, quote/unquote, in this situation. And the villain here is Congress. Because, remember, presidents can set immigration policy. However, they cannot make immigration law. Some of the ideas you're talking about, such as significant investments across Latin America, maybe helping to stabilize that region, changing immigration law to allow new legal pathways, that is the job of Congress. And that is the job on both sides that they have largely abdicated.I mean, right now in 2023, this is the ten-year anniversary of the last time the country attempted any significant type of immigration reform. Remember the so-called Gang of Eight in 2013? Again, a whole decade has gone by and we're basically facing the same situation. And what's incredibly unfortunate is these waves of unauthorized migration are very likely in the future to get worse because they are increasingly likely in the future to be driven by things like climate change. So, we are way past overdue for some type of fix but Congress has not fulfilled its responsibilities here.",

Former cast member Pete Davidson was supposed to appear this weekend, but instead he handed out pizza on the Writers Build picket line in Brooklyn. I hope that pizza was good. Davidson said he was there to support the writers. Other late night network shows have also gone dark because of that writers strike.Mage has won the 149th Kentucky Derby, beating out the second-place horse Two Phil's.
