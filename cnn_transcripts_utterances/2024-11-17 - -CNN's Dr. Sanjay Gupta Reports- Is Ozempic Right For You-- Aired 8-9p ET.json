Every time you eat, all sorts of hormones are released. Like GLP-1. They are called post-nutrient hormones. They travel here to the hypothalamus and the brain to tell you that you are full or satiated. They also travel over here to the pancreas to kick out more insulin to help absorb the energy you just consumed, and also over here to your gut to slow down the emptying, allowing you to better digest your food. In so many ways, it seems like the perfect hormone to help you stop eating as much. Seemed perfect for Rasheeda. In that first year, she lost 100 pounds. It changed her life.

It's what they use in their diabetes medication Ozempic and their weight loss medication Wegovy. And at Eli Lilly, they formulated a mimic of two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP. It's called tirzepatide and that's what they use in their versions, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Here's the thing, mimics of semaglutide and tirzepatide. They are readily available, but experts estimate that it takes months for the drug companies to purify them and then mix them to the right strength and potency to be an FDA approved medicine. Now, even if they could speed up that process, they still have to make enough of these special pens that dispense a pre measured amount of medication. And that takes time.
