Though he said he utilized H1B visas which, of course refer to high-skilled workers, when we know that he actually favored more visas that brought in workers with less skills which -- to have a different categorization. So there is -- it is -- there are some shades of gray there and we'll have to see exactly where he lands when he actually starts making policy as president. That said, your point to Musk and other tech billionaires -- Silicon Valley billionaires that have brought influence within this White House -- within this incoming White House is a marked departure from what we saw in the last Trump administration where he had a very adversarial relationship with many of these leaders which seems to be, at least at this point in the assembling administration, very, very different.",

And Washington actually honored former President Carter before the game Sunday night against the team from Carter's home state, the Atlanta Falcons. And then after that, Jayden Daniels showed why he's the frontrunner for Rookie of the Year, rushing for a career-high 127 yards and throwing for three touchdowns. But the Falcons have a rookie quarterback of their own, Michael Penix Jr. And on fourth and goal from the 13-yard line, down by seven with just over two minutes to go, he delivered a strike to Kyle Pitts for the touchdown to tie it up and force overtime. In overtime, Daniels found who else but Zach Ertz for the game-winning score. And with his performance yesterday, the 12th-year tight end earned $750,000 in bonuses as Washington gets its first 11-win season since 1991. By the way, that's the year they last won a Super Bowl. Elsewhere in the NFL, Eagles' running back Saquon Barkley running his way into the record books yesterday, becoming just the ninth player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. He gashed the Cowboys' defense for 167 yards on 31 carries in a 41-7 blowout win, locking up the 2-seed in the NFC for Philly. And how's this for fate. He needs 101 yards in the season finale to break Eric Dickerson's all-time single season record of 2,105. And the Eagles' opponent is his old team, the Giants. I am sure he will get it done. The Vikings might be the most under-the-radar 14-2 team in NFL history and a huge part of that is Sam Darnold. The former number three pick playing for this fourth team in five years. Darnold, the runaway for comeback player of the year. He was incredible again yesterday throwing for 377 yards and three touchdowns against the Packers. Minnesota led by as many as 17 midway through the fourth before holding on to the 27-25 win. And Darnold's teammates showering him with love and water after the game, and well-deserved. This week just keeps on giving, too, Paula. Tomorrow, the friendly confines become the frozen confines as Wrigley Field hosts the Blackhawks and Blues for the first-ever New Year's Eve Winter Classic. Coverage begins at 4:00 p.m. Eastern and the puck drops at 5:00. And you can watch that on our sister channel TNT. You can also stream it on Max. And then the college football playoffs ring in the new year as well starting with the Fiesta Bowl tomorrow night. You've got a New Year's Day triple-header. So really, Paula, no reason to get out of your pajamas for at least another three to four days if you're watching this at home. Back to you.",
