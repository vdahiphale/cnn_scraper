Because he's essentially vying for business in China's backyard. China is the major trading partner for most of these countries gathered here today. And this is in an era where China is suffering from a new trend of de-risking, post-Covid. Where they're saying we can't keep relying on China for all of our manufacturing. We have to find other shores on which to buy or make our products. And Biden is saying, here is our plan to lay it out to make it possible and to basically eat China's lunch.",

Both of charges including one count of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and the attempted kidnapping of a federal official. David DePape appearing motionless in court. There were a lot of big moments throughout the trial. Including Paul Pelosi taking the stand and saying that it was the first time he was speaking about that very disturbing, very intense and traumatic evening for him outside of speaking to investigators at his bedside. And, of course, the prosecutors -- he said he never watched any of the videos or listened to any of the 911 calls because he did not want to relive the trauma. Then, on the flip side, David DePape took the stand in his own defense and talked about his remorse for hurting Paul Pelosi. He said he feared for Paul Pelosi's life after the attack and didn't know he was alive until he was charged with attempted murder in his estate case. Obviously, a lot of very intense moments throughout this process. [14:40:07] Next will be his sentencing. And then the state trial will begin. We expect it to begin at the end of this month where he's facing attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, among other charges. So a lot happening here. Back to you.",

So there wasn't much history about the facts here.And the defense really wasn't anything like I didn't do it. It was a technical defense about whether the defendant understood that he was interfering with Paul Pelosi because he was Nancy Pelosi's spouse and he was trying to interfere with the actions of a federal official. I'm not surprised that ultimately the jury didn't buy that and found him guilty. The question now is, how severe will the sentence be? And, of course, he has another upcoming trial on the state side. So that could actually result in a higher sentence because it's an attempted murder where the federal charges were attempted kidnapping and assault on the spouse of a federal official.",

Thankfully, Mr. Pelosi continues to make progress in his recovery.\" He did speak about his recovery when he took the stand, saying he is still going through physical therapy multiple times a week. He had to relearn how to walk. He had constant headaches and dizzy spells throughout the last year and he still gets them. So it's been a very slow process. He had to have his hand reconstructed. He's had stitches on his arm. So he said that he's taking things slow and it's been very traumatic and very difficult.",

This speaks to, I think, also sort of a narrative and demonizing of public officials that someone like DePape, who honestly is not unique, might seize on. This isn't particularly a legal question, but perhaps this legal outcome may raise some, maybe, second thoughts for some people about the kind of rhetoric that is out there.

They might see this and say, well, gee, if I do what the former president suggested, I might get in trouble for it.
