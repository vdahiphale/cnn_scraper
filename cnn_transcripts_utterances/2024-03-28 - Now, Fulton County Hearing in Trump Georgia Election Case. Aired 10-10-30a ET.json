      "sentences": "Hello, and thank you for joining CNN's special coverage. I'm Laura Coates in Washington, D.C.And literally at any moment, a hearing gets underway in Georgia's election interference case against Donald Trump. The former president will not be in the Fulton County courtroom, but his attorneys will ask the judge to throw out the indictment that is against him. They're going to argue that Trump's conduct was actually political speech, and therefore should be protected by the First Amendment. The hearing is also going to focus on one of Trump's fake electors. Attorneys for David Shafer, Georgia's former Republican Party chairman, will ask to have the case dismissed as well. And, you know, it's worth noting, this is actually the first hearing since the presiding judge rejected the defense efforts to disqualify the woman you see on the screen right now, the district attorney of Fulton County, Fani Willis. I've got a panel of experts here at the table to help analyze all of this. Elie Honig is also joining us from New York. But, first, let's go to CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz, who is live outside the courthouse in Atlanta. Katelyn, tell us more about what we are expected to hear in court this morning.",

      "sentences": "Well, today in court is the first time that Fannie Willis's office will be back before all of those hearings over her ethics debacle, something that the judge has warned her not to step into any issues anymore, talking about the case outside of court. Nathan Wade, the lead prosecutor, resigned. They're all back today, and this will be a refocus on the law and on the allegations, the charges. There will be arguments from Donald Trump's legal team.Now, Donald Trump isn't expected to be here in person, neither is Fani Willis herself, but there will be arguments from Donald Trump's lawyers today about the First Amendment. They say that this racketeering conspiracy allegation that he faces includes quite a lot of political speech, tweets he was sending even, things that are protected under the Constitution, at least in the view of his attorneys, and so this case should be dismissed. Previous attempts by other defendants in this case to have it dismissed, those have been unsuccessful, but this is part of the stress test that is happening in the court system to talk about what is alleged here, what is alleged against Donald Trump and also other defendants, other lawyers for the defendant, David Shafer, a prominent GOP official in the state of Georgia, who was among the fake electors and leading some of their efforts for Trump after the election. There's going to be arguments from him as well on dismissing the case. Then, of course, too, we will see if there's any discussion at all about when this case would go to trial, a big question hanging over everything here in Fulton County.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's hard to say until we hear the judge actually take this up. There have been many hearings here in Fulton County at the court before Judge McAfee, where we know the prosecutors want to talk about a trial date and it just hasn't been discussed. So, we'll see if it does come up today.But remember what the calendar looks like for Donald Trump, at least on the side of the courts in these criminal cases where he's facing. He's going to trial in New York, in that hush money criminal case in the middle of April. That will keep him in court as a defendant in front of a jury likely for six weeks or so into June. And then after that, there is an open calendar, though it's right in the middle of the presidential campaign with the convention making him formally the nominee set for July and the election in November. So, there's a lot of questions. Is it going to be this case that could go to trial or slot into the calendar sometime in that window or is there the possibility one of these other cases, the two federal cases against Donald Trump, would those fit in? Each of these cases, it doesn't take just two days to try. And this case, in particular, in Fulton County against Donald Trump is massive. He and 14 other defendants are slotted to go to trial and the allegations here are voluminous. It will take quite a lot of time for the prosecutors to present those in court if and when it gets to that point.",

None of the charges in this case are about that. They are about falsity employed as part of -- or statements employed as part of a pattern of criminal conduct in numerous ways. So, there's nowhere to go.
