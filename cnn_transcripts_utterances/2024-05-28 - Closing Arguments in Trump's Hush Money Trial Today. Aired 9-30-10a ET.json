No one expected the former first lady to show up here. This is a case that personally infuriated her I'm told during this trial, but also when it was first becoming reported out about what happened. Michael Cohen admitted that he lied to Melania Trump about what happened with the Stormy Daniels payoff. But it does make an interesting point because even though she's not there, you know, we know why she's not there. It's a question of whether the jury is curious about it, because what Trump's attorneys had been arguing, and what they'll likely reiterate when these closing arguments get underway today, is that what Trump did was at the benefit of his relationship with Melania Trump and that he was trying to protect her and protect his family, not his candidacy and his potential political runs and what he was undertaking at the moment.",

Nothing in my reporting indicates that. And throughout the course of this trial, Todd Blanche has not fallen into that trap that we've seen with a lot of Trump lawyers, specifically Alina Habba and others, who do a lot of performative things in court to appeal to their client that doesn't always help him in the long run. In fact, one of the things they're going to argue today, that they have to argue, is that this was not part of a conspiracy to help Trump win the election. Now, that's one of their tougher arguments given the evidence, right? This is why this is charged as a felony. But they're not going to even touch the argument that they often make in the court of public opinion that these charges were brought to help, you know, Trump lose, basically to help Biden in the course of the presidential election, they're not going to make those arguments. And that's something that they acknowledged their client would love to hear in a courtroom. That's not going to happen today. So, I disagree with the idea that this is going to be for an audience of one. We haven't seen that so far. And nothing in my reporting indicates that.",

You know, when we look at who is in the courtroom with Trump, we've seen all these Republican lawmakers coming, including missing hearings and key moments on Capitol Hill and having to change his schedule because they're here in support of Donald Trump at his trial.Bob Good, the Virginia congressman and Freedom Caucus chair, who was here two weeks ago and came out and spoke in support of Donald Trump, his primary opponent rode in the motorcade with Trump. Trump just endorsed his primary opponent on Truth Social on the way to the courthouse right now for the first time and saying that Bob Good is bad for America and trashing him, even though Bob Good was sitting in the same seats that the family is sitting in right now in support of him.",

Closing arguments or about to get underway any minute. The defense will lead off in accordance with New York state law. The jury is now entering the courtroom. And let me just bring you all up to speed as to what's been going on inside the courtroom in the last few minutes. So, obviously, all the players are there in the aisle. From the aisle we see the president's family, the former president's family. Tiffany, Lara Trump, Eric Trump, and Don Junior, all seated in that order in the row behind him. So, a big representation of his family there supporting him. In addition, Susie Wiles, who helped run his campaign, and Alina Habba, his attorney for other cases. Right now Todd Blanche, the attorney, the defense attorney for Mr. Trump, said he expects to go two-and-a-half hours for his summary, for his closing arguments. And he goes first. Joshua Steinglass, who is with the prosecutor's office, says he estimates he needs four to four-and-a-half hours. So that's about seven hours total, assuming they keep to those parameters. Judge Merchan says he's going to ask the jury to stay later to four -- than 4:30, because that's what -- this would require to fill it all in. They've been adjourning basically between 4:00 and 4:30 every day. But Judge Merchan says, I'm going to leave it up to them. So, if the jury decides they're going to plow through and hit 5:00, 5:30, 6:00, whatever is needed, they'll do that. But if they have, for instance, if a juror has a childcare issue, they will adjourn. We'll find out what they're going to do. Judge Merchan advises the attorneys, Steinglass and Blanche, please do not go into the law. Stay away from the law. Do not explain the law. That will be my job. I'll take care of that. Members of the jury, you will now hear the summations of the lawyers, Judge Merchan tells the jury. Under our law, defense counsel must sum up first and then the prosecutor must follow, Judge Merchan says. The lawyers may not speak to you after that. So, this is a pretty huge moment.",

But you have to walk the jury through those three steps. It's complicated.That said, four hours is way too long. It is a mistake if the DA, Steinglass, takes four to four-and-a-half hours to give a closing. I mean I gave a closing in a three defendant, five murder case. The judge asked how long I needed. I said three hours. He laughed at me. He said, you have 90 minutes. I gave it in 90 minutes. It was the best jury address I ever gave. For hours is too long. He's going to lose the jury.",

Todd Blanche, every one of you has been on time. We see you paying close attention to the evidence all day, every day, and we really appreciate that. Indeed we do, jurors.

They don't have to put up any defense at all. It's on the prosecution, obviously, to meet that burden of proof. And so right now he is going after Michael Cohen. That's a surprise to no one. That is going to be a key staple of Todd Blanche's closing.

You'll notice, those are three names that we've heard repeatedly during this trial. They have not shown up at this trial. Dylan Howard worked at \"The National Enquirer.\" He has some spine issue and is living in Australia.

And, of course, this is really at the heart of the case. REIDwas then the leader of the free world, he wasn't paying attention to how things were being invoiced. Remember the testimony from the two accountants, Jeff McConney, Deb Tarasoff, you know, they just said they received these invoices from Michael Cohen. They clicked the boxes and, boom, a check went out. Now Blanche is saying the invoices were prepared by Cohen. The vouchers were prepared by Trump Organization employee Deb Tarasoff. And the checks were auto-generated. Remember that testimony from the accountants, even though they were called by the prosecutors, this is their strongest argument. And the danger for Blanche is not diluting this, not getting away from this, because this is the alleged crime. Michael Cohen's credibility also very significant. But he also, earlier, at the beginning of his argument, he reminded everyone that Trump denies the encounter with Stormy Daniels. Now, I think for a lot of people that strains credulity. They're also going to argue that this wasn't done to help him win the election. That's not the most important thing. The most important thing is to focus on falsifying business records. And that's what he's doing here. The challenges, again, not to get too distracted with these other things, that don't make or break the case, and the jurors may not believe.",

Now, in talking with sources, this document, this is a key piece of evidence for the defense. They believe that this email, this -- this particular piece of evidence, this is critical to their case.
