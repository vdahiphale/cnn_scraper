Sources tell CNN federal prosecutors have obtained recording of former President Donald Trump acknowledging he held onto a classified document about a potential attack on Iran after he left the White House. The recording is from a meeting Trump had with two biographers of his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. This happened at his Bedminster Golf Club in July of 2021. CNN has not been able to listen to the recording, but multiple sources who have describe its contents to us. And they say in it, Trump is discussing a document about a potential plan to attack Iran. Papers can be heard ruffling on the recording. It's unclear if Trump actually showed anyone in the room the document in question. The special counsel, Jack Smith, who is leading the Justice Department investigation into Trump, has focused on the meeting as part of the probe into Trump's handling of national security secrets. And prosecutors have questioned multiple witnesses before the grand jury about this recording and document. According to sources familiar with the investigation, the recording indicates Trump understood that he retained classified material after leaving the White House despite his public claims otherwise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I have no classified documents. And, by the way, they become automatically declassified when I took them. If you're the President of the United States, you can declassify just by saying it's declassified even by thinking about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is a crime to actually reveal classified information, which is what he was doing. It also raises the question of what was this document doing in Bedminster when he had moved all these documents to Mar-a-Lago? Were there other documents at Bedminster? Was this document one of the documents that was seized in the search in August of last year? And if not, does that mean that there are other documents at Bedminster that we still haven't yet retrieved or the Department of Justice hasn't retrieved?

There have been other cases of Trump being caught on tape saying things that should, would potentially be considered to be disqualifying in an American presidential election. I mean, you remember there were tapes that were released during the 2016 election of him talking about grabbing women. That didn't seem to bother his core base of supporters that much.So, I think one of the things. To remember here is that there is the legal implications for Trump, which are actually significantly different than the political implications for him, because the people that made Trump president have had seven years to get used to ignoring stories like this. And I think it remains to be seen whether this is going to break through to them.",

I have this information. It makes me special, and I'm willing to share it with you. I don't know if I can show it to you. And so you don't know if he had follow up conversations on it. So, the pattern of activity here clearly shows he had the intent to take these things not for any good purpose but for a purpose other than that. And, again, I think he thinks of these things as a trophy. I think he thinks that he doesn't have to follow the rules on classification, and that's dangerous because of the seriousness of what was in this document, clearly. And if you have, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which, given all of the things going on in the world, has to go down to the grand jury to testify about this particular document at this particular time, it shows you, A, the severity of it and why it's dangerous to have people who don't respect or understand the importance of classified information and why it needs to be classified.",

And yet when we look at the political implications, when we look at how the former president will be responding here and whether or not it sticks, there's also the history of the comments that have been made.I know in the past there have been comments that the president made that there were then contradictory. Does this change anything based on the evolution that we've seen from him in terms of what he believes he can do with classified documents? Has any of that broken through? ALTER:  I mean, I really think that there's sort of two universes of people here who are voting. There's the people who are paying attention to the story and who understand the legal implications of it and the nuances of it and understand why taking classified documents is not okay. And then there are voters who are just not going to believe anything that Trump is accused of. And it's very, very difficult to penetrate that. They've had seven years, really, since two 2016 to develop that worldview that's nearly impossible to pierce. And so I think a lot depends on what happens with the rest of the Republican field, because the more people who run against Trump, the stronger Trump's campaign is because it splits the vote of the people who are paying attention and perhaps alarmed by this story.",

That was really important to him and his leadership team, as they obviously were dealing with a lot of concerns and consternation in their right flank.Now, this heads over to the U.S. Senate. The expectation is that it is going to pass eventually. It's just a question of how quickly the Senate can move. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made it clear yesterday he would hope they could get a time agreement to begin this process as soon as today, hoping that maybe they could even get out of here before the weekend. Senators always are motivated by those jet fumes usually on Thursday afternoons but they do need to get some kind of time agreement. And, already, you're hearing from a number of Republicans and Democrats who want to have votes on amendments. Here's the key issue, though. None of those amendments really can pass because, otherwise, they'd have to kick it back over to the House of Representatives. That would push you past the Monday, June 5th deadline where Janet Yellen says the country could default. So, this is going to be something that moves hopefully quickly out of the Senate. That is the expectation of leadership. But they do have to secure that time agreement first. We're going to be watching for that and any signs avoid smoke coming out of the Senate later today.
