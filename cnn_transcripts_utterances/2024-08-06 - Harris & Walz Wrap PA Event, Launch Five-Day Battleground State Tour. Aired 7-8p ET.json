They had a teleprompter backstage and he was practicing with it. I just want to add. Someone texted me, he reads Republican and I think that is the reason I was told by people who were familiar with the vetting that he was a favorite candidate because he may not be Governor Shapiro of Pennsylvania, but they feel he will connect an attract voters in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Georgia, in North Carolina, that his Midwestern nice will play elsewhere. I also just want to say about that speech is one of the reasons that Harris picked him. That's his superpower. He is authentic. He knows how to deliver even a tough line with a smile, where the line of the night I thought was when he said, let's be clear, crime was up under Trump -- that part I'm paraphrasing. but then he turned and he said and that's not even counting the crimes he committed.

They're going to -- but to Jamie's point, he reads like a normie uncle, dad, white guy in the Midwest. And I think that he's somebody who can play in those critical swing states, Wisconsin, Michigan, his home state of Minnesota, but also in Pennsylvania.

I don't -- I don't view any of that is normal. I look at this through the lens of decision-making. In two cases, they've showed us who they are.

So in two big decision points for this ticket, they've showed us they will always bowed down to the radical left. So I think if you, if you want to talk about normal, to the normal people in this country, bowing down to the radical left is not normal. It shouldn't be normal.

You may remember that three weeks ago, there were a lot of people who were not sure that Kamala Harris was going to be the most exciting ticket. It feels very different now, and he is someone who definitely has ambitions to run and he was looking at down the road. And we have new reporting tonight from our team that, in fact, when he went into his vetting meeting and also in his in-person meeting with Harris, he made it very clear what kind of vice president he wanted this to be. It was much more of a two for the price of one. He wants to be in the room. He wanted to have a real say in these things. There are sources -- we've talked to who feel that in those meetings.

What do you think of the pick?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, listen, I think this is a brilliant pick by Kamala Harris. There was a sort of Beltway favorite and that was Josh Shapiro and she wanted to go really to an outsider in many ways, a guy who grew up in a small town in Nebraska, on farming country, and is the leader of a Midwestern state where, you know, populism and progressive -- progressive policies have met, right? So he can really, I think reframe what progressivism means, what liberalism means in a way that is palatable to a wide variety of folks. And you saw him there really leaning into the attack dog role, but he does it with the kind of righteous indignation and very memorable terms, right? He talked about during the COVID crisis, that Donald Trump froze during the COVID crisis. One of the challenges I think for this ticket is really going to be to really paint the years of the Donald Trump presidency. There are some people who have a sort of nostalgia for what Donald Trump was like as president for those four years. And so, there he is really painting a picture in saying, listen, this is a guy who wants to go out there and act like crime is ramping and out of control. But it actually rose under -- under Donald Trump. And so listen, I think this is a pick that he's going to appeal to a wide swath of Americans. He's a very regular guy, sort of aggressively normal. That is going to play with older white Americans, downscale, sort of high school graduate folks of all races. And so I think this was a really -- a real stroke by Kamala Harris to go her own way. They have a similar personality, right? If you've ever been around Kamala Harris, sort of office the record, she's very sort of funny and aggressively normal. And that's kind of how he is and very warm. And so I think that's why this pairing really makes sense for her.",

I mean, I think they're going to lean into that biography and clearly Kamala Harris referred to him as Coach Walz. I counted at least five times in the speech to get to that appeal point that Nia was saying.I do think though what Kasie and Audie were mentioning about a future versus a past. And this is where Donald Trump and his campaign, Jake, are in a bind right now and don't take it from me. I mean, Vivek Ramaswamy, a strong Trump supporter who was on our air earlier today and said good point blank, these last couple of weeks have been really tough for Republicans, bad for Republicans and this is a moment where they're trying to reset. Well, we're going to see how that reset goes. But here's the bind that he is in: it's in that tagline that Kamala Harris uses that you heard that entire arena, Temple, chant back to her, which is we're not going back, and you have a ticket that looks like the future. I mean, she talks about it as only possible in America here, right? So you have a ticket that's focused on the future and Donald Trump is running on a campaign to actually restore something from the past. And I just think that it presidential election this country are notoriously about the future and everything you saw in this outing was sort of pointing forward, and I think that's what the Trump campaign is going to have to respond to. Obviously, rollout day is the best day for a ticket. They've got 91 very hard campaign days ahead all right.",

That's what he was, a high school teacher.He was a football coach, he was the ranking member of the veterans committee in the U.S. House. And we certainly want somebody at the highest levels of government who's going to be fighting for the veterans of this country? And very significantly as the governor of the state of Minnesota and the reason that he is popular is he has been pro-labor. He has helped raise the minimum wage for gig workers. He has made sure that children in Minnesota do not go hungry. Now, some people may think that's a radical idea, I don't. And I think one of the misunderstandings that exist in the corporate media and in the political establishment is that standing up for working people, expanding Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision, expanding Social Security, so that the wealthiest not paying their fair share of taxes into the system, so we could raise benefits that ain't radical. More than 70 percent of the American people want programs like that, including a majority of Republicans.

SANDERS: Well, I don't want to give Trump's people any advice, but I would suggest that if they want to do that, they should read some of the polling. If Governor Walz believes, for example, that we should cut the price of prescription drugs in this country in half to what they all around the rest of the world, over 70 percent of the American people believe that. You want to attack them for being radical, I'll help pay for the ad. Walz believes we should cut prescription drugs that have, vote for Trump. I don't think so.

First of all, you had a big Vikings fan walking into an entire crowded arena of Philadelphia Eagles fans, okay. That alone is something to deal with. Then he just I think he was incredible. One, he established that he wasn't just a cookie cutter candidate. He wasn't one bit nervous. He was just fluid. He went in there, showed his genuine respect and friendship with Josh Shapiro who had done the same to him, putting at rest those disunity noises that we're hearing from the Republicans. And then he went on to do what he does. He was able to show how you govern. He was able to show that chemistry with the vice premier president and he was able to take down Donald Trump. And J.D.

This is a rural area used to be solid, solid Republican. Donald Trump won here with about 54 percent of the vote. So less Republican than it used to be. Can Tim Walz come here? Pennsylvania is all about the margins, right? Can he come here and pick up a few votes? Because he talks like these people, he knows what its like to be on a form. He knows what its like to be at the gun club, right? So that's one thing to watch for and I can tell you, not just here in my travels all year, you find a lot of voters, the people who didn't like Biden and didn't like Trump, the double-haters, they call them, independence, disaffected young people. They don't trust politicians. He talks differently. He's funny. Now, Kamala Harris is the candidate, not Tim Walz, but does it help in this moment where she has a trajectory of momentum going this way, can she sustain it? One way to do that is to get a new look if you will. So she has a big day today. Do people view them as differently? The environment and this election, Kaitlan, is a change election, with President Biden the top of the ticket. That change was going to be him losing. That's what most Democrats say. Can she shift that mood now and say they're the change, they're new, and they are different? And I think the way he talks, coach Walz will play in communities like this. Again, she's the candidate, so I don't want to overstate the power of the vice presidential candidate, but I think at a moment when they're getting a second look, there's something to this and trying to appeal in rural small communities like this.

And a good number of Pennsylvania Democrats we talked to said we just got Josh Shapiro. He's a first-term governor, we like him. Can we keep him? Can she pick somebody else? Now, overwhelmingly, there's no question Josh Shapiro would have helped here. Does that mean Governor Walz hurts here? I think it's too early to say that as we go forward. But clearly, what the vice president decided on. Listen to how they talk about his governing experience. He has deeper governing experience and deeper campaign experience that Governor Shapiro does -- not to take any of the way for Shapiro, a rising star, but the Harris team and the vice president made the calculation. This guy has deeper experience. They believe deeper strengths. We got 90 days to find out.",
