Hello and welcome back to the show. After nearly three years of being one of the most isolated nations in the world due to stringent pandemic restrictions China is unwinding its zero COVID policy at rapid speed. Starting January the 8th China will now scrap quarantine requirements for international arrivals restrictions on travel and flights out of the country will also ease. The global impact of this cannot be overstated. Japan, India and parts of Italy, for example, responding already they will require travelers from China to show a negative COVID test why? Well, a wave of new COVID cases is sweeping across China. But it's almost impossible to confirm just how many cases there are? China reducing how often it reports COVID-19 data and is now calling COVID an infection, not pneumonia CNN's Marc Stewart joins me now to talk more about all of this? Starting with online searches in China for travel they are up some tenfold on some sites. Let's just talk about how reopening one of the biggest economies in the world is likely to play out both outbound as it were an inbound?",

And as you rightly noted, it will have impacts on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. Earlier today here on CNN we heard from Ian Bremmer, a longtime China Scholar, President of the Eurasia Group, he pointed out the fact that American and other international business people can meet with their Chinese counterparts to have face to face meetings, the importance of that just cannot be underscored. Zoom meetings only went so far in this part of the world. And the chance to have a face to face conversation is just so significant. And then as we look at the reverse Chinese citizens wanting to go to other international destinations in particular here in the United States, New York and Ian Bremmer pointed out the amount of money that will be coming into the U.S. and other nations, from Chinese tourists, Chinese citizens wanting to visit their relatives abroad. That also is another significant economic story. So, Becky, we've been following this China story for the last three years. But I really think it's safe to say that we are about to see another big chapter about to be written in this very big sequence of events.",

We're talking by about for example 8 million people aged over 80 are not vaccinated at all, and B that many of those people who is vaccinated did so more than six months ago.

We don't have the normal hub, you know, hub and spoke like the other major airlines do. We fly point to point network, which can put our crews in the wrong places without airplanes mismatched, and that's what happened. And our software can't keep track of it. We've been telling them this for years. We have a meltdown, like once a year for the past five or six years and every year we go in and do an after action. And as swap the union leadership, we go in and talk to flight ops leadership and we tell them you know, you guys need to fix your scheduling software, the scheduling systems and how you operate our schedules and to no avail. They never updated never invest the money and resources they need to. And so we continue to have these issues. Of course, this is the largest disruption I've ever seen in my 16 years at the airline.

And the big issue is it'snot going to get any better at least not for a little while the airline has already canceled 62 percent of its flights today, close to 2500 flights. And they've already gone ahead and canceled nearly that total for tomorrow. The airline tells me it could be days of this where they're only running just over 1/3 of their scheduled flights as they try to regroup and the reality for so many travelers. It seems like the one behind me these rudely long lines as people are trying to reschedule and get on a flight rebook and those who are calling customer service. Many of them are waiting on hold for hours. I've been trying to call this morning, and I've just been getting a hold delay a hold signal. And so it has just been brutal for tens of thousands of travelers who are stranded right now. Now, the airline says that the big issue was the winter storm that it left their flight crew stranded in the wrong cities. And so right now they're trying to regroup and get people back to the correct locations. But the issue is that Southwest is really the only major U.S. Airline that's dealing with these mass cancellations. Yesterday they had more than 10 times the number of cancellations of any other major airline and their Pilots Union a head of it and said this really isn't an issue about winter weather. This is an issue of outdated processes and outdated IT at the airline. In fact, the CEO in a transcript that was sent to CNN, CNN obtained, he released a video message to employees on Christmas Day admitting that they were having operating issues and a part of the problem was the need to modernize the system. So Becky, a lot of difficulties happening right now at the airline at Southwest but the folks who are dealing with the brunt of it were facing the biggest issues are these travelers, some of them have been stranded at airports for days. They're looking at the possibility they won't be able to reschedule a flight until close to New Year's Eve. So it's just a very difficult situation for so many travelers here in Baltimore and across the United States.",

Thank you for your reporting.Well, Ukraine and Russia both are making new overtures about peace talks, but both appearing not to budge on what will be acceptable grounds for any negotiations. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov today saying that any peace must include, in his words, the de-militarization and de- nazification of regime controlled territories and warning if Ukraine doesn't accept Russia's demands, the war will be decided on the battlefield. And his comments coming after President Vladimir Putin said he is ready to negotiate \"about acceptable solutions\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is reaching out to his Indian counterpart Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help implement a peace plan. Ukraine reportedly saying any talks are contingent on Russia agreeing to face a war crimes tribunal. Well, on top of all of this, the power situation in Ukraine remains really difficult that is according to the country's energy minister. It's scary in Ukraine when the lights go out, especially for those who need Power for Life Saving medical devices. CNN's Will Ripley brings us one of their stories, have a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Christmas in Ukraine. Even the air raid sirens don't get a break. RIPLEY (on camera): So when the lights go out, you use this. How does, how do you turn on like that? RIPLEY (voice over): 12 year old Sebastian has an arsenal of battery powered lights for the blackouts so he can play with his small army of toy tanks. Unfortunately, this doesn't run on batteries. RIPLEY (on camera): Oh, you're using it as a weight. So that's how you stay strong. RIPLEY (voice over): Sebastian has cystic fibrosis, a rare lung disorder. He needs a nebulizer to inhale medicine. It keeps him alive. He could die without inhalations, we can't miss them, his grandmother says. The first time we had a blackout; we took the machine and ran around looking for a generator. We found a shop where people charge their phones, we did it there. His grandmother shows us their small portable nebulizer. When the lights go out, it gets the job done, barely. RIPLEY (on camera): This is 1319. RIPLEY (voice over): Patients like him rely on help from Savoy Foundation, a non-profit in Kyiv; they've helped more than 6000 people with breathing problems, the situation for many dire.

The sound of a blackout is even more terrifying than the sound of sirens for Olena Isayenko. The sound is like a flat line she says, she's living with respiratory failure on the 15th floor. Blackouts mean no elevator, no way to get to the bomb shelter downstairs. When you can't cook and there's no heat, you can live with that. But when you can't breathe, it's your life. Her portable respirator barely lasts two hours; it takes more than an hour to charge. Each blackout puts her life at risk.

Basically on television, I'm having a conversation with a bunch of colleagues about how it was unlikely that Vladimir Putin, even though he had built up tens of thousands of forces on the borders of Ukraine, to the east, how unlikely it was that he was going to take that step, cross the Rubicon and launch a full scale invasion is on the hands of the Ukrainians who resist. I say, well, I just heard a big bang, right here behind me. And it was a really shocking experience. Because, you know, not only was I having to report on the bombardment of Kyiv. But I also had to radically recalculate what was going on what was happening in this country I've been covering for so many years. But there's another. I've got a flak jacket right here. Let me just get on those first hours after the invasion were pretty frenetic, we didn't know what was really going on. There are all sorts of reports about Russian paratroopers moving into positions around the city. There was one particularly worrying report that airborne Russian Special Forces had moved into an airbase north of the Ukrainian capital, in an area called Hostomel, Hostomel that was the Antonov air base. These troops you can see over here, they are Russian airborne forces. I started chatting to that commander. And in the conversation, I said to him, so look, give me an idea of what we're seeing here, where, where are the Russians, I said, and he said to me, you know, what do you mean, you look really confused. So what do you mean, where are the Russians? And I said, well, I'm going to go live in a minute on CNN, you know, I want to, I want to tell people where the Russian forces have got to. And he looks at me, and he said, where the Russians, where the Russians. And at that point, we suddenly realized that we had come face to face, we crossed the front line inadvertently. And so it just shows us now for the first time, just how close Russian forces have got towards the center of the Ukrainian capitalist. I think what was most amazing, most surprising, I suppose about those first few days was the level of resistance that we saw that we witnessed by ordinary Ukrainians as well as the Ukrainian military, of course, but we saw ordinary Ukrainian people pick up weapons, defend their streets, their buildings, their yards.

Now this was put in place in the early days of the pandemic and allowed the U.S. government to expel migrants to their home country. Border agents in the El Paso, Texas area continue to see about 60 and 100 migrants every day and see if the restriction is lifted. That number could be much higher. In fact, right now more than 20,000 migrants are in shelters and makeshift encampments in northern Mexico. CNN's Rosa Flores joins us from El Paso in Texas. And I know the weather has been pretty inclement over the last few days. So it's been pretty miserable for those on the ground. You've reported that some 22,000 migrants are stuck in encampments on the Mexican side of the border. What more are we learning Rosa at this point?",

Others say that they crossed over illegally because they got so tired. A lot of the people that I've talked to here are from Venezuela, they describe the harsh and dire economic conditions that they couldn't afford to feed their families in Venezuela. That's why they made their dangerous track. Now, this is the church at night, it turns into a shelter. But the capacity is only 120 people preference is given to women with children, families with children, and you see all of the blankets that are along the church, all those blankets are pulled out. And a lot of these individuals find a spot in this cold concrete to spend the night. That's when it's really difficult for these families, because that's when the temperatures really drop, Becky. Now according to a federal law enforcement source, about 1500 to 1600 migrants are still turning themselves in into immigration authorities every single day in this area that's down for 2500 about two weeks ago, but that's still a very high number, a very high number. I remember it during the surge of 2019, thousand encounters every day was a big deal back then. Here they're seen between 1500 and 1600. Before I let you go, I want to show you here because this is what we see every single day. People from El Paso and these are just residents from this area or organizations. They drive up. They give water they bring food. They provide clothing, things like that for the migrants that are here in El Paso as they're trying to figure out how to get out of El Paso because Becky here's the thing. These migrants don't want to stay here in El Paso. They want to go to different parts of the United States. A lot of them just don't have money. They don't have transportation, or they don't have family to meet them someplace or to send the money so that they can get out of the border area. Brenda, I mean, excuse me, Becky.",
