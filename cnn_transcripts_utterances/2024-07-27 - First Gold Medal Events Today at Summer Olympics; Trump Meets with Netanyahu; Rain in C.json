The scale of it, the number of boats. We had the dancers, we had the history, we had the fashion. The athletes did get very, very wet. There was a lot of ponchos on display. We're judging by what they've been posting on social media. They were all really excited to be part of it. We had the great sporting legends. We had Zinedine Zidane carrying the Olympic torch. We had Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams. Of course this is a city that has been so integral to their tennis career, some of their greatest moments. And then we did have that much rumored moment with Celine Dion, the iconic singer, who had said, in the midst of her health concerns with this stiff person syndrome that she been dealing with. She said she was dreaming of just being able to see the Eiffel Tower again. Not only did she see the Eiffel Tower, she performed on it in the most emotional, spectacular fashion, wearing Dior. There were -- there was not a dry eye, I think it's fair to say, from those watching on that. And that lighting of the cauldron, the hot air balloon rising into the air, which will without doubt become one of those iconic opening ceremony moments. But that is really the moment that the baton, the torch gets passed now to the athletes, from the iconic moments of the opening ceremony, is now over to the athletes to have their moments and take it from here.",

Thank you for joining us from Paris.Some of France's high-speed train services have been restored now, hours after what officials say were a coordinated sabotage attack to disrupt several rail lines before the opening ceremony. Two trains carrying Olympic athletes were affected. The Paris prosecutor's office is investigating but, so far, no one's claimed responsibility for the attacks. CNN's Melissa Bell has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The organizers of Paris 2024 believed they were ready for anything but it was early this morning, just hours from the opening ceremony that French authorities said \"coordinated sabotage\" and arson caused chaos. PATRICE VERGRIETE, FRENCH MINISTER DELEGATE FOR TRANSPORT (through translator):  Today, all the information we have clearly shows that it was deliberate, the simultaneous nature. Everything happened at the same time. Everything now points to the fact that these were arson attacks, particularly the timing, which is more than suspicious. BELL (voice-over):  Security in Paris is tight with authorities keen to make sure that things go smoothly. But this was one attack carried out simultaneously across the country that was impossible to imagine. Intelligence services say this tactic has been used before by far-left groups.

This morning they told us they would be 3:20 late and in the end the train was canceled. So we had to take a bus to Paris. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I wanted to get to Paris for the Olympics. So I have no idea what I m going to do because they told us there won't be any trains until this afternoon. And they don't know when it will start again. BELL (voice-over):  It wasn't just speculators affected, with one official telling reporters that only two of the four trains carrying athletes were able to run. As repairs get underway, the national railway company's regional director said it could take a day or more before lines start functioning again. The latest drama likely to dampen the spirits of the French, many of them heading off from family holidays, even as Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo believed that enthusiasm for the Games had finally gripped the country. HIDALGO (through translator):  I felt that the enthusiasm arrived a little before during the passage of the flame in Paris on July 14th and 15th. The Olympic flame was paraded in Paris and there were people everywhere -- children, elderly people, all social classes. Everyone was really happy. And I said to myself that it's the magic of the games working. BELL (voice-over):  With the Olympics now firmly underway, organizers will be hoping that this will be a short-lived memory -- Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.

The IDF warned it would, quote, \"forcefully\" operate in the area and told residents to head to al Mawasi.However, the designated humanitarian area in al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July the 14th, which reportedly killed 90 people and injured 300. Israel says the orders to evacuate come after what it calls significant terrorist activity and rocket fire coming from the area. High level talks for a ceasefire in Gaza and hostage release deal are expected to resume in Rome in the coming days. A diplomat familiar with the plans tells CNN that U.S. CIA director Bill Burns and Israeli intelligence officials are set to meet with Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Those talks could happen as soon as this weekend, though the situation is fluid and nothing is nailed down. Families of hostages expressed optimism that a deal is within reach after meeting with the Israeli prime minister and U.S. president this week.
