The military junta that seized power is accusing France of organizing a strike to free ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. On Monday morning, they claim they arrested at least six members of Bazoum's party. A day earlier, furious protesters attacked the French embassy in Niamey, and thousands of pro-coup demonstrations showed their support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the meantime, the President of nearby Chad traveled to Niger's capital to meet with Bazoum and coup leaders. Niger's ousted prime minister says a resignation from the ousted leader is unlikely. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OUHOUMOUDOU MAHAMODOU, NIGER'S OUSTED PRIME MINISTER (through translator): This is a seizure of power by force. It is not a voluntary departure of the President, so there is no reason to talk about this resignation issue. He is a great fighter. He is a seasoned trade unionist and also, as you know, he is someone who is always outspoken. So, if he is optimistic about the situation, you would better believe it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why you see the transitional President of Chad, Idriss Deby, traveling to Niamey, meeting with General Abdourahamane Tiani, who now declares himself president, as well as the man he deposed, President Mohamed Bazoum, the first time we've actually seen him since he was deposed. To the answer to your question, Zain, he appears to be still in the presidential palace. He's receiving calls, the French are saying they've been able to speak to him, so many other world leaders. And this situation with General Tiani actually receiving President Deby and talking, they said they had in-depth discussions, but no white smoke, so no resolution out of this conflict, which puts the ball back in ECOWAS' court. They have to figure out how can they negotiate out of this, or will they actually make good on their threats to deploy militarily in Niger, like they've done once before in the Gambia. Zain.",

The rally was being held by an Islamist party that is part of Pakistan's coalition government. Massive flooding from a powerful typhoon has forced more than half a million people from their homes in China, including tens of thousands in Beijing alone. Now, a second approaching storm is threatening to cause even more damage. Typhoon Doxori made landfall on Friday killing at least four people. Officials say that number could still rise as its early days. It's the strongest storm to hit China since 2006. This was the scene, what you're looking at here, this was the scene in Beijing where cars were literally swept away, carried away, pretty much a lot of them underwater there due to rushing floodwaters. The capital received a month's worth of rain in just two days. Jennifer Gray is at the CNN Weather Center. So, Jennifer, I mean, here's the thing. You've seen these extreme weather events in China, especially this summer, whether it's heat waves or whether it's this typhoon. And then now, another hurricane-level storm is on the way, as well. Just walk us through what people there are going through. JENNIFER GRAY, CNN Meteorologist: Right. We have had just the past few months of very extreme weather across portions of China, as you mentioned, extreme heat. And now, we're dealing with extreme rain. So, the remnants of Doxori is headed to the north. So, for the most part, the rain has wrapped up for that area, but all eyes are on the secondary system that's also very strong. But there's a lot of uncertainty in what this one's going to do, so it's too early to tell exactly where it's going to go, but it is a huge concern and we'll walk you through it. Right now, we're looking at rainfall totals from 250 to 350 millimeters and just in 48 hours' time. And as you mentioned, that was about a month's worth of rain and just a 48-hour period and rivers were swollen. We had water just rushing down, carrying off cars, debris, as well as small homes and shacks just going down the river. And so, we had very dangerous situation unfold right around Beijing. Now, moving forward, the bulk of the rain is going to stay across northern sections of China. What's left of that storm, the remnants of the storm is well to the north. We're looking at Beijing to see anywhere from, say, 25 to 40, maybe 50 millimeters of rain for areas around Beijing, and then much, much heavier rainfall, 150 to 200 millimeters of rain for areas to the north. The second system, Zain, is going to stall out, and so could be just off the coast of China in the next couple of days.",

But you know, we have talked to people, both current and former Trump aides and allies, who frequent Mar-a-Lago and nobody really seemed to know who he was. We were told that he didn't really interact with club members. He wasn't part of the former president's inner circle. He wasn't privy to high-level conversations. But now he is in the middle of this federal case. And today, we got our first glimpse of him in court here behind me. And he showed up wearing a suit. He was with his Washington, D.C.-based attorney. He gave his name to the judge. The judge asked him after, as he read the charges to him, if he understood those charges. He told him that he had the right to remain silent and the right to have a lawyer, as well. And then he did tell him that he would be released on this $100,000 bond. But what's interesting is, he did say that he has a passport, which was expired, Zain, but the judge said he still had to turn that over within 48 hours. He also told him that he could not leave the area of South Florida without permission and that he could not speak to any of the witnesses in this case who have been identified by the government. He did not enter a plea, it's worth noting. He will do that on August 10th when he has a Florida-based attorney. He would need a Florida-based attorney in order to enter a plea for him.

A poll by the New York Times and CNN College finds Trump with more support than all of his rivals combined. There he is with more than half the support among Republican voters.

Globally, one in every 77 people are forced to flee their homes and take refuge in neighboring countries. However, some risk life and limb to go further. So, why the U.K.? Well, there are several reasons, like, of course, better work opportunities, study as well. The Red Cross says that some people already have family there and they know that when they reach the U.K., they can likely speak the language which, of course, makes things easier. But sometimes that hope for a new life is extinguished pretty quickly with many not reaching their destination at all. The British government is ramping up measures to deter migrants from crossing the Channel from France and a controversial new law has been passed that will include criminalizing anyone who seeks asylum there in this way. The country has also invested millions in high-tech surveillance to spot small boats.

Now, CNN has found that at the time of the incident, the U.K. government had expensive A.I. technology designed to spot these boats, and knowing that the vessel was soon entering their territory, and that there were people freezing in the water including children, they could have sent this. A Takeva AR-5 drone designed to detect small boats and capable of deploying a life raft. It's licensed by the U.K. government. Even the British prime minister proud to show it off. CNN has established it flew over the same area where the distress call was made on multiple previous journeys. It even flew the day before and after the incident, but not in the hours the vessel was sinking. Instead, it took more than an hour for the first U.K. lifeboat to arrive, in which time a fishing crew rescued the majority on board. VOICE-OVER: We must stop the boats. POLGLASE (voice-over): This tech forms part of a campaign of deterrence and hostility by the government towards those attempting to reach British shores. Millions of pounds have been spent on AI cameras trained to find rubber dinghies, some able to see beyond U.K. waters, drones with automatic identification abilities. Companies tout their life-saving capabilities. Footage from these drones is also being used to identify those driving the boats and prosecute them for human trafficking.

And we're talking about a region of the world that has just remained very undeveloped for many years.

And I should walk that back, actually, and say that it's not that France has control over these institutions, but there is something to be said about the fact that the, you know, the currency in West Africa, the SAFA, is tied still to the French Franc and their treasury. That said, I think what we're seeing in general is also, you know, you have a very, very young population. Something like 60 percent of West Africans are under the age of 25. And these young people are having access to social media, they're globalized, they know what opportunities are out there, and they also know that they're not really able to achieve those. So, there's this natural push to want to throw off the yoke of their former colonial ties. And I think that's being conflated.

Familyand friends are asking again for privacy but also for prayers. As you know Zain, as you followed, things are quite dire in Haiti right now. The U.S. started evacuating non-essential personnel on Thursday, the same day that Dorsainvil and her child were taken. And they have told Americans not to travel to Haiti at all, given the violence, but also the risk of abduction. I should say, as well, that the U.N. has been calling for a multinational force there on the ground. No takers so far, although on the weekend, Kenya did say that they were willing to perhaps put as many as a thousand troops on the ground to train police there. But no word on that in the last 48 hours to see if that has been taken forward. The only way it can be taken forward, Zain, is with approval from the U.N. The U.S. says there has been progress made on getting a force on the ground, but that will not come in time for this woman and her child as frantic negotiations right now are underway to really isolate exactly where she is and what her captors demands are.",

Clearly annoyed and upset, Cardi reacted by throwing her microphone into the crowd as security guards rushed on stage. Drake, Kelsey Ballarini, Harry Styles, BB Rexha, just some of the other artists who've had to deal with this, who've had objects from candy to jewelry to chicken nuggets -- chicken nuggets thrown at them while performing. And Chloe Melas joins us live now. The chicken nuggets -- chicken nuggets thing, I mean I shouldn't laugh, but oh my God, what is happening just in terms of people behaving this way at concerts? And what should be done? I mean obviously just in terms of how Cardi B reacted, you could argue that she shouldn't be throwing things at the audience members either, but what should be done to protect artists while they're performing?",

      "sentences": "Zain, it is a complicated and concerning trend that we are seeing at concerts. This is nothing new. Imean, since the beginning of live music, people occasionally have thrown things. But the difference here is that it's happening more frequently. And we are seeing people get incredibly hurt. You mentioned Bebe Rexha. She was performing when someone threw their phone, hitting her in the face. She had to get stitches, was taken to the hospital. Not only does it ruin the experience for everyone, it's dangerous. I had spoken to Tim McGraw over the weekend who's about to go on tour and he said, you know, not only could hurt the person performing, it could hurt a fellow audience member. You could potentially see netting being put up around the stage, obviously having your cell phone and other items confiscated before you go in so you will have nothing on you at the concert. Imagine those lines to get out of the venue. You know, you mentioned chicken nuggets. I mean, when Pink was performing recently, someone threw their mother's ashes on the stage, right? And so, Adele and others have spoken out and have said, do not throw anything. What is the point? This is so disturbing and so concerning. And if this continues, I think that very soon, Zain, we're going to see the way that we attend and go to live music will change forever. And that is going to be unfortunate because it's going to ruin the experience for everyone.",
