Moments ago, Dow closed down almost 277 points over banking fears, as did shares of major U.S. banks such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase down 278 points. Experts were already worried about the health of the banking industry after two U.S. banks failed within three days of each other. That led credit firm Moody's to downgrade its outlook for the entire U.S. banking sector. And those worries skyrocketed today because of troubles facing the global investment company Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse's biggest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, appeared to rule out giving funding to the already embattled company, and that combined with the recent U.S. issue sent stocks falling today. I want to bring in CNN business reporter Rahel Solomon. Rahel, walk us through how all of this unfolded today.",

Now, to be clear, stocks today closed off their lows of the day, but slightly lower. I think the Nasdaq actually closed slightly higher which is interesting.But this is really just a confidence issue at this point. You can see that reflected very clearly in some of the bank stocks. I want to point your attention to some of the regional stocks that, Jake, you and I have talked about this week already. Take a look, First Republic Bank off 21 percent, PacWest off 5 percent on top of their losses over five sessions or so. So, it's been a rough go for some of the regional stocks as we face the confidence issue in banking. But some of the larger banks getting swept up in the selloff. Take a look, Chase was off earlier. Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo also getting swept up in this larger selloff. And to be clear, Jake, Credit Suisse is a bank that has had significant challenges over the years, certainly had some scandals over the years. It's been considered the problem child of European banking, so it had its fair share of issues even before SVB's collapse, even before Signature. But I think what we're witnessing how on edge investors are about the sector and the outlook for banking. So, really, some confidence issues here moving forward.",

Credit Suisse meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systematically important banks, essentially saying that its books look solid, but this is the most important thing. If necessary, the SNB, the Swiss National Bank will provide Credit Suisse with liquidity.

However, they are very cognizant of the fact, as Rahel was pointing out, that there has been a mood shift, there has been a different in terms of how people are viewing the entire sector, and therefore any problem can create a real risk, particularly in one in a bank as large as Credit Suisse.Now, Treasury officials have been monitoring the U.S. exposure, the U.S. financial markets exposure to Credit Suisse throughout the course of the day. They've been talking on a pretty regular basis with their counterparts in Europe as well, trying to ensure that the spillover risk is limited. And if there is spillover risk, they're cognizant of that fact.

That is something that does not seem to have any pathway forward nor any immediate effect of what we're watching and dealing with now.When it comes to Capitol Hill with emergency infusion of cash, there just aren't a lot of conversations right now, in part because it's a recognition of a political environment and government where Republicans have stated opposition what happened over the weekend, almost all of whom are deeply opposed to what happened back in 2008. So there's no real move to doing something like that. Plus, they don't think that's necessitated at this point in time based on what they're seeing.

And so, it's possible that a ruling would still have the drug that's been on the market and stalked in pharmacies and been around for decades.And so, people could in those states where abortion is generally legal do a misoprostol only regiment, which is my understanding is 5 percent or 10 percent less effective, it takes longer, and it's much less comfortable for the patient. A two-drug regiment really is the gold standard. So, it's possible some people who would have elected medication abortion will go with the misoprostol only regiment, and it's also possible some of them will choose a procedural abortion. The problem with that is that requires an actual visit to a clinic, whereas, medication abortion can be done with telemedicine. Even folks driving from states where it's illegal, to states where it's legal, had the opportunity in recent months to cross the border, do a telemedicine visit from their car.

And we don't have some of the most modern equipment.For example, we had equipment that would give alerts to pilots if you're about to have a collision on the runway. But it's not mandatory. It's not widely available. The European Union was looking to put that in place. And, then, you know, finally, there is one common theme for all of these near misses. And in almost every case, there's a communication error. There's confusion about the runways and so you have to eliminate the confusion through training and better awareness. And, finally, almost all of them, there's a human failure. So if someone messed up, it wasn't usually equipment. So there are common themes and those have to be fixed.",
