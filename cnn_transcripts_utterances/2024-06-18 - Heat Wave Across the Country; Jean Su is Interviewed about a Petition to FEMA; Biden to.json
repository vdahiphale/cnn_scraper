Again, we're talking about over 80 percent of the U.S. population looking at temperatures of 90 degrees or even higher. And yes, for some that's maybe five or ten degrees above average, not too far, but for others we're reaching record-breaking levels.Look at this, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, all setting record highs yesterday. Some several degrees beyond what the previous record was. More records are expected, not just today, but likely through the end of the week. You're talking over 150 high temperature records could be broken in just the next several days. The bulk of them are in the Northeast and the Midwest, but you even have a few down in the Southeast, a few out to the west too. So, a lot of folks looking at this exceptionally pretty decent heat wave that's out there. Now for some, too, it's not just the temperature itself, but also factoring in the humidity. And that's impacts on the body. We refer to that as the heat index. Take a look at the feels like temperature today. In Cincinnati it's going to feel like it is 100 degrees later this afternoon, 103 is what it will feel like in Syracuse, New York, later today. And even Boston getting that feels like temperature up around 96. Another concern for some places is the prolonged nature of this heatwave. Take Pittsburgh for example. The average high this time of year, 80 degrees. Not only will we spend every single one of the next seven days above that, but the bulk of them, you're talking ten to even 15 degrees, Sara, above where they normally would be even for summer.",

Thank you both for being here. I want to start with what we're expecting to hear from Joe Biden today. He's going to announce this new immigration policy. This comes after he announced a policy that made actually it more strict for asylum seekers to come into the country. So you have these two things going. But this is a little bit of DACA, because of the children, and then the spouses of undocumented immigrants would be able to apply for citizenship.

On the other hand, there are 100,000 voters who are married to undocumented immigrants just between the states of Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. And for those swing voters, in those swing states, it's obviously a very big priority. So, he's got to play the balancing game very well. The White House has a lot of messaging ahead of it to make sure that they don't offend one part of the coalition they're trying to protect, and at the same time that they make it clear that they're taking immigration seriously because it is a big issue for the rest of the country.",

And that's having an impact on the quality of life and the safety of those residents in that city.And so I'm - you know, whether I - again, I can't get into the details of what President Trump said or didn't.

So, if you're blaming immigration on crime and places like Milwaukee, which you shouldn't, you should have done something about that.
