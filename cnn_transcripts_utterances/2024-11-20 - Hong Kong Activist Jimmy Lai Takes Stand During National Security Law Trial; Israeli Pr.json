It's a high-stakes court battle that could see him spend the rest of his life behind bars. The pro-democracy activist was arrested nearly four years ago amid Beijing's deepening crackdown on dissent. In his defense, Lai told the court he had always opposed violence during the anti-government protests of 2019.Hong Kong officials argue that Lai's actions jeopardized China's national sovereignty and security. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following developments for us. And Kristie, this is a very significant day in that trial.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Max. The court has adjourned for today, but I'm standing outside the court where earlier today, the jailed media mogul Jimmy Lai spoke for the very first time in his national security trial. Earlier, he had pleaded not guilty to several charges, including sedition, including colluding with foreign forces. Very serious charges that if convicted could send him to life in prison.Earlier today, we saw about 100 people, members of the public gather outside for a chance to sit inside the courtroom. And security has been very tight this day, this rainy day here in Hong Kong with police officers pulling and picking some members of the public from the line to question them and to search them. Now, inside the courtroom, we got a chance to see and to hear from Jimmy Lai himself. He's now 77 years old. He appeared visibly thinner. He waved to supporters in the courtroom, including his wife, including his daughter. And he also spoke calmly. He talked about how he had always opposed violence and that he finds any advocacy for independence for Hong Kong, quote, crazy. This is a trial that is being closely watched and monitored here in Hong Kong and around the world. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STOUT (voice-over): As a father figure to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, Jimmy Lai has been on a collision course with the Chinese authorities for years, but he never let that phase him.",

The former media mogul finally getting his day in court on Wednesday, taking the stand in his high profile trial, which began nearly a year ago. He faces a possible life sentence for multiple counts of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security, along with a separate charge of sedition. And for 77 year old Lai, life would most likely mean life. He has already been in custody for nearly four years. His arrest after sweeping national security laws imposed by Beijing, which China said restored stability to Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests in 2019. At that time, Lai had lobbied foreign governments to apply pressure on China, but his lawyers denied that happened after the new laws came into effect. In 2020, Lai was marched out of the offices of Apple Daily, the pro-democracy newspaper, which he founded. Today, most of Hong Kong's political opposition have either fled the territory or are in prison, like Lai, who after a lifetime of speaking up for democratic freedoms, may be getting his final chance to speak publicly before spending the rest of his days behind bars. (END VIDEOTAPE) STOUT (on camera): Jimmy Lai's relationships with U.S. politicians was a focus during questioning this afternoon in the courtroom. His dealings and exchanges with the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with the former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with the former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, the list goes on. But it's important to note two things. Number one, he did not directly talk with then president, now president-elect Donald Trump, and that these discussions took place before the summer of 2020. That was when Beijing imposed the national security law on the territory. Back to you -- Max.",

But we don't have any more details beyond what he has said that you just heard there. We don't know how it would work logistically, practically on the ground in the midst of a war. We have had, though, some responses from families of those who are still being held hostage in Gaza.

Now, this refers back to a controversial deal back in 2018 when Qatar was funding Hamas, transferring millions of dollars to Gaza. And it was known by Israel. It was tacitly approved by Israel at the time. Netanyahu said that was to stave off humanitarian catastrophe and also to try and make the Israeli villages around Gaza safer. But it certainly is a controversial decision to publicly say this while he is standing in central Gaza, at the Netzarim Corridor, which splits north and southern Gaza apart. And of course, it raises the question, well, where does this lead negotiations? Is this a tacit acceptance that negotiations with Hamas to try and secure the release of these hostages in tandem with ceasefire? Does that mean that that is going nowhere -- Max?",

On Tuesday night in Malaga in front of the Spanish fans who've adored him for so long and surrounded by the teammates that he inspired to play the game. Nadal's remarkable 23 year career came to a close. And it was emotional right from the off even before a ball had been struck. Nadal was tearful during the national anthem before the Davis Cup quarterfinal match against the Netherlands. He had to compose himself quickly because he went out first playing what was his first competitive match in some three months and he did find the going tough. Nadal was beaten in straight sets by Botic van de Zandschulp. But he wasn't necessarily finished, not quite. If his teammates could win their matches then Spain would survive and prolong his career just a bit. Carlos Alcaraz tried his best but ultimately they lost in the doubles and that was that. So watching on from the sidelines this was the moment that Nadal knew his wonderful journey as a professional tennis player had come to an end. Everybody knew that it was going to be the end this week at some point but of course everybody was hoping that he'd go out on a high. But in any case the Spanish team was prepared to mark the occasion with a special retirement ceremony. Nadal spoke at length on the court in Spanish and English about his career and this moment. At times, the crowd chanted his name, Rafa, Rafa, Rafa and as he took the applause and as he watched a video of his career highlights that's when the lip began to wobble and the tears began to flow. Some of his contemporaries, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic Serena Williams, also players known as the GOATS. They were speaking, they were wishing him a fond farewell. They were all saying how much they're going to miss him and quite honestly it was very hard to watch and not be moved as a spectator. Remember, Nadal won a record 14 French Open titles, 22 Grand Slam singles titles. He was, as I say, one of the big three and he absolutely will be missed. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
