Donald Trump formally nominated for the top spot a little while ago, and made clear his vice presidential choice, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, who will be nominated soon.We're told that Senator Vance is getting ready to make an appearance in his new role for the very first time. Let's check in with CNN's Kristen Holmes, who has some new report bring on this. And, Kristen, what are you learning about conversations between Trump and Vance before today's announcement?",

Now, we did also report previously that in recent days, Donald Trump met with all of the vice presidential potential candidate I think that it's Senator Marco Rubio as well as Doug Burgum. But the timing on Vance is particularly notable and critical given what happened later that day.Now I am told hold by a variety of sources that he had not come to any conclusion at the end of all of those in-person meetings, but he had continued to waffle back and forth looking for all of the things that he had put on his list, all they vice presidential pick including things like chemistry and securing his legacy. Now, of course, he has officially named Vance as his running mate, but it is a notable timing even when that meeting being occurred, Jake.",

There is excitement about the pick, but there's also questions. What does Senator JD Vance bring to the ticket? What does he add to the party, talking to a variety of Republican officials looking at House and Senate races as well? Many of them were hoping for someone in the mold of Nikki Haley, if you will, someone who could win over some of those moderate voters, perhaps.Jake, what this also has done in an instant, it has potentially changed the next race for president in 2028. Yes, it's early to talk about that. But in one tweet from the former president, naming JD Vance is running mate, is also changed this via to directory of a Republican like Governor Glenn Youngkin, like Nikki Haley, like Ron DeSantis, so many others. So what has happened here is we see JD Vance would likely come to the floor in the coming minutes or hours we are certainly going to see what is the future of the Republican Party is well. So, yes, there's a bit of a divide between the grassroots and the elected class, but there is no question in this decision, Donald Trump is looking ahead beyond his presidency -- Jake.",

It is something that takes practice.I mean, when you when I covered the 2020s, seeing all those Democrats, many of whom were running for the very first time, the Republican primary this time around, many Republicans running through this first time. It takes them a long time to get into the groove of the scrutiny of a campaign, of what it's like to really, actually not just be a surrogate, to be the nominee.

A lot of interests by delegates as well, because we are expecting Senator Vance to walk down that aisle. That is the first time we'll be seeing him since Donald Trump announced that he has selected him to be his running mate, and on that ticket.So, obviously, we'll watch him very closely to see what he says when he speaks to the microphone. He's someone who has been asked basically in every media appearance and last four months or so, if he is going to serve as Donald Trump's running mate, he has made clear that he would have liked to have taken that job and he was always a little bit coy as most president told, candidates and contenders typically are.

I think a lot of those criticisms are still valid, but you're not allowed to say them and you certainly not allowed to say 'em the way that Joe Biden has been saying 'em.

He matters because what he means for a Republican Party long term. This is cementing a kind of nationalism. Now, Trump -- to your point, I agree with you. He's an instinctive, impulsive, intuitive nationalist. JD Vance is an ideological nationalist. That's a much more dangerous virus because he can make this -- he can polish this stuff and make it seem palatable to people. He can sell this stuff to Silicon Valley. You can sell this stuff to other places. And what it does is it locks the Republican Party on a path way that I think is dangerous for the world, again, the Ukrainians are now in deep trouble. NATO is now in deep trouble. Trump is, you get a gone with it with Nikki Haley, and signal to the world, hey, listen, I got to get stuck to my base, but I'm not going to abandon the world.
