We're following all the fallout from Trump's escalating attacks on the judge overseeing the trial and the judge's daughter.Also breaking, more on a new ruling by the Florida Supreme Court clearing the way for a six-week abortion ban to take effect in the state, but the court also is green lighting a vote on a proposed state constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights for women. And a new flashpoint in the Middle East right now as Iran threatens retaliation for a deadly attack on its Consulate building in Syria, blaming Israel for the airstrike. We're getting new reaction from a key member of Congress this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. A very busy night of breaking news, we begin this hour with the new request to expand Donald Trump's gag order in the hush money criminal case exactly two weeks before the trial is set to begin. Let's go into CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, give us the latest on this request by the Manhattan district attorney and the Trump team's response.",

      "sentences": "So, Wolf, here, prosecutors are asking the judge to expand the gag order imposed on former President Trump to include family members of people involved in the case, because last week, this gag order was imposed that prohibits Trump from making statements about witnesses, jurors, prosecutors, court staff, or the family members of prosecutors and court staff.But the gag order does not apply to the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, or the judge overseeing the case. And shortly after this gag order was imposed, Trump fired off a series of social media posts, attacking the judge and attacking his adult daughter, who works for a political consulting firm. And, Wolf, there was some confusion about whether the gag order applied to that daughter, because, again, it does not apply to the judge. Both sides have sought clarification today. The district attorney's office writing, quote, the defendant knows what he is doing and everyone else does too. And we all know exactly what the defendant intends because he has said for decades that it is part of his life philosophy to go after his perceived opponents as viciously and violently as he can. Now, the Trump team has also responded. They insist that they do not read this gag order as applying to the family members of the judge or the district attorney, and they oppose any suggestion that it should be expanded to include those group because they argue that this is a violation of Trump's political speech. They wrote today, the court should reject the people's invitations to expand the gag order, which is already an unlawful prior restraint that improperly restricts campaign advocacy by the presumptive Republican nominee and leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election. Now, Wolf, with just two weeks to go before this trial begins, they're also asking for more time to file a motion to remove Judge Juan Merchan from this case. Now, they tried something similar last year. That was rejected. But the Trump legal team says they now have new evidence. So, all of this now up to the judge.",

In the long-term, voters here will decide whether they will be able to expand access to abortions.Now, the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling on two cases, both of them dealing with abortion rights here in Florida. In the first case, the justices really overturned years of precedent in a rule that a right to privacy in the state constitution doesn't protect the right to an abortion. That is a decision that clears the way for a six-week ban to take effect in about 30 days. Now, the case before the court dealt with Florida's current 15- week ban, which was challenged by a number of groups, including Planned Parenthood, and while that case played out in court, lawmakers in Florida, they passed a stricter six-week ban, which does include exceptions like rape and incest. Now, the ban was put on hold while the court decided all of these issues. Florida now joins a list of states across the southeast with serious restrictions, if not a ban on abortions. Planned Parenthood here in Florida said that the impact of this ruling is not just for women who live in Florida, but women that live and other states that have been traveling to Florida in an effort to get access to an abortion. The organization told me that they've been anticipating today's ruling. They said they have a plan in place to help women go to other States once this six-week ban takes effect. Wolf?",

So, while Florida has trended redder over the last few presidential cycles, we have seen time and again that this is an issue that motivates not only Democratic voters, but independent voters and a lot of moderate Republicans who don't want to see the government dictating the kinds of reproductive health care choices that women have.

And it's important to protect the sanctity of life. But those in the pro-life community also recognize there's a huge battle ahead, as this issue now will be up before voters on the next election. And as we've said, when this is on the ballot, it does turn out voters. And it's important to shift the conversation from talking about abortion bans to abortion limits. And I think Nikki Haley hit this issue square on in terms of, let's stop talking about bans and limits, and where most people agree. And if you look at poll after poll, people across this country in red states and blue states, nearly seven in ten oppose late-term abortions. That's something we can all agree on. So, let's talk about where we can put limits on abortions and do away with this language of bans, so we can most importantly protect unborn children, but also mothers, and make sure that we keep exceptions in place for rape, incest, and life of the mother, because that is another issue that voters do agree on.",

And I think the Florida attorney general challenging this ballot proposal to impose -- overturn the ban, I think it was important, as Carlos mentioned, that the word viability, when is a fetus viable, that's the question. Because the concern is that this can be interpreted in a very ambiguous way, and this could lead to late-term abortions, which is not something that a majority of Americans are concerned with. So, this is a conversation that certainly needs to be had, and Republicans need to recognize this is something that we need to make sure that we're speaking in a way that appeals to majority of Americans, but also protects the sanctity of life at the same time.",

Now, the State Department at this point, they are not weighing in either. They're saying that they're still trying to get more information from regional partners and allies about just who was behind this, who the target actually was.

As we've been reporting, based on our law enforcement sources, authorities went back through his background, his social media history. This was a central casting believer of conspiracy theories, particularly surrounding the 2020 election, surrounding some of the vitriol that former President Trump has been offering about the FBI.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As dawn breaks over Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, the full extent of this latest nightmare becomes clear, building scorched, some still ablaze, others riddled with bullet holes, are completely destroyed below. Bodies lay crushed and decomposing. Under torchlight, limbs are found tangled amid earth and rubble. This is the aftermath of the Israeli military's 14-day siege on what once was Gaza's largest hospital. Please, God, enough, this woman screams. How much more can Gaza civilians be forced to endure? Medical crews tells CNN, they arrived on Monday morning to find hundreds of bodies scattered around the complex others have been left wounded starving, and desperate for help . We spent days without food or water until the military gave us a few food cans, but they were not enough to feed all the patients, Dina says. They would give each patient just a quarter of a water bottle each day. The bombardment and shooting was constant. Again, the scale of the destruction wrought by the Israeli military here seems impossible to quantify. In the surrounding area, entire families were trapped in their homes for two weeks, on the near constant bombardment. Upon the Israeli military's withdrawal, Arafat Alulu (ph) was finally able to return home, only to find that his wife and seven children had been killed. The Israeli military has discovered the siege on a Shifa as a precise operation, targeting Hamas militants, some 200 of which they say were killed, though CNN is unable to verify this figure. Weapons and intelligence documents are also said to have been found on the complex, which had been housing hundreds of civilians when the siege began. The IDF maintains that soldiers distinguish between militants and civilians. But such claims stand in stark contrast to the troubling testimonies and videos CNN has received from countless civilians and medical staff who are trapped in and around the hospital. We can't estimate the number of medical staff who were targeted in what we can only call executions, this medical official says In earlier testimonies shared with CNN, civilians described being stripped, bound, and blindfolded in the cold before facing interrogations by Israeli soldiers. Reports of beatings are also widespread. For days, medical staff within the hospital told CNN they couldn't even move between buildings on the complex for fear of being targeted by Israeli snipers. Every day, a patient would die, nurse Mousa says. The occupation soldiers used us as human shields inside the hospital. More than 300 bodies have so far been recovered according to authorities in Gaza. But that figure will likely only rise, warnings that Al Shifa could soon be turned into a graveyard, now a gut- wrenching reality. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
