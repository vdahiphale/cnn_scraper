It's the first time Israel has struck the center of the capital since its war with Lebanon in 2006. The latest strike on a multi-storey building in Beirut killed at least six people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.And left the structure blackened and in ruins. A resident of the neighborhood tells CNN, the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority had an office there, and the area is known to be dominated by the group's Shia allies. Well, meantime, the Lebanese Foreign Minister told CNN Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had agreed to a 21-day temporary ceasefire just days before he was killed by an Israeli air strike. Abdallah BouHabib told CNN, a senior White House adviser was then set to go to Lebanon to negotiate the ceasefire. And CNN's Paula Hancock joins us now live from Abu Dhabi. So, Paula, what more are you learning about these latest Israeli strikes on central Beirut?",

This happened just after midnight, local time, and it was in the Bashura neighborhood of central Beirut, very close to downtown, about a kilometer from the parliament there. So, it's certainly an area that we have not seen targeted since the war back in 2006. There was one other strike in the -- at the Kola intersection which was within the city limits of Beirut on Monday.But it really has been mostly focused on the southern suburbs which are Hezbollah stronghold. So, this particular strike was on a building that did have a Hezbollah affiliated authority within it, called the Islamic health authority. We know that that was one of the flaws within that building itself. But it is obviously putting those in central Beirut on even more of an edge, given you've got many hundreds of thousands who are displaced at this point. A million throughout the whole country and they came many from southern Lebanon, believing that central Beirut would be a safer option for them. So, this is certainly of great concern to civilians within Beirut itself. Now, when it comes to the fighting in southern Lebanon, we understand from both Israel and Hezbollah that there has been harsh fighting, close range engagements. We're hearing from the IDF saying that they've destroyed more than 150 Hezbollah sites. Hezbollah itself saying that they have carried out more than two dozen strikes against Israeli soldiers in that area. The Lebanese army say that they believe the Israeli troops have gone into southern Lebanon three times but have withdrawn after that. Israel also suffering its first loss of life from this grand incursion with eight soldiers being killed. Rosemary?",

At that point, the U.S. was pushing Israel to show restraint, which it did, in a very targeted response after Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles against Israel.And there was a real sense that the U.S. was trying to tell Israel and President Biden said it in as many words, you should take the win, the fact that this did not impact Israel in a large way. The fact that it was repelled this attack, that doesn't appear to be the case this time around because the Iranian attack used 200 ballistic missiles, according to Tehran and It was a more significant attack against Israel itself. So, the concern is, of course, about the response that Israel will carry out. We've heard the prime minister saying Iran made a big mistake and they will retaliate. Rosemary?

Israel had built successful momentum in the region, and Iran successfully disrupted the momentum. Israel had building in the days after it successfully assassinated Nasrallah.Currently, Iran is attacking Israel, while Israel is attacking targets in Lebanon, Damascus, Yemen. And Israel will now to attempt -- will attempt, to gain the pre-Iran attack momentum. And I suspect they will keep betting on the escalate -- to deescalate strategy which they have been following in the -- in the previous weeks. The fact we saw eight Israeli soldiers killed in southern Lebanon in the past few days will put extra pressure on Netanyahu to act against Iran by the Israeli general public. I think there are a couple of different options available to Israel at this point. CHURCH: Now, U.S. President Joe Biden has given a hard no to Israel targeting Iran's nuclear sites, but Netanyahu has been ignoring U.S. calls to avoid expanding this war and has made it very clear that he has no intention of accepting that 21-day ceasefire that's still on the table.

I'm really concerned about that possibility. Unfortunately, from kind of my perspective here, I think Israeli is acting in a little bit of a self-defeating manner.Of course, it had every right to respond to the horrific attacks of October 7th. But for example, a recent analysis found that public perceptions of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader that Israel killed a couple of days ago have grown more positive across the Middle East since his death, even among Sunni Muslim communities. So, while Israel may have some tactical wins, you know, they took out Haniyeh, they took out Nasrallah. Strategically, they might be losing the plot if people even, you know, Sunny Muslim communities throughout the Middle East are becoming more sympathetic towards a character like Hassan Nasrallah.",

The Ukrainian military says its troops pulled out to avoid being encircled in a town that's largely reduced to ruins. Vuhledar is a coal mining center with a pre-war population of 14,000 people. But as Fred Pleitgen explains, it has an oversized importance in military terms.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  This video shows soldiers raising the Russian flag on the City Council Building in a key Ukrainian town, Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk region where today the Ukrainian army have announced their withdrawal. It was filmed a few days ago, but only released on October 1st. So why is all of this significant? Well, Vuhledar sits about 30 miles south of Pokrovsk, which is sort of the main area of attack in the east of Ukraine where the Russians have really been pushing over the past couple of months. And the Russians have been trying to take Vuhledar for about two years now and taking significant losses. While it's not a transport or logistics hub, it has been seen as a critical intersection of Ukraine's eastern and southern fronts. There have been videos in the past of whole Russian armored columns destroyed by the Ukrainians. But the fact that the Russians have now been able to take Vuhledar certainly shows that they do appear to have a good degree of momentum on the eastern front. It also calls into question Ukraine's own incursion into the Kursk area in the west of Russia and the Ukrainian say, it also shows how badly they need further Western military aid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
