But they cannot legislate until they elect a new speaker.This historic vote sending this chamber into a state of paralysis, unable to legislate and raising major questions for the Republican Party and the House about what is next. At this meeting at 6:30, we expect Republicans to talk about their plans. Will Kevin McCarthy run for speaker? That is the urgent question at the moment. If he decides to run for speaker again, that could lead to a prolonged race on the House floor. Because at the moment, he does not have the majority vote necessary to become elected speaker. Is there another candidate, a consensus candidate? At the moment, no. This party is badly divided as they broke out all day going back and forth between McCarthy allies and people who sided with Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led this effort to push McCarthy out of the speakership. Now, there were eight Republicans in total who voted to oust McCarthy, along with all Democrats, enough, and that raises the majority to eject McCarthy from the powerful position. One of them I caught up with was Congresswoman Nancy Mace, who said that she voted to kick McCarthy out because she says he broke his promises. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): I made deals with Kevin McCarthy, with the speaker, that he has not kept to help women in this country, and we have done nothing for them. Or as a survivor for rape, and I worked all year on a rape kit bill that hasn't seen the time of day, I cannot tell you how frustrating that is as a woman in this conference, in this Capitol, to have that happen. Like if you make a promise, you should keep it. And if you promise women you're going to help them, then you damn well better do it. So, as a fiscal conservative, I'm angry. As a woman, I am deeply frustrated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we have brought a lot of things back. Institutional Washington does not like that.

And the question is, what will his influence be on choosing the next speaker? Could it be, you know, Kevin McCarthy? We don't know the answer to that. But he's drawn the party along with a few of his comrades into complete and utter chaos for really no particular reason.

And, lastly, I think this question about who's next is fascinating because it's not like we didn't see this coming.

So, in the short-term, without question, it makes the very reasonable things David was mentioning there, saving the country from defaulting on our debt and keeping the government open, funding the troops, et cetera, those are basic functions of governing. And this is something the Republicans can't do here. So, yes, I think it is a good gift for the president. But what I'm struck by, 269 days. That is speaker McCarthy's tenure, the shortest speaker ever in our history. In some respects, though, it's amazing it lasted that long because we all thought every deal kind of along the way, he would lose. So, he went from winter to spring to summer, the beginning of fall, and he's out. What is happening in the meeting now, I was talking to one Republican on the Hill who actually was suggesting something Audie just said, this could go shorter. Because what Matt Gaetz wanted was a scalp. So, they got their scalp. And now, do they want to move a little forward? But there's no consensus or plan B that we know of. But things change in the dynamic of the meeting here. I would be very surprised, though, if Kevin McCarthy would go through -- I mean, I think he's willing to go through anything to be speaker again, if that was an outcome. I do not expect him to emerge successful in that. So, I don't think they'll try that. I would be surprised by that tonight.",

Are you hearing anything from any of your GOP colleagues, people that you talk to, about what the heck they expect to go on in that meeting? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): I'm not, Erin. And I'll tell you, in the moment on the floor, when it was all over, I mean, it was as though a bomb had gone off in the room. Nobody knew what was next. And I've seen a couple of my friends on the other side of the aisle since then in the gym and elsewhere, and they are just bewildered. I mean, I think there's a realization dawning on my Republican colleagues that they may have an unmanageable conference. And if the management does what Speaker McCarthy -- ex-Speaker McCarthy tried to implement, which is to sort of give everything that is asked for to the MAGA extreme, it becomes untenable.

We did it Saturday when almost every single Democrat but one voted to not shut down the government. Only half the Republicans voted for it. We did it a couple of months ago when we prevented a default by voting for McCarthy's deal with the president.But what you heard in the caucus this morning was, hey, look, we will not allow chaos to reign, but, sadly, Speaker McCarthy has brought absolutely no goodwill. Both times that I just mentioned when we waited in, in between, you know, he went after us brutally, blamed us for this and that.

The judge took the bench, he said that the post that Trump made was untrue and he said personal attacks on members of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate, and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

But there are four gentlemen who seem to rise to the top, rise above others in the considerations of this -- Congressman Patrick McHenry from North Carolina, Steve Scalise from Louisiana, Tom Emmer from Minnesota, and Tom Cole from Oklahoma.Let's tick through their credentials quickly if we can here. Representative Patrick McHenry, he has just been named as the interim speaker. But that's not the only reason that he's considered a top candidate for speaker. He is currently House Financial Services Committee chairman, which is enormously important. It deals with issues like international finance, housing, and banking. His profile and influence grew earlier this year when McCarthy tapped him to negotiate with the White House to raise the debt ceiling. He's one of two top candidates who actually voted to certify Joe Biden's win in the 2020 presidential election. Now, let's talk about Steve Scalise from Louisiana, currently the number two position in the House. He is the majority leader. He also has experience as the house Republican whip, that vote-counting and, you know, vote-generating experience really bolsters his credentials for House speaker. He survived a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017. He was recently diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer of blood cells, because of that cancer diagnoses, a lot of questions have emerged over whether Scalise has the energy, the stamina to really function as House Speaker, especially if there's going to be another shutdown, showdown next month. But Scalise says he feels very good and that his long-term prognosis is very good. Congressman Tom Emmer from Minnesota, currently the House majority whip, a very important position, the number three position in the House leadership. He's a key ally of Kevin McCarthy's, but he's also seen as being very close to Congressman Matt Gaetz. He led the national Republican congressional committee in 2020 and 2022. You've also got Tom Cole, the elder statesman who might be considered more of a caretaker for the job of House Speaker because he is 74 years old -- Wolf.",
