New details as well on the two survivors. And also, the investigation as OUTFRONT shows you what happened on the ship in the moments before impact. Plus, Mike Lindell's MyPillow evicted, reportedly tossed out of his warehouse for not paying rent as he's also forced to pay legal bills tied to Trump's election lies. Tonight, he's not the only Trump ally facing a reckoning. Plus, more breaking news this hour, Joe Lieberman dead, at the age of 82, after a fall in New York. The long time senator's last mission before he passed, finding a third party candidate who could unite this country. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, officials revealing they have now recovered the bodies of two men who were on the Francis Scott Key Bridge when it collapsed after being hit by that massive cargo ship the bodies, according to officials, were found in a submerged vehicle. As you can see, there were a number of construction vehicles on the bridge at the moment of that catastrophic collision. We're also learning more tonight about one of the two people who survived that collapse, an executive with Brawner Builders, that's the company whose crew is working on the bridge at the time, tells CNN and one of the survivors is surviving. He's very, very upset noting he does have injuries and I understand he's very stressed out and suffering from straps, going on to say, it's amazing that he did survive and that he swam away. Amazing maybe putting it mildly, especially when you consider the fact that he fell from that bridge, fell perhaps at most 185 feet into the frigid waters of the Patapsco River. The exact cause of the accident is still unknown at this hour. Officials do say the ship's black box is now in the hands of the NTSB, and that really provides some crucial clues as to what happened leading up to the collision. In a moment, we're going to take you inside a simulator for a massive cargo ship to show you firsthand what the ship's pilots may have experienced when they lost power. Pete Muntean is near the bridge collapse, Miguel Marquez was just at that simulator, and Ivan Watson is live in Hong Kong with new details on the owner of the ship's record. First though, let's begin with Pete Muntean, who's OUTFRONT live in Baltimore. Pete, were learning a little bit more about this investigation tonight. What can you tell us?",

Look at the size of this container ship next to Hong Kong's stone cutter bridge. At the time that Francis Scott Key Bridge was constructed in the late '70s, container ships like this simply didn't exist. They were not being built at that size and scale in those days. Just last month, China witness that deadly cargo ship collision with a bridge on the Pearl River in the city of Guangzhou, at least five people died as vehicles plunged off the stretch of collapsed bridge. Authorities initially blamed the crew for the accident. Global supply chains rely on these enormous ships to move goods around the world. The Baltimore bridge disaster may force some to reconsider the size of these ships and the potential damage they can do when things go wrong. (END VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (on camera): Now, the Erica, the U.S. Coast Guard, inspected the Dali in September, didn't find any problems. Meanwhile, Singaporean officials say that all of that ships safety certificates were valid at the time of this deadly accident in Baltimore and that the ship was due to be inspected in Singapore again, in June of this year. I've talked to industry insiders. They say that Singapore generally has a pretty good safety record when it comes to shipping.

The difference is it did not end in a catastrophe. Why?Well, here's one possible reason. It is much smaller. We've talked a great deal about how the Dali is about three football fields in length. We talked about how it carries tens of thousands of tons of cargo enormously huge. That Japanese freighter, which happened back in 1980, was probably about a third of the size of this ship.

Back in the 1977, when the Key Bridge was put into use, the ones wayup at the top there, those were the big ocean going ships. Now, the one at the bottom which can carry many, many, many more tons of weight, they're more powerful, they're harder to maneuver in the sense that they're bigger. All of that has come into play here. What hasn't come into play, according to many engineers, is any real step-up in the protection of these bridges. When that ship hit back in 1980, it was partially stopped by these protective piers that were out there to stop it from hitting the bridge pier directly. Some of these are called dolphin, some of them were called fenders. There are all sorts of different names for them. But the bottom line is many of them were designed according to engineers to stop these smaller ships. They were not designed to stop these monster ships that are out there now. And yet many of them have not been upgraded. So that's why engineers are looking at that old accident and saying, look, is there a lesson here? Did we have a chance to learn this lesson?
