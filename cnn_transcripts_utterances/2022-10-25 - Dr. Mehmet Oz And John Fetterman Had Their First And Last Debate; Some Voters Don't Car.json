He should take more time to allow himself to fully recover. Very pointed statement from a Republican senator.The Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, Casey, Bob Casey wrote, after the debate, Fetterman has a clear record of public service. The empathy of a leader understands the commonwealth. He knows Pennsylvania cares about Pennsylvania. He's going to be a great senator. Like no comment at all about the debate itself.

He had substance behind him, and there was this unifying general election message.I -- I want to be careful because I think some of the most consequential leaders in history have had different kinds of disabilities. I don't think it should preclude someone from serving, but what we saw today was someone who is not ready to be in office. And the lack of transparency leading up to this, I think actually shocked people watching it. Like I found it extremely hard to watch.

Oz obviously came in attempting to portray him as radical. It was very clearly going to be the strategy. Think he knew he was not going to have the nimbleness to be able to respond to those in real time. And so, he was trying to make a sort of blanket effort to, you know, create an issue around honesty and sort of validity of Oz's attacks.
