Tennessee prosecutors are planning to have one trial for all five former members of the Memphis police charged in the January murder of Nichols, who was just 29-years-old. In the federal case, all the defendants have pleaded not guilty to deprivation of civil rights, witness tampering and other offenses. CNN's Nick Valencia has the latest. Nick, what are you learning from this hearing so far?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's really been a team effort. We're seeing a fallout here.Now the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for DHS, which usually keeps its investigations under wraps, but in the gravity of this, it is making this investigation public. As you noted, Brianna, CNN first reported a Coast Guard investigation that substantiated dozens of rapes at the Coast Guard Academy was kept hidden for years. It was dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor. And that's the impetus of this. It found that some of the accused had moved into top roles at the Coast Guard or retired with full pensions and benefits. Victims were even discouraged from pursuing the allegations, according to our reporting. And they still had to go to class and even work with the person who allegedly assaulted them. Some victims ended up dropping out of the academy. But the assault and investigation was never reported to Congress or made public until CNN started asking questions. Now you have the Senate looking for answers. In a letter sent to the head of the Coast Guard, Senator Richard Blumenthal cited CNN's reporting. And said the leaders who oversaw or, perhaps, created the environment where misconduct occurred and did nothing much be held accountable and the public deserves to know why many reported cases of sexual assault and harassment were allowed to go uninvestigated for so many years. Senator Blumenthal told us this was the most shameful incident of cover-up of sexual assault he has ever seen in the military. Now this letter is asking for a slew of documents from the Coast Guard, including any information on every sexual assault at the academy from 2006 to present.",

The Biden administration is imposing new sanctions on more than two dozen Iranian individuals and entity, all tied to the violent crackdown on protesters following the death of Mahsa Amini. Her death one year ago while in the custody of Iran's Morality Police sparked one of the largest protest movements the country has seen in in years. Hundreds of those protesters were killed in the unrest. Also, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is warning the country not to shy away from uncomfortable facts about the history of racism. Her comments came during a speech at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, earlier today. That church is widely known and is commemorating 60 years since white supremacists carried out a bombing there that killed four young black girls and injured dozens more. And the extreme drought conditions causing massive traffic jams in the Panama Canal may extend into next year. That's according to the canal's administrator, who also said some ships are waiting as long as 14 days to get through.

      "sentences": "One of the most profound questions that humankind has always struggled with is, what goes through our minds in the moments before we die? A new study has a fascinating look at what people encounter in a near-death experience.In fact, one person told researchers, quote, \"I thought I heard my grandma, who has passed, saying you need to go back.\" Another explained that they went directly to a place of light. It was calm and immediate. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here with more about these findings. Sanjay, this is really fascinating research. What did researchers say they found, and how did they even go about conducting this study? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It really is an interesting story and an interesting study. It's fascinating. We have to be careful not to draw too many conclusions from this, because it is early research. But I agree, Boris, these near-death experiences, what exactly is happening in the brain, can you measure that somehow? Two quick points. I think one of the questions they were trying to answer is, are there these hidden reservoirs of consciousness that might exist in the brain? And during the dying process, when someone is in cardiac arrest or no longer getting enough blood flow to the brain, does something happen to the brain? Does it become disinhibited in some ways, which allows people to have some of the experiences you just mentioned or to have that flash of their whole life in front of their eyes as they go through the dying process? Perhaps. But they wanted to figure this out by going into rooms where people were actually in cardiac arrest, a difficult study to perform as you might imagine. There was some 567 people that they were able to go into those rooms, put the electrodes on the scalp and measure brain activity during that process. The people, 53, so about 10 percent roughly survived the cardiac arrest. And 11 said that they had recollection of what was happening during CPR of chest compressions and things like that. And six people had these near-death experiences like you mentioned. What was fascinating, Boris -- again, you don't expect there to be any electrical activity when blood flow has stopped to the brain. What they found is they were getting these electrical activities, alpha waves, beta waves, delta waves, all these different types of activity, up to an hour after the cardiac arrest.",
