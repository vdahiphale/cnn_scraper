Prosecutors have said the details of Michael Cohen's story have been backed up by other witnesses and evidence. The defense called Cohen the MVP of liars and told the jury they cannot convict based on his words alone. Jessica Schneider is in Washington, DC. And Jessica, it strikes me that this is really a case that's presented by the defense and the prosecution as to who do you believe, right? I mean, the prosecution is making the case right now, you don't have to just believe Michael Cohen in this, there are other facts. There are other testimony, there is other evidence. The defense on the other hand, is saying lot of holes in his credibility, and if you don't believe him, you can't believe anything.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right.The defense really did focus in on Michael Cohen and destroying his credibility, telling the jurors that there was reasonable doubt because of that, what the prosecution has been doing in the  afternoon here is they reminding jurors about all of the evidence that they've laid out in this case, not just Michael Cohen's testimony. And what they have been doing over the past few minutes as they've been going back chronologically to detail the various hush money schemes, in particular that the \"National Enquirer\" and Donald Trump were directly involved in and that is one of the prosecution's attempt to really bolster their case his with evidence of a pattern from trump that he was involved in these payoffs to different people during the election. Ultimately, the prosecution said, at the beginning of their summation today, they say that this case is about the conspiracy and the cover-up. They say they conspiracy was that attempt to influence the 2016 election through these cover-ups, this hush money deal and everything like that. And the prosecution is reminding jurors that this included the Stormy Daniels' payment, and then that was the conspiracy, the cover-up being the falsification of the business records, meaning the falsification of what was documentation of those repayments to Michael Cohen. And what is crucial here is that the prosecution needs to approve both in order to have these criminal charges count as felonies, because falsification of business records on their own is just a misdemeanor. Now, Jim, I mean, the prosecution, they admitted early on in their summation that Michael Cohen is not the perfect witness. But as you said, they've also reminded the jury that there is a stack of evidence that backs up Cohen's claims that Trump knew about this cover-up. So we still have about at least two hours to go in the prosecution's summation. It is unclear at this point if this will wrap up tonight. It could potentially bleed over until tomorrow morning, but tomorrow we are expecting that the jury will hear their jury instructions from the judge, basically how to apply the law to all of the facts they've heard. And then it looks like deliberations probably could begin at some point tomorrow. So we are looking to see how much longer this summation goes and then how things move forward from there -- Jim.",

They left their most problematic witnesses for last, and I would lump Stormy Daniels intothat category as well because these are people who have been  -- sort of they are uncontrollable witnesses. They're out there on podcasts and writing books. Michael Cohen wrote a book called \"Revenge.\" So this is a problematic witness for the DA's Office, but what they did is they laid out a trail of breadcrumbs leading to Michael Cohen's so that when Michael Cohen testifies and gets cross-examined on it, they can point to the jury all the ways in which his testimony is corroborated by all of these other witnesses. And they started with David Pecker, who laid out this conspiracy between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, the \"National Enquirer\" to promote the election by unlawful means, the hush money payments, Stormy Daniels' lawyer Keith Davidson added to that -- all of the witnesses, including Michael Cohen's banker, who talked about how Michael Cohen called in a frenzy after the Access Hollywood tape came out in a frenzy to start this shell company to get this money funneled through to Stormy Daniels, all of that led up to Michael Cohen's testimony. So that in closing, they will be able to do exactly what they are doing right now, which is saying you don't need to believe Michael Cohen to convict Mr. Trump. If you believe Michael Cohen, if you credit what he said, it is a slam dunk and you have to convict. But even if you don't believe him, look at the ways in which all of these other pieces of evidence support what he is saying. Both sides agree that he is a liar, but the prosecution is going to make the point. He was telling the truth about the core part of this case.",

They don't have to close. They don't have to call a single witness and that is their constitutional right. But having chosen not to take the stand, the question is, what did the defense accomplished during this trial? They did a reasonable job of trying to poke some holes in the case, but they never really offered an adequate alternative explanation than what the prosecution laid out. The prosecution laid out a very simple story, which starts with Donald Trump having an extramarital affair and the story about to come out right before the election, him trying to quash the story from coming out by sending secret payments pursuant to an NDA that was secretly signed with fake names, and then covering it up on the books and records of the Trump Organization. Now the defense doesn't need to do anything to do that, but they're trying to poke holes in that and say, well, Mr. Trump did not know about the falsification. Mr. Trump didn't know about that. What they have really tried to argue here is that the sexual affair never happened and that these payments to Michael Cohen were actually for legitimate legal expenses. That is their defense, and I don't know that they've provided enough to give the jury to hang their hats on that.",

Does that match what we are seeing on the ground, particularly if you compare it to the activities that we've seen over the last six months? Okay, I think we are having some difficulties getting hold of him there. When we do get to him, we will get him and we will get back to him when we can. For now, the effort to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza has been dealt another setback. The temporary pier constructed by the US military broke apart on Sunday in heavy seas. These are before and after satellite images and you can see there showing the damage. The pier, which costs $320 million to build, and only been operating for a matter of days. Officials say it will be reassembled and reconnected to the parking area when sea conditions allow it. For more on this, let's get to Natasha Bertrand in Washington. Natasha, this is an embarrassment. We know the seas are incredibly choppy in this area and that this was likely to face this kind of structural challenge.

This floating pier which has been operational for really about less than two weeks is already out of commission because heavy sea states damaged part of that pier and forced the US military to take it back to the Port of Ashdod where it is going to undergo repairs by US Central Command. Essentially, what happened was that the parking lot portion of that causeway, which is attached to the shore in Gaza broke off and it became detached from the rest of the causeway. And so now they have to take the entire structure and they you have to move it back to Israel where it is going to undergo these repairs for at least the next week according to the Pentagon. And this comes just days after heavy sea states also impacted a number of US army vessels that were helping to transport part of that floating pier back to Ashdod, again because of heavy sea states and they actually got disconnected from the rest of that pier system and ended up beached near Ashkelon in Israel and near the beach in Gaza. Two of those boats, which were beached near Gaza, they actually had to have the US soldiers that are on them stay on the boats because of President Biden's pledge that no US soldiers would actually be on the ground in Gaza. And so they have been there for the last several days. This pier, which was -- this causeway which was attached to the shore in Gaza is now being moved back. And this all comes as the US military really has had a slow start in getting that aid operationally moving across that causeway and into Gaza. Originally, they had predicted that roughly 90 trucks per day would be able to get into Gaza, but now, of course we are seeing that really only a fraction of that was able to get over that pier before it all kind of came apart. And so now, we are going to have to wait and see just how long it takes to repair this very expensive operation, which was already costing the US government around $320 million. But the US officials that we speak to insist that it still has been somewhat of a success because they managed in that short amount of time that it was actually working to get over thousand tons of aid to the people of Gaza. So saying it has not been a complete failure there -- Julia.",

We are not witnessing the same level of destruction and of casualties from that ground offensive as we did in previous iterations of it elsewhere in the Gaza Strip. It appears that the Israeli military is kind of been circling certain areas, clearing those areas of militants and then moving on to the next part of it, a much more deliberate strategy than what they've been carrying out previously. That doesn't mean of course that this military operation is proceeding without casualties and certainly not without civilian casualties. As we've been watching beyond the ground offensive, there have been these strikes, like the one Sunday night killing 45 Palestinians according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, wounding hundreds of others. And the Israeli military isn't even as they are investigating that strike and they have kind of entered this damage control mode amid the international condemnation of it, they're not necessarily changing their strategy elsewhere in Gaza on the ground and that is as it relates to other airstrikes. Late last night following about a hundred and fifty meters away from that Sunday night strike, the Israeli military carried out yet another airstrike it appears on the Tel al-Sultan camp very close to that location of that Sunday night strike killing eight people and then they also carried out a strike in the Al-Mawasi area, which most of that area has indeed been designated as a humanitarian safe zone for the population there. And that strike killing 21 people, including 13 women, and so it is very clear that the Israeli military is not going to slow down, it appears in the kinds of operations and the strikes that it is carrying out in the Gaza Strip, even as it faces that growing international condemnation and isolation, and even as it takes this fairly rare step of actually carrying out an investigation into one of its strikes this week.",

And I want you to look at the three swing states on your screen right now, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Joe Biden probably needs to win all three of those states if he wants to get reelected. And look at how close the margins are there. Michigan is a tie, Wisconsin in the average poll has Trump by a point, Pennsylvania, Trump by two points. These are incredibly tight races. We're still months and months to go until the election. The polls right now are significantly closer than they were four years ago when, of course, in all three of those states, the margin was three points or less. In Wisconsin it was less than a point, and Pennsylvania was a little bit more than a percentage point. So this idea that got floated today by \"Politico,\" that Democrats are all of a sudden, oh, my god, we're so worried about this election. Well, they should be worried because Donald Trump may be slightly ahead. But the idea that Joe Biden can't come back or can't win this thing is frankly lunacy. There's no support for that in the numbers. Joe Biden is very much in this contest, whether you look nationally or in the battleground states, because if he wins those three, he likely wins reelection.

The swing voters are really paying closer attention to the economy. I think the key question, though, is, you know, we talk about the broader public. What's really important here is, are there any Trump voters who are going to change their minds if Trump is found guilty, and a Quinnipiac University poll that was taken earlier this month found, get this, just 6 percent of Trump voters say they are less likely to back him if he's found guilty. Now, if that 6 percent actually held, that could be significant. I'm guessing, though, that that's probably even overstating the case. We have not seen any degradation in Trump's support in the polls even over the last month as this trial has taken place. We have not seen any degradation in support once he got -- once those four cases he was charged in. So I'm just not seeing that these cases and especially this New York City hush money case, where well less than a majority of folks believed that the charges are very serious, have had any impact.

And she's committed it in a lot of fascinating ways to advocacy organizations focusing very much on reproductive rights in the United States, and really disappointed that this nation has been stepping back in so many ways from helping women. But she's still maintaining her interest in women all around the world. So it's just a mix of a lot of dollars. And in the world of philanthropy, very little is given to help women. And she makes a point of saying that far too little has been given in the past and she wants to make a difference and I'm sure she will encourage other people to give more to women as well.

She gave money to a bunch of leaders and said I'm giving you 20 million for you to decide where it should go.

There's also a snobbery, I think, at certain times about the type of philanthropy that you choose.

It will be led by CEO Sam Altman and the chairman of the board, Bret Taylor. You might remember there was an attempted ouster of Sam Altman last November over safety concerns. Flash forward to this month on May 14th, Ilya Sutskever, who was in charge of safeguarding AI development, announced he was leaving. Three days later, another executive in charge of safety followed suit. Clare Duffy is in New York for this. The skeptic in me, Clare, is going, hang on a second, so we've got a clearly non-independent board now, as the new board in charge of safety at the company.",

And some of those employees specifically calling out the company and calling out Altman for prioritizing the commercialization of AI products over safety and security concerns and so OpenAI does seem to be trying to sort of get back at some of those criticisms. This new committee will make recommendations to the board about safety and security. It will be led, as you said, by CEO Sam Altman, members of the board. It will also include some employees at the company who are focused on safety and policy issues, including its head of security and its new chief scientist. But you do have to wonder just how effective it will be to have a safety committee that's entirely made up of internal people and led by the CEO, whose job it is also to develop and scale this technology. There is a really long history of ineffective self-regulation within tech. And this also comes just two days after two former OpenAI board members who are ousted as part of that leadership shakeup in November wrote an op-ed saying that they don't believe that AI companies should be able to self- regulate. So serious questions that this safety committee I think is going to have to answer in the coming months. The next thing we'll be watching out for is this new report that they will be releasing in the next 90 days. They're going to be reviewing the company's existing safety and security practices. And so we'll have to keep an eye out for that and see what they find, and just sort of how transparent this committee is going to be, Julia.",

And so it's interesting that, you know, he's in this position where he's making such crucial decisions about all of our futures.
