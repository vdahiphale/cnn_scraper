It was -- their main thing was to prevent crime from occurring, from going into these neighborhoods in Memphis, which have saw a spike in crime. And that was their goal, attack where this crime was occurring.And so it was a plain clothes, for the most part, unit. They drove around in unmarked cars. The Scorpion Unit is what -- the name that was given to them by the police department. And their focus, as you see there on our screen, was about robberies and homicides. And so, over the weekend, after calls from community leaders and Tyre Nichols' family to disband this unit, the police chief went ahead and announce that on Saturday. And so now it is no longer. They have to figure out, you know, what other measures they can take now there at the police department to help fight some of the crime because Memphis is one of these neighborhoods, one of these areas in this country where there is this huge spike of crime targeting, you know, every day lives of people, car theft and burglaries. So, this is something that the Memphis Police Department is certainly going to have to deal with. And also, you know, it's likely that the Department of Justice at some point, based on some of the complaints we're hearing from community members about this unit, that they're going to have to come in and take a look at what the Memphis Police Department has been doing and what's called a pattern and practice kind of look at what this police department and this unit specifically was doing.

And then you had Congressman Jim Jordan, on the other hand, was saying, look, this wouldn't have changed anything for Tyre Nichols.

My research documents that the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act would have huge implications for transforming policing in the United States. We have to keep in mind a couple of statistics that have implications for Tyre Nichols.First, research documents that every one out of 1,000 black males can expect to die to police violence and black people are 3.5 times more likely than whites to be killed by police when they are unarmed and not attacking. That is Tyre Nichols' story. And as we look at the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, Republicans and Democrats were not all that far apart. Qualified immunity was the big thing as it relates to (INAUDIBLE) bias, as it relates to certification. That is something that should be happening across the country. Also, when it comes to data. There is an implication that these Scorpion Units, or the Red Dog Unit that Chief Davis ran in Atlanta, some kind of way really helped. Well, when we look at crime data across time, and I know Memphis well. I'm a native Tennessean. I attended the University of Memphis. When you look over time it's question whether or not those units actually have that impact. But what we do know is that they often terrorize and brutalize communities that look like me.",

For Chief Davis to use the words heinous, reckless and inhumane, that is certainly what I saw. And so I think she absolutely did the right thing in terms of holding those officers accountable.

Having an investigation, firing the officers, showing the family the video, preparing for some protests and showing that to the public, charging those officers criminally. I think a lot of people expect for more things to come.As we think about moving forward, I think we simply have to look at the road to Nashville, where they have a community oversight board where civilians have votes on the police misconduct board. That creates transparency, equity and accountability. Memphis should follow suit. The other part is dealing with data. We should have data to actually be able to track not only some of these criminalist outcomes when it comes to arrests or when it comes to getting drugs and all these things off the street. Police officers do amazing things every single day. But because our data for police are set up in a deficit manner, we never get those positive outcomes. Those are things that could actually change. And then, as I mentioned before, that certification process is prime. And the big thing, and here we go, eventually there is going to be a large civil settlement paid out to Tyre Nichols' family. And as person from Tennessee, who has lived in Memphis, Memphis does not have money like that to be paying out this huge settlement, but it will. We need to think about restructuring that, where it comes from police department insurance policies. That is the real accountability.",

I think that most police chiefs and certainly Chief Davis has been working on culture change and making sure that the Memphis PD, which, by the way, overwhelmingly has great men and women dedicated each day and night for the citizens of Memphis, but culture in any organization is very difficult to change and you have to continue to stay at it and sustain it, but also legislation.You know, Chief Davis was able to fire those officers under her employment tools immediately. There are many municipalities around the country, Jim, that that makes it very difficult, the legal laws on constraints make it very difficult for chiefs to, when they see egregious, obvious acts of clear misconduct, it makes it very difficult. So, legislative changes are very important. We know that police unions have a role in part of that culture change as well. And so I think it's got to be a two-tiered approach, Jim.",

I think Nate Cohn (ph) pointed out well this morning, this was certainly not a rallying cry for Republicans in the midterms, right? They were focused more on perceived cultural issues.
