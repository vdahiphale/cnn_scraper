And weeks-long battle to raise the governments the federal government's debt ceiling is now over. An hour ago, the Senate narrowly voted in favor of a compromise deal and avoided an unprecedented default by the U.S. government and an economic meltdown that would have been felt around the world. The bill had cleared the lower House a day earlier and was narrowly passed by the Senate, 63 to 36. The U.S. government is just days now from running out of money. Once the president signs this bill into law, the treasury can resume borrowing money to meet its many obligations until 2025. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Democrats are feeling very good tonight. We've saved the country from the scourge of default, even though there are some on the other side who wanted default, who wanted to lead us to default. We may be a little tired, but we did it. So we're very happy. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, \"Thanks to House Republicans' efforts, the Fiscal Responsibility Act avoids the catastrophic consequences of default and begins to curb Washington Democrats' addiction to reckless spending that grows our nation's debt.\" President Joe Biden called the deal a big win for the U.S. economy and its people, and he's set to deliver his first ever Oval Office address on avoiding default on Friday night.

      "sentences": "Prices are still rising in the Eurozone but month on month, they are heading in the right direction, with a fall in inflation across a broad range of categories.Food inflation dropped by one percentage point in May, compared to April, although it remains high at 12 and a half percent. And at this early stage, it's unlikely households and consumers across the bloc are feeling much benefit from this improvement. While the glimmer of good news caused some economists to question whether the European Central Bank might ease up on its rate hikes, the general consensus is there be a rate rise this month, and another to come this year. Not least after ECB President Christine Lagarde spoke about the bank's determination to bring inflation down to 2 percent in a speech in Hanover Thursday, adding, \"We've made clear that we still have ground to cover to bring interest rates to sufficiently restrictive levels.\" One of the headwinds for the ECB is wage growth in the Eurozone. Unsurprisingly, given just how costly life has become, thanks to inflation, workers have demanded higher wages. Wage growth in the eurozone was 5.1 percent year on year in the last quarter of 2022. Now, that is not enough to offset the cost of living, but it does contribute to inflation. So the ECB will be watching that indicator as well as CPI before considering a new phase for interest rates.

More details in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [00:30:23] VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone, I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. In the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Thursday morning, the air-raid sirens warned of yet another round of incoming Russian missiles, many headed for safety, what's become an almost nightly routine for millions of residents. But for one little girl, just 9 years old, her mother, another woman, when they reached what they thought was safety, there was nowhere left to run. All three were left stranded in the open, because the doors to the basement of the local health center were locked. And as debris from the intercepted missiles came crashing down, all three were killed. A moment of tragedy amid an already tragic war, a moment which seems impossible to imagine. And so it was for the grandfather of the little girl. For hours, he sat on the ground next to the dead bodies. At one point, someone gave him a chair, and there he set, hour after hour, trying to make sense of the senseless. Ukrainian officials have now launched an investigation, and the Ukrainian president has made his feelings known about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZELENSKYY (through translator): People will answer for the fact there were those who couldn't get into the bomb shelter and, unfortunately, died. As if it wasn't enough to have Russia as an enemy, we also have internal ones. There's a word I want to say, but there are many journalists here. It's on the tip of my tongue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One of Mount Everest's deadliest climbing seasons in years is now over. Twelve people have died, trying to reach the summit of the world's tallest mountain in the spring. Five are still missing, but one Malaysian climber is not on either list, thanks to a Nepalese sherpa guide who found him clinging to a rope. CNN's Isa Soares picks up the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the ominously named death zone of Mount Everest, during one of the deadliest climbing seasons on record. Nepali guide Gelje Sherpa carried out a rare and almost impossible rescue mission. It was midnight when he saw a Malaysian climber clinging to a rope, shivering in freezing temperatures. Just over 1,100 feet away from the 29,000-feet high summit. The air too thin for humans to breathe and for helicopters to land. GELJE SHERPA, EVEREST GUIDE (through translator): It was important for us to rescue him even from the summit. Money can be earned any time. Left like that, he could have died. We have saved his life by quitting the summit. SOARES (voice-over): Gelje convinced his client to abandon the summit climb attempt so they could save the Malaysian climber's life. Gelje wrapped the distressed climber in a sleeping mat and hold him down with another guide's help. GELJE (through translator): We had brought him down from Camp Four, carrying him on our backs, because dragging was impossible. It took me 5 to 6 hours to get from 8,500 meters to 7,900. It was very difficult. SOARES (voice-over): From there, a helicopter lifted the climber down to base camp. The favorable spring weather is gradually turning even more unpredictable due to climate change. Eleven people died on Everest in 2019, a climbing season that saw unprecedented traffic and long delays in the same death zone near the summit. This season, Nepal issued a record 478 climbing permits. So far, 12 people, including an American, have died, the highest number for eight years, and another 5 are missing. The unidentified climber was put on a flight back to Malaysia last week. Thanks to Gelje, his name was kept off the list of the mountain's victims. Isa Soares, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
