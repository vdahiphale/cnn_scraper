And then it is the start for him formally of the journey toward trial and a point in time where he's going to have to make his own decisions as a criminal defendant with his lawyer, whether he -- his interests will align with Donald Trump or not.Now up to this point, let's remember who he is. He's not just Donald Trump's valet, his body man, his co-defendant. He's also a person who travels with Trump, very consistently. He's on the political team. He even left with Trump for a political stop after their arraignment two weeks ago. And so there is this situation where he's being charged not just because of who he is and what he did, but what he did at Donald Trump's direction allegedly moving those boxes. He's not charged with the retention of the 31 documents that Donald Trump is accused of having knowingly after his presidency. But he is accused of obstruction and false statements trying to conceal those records from the Justice Department. Sara, those are hefty charges on their own, even decoupled from the retention counts. And so this man will be coming into court today. We expect it to be a little bit of a shorter proceeding in court so that he can enter that not guilty plea. But this is his own defendant.

It will put the juror right into the room as you're listening to that. Don't you feel like you're right in there, you can understand exactly what's going on. They were made by Donald Trump's team. So there can't be any accusation of a foul play or any motion to sort of suppress the evidence, as we would say legally.And finally, these tapes go to the heart of Donald Trump's intent and knowledge.

But in addition to that, you're going to have likely several witnesses who will take the stand and be asked questions like, is this what you heard in the room? They'll hear the tape. They'll agree. Then they'll say, what was he holding in his hand? Did you see what was what he was referring to when you hear that noise that the paper makes?Did you see any markings on that document? Did the markings look like these classification markings?

One, as Andy said, you can reconstruct it as best you can, using the context of that tape, the rustling that you see here, look, here, it sounds at times as if he's reading off that. He says confidential. It's mark confidential. It's mark secret. Those are security classifications.The other thing is, you can reconstruct through the witnesses, as Andy said, what did you see? And the key thing is, even if there's no document, you argue that it goes to what he knew. It goes to his state of mind. And it shows you what his whole plan was here. Why is he keeping these documents? He's not selling them to foreign entities. We don't have any evidence that but he's keeping them. He's using them.

And the Trump lawyers apparently responded that they don't have it. But that may have been an effort just to get the document in a form that the Trump team voluntarily turned over.

Here is what we do know about this larger than life figure though, who created and led the Wagner group for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin was once a very close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. They're both from St. Petersburg, Russia and have known each other since the 1990s.When Prigozhin ran a successful restaurant business, big catering contracts with the Kremlin, with probably the help of Vladimir Putin, earned him the eventual nickname of Putin chef, leading Prigozhin to join the ranks of the country's wealthy oligarchs. Prigozhin then went on to found the Wagner group in 2014, a private mercenary group known for its brutal tactics, operating outside Russia's military structure yet fully in support of Russia's interests around the world. CNN has tracked Wagner mercenaries in so many places, the Central African Republic, in Sudan, in Libya, in Mozambique, in Syria, definitely, and also now, of course, in Ukraine, that critical relationship. So a big shift, though, in just the last few months when Prigozhin began openly criticizing Russia's military leaders on their war effort in Ukraine, those critiques turned into a full blown rebellion that we saw on full display this weekend as Prigozhin led what is now the greatest challenge to Putin his grip on power in 23 years.

Joining us now to discuss CNN national security analyst and former CIA chief of Russia operations, Steve Hall, and CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger. I have so many questions, but I will try to control myself. I'm going to start with you, Steve. Putin has just spoken and he's used the word civil war, saying that his troops helped avoid a civil war. What do you make of his latest statements? We've never heard him say that. STEVE HALL, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYSTSo it gets going back and forth, and back and forth. That's one indicator. The other indicator, of course is, you know, where is Prigozhin? Nobody knows exactly where Prigozhin is. And then of course, you've got all the stuff that we've seen before, you know, Putin, standing in front of the guys with the big hats. This is this is not something that he typically has to do this sort of press repair work, a PR work. This is not something that dictators normally do, they can normally just repress. So the fact that he feels that he's got to do all this stuff is I think, an indicator that he himself is concerned about his situation.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And this is risky territory that you saw President Biden try to navigate carefully, yesterday in what was his first and fairly sparse comments about the chaos that we've seen unfold. You know, his first message was, we had nothing to do with it. But that's different from saying we didn't know it was coming. And our reporting and \"The Times\" and CNN is reporting have indicated that in fact, they did have at least a few days notice that this was likely to unfold.The administration made a decision not to go intervene on either side. And frankly, I don't see, Sara, they had any other choice. I mean, Prigozhin is a sanctioned, brutal killer. In fact, they've had to delay more sanctions on him in recent days. Putin obviously is not only sanctioned, but is running a war that the United States and the NATO allies are trying to go undo with the other end by supporting the Ukrainians. So there was no percentage in Biden getting involved in this. However, I'm sure they're going to try to exploit it. You've already seen Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, go on the air saying, look, this was entirely Putin's own doing, right? Had he not invaded Ukraine, he wouldn't be in this situation. And in fact, he's right. I mean, this is the first challenge, as Steve said, that we've seen in 23 years, and it would not be occurring, had President Putin not entered into a war that his own troops couldn't execute on. SIDNER: He brought it on himself, Putin, because he went into Ukraine unprovoked. Steve, I want to ask you about Prigozhin. He has said and claimed, look, this was not a rebellion. This was a march of justice. But he took out three, you know, two helicopters and a plane, Russian military equipment. And now you're hearing that they're not going to charge him? Is that even close to a possibility? I mean, they might kill him instead?",

So there's no rule of law unless you are in Russia, Putin is going to do whatever it is that Putin wants to do. The interesting fact of courses is that we still don't know where Yevgeny Prigozhin is. And there's a theory to that, that it might actually benefit Putin, to have some uncertainty about that. Is he alive? Is he dead? Is he both alive and dead? Nobody knows. It depends on who knows what the actual inner workings of that are. So Putin's inner circle, how many of those guys actually know where Putin is?Does Putin know? But he might be trying to use that to his, you know, tactical advantage inside of the Kremlin because that's what he's got to do at this point to stay in the job.",
