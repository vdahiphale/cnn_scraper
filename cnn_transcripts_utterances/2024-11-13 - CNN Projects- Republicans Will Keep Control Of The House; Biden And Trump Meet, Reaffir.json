CNN is now projecting the House of Representatives will remain in Republican control after the GOP won two House seats in California and Arizona. The races were called just moments ago, and it come as Donald Trump makes his triumphant return to Washington. President Biden hosting President-elect Trump in the Oval Office earlier, the White House saying that Trump brought a detailed set of questions to that meeting. They described the talks is very cordial, very gracious and substantive. Trump also visited with House Republicans today, where he backed Speaker Mike Johnson bid to retain his leadership position. A secret ballot vote in that race is expected at any moment.Now, Trump did not weigh in on who he wanted for Senate leadership, but their Republican senators elected South Dakota's John Thune to replace Mitch McConnell as their new leader, Thune, declaring that they have a mandate to pursue Trump's agenda. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. Manu, a lot happening. Start with the Senate leadership race.",

He's the incoming Senate Majority Leader after this race that had been going on for roughly nine months or so happening behind the scenes in the aftermath of Mitch McConnell stepping aside the longest serving Senate leader of any party in history, dominating his Republican conference for 18 years, but stepping aside and leaving - paving the way for John Thune, who edged out John Cornyn, another rival in the Republican conference, by a vote of 29 to 24 Rick Scott, who was favored by some folks on the - in the MAGA wing of the party. Scott did not make it to a second ballot of voting.So now John Thune has to implement Donald Trump's agenda. He and Donald Trump just spoke on the phone and Thune has promised to be in line with Trump, even though he has sparred with Trump over the years and criticized his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and also endorsed Tim Scott for the presidency. But now Thune says that things will be on the same page, including over Donald Trump's call to push through his nominees. Trump had called for using recess appointments, essentially bypassing the Senate confirmation process and putting his appointments in during extended Senate recesses. Thune was asked about that at a press conference earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): We will do everything we can to process his noms quickly, get them installed in their position so they can begin to implement his agenda. We expect a level of cooperation from the Democrats to work with us to get these folks installed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It was, although some of it we got to hear a little bit of Donald when he - Donald Trump addressed the group, and then they went behind closed doors. Look, one of the things that's really interesting is what Manu was just talking about how House Republicans have this razor thin majority. Donald Trump brought that up. He was, you know, really taking a victory lap with this visit on meeting with the House Republican Caucus today. And he said he was like, Look, I won really big in all of these states. It's crazy that you guys have a slim margin kind of making fun of them.But I think the point really of that entire meeting and from my conversations with those who were involved with the planning on this is that Donald Trump wanted to go and claim what she did that he had won the popular vote. I know there's still millions of votes being counted, but he claimed that he has a mandate and that the popular vote would give him a mandate and that really he wants all of Washington, particularly Republicans, to line up behind him and really to hit the ground running on his agenda, particularly once he takes office in January. Now, I want to read for you some of what we know he said behind closed doors. First of all, I think Manu mentioned this, but he did show his support for Mike Johnson. A source in the room had told us that he basically said he was with Johnson all the way. He did not weigh in on the Senate Republican meeting, but he did give Johnson that backing. But this was interesting as well. A source in the room told our own Dana Bash that he was joking that he couldn't get rid of Elon Musk, saying that Musk loves Mar-a-Lago. The reason I bring this up is because, one, we know that Musk has had an immense amount of influence on Donald Trump, particularly in the weeks leading up to the election in the days after. And he actually traveled with the President-elect this morning. He rode with him on his plane from Palm Beach. He attended that meeting. He was sitting front row watching Donald Trump give his remarks. And so I think that's just another sign of how really powerful Elon Musk is. And I can tell you as well, I know from my conversations with people working for lawmakers, but also those close to Trump that Elon Musk has been calling up lawmakers, and they have been calling up him trying to jockey and really to boost their profiles in Donald Trump's eyes. And so I thought it was fascinating that he joined him today.",

That carries a lot of weight, and it ought to. Now, he's going to need a lot of help around him. Obviously, a great leader surrounds himself with even greater people, and that's what I would advise him to do. But no, I think we can get - I think Pete can get at least the 53 Republicans to vote for him and maybe some more.

And by the way, the only thing she had to do to earn that was get more votes than her opponent. It's kind of a funny system that we have here.But having said all of that, I think once again, Tulsi is a - is an illustration of peace through strength with an understanding of populist view, a mega view, if you will, that I think is what the American people elected. She's very articulate. She knows who the enemy is. I have full faith in her, and I think most of my colleagues in the United States Senate will. And frankly, I think when you take Tulsi and Pete and Mike Waltz as the National Security advisor, you're seeing the picture. This is the president who wants to deter the enemy not simply by better weapon systems, but by attitude and by reputation. Kristi Noem, frankly, for DHS, similarly, you might argue about particular experiences or, you know, credentials, if you will. But at the end of the day, they're all strong leaders who I think represent that that peace through strength attitude, not just the weapon system.

She served in the House for a number of years as a Democrat from Hawaii. Earlier this year, she transferred parties. She joined the Republican Party. She has been out there slamming Democrats, saying that they are pro-censorship, they're anti-freedom and also essentially campaigning for Donald Trump.Now, it's not that surprising that she got a position in the administration. We know that she had been helping behind the scenes with the transition in terms of intelligence, helping with personnel, helping with policy. But again, we expect this to be a very controversial pick. And the other thing to point out, and one of the things I reported yesterday is that Donald Trump is doing a lot of his picking based on how people present on television. Tulsi Gabbard, she has been a fill in anchor on Fox. She also has been on the airwaves for months talking about Donald Trump's talking points, trying to articulate his message. He is a - she is a known entity when it comes to articulating that message on television. It just goes to show you with the announcement of the secretary of defense yesterday, who is also a television personality that this is something Donald Trump is weighing heavily. And just quickly, I want to read part of the statement that Donald Trump put out. He said, \"Over the past two decades, Tulsi has fought for our country and for the freedoms of all Americans as a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination,\" which I didn't mention. She did run for president in 2020. \"She has broad support in both parties. She is now a proud Republican. I know Tulsi will bring fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength.\" She maybe will have some people on both sides of the aisle, which is also going to have a lot of detractors, Brianna.",

But this is a way of Donald Trump giving him oversight into something.Now, the big question, of course, is how much power is Elon Musk actually going to have in this position? Just one other thing, it seems very hard to imagine Vivek Ramaswamy getting confirmed for any administration post, which is likely why he also got slated into this section. Can't say he wouldn't, obviously, Republicans have control of both the Senate and the House. But this is an opportunity to give them some power in Washington, some say in Washington.

He has talked a lot about how he sees his predecessor and now the incoming president as being a threat to democracy. And as for just the scene here at the White House, you know, this was a day when a lot of the staff and the aides working here were really still reeling from the Election Day results from last week.
