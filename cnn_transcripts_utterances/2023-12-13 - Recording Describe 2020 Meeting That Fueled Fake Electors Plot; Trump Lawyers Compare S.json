Talking about his record while he was in Congress and ethanol. He thinks this is a winning talking point for him. Really the larger point here is that we're hearing from Donald Trump's team that there is this renewed sense of confidence here in the first caucus state, particularly because of that Des Moines register poll that hadn't met 51 percent and Ron DeSantis at 19 percent. Something you and I have talked about is that on the ground here in Iowa GOP operatives have long said, and this is people who support Trump or DeSantis, both, that they believe that while the polls were correct that they thought the margin was smaller.[17:25:11] But given this most recent polling, they don't think it's possible for DeSantis to catch up. And that is something that I'm hearing from the Trump team they are really capitalizing on. Now, just -- despite that, we are seeing Donald Trump ramping up his campaign. This is the beginning of a number of stops. He will be in New Hampshire and Nevada over the weekend and then back in Iowa. But one thing to make clear is that even though he is ramping up his presence on the campaign trail, he is still being far outpaced by his rivals, who are still trailing him in the polls, both in Iowa and nationally.

Now she of course, has not spent nearly as much time in her campaign saying what is bad about Donald Trump, but what she would do for the future. So there certainly is a strong sense that the endorsement from the very popular governor here.Ken move the needle for her, at least they hope it can. He'll be putting his political organization behind her. They'll be campaigning aggressively, really a two person show, if you will, but it really is somewhat of a race for second place here. And she may be ahead of DeSantis on that score here in New Hampshire, not an Iowa, but Donald Trump still commands the lead here in New Hampshire as well. But she is making the argument that it's time for voters to take a leap. She makes a general election argument, Jake, that she can defeat President Biden to head to head matchup far more than Donald Trump can. Jake.",

In a growing public rift between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon, the White House desperately trying to clean up Biden's comments after he told supporters on Tuesday that Israel's offensive in Gaza is, quote, \"indiscriminate,\" the bombing indiscriminate while publicly other Biden administration officials have been insisting that Israel's intent is to limit civilian casualties. Joining us now, senior writer on Israeli and American Politics for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Alon Pinkas. He's also a former ambassador, and served in as an adviser to multiple Israeli foreign ministers and a prime minister. Mr. Ambassador, thanks so much for joining us. So in your recent article in Haaretz, titled \"Netanyahu Must Be Politically Destroyed, or Israel Will Go Down with Him,\" you lay out the prime minister's missteps and your view with China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the U.S. you say, quote, \"Netanyahu always meddling in and manipulating internal U.S. politics has impressively managed to turn Israel into a wedge issue in Washington, in contrast to decades of sacrosanct bipartisanship.\" What do you make of how Biden has been trying to handle this relationship and the chasms we've seen bubbling up in recent days such as Biden, I don't know if it was accidental or not, but Biden saying the other day that Israel was indiscriminately bombing Gaza?",

He's very unpopular right now. I think his approval rating is like 25 percent, that he just wants to stave that off as much as possible.

There's the military, there's the defense minister, there's a war cabinet in which two members of the opposition both of whom are former IDF, Israel Defense Forces chiefs of staffs, so he's not alone.So I'm not sure he can pull this off. And so while there is a conventional wisdom that he would like to extend the war, the question is, Jake, how do we define the day the war ends, because it's not going to be a, you know, a clear cut day or clear cut scenario, the war may change for me will morph into a low intensity conflict, Israel will stay in Gaza. It will conduct incursions. It will conduct so called Search and Destroy operations, against the better judgment and wishes of the Biden administration, at least in terms, Jake, at least in terms of how they view the so called day after, the post-war in Gaza, which they don't see Netanyahu as a partner in shaping.",
