Trump lawyer John Eastman, who is one of the architects behind the former president's efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election, arrested in Georgia today. His attorney will join us live. As we are learning new details about Rudy Giuliani's legal troubles ahead of his arrest.Plus, breaking news -- a Trump employee at Mar-a-Lago is changing his story about erasing videos now that his attorney is no longer being paid for by Trump's allies, according to a new court document. And now the special counsel is investigating. And 100 strikes in 24 hours. Russia dramatically escalating its attacks as Ukraine fires back, hitting a building not far from Moscow. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, we have breaking news. Turning on Trump -- federal prosecutors claiming tonight that a Trump worker at Mar-a-Lago initially lied to prosecutors about Trump's efforts to erase videos at Mar-a-Lago. Then, he got a new attorney, one who was not being paid for by Trump allies, and he changed his testimony. We are going to have much more on this development coming up. But also tonight, we're following just a flurry of activity out of Georgia as officials prepare for former President Donald Trump to turn himself in Thursday at the Fulton County jail. Today, the first two Trump codefendants surrendered. One of them Trump lawyer John Eastman -- a key player in Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election results.

He has had trouble paying many of his attorneys which, of course, it makes it hard to retain or even attract new council down here in Georgia, to help him through this prosecution. We have learned, though, that former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, one of his longtime closest friends, has agreed to sort of help him through this.Now, Bernie Kerik is not an attorney. But he does have extensive experience in the criminal justice system, both as a police commissioner and also as a defendant. He was convicted and then pardoned by former President Trump. But he is helping Rudy through this, reaching out to lawyers here in Georgia, to try to get someone who will agree to represent them. But, Brianna, as of now, all Rudy needs is someone with a Georgia law license who is willing to just sign a bond agreement so that Rudy can go and surrender. Now, it doesn't have to be a long time relationship, right? This is not going to be permanent representation. Right now, all they need is one lawyer who will sign that bond agreement. And it does appear likely he will be able to find that. But then they need to continue to hunt for someone who will represent Rudy throughout the course of this case. Now, if he was to not surrender by Friday, yes, he could potentially be detained. KEILAR: Which, I mean -- that would be something. So, we'll be watching to see how that plays out.
