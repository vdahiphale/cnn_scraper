The news continues on CNN with Wolf Blitzer in The Situation Room. I will see you Sunday morning. RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: It is 6:00 on Saturday in Beijing, 3:00 in Los Angeles, and it's Friday 6:00 p.m. here in New York. I'm Richard Quest. Julia's off. And wherever you and I are in this world, it's your \"First Move.\" And you're most welcome wherever in the world you are. Here's today's need to know. Deadlocked. CNN's final national poll before the U.S. election finds a tie between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Sources tell CNN that Chinese hackers have targeted the phones of Donald Trump and J. D. Vance. And Russian troops are heard condemning North Korean soldiers in intercepted audio. Also, we're going to tell you about the World Series showdown. The superstars Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge battle, the New York Yankees take on the Los Angeles Dodgers. There's that and a great deal more. Only after I've told you about the presidential race, which remains deadlocked. 11 days of campaigning remain, and both candidates' neck and neck. 47 to 47. There's the numbers. Look at it. Couldn't be clearer. And there goes a New York Times poll which also reveals a tie. So, tonight, Kamala Harris is to address reproductive rights at a rally featuring Beyonce. That takes place in Texas. Donald Trump in Texas talking immigration and later he'll be at a rally in Michigan. We get to Harry Enten to go through these numbers. What do you find surprising about them?",

There hasn't been any movement at all. I mean, maybe, you know, Harris, when she came in, the numbers moved a little bit towards her, but we've basically been in a dead heat now for, you know, a month and a half, two months since the Democratic National Convention back in Chicago. And you look at this data and you just wonder to yourself, what the heck is actually going to move those few undecided voters?

Then you kind of place, youknow, two and three, it can be immigration, sometimes it's abortion. But the bottom line is, if you look at the top three issues, two of them line up with Donald Trump, one of which lines up with Kamala Harris. And the question ultimately is, when you look at that, you wonder to yourself, how does Kamala Harris actually win this election? But here's the thing that I go through in my mind, Richard. When we headed into the 2022 midterms and you looked at the president's low approval rating in our CNN poll, I think it's 36 percent. You look at the percentage of Americans who say the country is heading in the right direction, it's south of 30 percent. You look at the percentage of Americans who say the economy is way off in the wrong direction, it's the same back as it was in 2022. And yet, Democrats put in a historically strong midterm election. The real question, as yet unknown, is, can Donald Trump take advantage of these fundamentals? And the thing that is holding him back, holding him back is the fact that he still has a majority of folks who have an unfavorable view of him and it has not been proven to me just yet that Donald Trump will, in fact, be able to take care of this election, go with those fundamentals and actually take advantage of them.",

As it turns out, I missed the call for Bush, then the call taking away from Bush, and then it was 37 days of excellent drama in terms of elections.

So, this is just the latest sign that this activity has gotten really serious. They've -- this has been going on for several months, and U.S. officials have been investigating, and they still actually haven't gotten to the bottom of how serious it could be. But with the news that the former president and current candidate for the highest office has been targeted that has set off alarm bells here in Washington about some of the national security risks of this activity, Richard. I know we're talking phone records and who's talking to who, and where they might be on a given day. You can track someone location-wise with their phone. So, this is very serious.

Yes, Cisco is a great company. It was back then. It is still now, but you have to pay attention to valuations. And also, as you pointed out, if AMD and Intel, which is admittedly really struggling, and other chip companies step up their game and give the large hyperscalers more of a choice in the type of chips that they would buy, that could eat into NVIDIA's growth and profit margins.
