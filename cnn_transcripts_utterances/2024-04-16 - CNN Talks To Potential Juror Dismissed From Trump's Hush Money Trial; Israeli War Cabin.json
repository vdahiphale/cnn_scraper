So, I was wondering if I wouldn't be on that or on some other case, at the same time, you know, in the building because I assume there's a lot more going on. And then yesterday when I got here and we were put into a jury holding room, and it's -- you'd like, there were 500-ish people waiting to get put into two separate holding rooms. I had the thought of like, this is probably Trump because I don't think they call it quite these many jurors for anything else. So --",

Weirdly enough, I think everyone had a sense of kind of uncertainty over what the protocols were in this situation. And so, no one really felt like they should mention it.I'm sure there were some jurors who just didn't know that this was happening right now or didn't realize that this was what they were called for. You could definitely see people kind of looking around. Like, do other people also get the sense that this is, but not really talking about it? No.",

And it's fascinating because you get these two very contrasting, kind of, senses at the same time, which is, on the one hand, it's this very -- like, massive sense of gravitas and importance because you know that this is history in the making. And whatever the outcome of this is everything going forward will be affected by it.And at the same time, you walk into the courtroom, and you see Trump sitting there -- I had never seen him in person before.

We don't know as you say what that will look like.It's clearly something that they're debating and discussing. This is now the fifth meeting. How many hours every single day? There's a diversity of opinions. Do you go for a straightforward tit-for-tat, hit Iran, some kind of a military site on the ground? Do you go for an asymmetrical attack one of Iran's numerous proxies in the region? Do you look at a cyberattack? I think what's interesting today is that you're seeing a lot more push on the diplomatic piece of this. We've seen Israel's foreign minister issued a statement saying that he's, you know, reached out to more than 30 different foreign ministers trying to create consensus in the region, or even they had talked before. Benny Gantz had talked about building a regional coalition. Those types of things take time, right? They're not things that you can do overnight. And there's a lot of hesitation in the region. On the one hand, an agreement that yes, Iran's threat is significant. On the other hand, horror about what they're seeing in Gaza. And so, trying to kind of find that sweet spot between sending a strong message or reestablishing a deterrent but also creating consensus in a region that is emphatically anti-Israel at the moment is not an easy thing to --",

The U.S., Israel's strongest ally has been very critical, most recently about Gaza, about warning of an incursion into Rafah, the vibe, we got straight away after Iran's attacks were, don't escalate, urging caution. That's what you're hearing as well from international allies in the West. Be careful. Don't allow this to grow into something bigger.At the same time when you talk to people in Israel and you listen to some of the voices from the broader cabinet, particularly that right- wing hardline coalition, Ben-Gvir, they're urging for a much tougher response, a robust response, a forceful response, one, that the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said would make would resonate across the Middle East. So, how do you -- you know, juggle all those different political calculations and come up with some kind of a coherent sort of Goldilocks sweet spot initiative is, well, it remains to be seen.",

But there again, you have these competing calculations, you have the international community that has been horrified by a lot of what it seen happening in Gaza, that has been sounding the alarm bell about the importance of finding some kind of safe haven for the 1.3 million people who are currently hunkered down in Rafah. And then you also have people in Israel who are saying, hold on a second, where's the military victory? Where are the hostages? How is Hamas still, you know, surviving in some capacity inside Gaza?So, there's no easy or clear answer or path ahead here. And it's precisely that instability.

Obviously, it'd be nice and neater and faster if we could take the Senate Bill, which has been languishing for months now, and Senate -- and get that on the floor, pass it, and send it to President Biden, who will sign it so that we can help our allies in need, both Ukraine and Israel. You know, one from Putin and Russia, the other from Iran, who by the way, are linked at the hip.But if they -- if they want to split it up and do separate votes, but the policy is the same, it's basically the Senate Bill, just you know, separated by two or three votes. You know, I'm happy to do that if that's what it takes to get it out of this body. BLITZER: Another very sensitive subject that is emerging right now. I know you just told our Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju that you will vote to save the House speaker, Mike Johnson if he faces removal. Why the difference between how you and your Democratic colleagues handled Kevin McCarthy?",

I feel like we're at the scene where like, it's Bill Murray and the groundhog in the truck driving over the cliff. I mean, we've seen this show before.What's the difference? The difference is the world has changed, right? The Kevin vote happened before October 7, right? The Kevin vote happened before Ukraine really needed our help against Putin. So, the world has completely changed. That's number one. Number two is that I don't know speaker Johnson well. Our politics and policy beliefs are completely different. But there is no way I'm going to let Marjorie Taylor Greene who wants to secede from the Union take over the House. There's no way I'm going to let Thomas Massie who has never voted to help any of our allies -- he would let the Ayatollah go right into Israel. He'd let Putin take all of Europe. There is no way I'm going to side with these people and stand by while they let the world burn. I mean, Marjorie Taylor Greene would invite Putin to give a joint session of Congress speech. I mean, Thomas Massie literally, if the Capitol was on fire, he'd get more gasoline. So, these are not just chaos people. These are people who want to break the world order and side with our enemies. And so, look, Democrats have -- will have a choice. Obviously, I defer to Hakeem Jeffries and our leader. He knows what the best course of action is. And so, we'll all wait as they -- as they work that out. But Democrats will have a choice. Let them light this on fire and watch it burn or to get a bucket of water and throw it.

It'll be tabling the motion. So, that means we don't ever talk about it. We don't ever discuss it. It goes away.I think that would likely pass so long as Speaker Johnson continues to deliver on what he said, which is basically to bring the Senate bill on policy divided up into votes. I just don't see Democrats -- we -- look, we've been in chaos here and the 118th Congress. Republicans have played politics with our allies, which has emboldened our enemies.
