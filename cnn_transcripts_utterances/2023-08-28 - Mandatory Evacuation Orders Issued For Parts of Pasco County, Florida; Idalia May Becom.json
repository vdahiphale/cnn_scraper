It's taking aim at Florida right now as it gathers strength in the warm waters of the gulf.This is expected to be category 3 hurricane when it makes landfall on Wednesday. Emergency officials are warning that the storm could also cause tornadic activity. And just last hour, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis urged people to get to higher ground. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A lot of people thought it would end up being a tropical storm. Then they said, well, maybe a category 1. Then yesterday, well, so, maybe it will hit cat 2. Now, there really doesn't seem anything to prevent it from continuing to strengthen. It is going to be a major impact, and Floridians should expect that this storm will be a major cat 3 plus hurricane. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST AND AMS CERTIFIED METEOROLOGISTAnd by the way, it's not just Florida, that's the more immediate threat. But we have to remember that Georgia into the Carolinas, you will be impacted by the storm later into the future. So, here's the earliest arrival time of tropical storm force winds, remember, you can't put up hurricane shutters in tropical storm force winds. It's impossible. We've already started to see some of those mandatory evacuations for zone A in -- hoisted for places like Pinellas County, for instance. 65 mile per hour winds, this is important. It's moving north at eight miles per hour. And at the moment, it's battling a lot of upper-level shears. So, it's keeping the center, kind of, sheared off at the top and that's going to limit the strengthening of Idalia going forward for the next 24 hours. But trust me, there is a lot of warm water associated with this system and that will allow for strengthening as it approaching the big bend and the west coast of the Florida Peninsula. We do anticipate a major hurricane to sit offshore just throughout the day on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. Here's a look at the storm surge potential, of course, there's also flood threat, severe weather threat as well. Boris.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is breaking right now, Boris. We are getting pretty scant details, but we can see in that video some really key clues here as to what happened in this crash. This Broward County Sheriff's Department fire rescue helicopter, it's an EC-135 is the type of the helicopter. You can see in that video of the left side of the helicopter, something apparently on fire. The helicopter trailing some smoke.And then this is where it gets really hard to watch. The pylon that goes out to the tail rotor, so critical in a helicopter to keep it flying straight breaks into two. And then the helicopter, the forces of the rotor, the main rotor just overcome it and it spins out of control. We're also getting video from the scene now of the helicopter's impact right over there in an apartment building. Still not clear if the two people who have been taken to the hospital were those on the ground or those in the helicopter. A very grisly crash. This helicopter type has a very good safety record. Two engines on board. Built by Airbus and Eurocopter. It's been around for a long time. 2,000 of them out there. The flight path, though, tells a really distinct story here. You can see it from ATSB exchange, as the helicopter took off 8:45 this morning from the Pompano Beach Airpark, pretty busy airport there, a lot of flight training. They went out to the west, only gotten to about 650 feet, very low. And then immediately tried to make a turn back east to the airport when this accident so very clearly happened. Still getting in information now -- right now, Boris. But the video, very hard to watch. It's so clear that this helicopter was out of control. Not much that the pilots could really do, especially without a tail rotor. It is so hard to keep a helicopter flying straight without it, Boris.",

I think that if you get into the mind of the Republican primary voters, they have been told that there is a conspiracy against them, that there is a deep state, that their votes were stolen which a lot of them believe, that we have an illegal president.And this is just further efforts, one enough just to steal the election, you have to go out now and try to stop the man who should be president from becoming the next president. Now, to most of us, that sounds stark raving and saying. It's been disputed by every court. There are no secretary of state in America, Republican or Democrat, who says that there was any serious problems with their elections. But if you believe that, there is a logical chain that lead you to believe the Donald Trump, the more he's persecuted, the more he's indicted, the more you should support him. And I think that's what you're seeing reflected here.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, I worked in five different presidential campaigns on the Republican side. And they have a lot similarities, there's a lot of structure to them. You have campaign staffs with advanced teams and with messaging teams and voter contact teams. The Trump campaign really has bn been existing without all of that. He is the campaign.When he goes out, he draws a crowd. He doesn't sit around and have meetings about what his message is, he just goes out and says it. So, I think if you compare, like all the money that DeSantis is spending now and his super PAC, it's just spending it on, sort of, structure and noise, and to try to look like a presidential campaign. Trump doesn't do that. You know, in '16 when he ran, I've said, if Donald Trump wins, it means that everything that we know about politics is wrong. And as it turns out, everything we knew about politics was wrong. And I think he continues to break those rules. In '20, he was in a very difficult place for him because he was running as an incumbent who had to defend the record. And Donald Trump really had no idea what his record was. He's now back to being in a very comfortable space as an outsider. That's probably like Ramaswamy, they're both outsiders. They can say, which is sort of, you know, another way of saying, they don't know what they're doing. But I think he likes to attack. He's got good targets and he is in a comfortable space now for him as a campaign. SOLOMON: Yes, I wanted to talk about Ramaswamy. He, of course, made waves at the GOP debate last week. He also made some comments about his foreign policy making those waves. But he also, this morning, officially rolled out his platform on the subject of foreign policy. He said he will accept Russian control of the occupied territories of Ukraine, and pledge to block Ukraine's candidacy for NATO in exchange for Russia exiting its military alliance with China. I will end sanctions and bring Russia back into the world market. This policy of, essentially, punishing friends and rewarding enemies. I mean, how do you think this is going to play with Republican voters?",
