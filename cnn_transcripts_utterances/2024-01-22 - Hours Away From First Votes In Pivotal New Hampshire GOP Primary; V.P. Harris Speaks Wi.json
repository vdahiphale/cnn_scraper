He didn't win, but he came back from very big problems with his campaign. And that is because of the kind of sentiment and the sensibility of New Hampshire voters, but it is also because of what you alluded to there. They're called undeclared voters here, independents who are not affiliated. They can vote in either primary and in the Republican primary, particularly this year, given this dynamic, they are expected to play a big, big role.

Trump gained a little bit more.But, again, Ron DeSantis' support at this late stage of the race in New Hampshire, Wolf, was so small that this is a rather negligible kind of movement or benefit for either candidate, but it would make sense.

Our colleague, Jeff Zeleny, made this point on inside politics today and I just want to borrow it from him, and that is if there was another crucial primary state other than South Carolina coming up and she could afford to not win but stay in the race and just try to collect delegates, even though South Carolina wouldn't allow her that because it is winter take all, but to continue to Super Tuesday which has a lot of delegates at stake, it would be a lot easier for her to have the money to stay in the -- to use the money that she's already collected, perhaps collect some more money to stay in the race.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: When you look ahead and you see what is coming down the road, particularly the next time of the calendar date is January 6th, Madam Vice President, the last time we saw an election year, presidential election year, of a vice president overseeing certification of the election, we saw what transpired with our eyes. There is concern that many actually believe that we do not have free and fair elections in this country. Do you have concerns about how to approach the certification process again on January 6th? KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I think everyone is right to be vigilant in demanding that we maintain our democracy and we uphold its pillars, which includes the integrity of a free and fair election system. And that means addressing, for example, the intimidation that has happened with poll workers. I was recently in Georgia speaking with poll workers who have been the subject of attack or are fearful about volunteering their time in our elections because they feel a sense of civic duty. It's important for all of us to stand and say we support people who do that work and they should not be attacked. It is important that we all remember that a hallmark of a democracy is civic participation, which means let's all vote. I'm not telling you who to vote for, but, please, in the midst of all that you've got going on, take the time to fill out a ballot. If you can vote by mail, then send it in. Sometimes you might have to stand for quite some time in line, but please do, in spite of, again, in states like Georgia, who pass laws that make it illegal to even give you food and water if you're standing in line.

And one of the leading voices around election sabotage and voter intimidation is Donald Trump, whether it be around voter suppression or on January 6th.The final thing I will say is that she also called people into community saying women are often questioned, particularly women of color. And that is something that is not new to me or something that is not new to someone who is in a place of leadership.

Now, the Israeli prime minister, for his part, he has made clear that a proposal from Hamas to try and end the war that would see the release of all the hostages, but also leave Hamas intact in many ways and allow the release of Palestinian prisoners, including those who committed the terrorist attacks on October 7th, he's making clear that that is completely untenable, telling the families of hostages instead today that Israel has its own proposal. And now we are learning from Axios, our own analyst, Barak Ravid, saying that there is an Israeli proposal on the table that is offering the longest ceasefire that Israel has ever put on the table, up to two months of a pause in the fighting to allow for the release of all the hostages. This would be a phased release that would see women, older men and those in need of medical care exit first before eventually getting to female soldiers, men and male soldiers as well. Netanyahu -- the question is, of course, whether Hamas would accept that. We do know that there are a number of negotiations ongoing at the moment. In fact, President Biden has dispatched one of his top advisers to the region to try and move these negotiations forward. He is traveling to Egypt as well as Qatar this week to handle these negotiations. But as these negotiations are ongoing, there is still intense fighting in Southern Gaza. A source familiar with the matter telling me that the Israeli military is currently undergoing a major offensive in the western part of Khan Younis, the largest city in Southern Gaza, trying to take down one of the major Hamas battalions that exist there. And Palestine Red Crescent society officials telling us that that offensive, that the fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military is making the humanitarian situation there very difficult, very difficult to reach the wounded and get them to hospitals.

But a write-in campaign for the president could offer some key insights into his strength in New Hampshire.Joining us now, the Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.

So while Granite Staters think the DNC made a terrible decision, and we have a state law that says we will have the first primaries, so that's what's happening tomorrow. We also know what the stakes are in this election. We care about democracy. And our democracy cannot afford another Donald Trump term. We know that Donald Trump advocates violence over voting. He's an election denier. He will continue to work to undermine individual freedoms like a woman's reproductive rights. And he will continue to say that he is above the law. That's antithetical to our democracy. Meanwhile, too, Biden has a terrific bipartisan record of achievement and delivering results for all Americans. And we have a lot of work still to do on that front. But he has been able to put politics aside, and really focus this on getting things done like the infrastructure bill, like veterans health care, like investing in American manufacturing. So, Granite Staters, knowing what is at stake here, are very energized by a write-in campaign and we are encouraging all Democrats and independents to go to the polls tomorrow. Go all the way down on the ballot, fill in the bubble next to write in and write into Biden's name.",

A veteran told me told -- my team recently that for the first time he's getting health care from the V.A. for his exposure to Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. And he finally feels like it's not his fault, his problem, the V.A. is helping him now. That's again part due to Joe Biden's leadership. So Granite Staters are really enthused about this, as I said. They also know the stakes in this election. I'm the daughter of a World War II veteran. And when I hear Donald Trump echoing fascist, calling his opponents vermin, calling and encouraging violence, my dad always used to say to me in the run-up to World War II, we thought that was just talk and it wasn't.
