He actually has representation but not actually local counsel. So he'll come back, facing those six charges outlined in the indictment.

The DOJ normally would have about 14 days to turn over everything, to say here is what you have in preparation for a fair trial, obviously, to have both exculpatory information available and everything else. But this will be massaged a great deal because, of course, you've got delays possible, due to classified documents. You've got to get security clearances to see the documents at issue here. It doesn't say anything about what's going to happen eventually for a jury to actually look at those documents. Summation probably happened already. You're talking about the grand jury.

That will be the part of the pretrial motions. It's not unheard of to have these motions. It's quite standard to talk about what's going to come in, what's going to be excluded. We're talking about a jury, of course. The court of public opinion will probably hear a lot more than, actually, a court of law, jury empaneled people will do. But the No. 1 question's going to be the schedule. It's a big question mark. We know that they have a lot of time against them, if you're the prosecution. But we don't actually have a set schedule in terms of a trial date, most importantly, of course. The speedy trial says within 70 days.

So we learned that law enforcement in Fulton County actually sent officers to New York when the former president was there facing an indictment. They sent officials yesterday to Miami. Their goal was to try to see how do these crowds work and how does law enforcement prepare? So they're basically building their own playbook. It's interesting because these -- you know, anyone who has worked at protests know it's -- it's almost like an ecosystem. Right? You try to identify who's the leader of this group. And, you know, it's not uncommon for law enforcement to try to make contact with that person, just to have a line of communication. Miami police yesterday did a really good job at quickly identifying, you know, potential moments of tension, trying to diffuse them. There are also lessons learned, to be sure.

TALCOTT: I think they'd love not to respond, quite frankly. But, given that they will have to respond, Mike Pence is, I would say, going to be the baseline of kind of separating himself from saying that Trump is innocent and this is, you know, a witch-hunt, but also saying that it's politicized. And that's kind of the safe bet for a lot of these candidates, because so much of the Republican base believes that the DOJ and the FBI are politicized. So they get points there. And then they kind of get points in terms of keeping their credibility by admitting these are really serious charges and, you know, maybe we shouldn't jump to, you know, immediately pardoning them, like the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) has promised to.",

So he's cautious of that, as well. And remember, that already concluded as him not being charged. But Biden still lives in a bit of a glass house, albeit a White House at this point in time. And there's a lot of conversations abut what you can say and what you can do and expose yourself to these things. But remember, this is the head of the executive branch. The idea of the Presidential Records Act, which by the way, we played at the top of the hour, there is no grace period for turning over documents. When the clock strikes 12 p.m. for the inauguration, that's it. You're supposed to, in your lame duck period, do all that you could to get the documents returned. That's just patently false.

Maybe there's a spectrum there of, you know, how forceful they're going to be. But they're also then going to say, but the Justice Department was politicized; but the FBI needs to be reformed.
