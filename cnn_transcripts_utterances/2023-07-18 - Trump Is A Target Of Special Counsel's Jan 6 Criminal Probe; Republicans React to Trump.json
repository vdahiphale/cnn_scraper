You're getting, on one sense, the quick rush to defense.That came from the speaker of the House to a number of rank-and-file members who will support Donald Trump no matter what, even if he is, in fact, indicted for a third time. Something that would be absolutely unprecedented, having a former president to go under and face these kinds of criminal charges. There's still unflinching support among various elements of the House Republican conference, in particular. There's also silence coming from the Senate Republican leaders, including Mitch McConnell, yet to weigh in on this, as well as his top deputies have not said anything. And there are some members in the rank-and-file who are uneasy about Donald Trump being president and are uncertain what to make of it, as Congressman Tony Gonzalez just told me moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TONY GONZALEZ (R-TX): It's all messy. It's all ugly. It's all the fact that we're throwing around indictments and all these things like they're candy. It's troublesome. But there's also this idea that politics is in everything now. So I don't know. It's a bad nightmare for everyone involved. Hopefully, it goes away some time soon. This place could use a shot of bipartisanship. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But he has yet to get those documents. The Justice Department simply will not provide information as part of this ongoing criminal investigation. Democrats contend this is a clear effort to play interference, try to help Trump to use their power to try to muddy the waters in this investigation here. But at the moment, you're hearing a variety of reactions. A lot of folks don't know what to make of it, but a lot of Republicans rushing to Donald Trump's defense.",

And my guess is they were not as free to say, \"pound sand,\" as they did to our committee.We lacked the time to go through the enforcement actions, for the most part, in court. But the grand jury has powers we don't. The Justice Department has an enforcement capability we don't in Congress. I would expect they have a lot more information and evidence than we were able to accumulate and we accumulated a lot. We accumulated certainly evidence, powerful evidence, that Donald Trump was told by his own top Justice Department officials that these fraud claims he was peddling were B.S. He was told this by his own attorney general and the top deputy attorney generals. And this is powerful proof of knowledge and intent. That is, he knows this is fraudulent and yet he continues to push it. Similarly, out on the mall on January 6th, he's told these people won't go through the metal detectors because they're armed, and his response, \"Then take down the F'ing mags, they're not here to hurt me.\" This has been a powerful evidence of the present state of mind, his knowledge and complicity. And I think these are key things that the special counsel and the grand jury are considering.",

For example, Pat Cipollone, White House counsel, would answer certain questions, but not go into conversations with the president.I would hope and expect that he was more forthcoming with a grand jury. He should have been more forthcoming with us. Nevertheless, I would expect those direct conversations would add a lot of important value to prosecutors because they're the best window into Donald Trump's state of mind. And one of the things prosecutors will have to prove is, you know, what did the president know, what did he understand, how strong is the proof, that when he was lying to the American people, he understood he was lying to the American people? What conversations with special counsel able to elicit between the president and the vice president, Mike Pence, in terms of the pressure campaign on the vice president to ignore the law and Constitution on January 6th? So those conversations, I think, are among the key evidence, much of which we did not obtain because witnesses were simply unwilling to provide it and we couldn't force them.",

That's a pretty speedy timeline for this case.The Trump team has maintained that they don't even want the judge to set a timeline yet because they have a lot of issues that they believe need to be litigated, including, of course, the very nature of these documents, whether they're classified, and whether the special counsel even has the authority to bring these charges. Of course, that's something that could take months. It depends if it goes all the way to the Supreme Court. But we know, of course, that real reason, the main reason, why this hearing was called, was to discuss the classified documents that are at the center of this, Anderson. The special counsel has requested a protective order, which would place restrictions on how the evidence is being handled, including by the Trump team and Walt Nauta's team. And so far, the Trump team has declined to say what exactly they view as objectionable in there. They said they had objections but wouldn't specify exactly what those objections are. These hearings usually don't last that long, but because we are talking about Donald Trump and, obviously, a historic case, it's unclear how long this will go.

      "sentences": "This is a Republican Party divided. And it's not going to become less so over the next few months.Six months from now, the first voters will begin weighing in Iowa and then onto New Hampshire. There is a clear hunger and appetite among half of the Republican Party, likely more, for a new page, a new direction. A new poll out this morning from New Hampshire showed that Donald Trump has 37 percent support. That means he has consolidated and is holding his base. That's it. This is a former president. He's basically the incumbent in the race, and that's not a good number for the incumbent. However, no one has managed to overtake him yet. So we have to be patient and let it play out over the summer months. Someone will have to make the argument to show the Republican voters they're the alternative. There's definitely an opening for him. But we know he's campaigning on the indictments, on the investigation. This is part of his strategy. We're seeing it in real time. JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's hard to beat a frontrunner if you look back at history. With a caveat, who knows if history applies when it comes to Donald Trump. When you have a faraway frontrunner like this, it's hard to beat them. Because Donald Trump has proven he can raise money and he uses bad news to somehow generate good news politically. But the number is important, 37 percent. Ron DeSantis at 23 percent. Everyone else in single digits in New Hampshire. That means more than six in ten Republicans in the first primary state do not want Donald Trump so he can be beat. But 2016 teaches us, if there are six, eight, 10 other candidates on the ballot, 37 percent is enough to be the candidate. It's 182 days before anybody votes. That's the Iowa caucuses. They go first. A lot can and will change right now. But when you hear from the speaker, from the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, you hear from the Tumpees in the party, they're not wavering. In part, because they think he's a snowball coming down the hill. They know the history. You step away from Donald Trump, he will bulldoze you.",

Again.Here's the thing about wanting to run for president is, generally speaking, you think you're the only person who can do it. That's why all of these people, whenever they see Trump have a potential weakness, they say, I'm the one. And if enough of those people do that, then, all of a sudden, you have 10 or 12 or 15 people in the race. That's what's happening in the Republican Party right now. Consolidation is the only thing that will allow someone, other than Trump, to be the nominee of this party. And the question of consolidation is a question of timing. When it happens matters. In the Republican Party, it's a winner-take-all primary system. That means you cannot wait until Super Tuesday to consolidate. You have to do it early enough to give the voters enough time to coalesce around someone so Trump doesn't start -- it doesn't start to be a snowball falling downhill. So far, we've seen no evidence of that happening. But we've seen the opposite, more and more people getting in.",
