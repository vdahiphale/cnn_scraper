Top White House officials say they do not want to go to war with Iran, but they are promising a serious response after a weekend drone attack killed three U.S. Army soldiers and wounded more than 40 others. The attack happened at a small U.S. outpost known as Tower 22 in Jordan. This is near the border with Syria and Iraq. This happened early yesterday morning. This afternoon, the Pentagon identified the fallen soldiers as 46 year-old Sergeant William Rivers, 24 year-old specialist Kennedy Sanders, and 23-year-old specialist Breonna Moffett. This is the first time U.S. troops have been killed by enemy fire since the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Some of the most gravely wounded have been evacuated to a medical center in Germany, and the number of injured is expected to keep rising because it can take time for symptoms of traumatic brain injuries to appear. Moments ago, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called this the most dangerous time in the Middle East in more than 50 years. U.S. official say they're still trying to figure out exactly who was behind the attack. But this afternoon, Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the Pentagon is confident that the militia is a group supported by Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTERappears to have happened here is there were two drones that were kind of approaching the U.S. military outposts called Tower 22 in northeast Jordan, roughly at the same time, there was an American drone that was returning to base. And then shortly thereafter, there was that enemy drone, that kind of managed to sneak in and it was flying low according to U.S. officials, which also may have contributed to air defenses being -- it being able to evade the base's air defenses. So there was confusion about just who this drone belonged to. And that may have contributed to a delay in the U.S.'s ability to respond here. But one other question that we had in which I asked the deputy Pentagon press secretary today is just how one drone could cause so much damage. Because in previous strikes that these Iran-backed groups have carried out on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. There have been small number of casualties, very light injuries, usually a couple injured here and there, but never before have we seen one of these attacks injure upwards of 40 service members and kill, of course, three U.S. service members. And the answer I got is that essentially this drone hit a living facility where the service members were sleeping. They were in their beds. It was early in the morning on Sunday, and essentially there was just not time to evacuate the area. And so now the question that central command is going to be trying to figure out, among many other questions, among them, who was responsible for this is what needs to be done to bolster security at this base because there are 350 U.S. Army and Air Force personnel currently stationed there.",

Since October, there have been more than 170 attacks from these Iran-backed militias on U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, and now Jordan. But this is the first time we've actually see them kill U.S. serviceman.The question is, was the intention to escalate or was this somehow happenstance? You heard Natasha talking about the various issues with air defenses there. Was this a deliberate attempt to escalate? We've seen Iran come out already and say, we did not have any part in this, that may be an attempt to try to avert a direct escalation with the U.S. But ultimately, I think at this stage, Jake, for President Biden, it doesn't really matter what the intention was. He has to respond to the reality. This is a moment where the U.S. has been leading a military campaign against the Houthi militia in Yemen. And so far, it has done very little to avert those attacks on the shipping channels in the Red Sea. And so, this really is a crucial instance where the White House needs to show a forceful and compelling response. But as we've seen so often, with the Biden administration, they tend to prefer a very sort of carefully calibrated goldilocks response. And in this instance, with all the various proxies at play, whether they go for an attack on one of these Iran-backed militias are on Iran itself, it is a very delicate moment and it is a very difficult needle to thread, Jake.",

They know that when they're shooting ordnance at U.S. bases, that there is some probability that they kill Americans.Well, they did that. And so now they are going to see hey, response that really is going to have two objectives. Number one, to send a deterrent effect and that's why that response needs to be very, very strong. If it were me, it would be about taking out an awful lot of the infrastructure of these proxy groups in places like Syria, maybe hitting the Houthis harder, but also without escalating. You know, I have colleagues that are calling for attacks inside Iran, you know -- you know, what would also be escalatory if we killed a whole bunch of Iranian civilians as tragic as the death of American servicemen are -- was in Jordan, we need to be careful that we send a very strong signal that this will not be tolerated without putting the Iranians in a position where now they're going to start shooting in our ships and we find ourselves in a war in the Persian Gulf.",

So, Nikki Haley is a long way from occupying the Oval Office. Now, look, they killed U.S. service people, right? So the right response here would be painful, not just to militias, but to the IRGC, right? So again, I hope that the White House comes up with a response that, that brings a lot of pain to the IRGC. But again, taking shots inside Iran with the risk, the attendant risks that we kill a lot of innocent Iranians, civilians, that would be a pretty good way to escalate this even further into a -- you know, into a spiral that might not, that we might not be able to control.",

The best thing that ever happened to these guys was to find themselves in a war with the United States.So what that says to me, Jake, is that the response needs to go beyond just sending a message. The response needs to also be about taking away capability that is finding the missile launching sites, finding the drone launching sites, finding the logistical supply lines, and taking those out because deterrence alone won't work. Now again, I still think its a very dangerous thing to call for strikes inside of Iran because of the risk of civilian Iranian deaths in that instance but, you know, the Houthis are not going to be deterred.

And now, maybe it's not so necessary anymore based on the way it's socialized its constituents and, you know, its like in some ways its more similar to abortion.

It's not clear how Herring and OAN obtain that spreadsheet and it's not clear if the passwords were real. But Smartmatic is arguing that this is a real problem for OAN. Let me read for you something that they told a federal judge last month in a court filing, they said that Smartmatic believes that OAN executives, quote, may have engaged in criminal activities because they appear to have violated state and federal laws regarding data privacy. Remember, this was back when both OAN and Sidney Powell and a bunch of other pro-Trump figures were brazenly peddling the lie that the election was rigged and Smartmatic was to blame.",
