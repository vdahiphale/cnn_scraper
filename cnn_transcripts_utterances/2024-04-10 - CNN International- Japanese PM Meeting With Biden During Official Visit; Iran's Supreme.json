We did see that highly ceremonial arrival out on the South Lawn just a few minutes ago, and it really does underscore the importance that the White House is placing, not only on this visit, but on the broader U.S.-Japan relationship, which they really do view as a linchpin of their strategy in the Indo-Pacific.And you heard very warm words from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida, hailing this alliance that has been enforced for decades, but they are hoping to bring to a brand new level with this very visit, and you'll see that in the list of announcements that will come out, out of this meeting today. It's almost 70 items long. Officials say that's one of the longest lists of so-called deliverables that they can remember for this kind of official visit, and it includes steps to try and integrate the two countries, militaries try and reinforce cooperation on issues of space, of AI, try an increase in the defense industrial base, all of these issues where the U.S. thinks that there really is much more room to expand this very historic relationship, and you could see in that arrival ceremony the worth between these two men. The other big thing that Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden both talked about is the cherry blossoms and that's something that they think sort of symbolizes this decades-long relationship. Listen to a little bit of how Prime Minister Kishida described it in his remarks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (Interpreted): The cherry trees along the Potomac River are a symbol of the friendship between Japan and the United States. These Japanese-born cherry trees have been sounding the arrival of spring to the city every year for over 110 years. Just as the local residents have cherished and protected these cherry trees, the Japan-U.S. relationship has been supported and nurtured by the many people who love each other's country.

And President Biden has made clear, his foreign policy is one of multilateral relationships of trying to boost the United States' presence in the Indo-Pacific. That's very different from something that President Trump might pursue, if he were to come into office. And when you talk to officials at the White House, they're very frank that there is a lot of uncertainty around the world about what might come next in American foreign policy. And so, a lot of the items that these two leaders will be ticking off today in their meeting in the Oval Office are trying to make permanent some of these items, trying to sort of future proof them in case Trump is to win another term in the White House.

Kevin, thanks so much.Well, scathing words over the war in Gaza by one of Israel's closest allies, U.S. President Joe Biden telling Univision that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is making a quote \"mistake in how he is handling the war.\" The interview took place days after an Israeli strike killed seven food charity workers. Meantime, Israel is warning that if Iran hits its territory, it will strike back inside of Iran. And Iran's supreme leader today saying that Israel quote \"must be punished and will be for strike that killed several top Iranian commanders in Syria.\" Now, the Israeli Foreign Minister says that a direct Iranian hit on Israel would be a turning point. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Lebanon, where there have been fears of the war becoming a regional conflict, Ben, really since October 7, since this began, but Israel and the U.S. now appear to be hardening their stance.

And it's a reflection of the growing impatience. We're now six months into this war. Almost 33,500 people have been killed in Gaza, 70 percent of them the UN believes are women and children. The war is becoming a political liability for President Biden himself within the Democratic Party.So, certainly, there are strains, but at the same time, the United States, despite all the words that are coming out of it, we're seeing that U.S. is still willing to provide until now Israel with, by and large, not completely, all of the weapons and ammunition they are asking for. So, on the one hand, you hear these words from President Biden in that interview. But, I think the actions of the United States speak louder than those words. Rahel.",

And so, we've seen Japan even just in that region sort of build these alliances and these ties. And I'm curious, what China has to be thinking, watching this visit? What China has to be thinking, looking at these partnerships, which appear to be getting stronger?",

So, traditionally, the United States has bilateral, strong bilateral strategic relations with -- certainly with Japan and Korea, South Korea and with others, but Japan and South Korea traditionally, at least since the Second World War and the Korean War, have had a terrible relationship. And so, the United States has played a leading role in trying to bring Japan and South Korea together because the strategic interests of the United States, Japan and South Korea are aligned, and that strategic interest is to stand up to the bullying and aggression of China and North Korea. And that's really important.And so, Japan, in many ways, is graduating from being a strategic dependent, where it depends on the United States, to being really a full-fledged partner. And because of that, we need to have a more latticed relationship between America's allies and partners in Japan, and Korea allies and partners in the region. But, the thing that we're -- that everybody is afraid of is China. And just as the Japanese Prime Minister is in Washington, meeting with President Biden, Xi Jinping, the President of China, is meeting with Sergey Lavrov, the Foreign Minister of Russia in Beijing. And so, Russia and China are collaborating in lots of ways. And now, it seems clear that China is giving not insignificant material support to the Russian war effort, invasion of Ukraine. And so, we're seeing two different visions of the future. And the United States, Japan, Korea, Philippines are standing together in support of a rules-based international order, and if we're successful, that will be an order that helps many people across the world flourish.",

We want to get back to one of our top stories here in the U.S. A little earlier, we told you six former Mississippi law enforcement officers were sentenced by the state. The officers pleaded guilty to torturing two black men, one of whom was shot in the mouth. They received state sentences ranging from 15 to 45 years. This group of officers, some of whom called themselves the quote \"Goon Squad\", last month, all six were also sentenced to federal prison terms from 10 to 40 years.Let's get to Ryan Young, who is outside this courthouse. Ryan, you have been covering this story from the very beginning. Walk us through what happened today. RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Look, we've been watching this for over eight months, and the victims, everything they've told us so far has played out in court from how they were treated to what happened to him, the fact that they faced torture for some two hours. What we learned here today is this is the first time that Rankin County police officers and county deputies have ever faced charges and were convicted. What we did learn is those state charges will run concurrent with the federal charges. So, they didn't get any extra time today. This really sent a clear message. Let's remind our viewers how this started. There was the accusation that these men were dating a white woman, and that's why their house was raided. Once the house was raided by the \"Goon Squad\", the members did everything from waterboarding to spreading chocolate syrup on them. They tried to sexually assault the men. They took Tasers and hit them over and over again with the Tasers to see which Taser was more effective. Then, one officer pulled a gun out and shot Michael Jenkins in the mouth. That changed his life, obviously. And if it wasn't for that shot, we probably wouldn't be here today. But, listen to Michael Jenkins talk about this day in court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Also, these rate cuts that we're talking about, sometimes rate cuts, that can help boost the price of gold. Then there is a lot of demand for physical gold right now because central bankers, including those in China, they've been buying aggressively as they seek to diversify away from the dollar.Gold is also something that people buy when they're worried, right, and there are concerns about wars, the Russia-Ukraine war, the situation in the Middle East, and then there is FOMO, right, just the fear of missing out. To some extent, people are buying gold because other people are buying gold and because the price is going up.
