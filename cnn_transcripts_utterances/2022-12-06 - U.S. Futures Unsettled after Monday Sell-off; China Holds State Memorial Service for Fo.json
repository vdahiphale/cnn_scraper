Yes, it's all happening on the show today Qatar's neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, shooting for the stars and Mars hoping to harness the benefits of space exploration. We'll hear from the Chairwoman of the U.A.E. space agency. Her Excellency Sara Allen Mary later on in the program.

As you can see C, for consumer strength new numbers, it's showing a big jump in U.S. spending on services. That's actually a red flag for the inflation fighting Federal Reserve, which meets next week to raise rates once again. O, in the meantime for oil whipsawed by U.S. recession concerns and uncertainty over that brand new $60 cap per barrel cap on Russian crude.

Tesla, in the meantime denying that report and Monday's news may have been cold today's picture also not so bold U.S. futures remain pretty unsettled. As you can see that Europe also softer after a mixed handover during the Asia session though I have to say Taiwan is all the talk today with a monster new investment in the United States. And that is where we begin today's show. The world's most valuable chip company, Taiwan Semiconductor betting more chips on U.S. growth the firm is set to announce it will triple its investment in the state of Arizona to some $40 billion. Marc Stewart is here with all the details on that story. Great geographical diversification, I think for Taiwan semi, but it's also a big win for the United States in terms of FDI and their supply chain for big companies like Apple, of course and Nvidia.",

As you mentioned this $40 billion investment, it's been touted by the company as one of the largest international direct foreign investments in history that again, according to the company. So there's certainly some novelty to this, but there's also some necessity. As we have been discussing now, for months, more than a year, there has been this big push in the United States to increase domestic semiconductor production. As we saw during the pandemic, it proved to be a big challenge. Certainly, we use these chips for our laptops, but they also are needed in our smartphones, washing machines, automobiles, the list goes on and on. And big companies like Qualcomm, like Apple all depend on Taiwan Semiconductor to help make these products. And these chips are not something that everyone can necessarily make. They require a finite production style. They require a lot of intellect, a lot of smarts and Taiwan Semiconductor has been able to refine that process. So for the United States to have a plant here of this scale, of this capacity, of this intellect, it's a very big deal. In addition to the facility itself, this will generate thousands of jobs. At least 10,000 jobs are what the company is saying. And it's something that President Biden will likely discuss when he tours that facility, Julia, later today here in the United States.",

We also have these complicated relationships about autonomy with Taiwan. So there are several ingredients in this which make this a politically complicated situation. And it's something that perhaps we will hear more from the White House. Not sure exactly, you know, as far as specifics after that meeting with President Xi and President Biden.

And more changes in China, Beijing's two major airports will no longer require departing passengers to show a negative COVID test to enter their terminals. This comes as a number of Chinese cities begin to ease COVID restrictions. And Selena Wang has all the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is the kind of line Beijing are stand in. Outside in the cold to get there COVID tests a 48- hour test are required to get into most places. But there aren't many places to go. Much of Beijing is still closed down. WANG (on camera): This is one of the most popular tourist places in the city. But the restaurants are largely closed and the malls are pretty empty. So this McDonald's is still open, but for takeaway only. But even to get takeaway, you've got to prove that you're clear of COVID. Here's how I do it I open up the health app on my smartphone, I scan the QR code. So it says I've got a green code, and I've got a recent COVID test so I'm good to go. This code dictates all of our daily lives in China green means good to go. Red means I may have to isolate at home or go to a mass quarantine facility. This allows China to track the movements of virtually all 1.4 billion people in the name of contact tracing. I've got to scan my code to get into a taxi or Public Park or mall or a coffee shop or even a public bathroom. WANG (voice over): I ran into a group of delivery people on the street, they've got to do COVID tests every single day to do their jobs. This woman tells me the pandemic has been hard on her. I asked her why she says it's because she's scared at the virus. WANG (on camera): Getting COVID in China is unlike anywhere else in the world. You and your close contacts all get sent to a quarantine Center. This is a convention center in Beijing that's been turned into a massive quarantine facility with thousands of beds. But some of these facilities in the country they are in very rundown and unsanitary condition and then your whole building or community could go into lockdown. WANG (voice over): I spoke to a man who has been in and out of quarantine six times already just this year. He tells me his whole building of more than 200 families went to a quarantine facility last month because they were considered close contacts. He says he's not scared to get COVID because omicron is less severe and his whole family has been vaccinated. I approached a few people just released from this mass quarantine center here. I asked if they had tested positive for COVID. Yes, the man nods and says they have recovered. How many days did you spend in there? I asked. 7 days he said. Unprecedented protests recently erupted across China. WANG (on camera): They're chanting that they don't want COVID tests. They want freedom. WANG (voice over): Authority swiftly crackdown on the protesters, but they are finally softening their stance on zero COVID. Some cities are lifting lockdowns changing COVID testing requirements. Under some conditions people can now quarantine at home if they have COVID which is a huge deal. But this country has already built up a whole infrastructure around zero COVID spending all of its resources on quarantine facilities and COVID testing. So it's going to be a long and slow exit from zero COVID, Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So we did some tightening to our underwriting for a longer term credit. And then in May, we did further tightening on the underwriting side. And in addition to that, also, we obviously concluded that the investor sentiment has shifted dramatically. People don't want to lean as much into the future, they want to see profitability now. Fortunately, Klarna has been profitable for its first 15 years of existence so we can have, we know how to do it and so we have to make a shift, and unfortunately, lead those who are still making have to make changes to organization. But right now, we are in this path back towards profitability that we hope to accomplish on a month by month basis of the summer.

So in general, the overall average balances on the credit card, maybe 3, $4,000. We don't our product doesn't work that way. It's a for pain for pain, three, so our balances are only outstanding for up to about two months. So that means that we turn around their balance sheet 12 times a year, and the average outstanding balance is only $70. So what happens when an economical-recession comes like this one, it gives us a very different level of agility? If we change your underwriting models, within two months, 50 percent half my balance sheet is underwritten according to the new standards, which may be tighter and tougher in that perspective, right? And that's different the credit card or a big bank, the durations are so long, when an economical-recession hits. They cannot just simply change the composition of their balance sheet, because it takes a lot of time for that to translate into the balance sheet, right so there is actually a very favorable aspect of the product that we half that losses that level of agility? And that is why we can react in a better way and with their storm, like an economical-recession and so forth better than your traditional credit card industry and you also see that in lower losses light.

How we need to maintain space free of debris? How we need to continue to collaborate as space faring nations? And how that all ties together is bringing in people from various backgrounds. Space agencies usually speak to each other, we sometimes include commercial space, but rarely do we bring in space commands. Rarely do we bring in regulators and policymakers and also diplomats. Space is ever becoming an area that needs to be discussed. And dialogue needs to be pushed forward on the global sphere so that we can actually harness space for humanity, rather than making it the next front for disruption.",

Do you see the UAE in that regard is some kind of bridge between what were the traditional space powers, the United States, and Russia, of course, and those now that we're all getting on board, and I include China in this because there clearly is a danger perhaps for conflict in the future beyond that competition?",

It does feel like that at this stage, given the reference that you made to climate in particular, we clearly haveto move quicker above anything else I think where space is concerned. The challenge I think for a lot of people watching this will be never mind getting to the moon never mind getting to Mars, we have huge problems on this planet. Climate is a great example that that need fixing. And I think helping our citizens understand the benefits, the economic benefits, perhaps beyond anything else of space exploration, the data that you're now pulling, for example, from the Mars mission. Have you quantified the economic benefits of this so that the people can understand? And do you think that's also something that that nations have to consider for those that perhaps are saying, why when we have so many other problems to solve?",

From a needs perspective if I take the climate,climate change and the weather systems and the dynamics that we're now seeing. One of the only ways that we can study that over time is using satellites. And those satellites typically operate in low Earth orbit around Earth. That is the most congested part of Earth. If we talk about communications and expanding our communications capabilities, we see companies now utilizing low Earth orbit. Starlink is an example of that. So that's how we just connect with each other. These are all fundamental needs, they do create economic benefit, but they are making our lives better, and they're impacting our lives positively. If we do not address the issues that we currently have in low Earth orbit, and just to contextualize that we actually within a decade will have a real problem in low earth orbit. It might lead to a point where spacecraft's might collide with each other cause more debris, render that area of space, not accessible, which means the spacecraft's the satellites, that we rely on, for our data for our information for our connectivity, will no longer be able to safely operate. And that's going to be a world that we don't want to live in. And that's why I always like this to the climate agenda. Right now it's too late to solve the climate change issue. If we don't solve the space issue within the next three years, and have the mechanism to be able to deal with debris, the mechanism to agree that we will not cause any conflict or even scattered and sustainably access space only then will we be able to realize the full potential of that. And the time to act is now we cannot wait a year from now. We cannot wait for a decade when the problem is staring us in the face.",
