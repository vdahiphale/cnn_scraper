They've been farther from the Earth than any human since the Apollo astronauts more than 50 years ago. They walked in space, advanced the technology, and now, returned home safely.I'm joined live now by Daniel Dumbacher, CEO of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, you know, from where I was watching, it seemed like a picture- perfect re-entry and splashdown.

When you talk to American officials, they do say they still have some concerns about taking this step. Some of the concerns are practical. You heard this from the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, who said that a number of high value Russian targets have already been moved out of range of these missiles. You also hear concerns about escalation, and certainly, that has been at the front of President Biden's mind every time a new capability comes on the table when it comes to Ukraine. And certainly, we have heard the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ratcheting up his rhetoric, saying that if President Biden takes this step, it would mean that Russia is directly at war with NATO.

He was asked at the debate last week whether he would support Ukraine, and he declined multiple times to say that he was committed to Ukrainian victory.

She's fighting for the middle-class and fighting for our freedoms. You know, we're not going back is what she's saying. And she's trying to position herself as a candidate of change in a very subtle way because she can't distance herself that much from the Biden administration. The Trump campaign is very different. He is a challenger, but he also was president for four years. But what he's done, instead of giving a rationale for his candidacy, he has told a story about why we should not elect Kamala Harris.

And you see how Kamala Harris is, again, trying to separate herself from President Biden, saying there's a lot -- understanding that people are hurting and there is still much more that needs to be done to bring that economic security or that economic freedom.

The effects tend to be short-term, very minor.And there's -- I'll give you a few reasons for that. One is we know most of the -- we know the presidential candidates. There's not much more we can learn about Donald Trump. So, Kamala Harris is a little different. She got into the campaign a little late. And you can see both candidates are trying to tell a story about -- an alternative story about Kamala Harris. Another reason is that these ads are targeted toward these persuadables. There are not many of these persuadables left. But to try to reach someone, to get someone to change their mind about a candidate, it takes someone six times to be able -- they'll have to watch an ad six times before they really process it and maybe change their thinking.

You know, I've said that that these ads don't really make a difference, but there is no candidate that's going to take a chance and start spending their money elsewhere. So, both candidates are spending this extremely high amount of dollars, and those messages are canceling each other out.And so, you might see a very effective ad by Harris, and then that viewer sees a very effective ad by Trump.

There are many people who are watching those ads that have already made up their mind.So, with social media, a campaign has the opportunity to target voters. So, they know -- based on the issues that they care about. So, if the -- and also, it is about mobilization, not necessarily about persuasion. So, the candidates have identified which voters have the greatest probability to vote for them and which ones have -- you know, are a little bit less enthusiastic. And these ads are meant to be able to get people excited or angry about the campaign based on an issue that they care about. So, you can get very targeted ads on just abortion, just on the economy, just on immigration. So, the key here is to make sure that the people that, you know, are going to vote for you are going to vote. They're going to tell a friend to go and vote and maybe help them get to the polls. And more importantly, they're going to donate money, which then could be used to buy more television ads. BRUNHUBER:  Yes, it sounds like it's a heck of a lot of money spent for very little gain. But as you say, the margins so thin might make the difference in the end. We'll have to leave it there.",
