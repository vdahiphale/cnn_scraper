And Barack Obama has forever been skeptical about Joe Biden's chances as a presidential candidate. He - part of the reason they picked him as vice president is they thought he would never run for president. Easy enough.In 2015 there was a moment in the summer there, after Beau Biden died, when Biden was thinking about getting into the race. And the way that Joe Biden remembers what happened, and he's written about this in his book, is that he says Barack Obama was not encouraging. Obama's sense of what happened in that conversation is different, notably, that he was just saying, focus on your grief. He was trying to say to Biden, this is going to be a really hard race. You sure you're up for it? Now, fast forward to right now. I talked to a number of people about this who said not only would it be complicated for all the other reasons for Obama to step in, but that if he said to Joe Biden, someone said to me, you should step aside, that Biden's reaction would basically be, well, Mr. President, you used that chip in 2015, and that's what got us Donald Trump. So, basically saying, your judgement on this that you may think is the thing to do is not the right thing to do. I think also the - it taps into a lot of frustration that a lot of Democrats have had of Barack Obama since he left office that he has really stepped away. Obama has a theory of why he's doing this, that it gets - let's the next generation come up, that it doesn't trigger Donald Trump as much, all of that. But Obama is not prone to getting involved here. And if people have looked - every time they've looked at him over the last couple of years, they say save us Barack Obama, his response has basically been, I'm going to stay right here for right now and not say anything.",

So, people say, step down Joe Biden, but they don't tell us then like, I'm going to fall - throw all my support behind Kamala Harris, or we should run an open primary. That, to me, is irresponsible.I also remember - look, I remember the day Beau Biden passed away. I was working at the White House at that time. I remember the day Donald Trump - I was in the Rose Garden the day Donald Trump won and President Obama told his whole team to like support the process. I was someone in - I was probably like a lone wolf, but I was someone in 2015 that wanted Joe Biden to run for president. And I appreciated the grief, but I thought he could beat Donald Trump. And then we saw what happened with Hillary Clinton losing. So, I understand - and I remember having conversations the day after Donald Trump lost in the West Wing and people who - they - they were - we weren't like super senior folks that we like next to the president that day, but people saying, wow, I wish Joe Biden had run. So, it is complicated. I think President Obama also realizes the weight he carries in the Democratic Party and doesn't take that lightly. So, he is being thoughtful because whether or not Joe Biden and him are best friends, he respects him as a colleague. He respects the role that Joe Biden played for him as vice president, as being the first black person ever elected to the highest office of the land. And so he - I think he is taking that with a great weight, which is why he wants - if he's going to say something, he's not going to say, here's step a and figure the rest out. He's going to lay a pathway.",
