CNN's KFILE investigation, a CNN KFILE investigation uncovering explosive online posts made by North Carolina's current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, the same Mark Robinson who is a close ally of Donald Trump's and also running to be the next governor of that state.The CNN investigation finding that Robinson posted on a porn site messaging board starting in 2008, describing himself at one point as, quote, black Nazi, even calling for slavery to be reinstated. And that is just some of the parts that we can at 7:00 in the morning. Robinson has denied making the posts. This morning, though, House Republicans are beginning to distance themselves from Robinson and there are calls for him to drop out of that governor's race in North Carolina. Robinson has made campaign appearances with Donald Trump. As I mentioned, he's a close ally. Trump has called Mark Robinson Martin Luther King on steroids. CNN's Daniel Strauss picks it up from there for us. Daniel, how is the Trump campaign responding, reacting to this investigation, to this reporting? DANIEL STRAUSS, CNN REPORTER:  This is definitely something that the Trump campaign did not have ready in their chamber. And Trump himself, as well as his allies and aides have been fairly quiet on this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. MARK ROBINSON (R-NC), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm not going to get into the minutiae of how somebody manufactured these salacious tabloid lies, but I can tell you this, there's been over $1 million spent on me through A.I. by a billionaire's son who's bound and determined to destroy me. The things that people can do with the internet now is incredible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The question is, how will Donald Trump respond when he actually does say something about it.But speaking of Donald Trump, he was speaking at an event opposing anti-Semitism yesterday, and in his comments, essentially said that, at least in part, he would blame Jewish voters if he loses this race.

She had for this administration been deploying across the country very quickly to respond to issues of consequence or news of day. Remember, she did it with Tennessee, today with Florida, and she also did in Arizona where she coined the term Trump abortion ban. So, today, what we're going to see from the vice president is what we saw before, is her telling her team she needed to be here to respond to this report. And one of the families that was included in this report, a woman who died of what they said was a treatable infection due to delays in care, was in the crowd yesterday during the vice president's event with Oprah.

Israel's alleged history with black ops planting explosives in devices is extensive.Back in 1972, after Palestinian militants killed 11 Israelis at the Munich Olympics, Israel launched what is known as Operation Wrath of God to track down those responsible. Eventually, operatives allegedly linked to Israeli intelligence broke into the home of the PLO representative in Paris and planted a bomb in his phone. It was detonated remotely when he picked it up for an interview with someone posing as an Italian journalist. And then, in 1996, Hamas chief bomb maker was killed after his cell phone exploded. And since 2010, five Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed in foreign-linked assassinations, the latest one in 2020, when Iran's chief nuclear scientist was killed. Iranian officials said a remote controlled machine gun had been set up inside a car equipped with A.I. and facial recognition. It detected the scientist, opened fire, and then the car self-destructed by exploding. John?",

That's some places like schools, government buildings and others.Now, the governor has said a lot of these have been hoaxes, but the mayor also said some of these threats have been personally to leadership in the community. And regardless of all of it, it's had very real effects on the ground. It has led to actually students being evacuated, people being evacuated from city buildings as well, an overall feeling of unsafe -- of uneasiness, I think, is probably the word. And in one school, for example, the mayor said roughly 200 out of 500 kids were absent because of security concerns. So, that just sort of gives you an idea of the dynamic we're dealing with here. One Haitian activist who's lived there for a long time told my team that Haitians are trying to make themselves less seen right now out of concerns for potential conflict or even their safety in some cases. And I want to step back for people, too, because, look, a lot of what we've talked about has been in the aftermath of the presidential debate, understandable, but some of these tensions go way beyond that, because this is a community according to the 2020 census had around 60,000 people, a little bit under. The best estimates right now, between 12,000 and 15,000 immigrants in the Springfield area, a lot of them Haitian here. And what that's led to is a lot of real tensions on the housing situation. The city manager said we need more. We just don't have enough with what we've got right now.",
