      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, global markets plunge Japanese stocks,suffering their biggest-ever day loss, while U.S. stocks look to claw back losses after an earlier drop, we'll find out whether the fears of a U.S. recession are justified. Then hundreds of arrests as violent protests rock the U.K. Far-right misinformation sparking clashes with police. We'll be live in Rotherham with the latest. And countries across the Middle East brace themselves as Iran says, it must punish Israel in retaliation for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. That and much more ahead this hour. But first, this evening, we start with stock markets and particularly U.S. stock markets are down sharply for the day after what has been, I think it's fair to say a pretty tumultuous morning on Wall Street. There have eased somewhat still down, red arrows right across the board. I mean, the Dow opened out more than about 1,000 points low, while you can see that had disease, we're now almost 2.5 percent. Both the tech -- the tech heavy Nasdaq and the S&amp;P were also in a nose-dive. So, up from the steep loss we've had earlier, but still very much deep in the red. If we have a look at where it all started in the day, and that started in Asia, particularly in Japan, stocks suffering their biggest daily, biggest daily point loss in fact. Twelve, but just over 12 percent lower, the Nikkei, 225 index, closing that sharply lower, tumbling comes as global markets fear the U.S. could enter a recession started in Asia. And when all around the world, including Europe, then to the United States, tracking this story from all angles, of course, is Clare Duffy in New York. First, I want to go to Richard Quest, and Richard, you and I were supposed to talk about this on Friday, of course, and then we had some breaking news. But it goes back to Friday, doesn't it, Richard? Because it was one data point. Just explain what's going on? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  So, the data point to which you refer was a number from the jobs that showed only about 115,000 jobs created in the U.S. during the last month. And that was lower-than- expected, not dramatically, but it did show, Isa, that the U.S. economy is slowing down. It showed that 11 interest rate hikes over the last two years has finally taken its toll. The economy is slowing down, the lagging indicator of unemployment is now starting to show more unemployment 4.1 percent to 4.3 percent, fewer jobs being created. And in many ways, this is exactly what you would expect if you raise interest rates to kill inflation, which is what they've done very successfully, eventually it will hit the job market. And so, the test now, has the Fed got there too late? Can they cut rates to keep growth and to avoid a recession, the so-called soft landing, or are you going to bump right down into recession because they've left it too little, too late.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa, I mean, look, these high flying tech stocks had been fueling markets for the past few months. Andspecifically, the excitement and the hype around official intelligence. Tech giants have been promising that  Artificial Intelligence is going to fuel the next industrial revolution. And that has justified the tens of billions of dollars they've been spending on A.I. infrastructure in the past few months. So, heading into tech earnings season, which was the past two weeks, investors had really high expectations. They were hoping they would start to see some revenue gains from that A.I. spending, but that's not what happened on the whole. We saw really mixed results, in some cases, lower margins, in some cases, weak expectations for the current quarter. And it was kind of a record- scratch moment for investors who said, wait a minute, when is anybody going to start earning money from these A.I. investments? And the answer really is that it's going to take longer than many people thought. For example, Microsoft CFO said they're expecting to start to see monetization from their A.I. technology over the next 15 years and beyond. Meta said similar things during its earnings -- during its earnings call. And that time horizon really is uncomfortable for investors. One analyst, Gill Laureate(ph) told me that, that 10 to 15-year time horizon for returns is more like a venture investment than a public company investments. So, I won't be surprised if we start to see some of these tech names pull back a bit on that A.I. spending, especially amid this broader economic uncertainty. Isa.",

It killed many of the Hamas leaders. Hamas is still there. It assassinated the leaders of Hezbollah, Mughniyeh, in 2008. Hezbollah is still there, stronger. It -- the Americans took out Qasem Soleimani in an extrajudicial killing. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Supreme Commander. Iran is still strong. So, these actions do not shift the strategic equation or the military equation, but they can sap morale and they can generate a response. And the question here is, do either Israel or the U.S. have a strategy that goes beyond the military? Now, Netanyahu shows no interest in politics or diplomacy. Does the Biden administration show an interest in those things? Because if the signal Iran is receiving is that Israel continues to have a green light to do anything, then Iran may draw the conclusion, and Hezbollah may draw the conclusion that this is going to end in a regional war, so we might as well set out our terms. There is quite a consensus, Isa, as you know, because you follow this closely, that the escalatory actor, the unpredictable, dangerous actor, is not primarily Iran and the Axis of Resistance, it is primarily Benjamin Netanyahu and the axis of Zionist extremism, and I think it's correct to call it that. The U.S. has to decide whether it's aligning with that. Arab states have to make that decision or whether they're going to wind this down. That's going to be decisive.",

He was less than convincing in the heats and in the semifinal. And in the final, he had to come from behind, storming to the finish and winning in a photo finish. And it was so close that none of the finalists knew the result until it was confirmed on the big screen. Lyles taking gold ahead of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson. Another American, Fred Kerley, took bronze. The Olympics are now over for another American star, Simone Biles, signing off in style. She won silver in the floor routine on Monday, adding to the three gold medals that she'd already won in Paris after the mental health setback she suffered in Tokyo three years ago. It's been a hugely successful comeback for the 27-year-old. Her Olympic medal tally now stands at seven golds, two silvers, and two bronze. And the gymnastics floor champion, Rebeca Andrade, is also a really good -- feel-good story. The Brazilian has suffered three ACL tears in her career. This was her first gold, but fourth medal in Paris, and with another American, Jordan Chiles, taking bronze. We had three black athletes on the podium. That was a first for Olympic gymnastics.
