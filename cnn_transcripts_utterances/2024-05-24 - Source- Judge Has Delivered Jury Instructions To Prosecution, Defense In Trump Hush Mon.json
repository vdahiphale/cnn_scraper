New details about the jury instructions coming just days before prosecutors and defense attorneys deliver their summations and a jury decision could come as early as next week.Also tonight, it is not just flags, Justice Samuel Alito's history of speaking his mind about both cultural and political issues. Plus, a young American couple risked their lives to help those suffering in Haiti. Two U.S. missionaries killed in a gang attack. Their story tonight. Good evening to you. I'm Jim Sciutto in for Anderson this long, warm Memorial Day weekend. Breaking news now about the former president's hush money trial. Days ahead of Tuesday's make or break summations, a source tells CNN that Judge Juan Merchan has issued the final jury instructions to prosecutors and defense attorneys. This happened on Thursday. These instructions are a critical road map for the jury once deliberations begin. We will likely know more about them after the closing arguments on Tuesday. Those summations will attempt to weave compelling but competitive narratives after more than six weeks of documents, texts and emails. Plus, exhausting, sometimes contentious and occasionally sordid testimony about allegations of an affair, a payoff and a cover up. Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, was the key witness for the prosecution. He gave damning testimony that went to the heart of the 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. But the defense also sought to undermine his credibility, even getting him to admit that he stole from the Trump organization and raising questions about a conversation Cohen said he had with his former boss about the scheme. Ultimately, it will be the burden of the prosecution to prove and beyond a reasonable doubt what they claimed in their opening statements, quote, \"It was election fraud, pure and simple.\" Also, because of the current political timeline for the former president, we may hear the final decision of the jury about his face - fate weeks, perhaps days before the first presidential debate here on CNN. That happens exactly one month from Monday on June 27th. On Wednesday, Anderson spoke with former FBI Director James Comey about the case. Comey believes the jury may convict.

Also with us, former New York State Supreme Court Justice Jill Konviser, a longtime friend, it happens, of the trial judge, Juan Merchan.Judge, if I could begin with you. There's been a lot of talk about the jury instructions and how central they are to how the jury will decide this case because the judge has some influence on defining for them the terms in effect and giving them a road map for deciding guilt or innocence.

Because the wrangling has been over, as I understand it, as a layman about describing what's necessary to convict on the felony portion of this charge that, in effect, Trump knew what this was about and he did so with intent to, in effect, break federal election law.

      "sentences": "Yes. So in New York, falsifying business records can be either a misdemeanor or a felony. You have to intentionally cook the books, if you will, right? It's not a mistake. You didn't make a mistake.And if you just do that, that's a misdemeanor. What bumps it up to a felony is if you also had the intention to either do so to cook the books in a way that committed another crime or concealed another crime. And that's the theory that the prosecution is using in this case. They're saying, yes, they falsify the business records by calling it a legal expense when it was a reimbursement for a hush money payment. And they structured the payment over time and they tripled - essentially tripled the reimbursement amount so that it made it look like it was income instead of a repayment of hush money. So that's what they're going to charge the jury on and one of the questions that the judge resolved in the jury charge was the jury doesn't even have to unanimously agree on which crime they think the defendant intended on committing. It could be state election fraud. It could be federal election fraud. It could be tax fraud. SCIUTTO: Temidayo, the timing is interesting here because the judge, in effect, gave the jury a break and said, I'm not going to, you know, we're not going to give closing arguments before the holiday weekend. You're not going to start deliberating before the holiday weekend. But they've heard a lot of testimony. They've seen a lot of evidence. Their minds are going to be going over the weekend. How does that affect their thinking and how might that affect the deliberations once they do begin? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, I don't think it affects it that much. I mean, they've had a long trial. They've been at this for four or five weeks now. And this entire time, they haven't been allowed to talk to anyone about it and that includes each other. So this whole process, they've really bit (ph) in their own heads and thinking about the evidence. So to the extent it has any impact, I think the last view they had of the case was the - you know, the failed attempt of the Trump defense to put up some witnesses to have any real impact. I mean, you know, they put up Michael Cohen's former lawyer and he really got destroyed in cross-examination. So to the extent that there's a remnants of memory there, it's going to be that. But I think overall, they really are thinking about the broad entire case that they've been looking at for so many weeks. And I think, you know, when they get in the next week, that's the first time they get to speak about it. And they're going to be bursting to really unpack the evidence and get and dive into it. So the - I wouldn't put too much weight on that. It's when they come in, they get that jury charge, they sit in that room and they get to finally exhale and talk about this. That's when it's going to get interesting.",

They're going to be going over all of the jury charges, trying to explain that to the other jurors. Again, I'm a lawyer. I'm a little long winded. I like to explain and legally nerd out frequently.

It's not going to be immediate sentencing. But I think it does change the game for the former president. I mean, it's one thing to be charged with felony. So nothing has to be walking around as a convicted felon. And to the extent that he is - you know, he's trying to win the presidency, but he's also going to be thinking about one day Judge Merchan is going to be deciding, does he go to prison. So as, you know, he's - for this last few months, been undercutting, you know, the gag order, not obeying the judge, attacking witnesses, if that kind of disobeying of the law continues after he's convicted, those are the kinds of things Judge Merchan is going to be thinking about for possible sentencing here. He's going to be thinking about, does this defendant need to go into prison to learn his lesson here or is he someone who's - as now learned to respect the law. So I think that is what I would be concerned about if I were the former president, that his behavior suggests that a judge will find the prison time here is really necessary and not something less.",

He is treated differently than everybody else, just not in the way he claims. So I think for him, it is particularly tricky because he is guarded by the Secret Service.

Its history dates back to the Revolutionary War, but more recently, it's become a symbol for supporters of the former president.The Times also reported an upside down American flag was seen at the Alito home after the January 6th riots.

Alito emerged as the court's most pointed conservative voice after the 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. And he became a full-fledged hero to the conservative right with his 2022 opinion that struck down guaranteed abortion access nationwide. \"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,\" Alito wrote for the court's majority. \"Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\" Alito's critics say the January 6th connected flags that flew over two of the justice's properties should disqualify him from voting on the related cases before the Supreme Court. Those include an immunity case which could clear Trump of any criminal liability related to the attack on the Capitol. But Alito may have already tipped his hand on Trump's immunity claim.

So amid the never ending speculation about whom Donald Trump will choose as his running mate, there is news that a somewhat unexpected strong contender has now emerged. That according to the New York Times, which reports that Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a staunchly conservative Harvard educated army veteran of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is now at or even near the top of the list. We caution, of course, that the former president is notoriously unpredictable, and the GOP convention is not until mid-July. Still, news of 47-year-old Cotton's prominent spot in the so-called veepstakes provides a sense of which qualities Trump is now prioritizing, at least for now. Joining me now is the reporter who broke this story, New York Times Political Correspondent Michael Bender. So, Michael, I mean, the thing about Senator Cotton, while certainly not out of the blue, I mean, quite a prominent in public Republican voice, but he's hawkish, he's socially conservative, he's a white male from Arkansas, which are not demographics that the former president needs help with. So why is Cotton such a strong contender?",
