You see some of that footage there, fighting raging on the ground.CNN has also learned that Blinken, President Biden and his top advisers are warning Israel that the human suffering in Gaza is eroding public support for the war, and the outcry for a ceasefire could reach a tipping point. The Israeli military says its troops have completely surrounded Gaza City. This is some of the latest video, just in this morning from those ground operations. Casualties are rising on both sides.

Jim, with the secretary of state back on the ground, clearly the ground operation advancing at a level I think some Israelis would say is faster than expected, this is a huge moment. What are the stakes today? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: I think you could call this a mission of moderation from the U.S. secretary of state, as you said, meeting with Israeli political leaders Benjamin Netanyahu but also the war cabinet. Part of the message is -- and and he said this before he took off from the states -- encouraging Israel to take steps to protect civilians in Gaza as U.S. concern grows about the fate of civilians there, particularly with some of the air strikes we've seen this week, including on the Jabalya refugee camp where Israeli forces targeted a Hamas leader, but many civilians died in the attack, as well. In addition to the message he's delivering here, he's going to follow this trip with a visit to Amman. Remember, President Biden, in his initial visit to the Middle East after October 7th, was meant to go to Amman, meet with Arab leaders after his stop here in Israel. That trip was cancelled following the attack on the hospital in Gaza, initially blamed on Israel. Of course, U.S. intel has since assessed that was a Palestinian rocket. Regardless, we now have the U.S. secretary of state, the top diplomat, going to Amman to meet with Jordanian leaders and others in an attempt to bring them on board to some degree for a way forward. And the concern not just about Israeli military activity in Gaza, but efforts to prevent this war from expanding to the Northern front here where we are, facing Lebanon and Syria, as well as the attacks we're seeing coming from as far afield as Yemen, the Houthi-backed rebels there.",

That is going to be a key part of his message here, because the administration believes that it is going to get increasingly difficult for Israel to continue prosecuting this war as long as the images keep emerging of children and women being pulled from the rubble of these air strikes. And so that's going to be a key priority here. But another one, of course, is going to be getting sustained aid into Gaza. He said that there are about 50 to 60 trucks of aid per day going into the Gaza Strip, but he wants to see that get up to 100, if not more, and so that sustained aid is going to be key. But then, a third priority for him is going to be the day two question. What happens if and when Israel manages to degrade Hamas to the point where they no longer govern the Gaza Strip? Who then can be responsible for governing this very large population of Palestinians? So that is something that he is going to be discussing, because while many people say it is premature at this point to talk about what comes after this military operation ends, the administration does not want to see Israel becoming occupying force inside Gaza. And so the question then becomes, who can take that on? So that's going to be part of his discussions. And then in relation to that when he visits the Jordanians, he wants to reassure them that Palestinians are not going to be expelled en masse from Gaza, because that is not something that the Jordanians or other regional partners want to see either, Phil.",
