It's Monday, June the 17th, 9 a.m. here in London, 1 a.m. in California, where a massive fire is burning in Los Angeles County.The Post fire has scorched more than 14,000 acres. That's nearly 6,000 hectares. Authorities say it's only 2 percent contained so far, with high wind gusts and very dry air making it difficult for firefighters to contain it. The National Weather Service is warning these conditions could potentially fuel the flames, and a red flag warning is in place until this afternoon. The wildfire, which began on Saturday, has forced hundreds of people to evacuate the area. Authorities say the cause of the blaze is under investigation. CNN's Camila Bernal has been following the developments and has more from California. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Firefighters are working around the clock to try to gain containment on this fire. So what you're seeing here behind me at the moment is actually a controlled burn. What firefighters on the ground are trying to do is keep the flames from spreading to areas where you're seeing that green vegetation. And so they are working here on the ground and also communicating with pilots in the air to then come and do water drops. We've seen consistent water drops throughout the day and firefighters saying that this is actually a very difficult fire because of a number of things. The high temperatures, the low humidity and the wind. The wind is a huge concern. On Sunday, wind gusts of 45 to 55 miles per hour throughout the day. And it is the evening that is most concerning, the overnight hours. The National Weather Service saying wind gusts of 60 to 70 miles an hour. Take a listen to what the Forest Service is saying about all of this. FLEMMING BERTELSEN, U.S. FOREST SERVICE: Every one of us is concerned with the wind. That's the single most driving factor of this fire. It does -- it burns fairly frequently along this corridor, which keeps it from there being a very large brush component. However, now we have more light flashy fuels so the fire can move quickly. And then when the wind lines up with the drainages and starts ripping right through them, it's definitely a concern. So that's what we're looking at. Hopefully these winds that are forecasted tonight don't materialize to the extent they're supposed to, which is 60 miles an hour. And maybe tomorrow will be a more calm day.",

And we've seen that the polls haven't been very good for Biden with this wide group of different people that he has to attract, not just young voters, Hispanic voters, Black voters. Biden has been hemorrhaging support amongst African- American voters, and Trump is trying to capitalize on that.Now, what some of the polls also reveal, though, is Trump is not able to grab a lot of those voters because many of them have said, maybe we won't vote or we're going to vote for a third-party candidate. A recent poll looking at the states of Michigan and Pennsylvania were showing that, though Biden is losing a lot of support and only has about 60 percent favorability rating among African-American voters there, Trump isn't making huge gains. And so it's a bit of a mixed picture there. [04:10:00] And you also have the recent conviction, which Trump claimed would appeal to African-American voters, and the majority of them found this really offensive. And you had two-thirds of those same voters in those two swing states that said they were less likely to vote for him because of his conviction. So while he may be chipping away a little bit at Biden's huge lead that he had in 2020, it's not really a sizable amount of voters that will help Trump.

But there's a lot on the line for Biden. And similarly to his really well-done State of the Union address, where he was able to at least quiet concerns about his age and robustness, he can't have a bad debate. He's going to have to appear energized and quick on his feet. I know the way Trump will perform it will be the same way he always does.

There could be other Supreme Court justices that will overturn even further and roll back even further reproductive rights and possibly the rights of the LGBTQ plus community. And it's not just that, that the Supreme Court justices, it's that Trump will weaponize the justice system in his favor and will appoint more just federal judges. He appointed almost as many federal judges in four years as Obama did in eight years. So that's going to be the key talking point for the Democrats, that this is really the most important election in spite of the fact that no one's particularly energized because you have, you know, the same matchup as last year.

But certainly ever since this government came into effect, what it has done is after every militant attack, for example, in the West Bank against Israeli settlers, for example, or any terrorist attack that has taken place, is that it has kind of responded by giving approvals to more settlements.Now, usually this is just additional dwellings in existing settlements, but it has also made moves to legitimize so-called outposts, which were not accepted by the Israeli state as settlements. So certainly this is something that Israel is considering. And as I say, it would be, you know, in keeping with this government's previous announcements, which is that every time there is some kind of attack or against Israel from the West Bank in particular, or it feels under threat, for example, with the recognition of a Palestinian state by countries such as Ireland that we had just the other week, then its kind of response is to, you know, push through more settlement building in the occupied West Bank -- Max.",

Indeed, one of the U.N. agencies said as much, but certainly there doesn't seem to have been made any difference thus far. In terms of the actual announcement, it's a very curious situation, isn't it?Because what we had was a statement from the Israeli military saying that this tactical pause, this came out on Sunday morning, saying this tactical pause came into effect on Saturday and would remain in place until further notice from 8:00 in the morning until 7 p.m. local time. That was swiftly followed by a clarification saying that this doesn't mean that there'll be a cessation of hostilities in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, particularly in Rafah, where Israel says it is going after the last redoubt of Hamas, the last remaining battalions of the militant group, something it needs to do in order to destroy the militant group's governance and military capabilities. Now, we, as you said in the introduction, Max, we understand that Netanyahu says that he didn't know about this, that he only learned about it from media reports. Israeli media saying that the same thing goes for Yoav Galant, the defense minister. So effectively, you have the two people that make up the war cabinet now that Benny Gantz has gone, the two people that make up the war cabinet and are therefore in charge of the war in the Gaza, apparently being unaware of something that is apparently as significant as this tactical pause. But I think what it does also do, Max, is it kind of shows the competing pressures that Netanyahu is under on the one hand from the United States to get as much aid into the Gaza Strip as possible, and on the other from the far-right ministers in his governing coalition who don't want him to make any concessions to the Palestinians because it says that these are concessions, rewards effectively, for Hamas. I would liken this a little bit to President Biden's ceasefire plan, which he announced about three weeks ago, which he said that Israel had signed off of. No sooner had President Biden put out that statement and on the Jewish Sabbath, which is very rare, the prime minister's office putting out a statement almost not denying the existence of this plan or Israel or his approval of it, but clarifying that this doesn't preclude Israel or Israel will continue to fight Hamas in the Gaza Strip so long as it has yet to achieve its objectives of destroying Hamas's military and governance capabilities, preventing the Gaza Strip continuing to be a threat, and also getting all of those hostages home. So I'd liken it to that situation, where Netanyahu isn't necessarily denying -- well, we understand that he's denying, but it may be that he was aware of it, but at the same time felt the need for this clarification so as to avoid alienating the far-right ministers in his government -- Max.",
