So we heard that the U.S. military in the early hours of Tuesday morning had actually targeted for anti-ship missiles that were actually on the launching pad. It was an imminent threat. Were being told by the U.S. military and they took those out.But then just several hours later, we saw that they did manage to hit a Greek owned motor flagship. Although that was able to keep sailing and it had no injuries, but the damage that the Houthis are doing to this area, to the commercial shipping industry is significant. Now, we heard from the U.S. military that they believe, remember back on Thursday overnight into Friday, there were more than 60 targets hit by the U.S. and U.K. Navy. They think they destroyed less than a third of the weapon capabilities of the Houthis, which just shows how significant the capabilities of this group are. They are being restocked and refunded by Iran and certainly they would have their weapons capabilities dispersed across a large area of Houthi- controlled territory in Yemen. So, certainly, there is an expectation that this has a long way to go -- Kasie.",

They are always the intermediate -- the mediator here, along with Egypt, of course as well. But Qatar has cut this deal where those hostages will get the medication they need. But in return, medicine will be allowed into Gaza for Palestinians as well. So I think that's what's happened here.

I think when -- you know, discussions of a ceasefire, the defense minister of Israel has ruled out a ceasefire.What they really looking is looking at the south of Gaza and continuing the pressure. They're reaching a deal according to, you know, a lot of people in the Israeli government is really about putting pressure on Gaza as opposed to taking it off. So, we're looking towards a ceasefire, but it's not going to happen now. I don't think if you listen to the latest soundings we're really getting from the Israeli government.
