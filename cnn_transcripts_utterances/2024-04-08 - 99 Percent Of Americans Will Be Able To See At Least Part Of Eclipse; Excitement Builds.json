But they're starting to filter in and sit down in the stands.Just beneath me there's going to be some race cars going around. And just some things getting people excited because we're still a little ways away from the eclipse starting. And, you know, Boris and Brianna, I was speaking with an astrophysicist recently about why total solar eclipses has really -- have really captivated everybody's attention and imagination. And he described it as the solar system, the galaxy, the universe, really just falling right down onto your lap. That's the moment when you realize like, whoa. I am just a very small human in a very big universe. And there's really nothing else quite like it. Here at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, there is also dozens of NASA astronauts. And you know, these are people who have actually been to space, right? They have seen some of the coolest sites that -- that so few humans have ever actually seen. And yet, a total solar eclipse is still for them at the top of many of their bucket lists. And not just any total solar eclipse guys, but this one. And here are just two reasons why this total solar eclipse is just so exciting. One, the duration of totality twice as long as what it was during the last total solar eclipse back in 2017. And then the other really cool thing is that the sun is almost reaching its peak cycle of activity. It's very peak of when those solar flares and coronal mass ejections would be taking place. And so, when we see the moon totally cover the sun at about 3:06 pm eastern time. Boris and Brianna, we could get a much more active sun than what we saw in 2017. So, and fingers crossed Boris and Brianna, so far, the web is looking pretty good.",

So, they're going to be paying a lot of attention to how the animals react. Back in 2017 in South Carolina, giraffes galloped other animals, you know, either tried to put themselves to sleep is the real questions. That's exactly how a lot of these animals reacted. There's not a lot of research that has been able to be done on all of this. That's why they're going to be crowdsourcing a lot. A lot of the guests here at the Dallas Zoo today are getting this form where they can write down observations and pass it along to the experts.

Now we talked about this three minutes of totality. That is only along the middle part of the line. You know, in hurricane season, we say don't look at the line, look at the cone. If you are on the very edge of the cone, your totality may only be 10 seconds. Your moon is going to go by and then all of a sudden, you're going to get a diamond ring. You're going to get totality. And that diamond ring could come back very, very quickly. Prepare for that if you are not near the middle because everybody's expecting two to three minutes. And that's just not the way this happens.

If you're still there four or five o'clock this afternoon because things are going to go bump in the night. There's going to be large hail. There may even be a random tornado or two.
