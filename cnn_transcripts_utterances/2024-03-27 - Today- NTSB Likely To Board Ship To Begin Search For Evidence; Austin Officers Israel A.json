      "sentences": "Right. Well, they're going to be looking at the safety record of the ship, of its crew, of its operating company, which is based out of Singapore.The ship in question is the Dali. It's a -- it's a container ship. We've been looking at ships like it steaming through this channel all day. They are just massive, and the Dali is no exception. It's around 300 meters -- just under 1,000 feet long. I mean, that's three football fields. And it's not even considered one of the biggest of these kinds of ships that the world's trade relies so heavily upon. It can carry up to 10,000 containers but was carrying a cargo of about more than 4,700 containers at the time of that deadly collision in Baltimore. The operating company is called Synergy Marine and it's based out of Singapore. The Singaporean maritime transport authorities -- they say that the ship's crew -- 22 Indian nationals who were on board and who were all OK after the collision. They did report a problem with propulsion on board that vessel before it hit the bridge in Baltimore. Now, the ship itself -- since it was constructed in 2015, Kasie, it's been inspected dozens of times, according to marine industry statistics that we've looked at. In September of last year, the U.S. Coast Guard looked at it and found no problems with it. But in June of 2023, officials in Chile briefly held the vessel, saying that there were problems with some of its gauges and also having to do with its propulsion system. So that may be a link that investigators will have to look at as part of this investigation. I want to add one final detail. Just last month, not far from where we are, in the Pearl River that Hong Kong and this harbor leads to, in the city of Guangzhou -- a Chinese city -- there was a different ship- bridge disaster -- a deadly one where a Chinese cargo ship slammed into a bridge in the city of Guangzhou. At least five people died. Part of that bridge collapsed and cars -- vehicles were plunging off the edges of that bridge. Perhaps a coincidence that two deadly disasters like this happened only just about a month apart, but also maybe something that authorities around the world have to take a look at. The size of these ships -- they are just gargantuan and something that certainly, the Francis Scott Key Bridge was not built for back in the '70s -- Kasie.",

It is not a large area. And so, if there is a major Israeli military operation there, the Americans are concerned that you will see a skyrocketing death toll. Already, the death toll in Gaza from 173 days of war is more than 32,400. And we heard Lloyd Austin, the U.S. Defense secretary, saying that the civilian casualties in Gaza is far too high and the amount of aid getting into Gaza is far too low. Now, if there is going to be a military operation in Gaza the question is how do you get all of those people -- the 1.5 million people who have taken refuge there out of the way? And there really isn't much anywhere they can go. Much of Gaza has been destroyed. If they go to the north, where are they going to stay?

And check out the reflexes, though, of Angels third base coach Eric Young. A foul ball coming his way there at the bottom of the seventh and the 56-year-old hitting the deck there. Some nice reflexes from Eric Young. All right. And finally, the NFL completely revamping how kickoffs are going to look next season. So the kicker is still going to kick from that 35-yard line, but the other 10 players are going to line up on the opposite 40-yard line just five yards away from the receiving team. Now, none of those players can move until the ball hits the ground or the returner catches it. [05:55:00] And kickers -- they are now going to have to kick that ball into what's being called the landing zone between the 20-yard line and endzone. Because they can't just blast it to the endzone anymore because a touchback is going to result in the ball being placed at the 35-yard line. This new rule is hopefully going to help reduce violent collisions that result in concussions. And also kickoffs -- Kasie, they're not going to be throwaway plays anymore like they were last year. I mean, they returned only about 22 percent of the time last season, which is record lows. A boring play as they all kick off. It's going to be a touchback. Hopefully, that won't be the case anymore.
