Then, fierce mount of a wider war in the Middle East. But what are the risks? Regional and security experts Kim Ghattas and Colin Clarke join me. Also, ahead, as Republican candidates make their case in Iowa, former GOP strategist Sarah Longwell breaks down the campaign trends so far. And, almost three years on, from January 6th, how support for political violence has shifted in America. Walter Isaacson speaks to Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. This weekend will mark three months since Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7th. The horrors of that day, when at least 1,200 Israelis were killed, are still reverberating around the world. And the Israeli military response is intensifying in Central and Southern Gaza, where more than 22,000 people have now been killed, according to the Hamas controlled health ministry there. Meanwhile, a painful ordeal continues for the families of more than 130 people still thought to be held hostage in Gaza. Prospects of another deal between Israel and Hamas to pause fighting are uncertain despite a temporary truce in November, which saw the release of 105 hostages. Among those released was 34-year-old Doron Katz Asher and her young daughters. Doron says she endured psychological warfare in captivity, as she told me when I sat down with her earlier this week in Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I don't have enough tears.GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Nearly six weeks ago, Doron Asher and her two young daughters returned home after spending roughly 50 days held captive in Gaza. ASHER (through translator):  The first thing that they did was to go outside to feel the wind on their skin and how good it feels because we were never outside. We didn't see daylight that entire time. GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Perhaps not yet fully able to process what happened, she exudes remarkable resilience. ASHER (through translator):  While we were hostages, all of my energy was dedicated to the girls because if I were to get lost in grief there would be no one to take care of them. So, I was acting on autopilot. I was building walls around me and I'm still on autopilot. GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  The three were visiting Doron's mother for the weekend at Kibbutz Nir Oz where the girls loved to play. That's five-year- old Raz in the pink dress on the right, while 3-year-old Aviv holds onto her stuffed animal. This was their last photo taken before Hamas terrorists rampaged through the Kibbutz killing 48 residents, including their uncle, Ravid. ASHER (through translator):  We woke up to the sound of sirens and were inside the shelter. And then rumors started to come in the terrorists had invaded the Kibbutz. GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  They hid in the safe room along with Doron's mother and her partner, 79-year-old Gadi Moses -- a man the girls called Saba -- grandfather in Hebrew. ASHER (through translator):  He tries to speak with them in Arabic to give them money to try to save himself. And then after a few minutes there was silence and we understood that they took him with them. GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Eventually, another group of terrorists would arrive -- this time taking all four women with them to Gaza. Only three would survive. ASHER (through translator):  They have led us to the fence near the Kibbutz, and then they put us on a tractor with other Israeli hostages. And on the way there, there was shooting going on. That's how my mother was murdered. I was hurt in the back and Aviv, my youngest, was hurt in the leg. GOLODRYGA (on camera):  Once you got into Gaza, what happened? ASHER (through translator):  We got into our hiding place -- an apartment that belonged to a family. We were inside the room without the ability to get out -- of course, closed door, closed window. And after 16 days, they relocated us to another place -- a so-called hospital.",

We waited a long time for the Red Cross, and we were very scared because we didn't know what was going on. No one gave us any info. Once the Red Cross vehicles had arrived, thousands of Gazans, thousands, children, elderly, everyone came in and started to climb up on the cars, and being on the cars. I was holding my girls, and I was scared of a lynch mob. And this was the first time that Raz said to me after a month and a half of me protecting her, mommy, I'm scared. They absolutely put on a show to dress me up in nice clothes and shoes before I was released when my girls and I were barefoot for 50 days and we were cold because we were wearing short sleeves in November. It's one big show. GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Today, the girls are back in kindergarten, and with family therapy for the most part, are readjusting well. ASHER (through translator):  There was one day that they saw a tractor here, and they asked if the evil men are here. And I had to tell them, no, the tractor doesn't belong to the evil men. The evil men are in jail. GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  And while they mourn their grandmother, Doron says the healing cannot really begin until all of the remaining hostages are released, including Gadi. ASHER (through translator):  Yes, absolutely. The world has to understand the reality that the hostages are in. They're not being treated as human beings. They don't give them medication. There's barely any food. Taking a shower is not something that's happening. We came back sick because of the poor hygiene. I don't want to think of how they are treating men there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what would that mean for the region? Joining me to discuss is Middle East expert and contributing writer for The Atlantic, Kim Ghattas, from Beirut. And from Pittsburgh, director of research at the Soufan Group, a collection of security experts, Colin Clarke. Welcome both of you. Kim, let me begin with you because it was notable that for the first time, we heard of at least some plan from the present government in Israel of what a post-war Gaza would look like, and that is from the defense minister, Yoav Gallant. He said Gaza's post-war governance should include the involvement of four parties. That is Israel, the Palestinians, Egypt, and a multinational force, but no Israeli civilian presence should be there. What do you make of that plan? It is interesting that we haven't heard a similar one or any response yet from the prime minister. But what do you make of the plan of itself and its feasibility? KIM GHATTAS, AUTHOR, \"BLACK WAVE\" AND CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE ATLANTIC:  Bianna, thanks for having me. It's good to be on the show. I think there are lots of different plans being discussed. We've heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu. We've heard now from Yoav Gallant, it is the most detailed plan so far that does not include Israeli military -- or Israeli civilian control of Gaza. However, on the point of a multinational force led by the U.S. I think they'd have to check with the Biden administration. I don't think the White House is interested in having any physical role on the ground in Gaza. And certainly, I think that Arab countries are not interested in participating in a multinational force or participating and contributing to the reconstruction of Gaza unless it comes with a wider plan for a political solution and a political horizon, not only for Gaza, but for the Palestinian issue. And that's where you have the question of a two-state solution come in. And of course, still somewhere in the background simmering the idea of Saudi Israeli normalization, which cannot go forward, in my view, and the Saudis will have made that clear already, cannot continue, cannot resume unless it is part of the bigger regional picture. And of course, in the meantime, Bianna, as I'm speaking to you from Beirut, there is, of course, as you mentioned, the risk of further escalation before we even get to discuss what might happen in Gaza the day after.",

      "sentences": "Colin, there are so many things that come to mind about what should come first. I mean, even when you look at Gallant's plan that heunveiled, that he said that includes among those governing the Palestinians, he didn't say who among the Palestinians because Israel has not come out and endorsed. the P.A. governing in Gaza, and obviously they would not allow for Hamas to remain in government there. So, what is the likelihood that some sort of Palestinian government could be formed that could win the approval of the Palestinian people as well as the Israeli government, not to mention support from regional actors and the U.S.? COLIN CLARKE, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, THE SOUFAN GROUP AND AUTHOR, \"AFTER THE CALIPHATE\":  I think the odds of that are very small at the moment. And I think the Israelis in particular are at great risk of what we call mission creep of moving the goalposts continuously back. And that's been, you know, a problem from day one. It's been an extremely myopic strategy. The military approach has been put way above any kind of idea about a political or negotiated settlement, those two have been divorced and we're now only seeing bits and pieces. So, you know, we can go back to the basics of studying warfare and that's, you know, war is politics by other means. So, at the end of the day, unless there's a political settlement here and that's something that Netanyahu has bragged about denying the Palestinians for a long time, then we're really just going to end up being back in the same situation six, 12, 18 months from now and we'll be sliding into, you know, a situation that maybe starts to look a little bit like Israel and South Lebanon in 1982. They were there for 18 years and certainly didn't plan to be.",

They will not negotiate directly with the Israelis. But from the onset, pretty much within a week after the horrendous attack of October the 7th, it was clear that Hezbollah and Iran were not interested in an escalation, a full-on war that could involve Lebanon or potentially Iran. And so, they've calibrated their response very carefully. In some ways, Lebanon is already at war. There are daily clashes on the border. There are 60,000 Lebanese civilians who had to leave South Lebanon, and the clashes are intense, but this is a calibrated response, which allows Hezbollah to say that it is supporting the Palestinians, but not going all out because they have their own interests. And what I found interesting in Nasrallah's speech earlier this week is he said, if Israel wages war against Lebanon, our response will be without limits. In other words, an Israeli strike against a Hamas leader in the middle of Beirut, which is actually an extra judicial killing on an sovereign -- on another country's sovereign territory, he does not consider that war against Lebanon. So, they're looking every time to move their own red lines. And again, today, signaling very clearly that the points of contention along the border that Lebanon still considers are occupied by Israel can be negotiated, and those negotiations can only take place after the war in Gaza comes to an end. So, again, clear signaling that they're not interested in war, but missteps and miscalculations can happen. And so, this country is living with a lot of tension and fear about the day when something like that might get out of hand.",

Colin, you have the secretary of state making a fourthvisit to the region, really a whirlwind trip to many countries there in the region, landing in Turkey today with the focus on this war not expanding. Yet, each and every time we have seen the U.S. make any sort of attempt to keep that from happening, we see further action, whether it be in Iran, in Iraq, in the Red Sea by the Houthis and now, focusing on Northern Israel and tensions there with the Lebanese border.

It's a low boil war compared to where things could go. But I thought Kim had a really nice piece in \"The Financial Times\" a few weeks ago, where she said that the region has settled into the rhythm of war or something along those lines. And I think that's a really astute observation, because we're now seeing this from Gaza to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, there's no part of the region that's really unscathed from what's happening. And this was Qasem Soleimani's dream, right? Creating this, you know, axis of resistance that really didn't acknowledge the borders and the boundaries in the Middle East. So, I think the U.S. has a major role to play, not only on, you know, standing with the Israelis and advising and providing, you know, hard advice and sometimes advice that the Israelis don't want to hear and trying to prevent missteps and miscalculations, but also in providing that deterrent response that we've seen so far really is one of the few countries in the world that is able to marshal strength, the military hardware to do something about the status as well.",

And I think it's a sad state of affairs where we're almost relieved that the culprit was ISIS and not Israel. It's not the usual MO of Israel to go after targets like that, civilian targets in Iran. They've been very precise in their targeting before, although, of course, they don't admit to any of these strikes. But it's a sad state of affairs when the initial fear was, my goodness, this could be even a wider conflagration now between Israel and Iran. And then, there's some relief with, of course, a lot of sadness for the civilians in Iran who were killed, that it is only ISIS, if I may put it like this. But as Colin was pointing out, it's important to see that we are already in a sort of horizontal, low level intensity war across the region. You know, we should not be waiting for the conflagration. I don't see a conflagration on the border between Israel and Lebanon, not anytime soon. We'll have more of this, more attacks in the Red Sea, more clashes on the border between Israel and Lebanon, more strikes, Israeli strikes. against Syria, potentially. And I think to answer your question to Colin about what the United States should be doing, what the White House should be doing is push as much as it can possibly with its allies, with Israel, with the Saudis, with the Egyptians, with the Palestinians to get to the point where we can have a serious conversation about the day after and a serious conversation about a wider political horizon and solution for the Palestinians, which allows all of this tension to be diffused to some extent.",

We have to consider the second order effects of some of these, if you want to call them kind of micro battles or individual theaters. And I look at Iraq, most specifically, with the recent U.S. strike in Baghdad against Shia militia groups. The second order effective that could potentially be pressure on the Iraqi government to expel the United States, and if that does happen, a group like ISIS is bound to come back in some shape or form. And I think. The recent attack in Iran is indicative of what we might expect should the U.S. be forced to leave Iraq and to kind of give free reign to an Islamic state that's really hung around and is waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc in the region.",

Is his nomination all but secured at this point? And if so, given all of the headwinds that he is facing personally, why has he not lost support from the most of his base? SARAH LONGWELL, PUBLISHER, THE BULWARK, HOST, \"THE FOCUS GROUP\" AND HOST, \"DEFENDING DEMOCRACY TOGETHER\":  Yes. So, I do think his win is inevitable. He is dominating in every poll, both nationally and in the early states. For people like me who desperately want to see somebody beat Donald Trump and want to make the optimistic case, you could say, well, the lead is a little bit narrower for Donald Trump in some of these early states, but it is still 20 points in most cases or at least double digits. I'm not sure we've ever been in a primary situation where we've had somebody who is so dominant. I talked to voters every week. I just did a focus group in Iowa with two-time Trump voters, and they weren't even considering anybody else. There was one woman who was a little Nikki Haley curious, but for most of them, they took it as a fait accompli that Donald Trump was going to be the nominee. And I think it one of the reasons that he has maintained such a dominant lead is sort of two reasons. One is they like him, OK? They think he did a good job. They talk about what a good job he did on the economy. They like what he did on immigration. They like his stance on crime and they feel like he's a known quantity. The other problem is that, look, when I was doing focus groups a year ago, right after the 2022 midterms, there was an opening for somebody else besides Trump. There was sort of a decent chunk of the party that was sort of move on from Trump. And those people were very Ron DeSantis curious. But as they've gotten to know Ron DeSantis, they've decided that they don't like him. In this Iowa focus group, people talked about DeSantis has seeming like he's given up. That he's depressed. I mean, he's just -- he's a regular politician. He's wooden. And so, as a result. Basically, you can't beat something with nothing and Trump was something. He has a deep relationship with these voters. They voted for him multiple times. And so, these other candidates needed to come in and really give voters something that would make them turn their heads.

Now, for that to happen, it would have to defy everything I know about Republican voters, which is that they don't want a pre-Trump candidate. They view Nikki Haley -- see, voters say some -- the way voters talk about Nikki Haley is they say, I don't hate her, I like her OK, but they see her as establishment, as somebody representative of the old Republican Party, which they believe that they've moved past. And which they say, very specifically, I don't want to go back there. I want America first policies. I want Trump or candidates like him. And I think when they talk about somebody being a regular politician or establishment, the way they talk about Nikki Haley, for them, that means somebody that they can't trust. And so, I just have a hard time seeing a sea change in her favor, but that's the way it would have to happen. She'd have to really win New Hampshire or come in just right on Trump's heels.",

And as you quite -- as you say, the numbers are actually slightly higher in terms of raw numbers on the left than on the right. The difference is that on the left, the main leader of the left, Joe Biden, has been the opposite of Donald Trump. Rather than pour gasoline on a fire with political rhetoric, trying to stimulate violence or justify political violence, what's happening with President Biden is even for goals that are on the left, he has been trying to tamp down movement toward political violence and vectored into politics.",

One is mass sentiments for violence in the mainstream, the body politic. The second is leaders willing to stimulate and trigger that violence. On the right, we have both of those ingredients, and that's what's making things so dangerous on the right, and why we see so many instances of political violence, whether it's -- even against Congress, members of Congress, which are really oriented around their support for Donald Trump. That is, people on the left are being -- are receiving violence threats if they oppose Donald Trump and also, Republicans who oppose Donald Trump are being threatened with physical violence in members of Congress. We're not seeing that to the same degree on the left. And why is that? It's not because there's not violent sentiments, there's actually quite a bit of violent sentiments on the left, whether it's to oppose Donald Trump or support the restoration of abortion rights. But what we're seeing are -- political figures on the left are making active efforts. Joe Biden's speeches on Roe v. Wade are a key example of this. On June 22, 2022, that's when the Supreme Court overthrew Roe v. Wade, that Friday. Joe Biden, early that morning, gave a long speech. He was very opposed to what the Supreme Court did, but he has a big fat paragraph in that speech, not simply a one liner, that says directly that the left, his constituents should not act out violently. And he says this over and over again about why this would be wrong in so many ways. And instead, should vector that anger toward the ballot box and energy for voting.",

And so, what you, what you see is that they're -- and they gave statements, and many of them were proud of what they did, Walter. They weren't hiding. They were true believers. And what were they believing in? They were believing in Donald Trump's statements that the election was stolen. And number two, that they're doing this to save democracy. So, when their view, what was -- and this view is coming, not just from the media in general and Alex Jones, it's coming from statements from Trump. In fact, many of them are saying, I'm here because Trump called us here. I'm here because Trump told us to stop the steal. They're expressing it directly in terms of Trump told them to. Well, he is the sitting president of the United States. So, when he makes these statements, Walter, he's not simply has an audience of millions of people, he has the authority that comes with that and that mantle. And for many of these people, he is still the president of the United States, you see. So, that is why that -- it's not impossible for that to happen again, but it would take more of an orchestrated effort. But that's also why, Walter, it's important to see, we've learned a lot in the three years since January 6th. And it is -- it changes, I would say, the narrative that we had then about 90 degrees. The narrative that we had is not 100 percent wrong, it's just off enough that we're missing the core elements of the real dangers to democracy.",

He's clearly been the leader, but there have been a growing number of, you can call them mini-Trumps and so forth, who are coming right out of the Trump playbook. This has happened in other societies, Walter. This happens in other terrorist groups, by the way. I've been spent -- I spent 30 years studying terrorist groups around the world and violent societies around the world. Many people think, oh, if the leader would just go away, then everything would be fine. And the truth of the matter is that almost never happens. The truth of the matter is when the leader goes away in these violent movements, typically, you get a younger, more aggressive generation who've got to prove themselves, and they typically are proving themselves through violence. So, I think that there's a hope, I think, by many people that, oh, we just need to wait out Trump and -- or somehow Trump will just disappear for a variety of reasons and then everything will be simply fine. That's putting -- I think that's missing the forest through a very big tree of Trump. But I think it's missing the general landscape that we've now moved into.",
