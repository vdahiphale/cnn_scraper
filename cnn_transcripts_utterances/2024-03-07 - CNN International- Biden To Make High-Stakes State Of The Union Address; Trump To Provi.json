      "sentences": "So, Erica, this the very first time that crew members had been killed in any of these Houthi strikes, which is pretty remarkable to think that there have been some 45, approaching 50, attacks on commercial shipping vessels. And while there had been some injuries, no one has been killed at thus far until now. But surely, it was only a matter of time, because in those 45 attacks, many of them have been hits.Now, oftentimes, these ships are big enough that they're able to absorb some damage and continue sailing. Other times, though, they're not so lucky, as it happened with the Rubymar ship that was actually hit back in February, and for weeks it has been slowly sinking. We just got word over the weekend that it has officially now sunk, and it's also carrying thousands of pounds of fertilizer, creating an environmental problem now as well. The Filipino government says the two of the three victims in this attack were its citizens, as are two of those who were injured as well. This shouldn't be surprising given that Filipinos make up about one fifth of the global workforce of commercial shipping. These are crew members who are away from their families for months at a time. They are often paid extra, paid double off and to go to dangerous places, though that will be obviously little consolation for their families. Most container ships are now taking the long way around Africa, but this was a bulk container ship. Bulk container ships and tankers are usually still taking the Red Sea route. And the Houthis say that they had warned this ship to change course before they struck. These warnings often come before a hijacking attempt or before an attack. They say that they targeted it based on American ownership. But, a U.S. defense official says that this was not an American ship. It was a Barbados-flagged ship and owned by a Liberian company after having been sold from a previous American owner to the Liberians. The world of international shipping though is often quite opaque, quite confusing. Obviously, the Houthis are targeting British, American, any ships with links to Israel, obviously in an effort to pressure them to stop the war. But often, you have a different crewing company, a different company leasing the ship, and obviously a different ownership as well where the true beneficiaries are often quite opaque. You mentioned that the U.S. launching those two drone strikes just hours later, Erica, well, this has been a pattern that we've seen for months with the U.S. trying to degrade Houthi capability with strikes in Yemen. But, they still acknowledge that even months later, this is not something that's going to happen overnight. Maybe it may not happen overall at all, because they say that the Houthis are still very well equipped with very sophisticated weaponry, a big arsenal of sophisticated weaponry that is being supplied by Iran. And while, of course, many ships who are continuing to take this route are taking more security measures, many more are now carrying armed guards, that's not going to do much to stop an attack like this, an anti-ship ballistic missile. And even other security measures aren't going to do much to stop the attacks like we saw on the Galaxy Leader which was hijacked. And it's worth pointing out as well that, of course, the one in Gaza is not the only hostage crisis taking place in the Middle East right now, Erica. 25 crew members of the Galaxy Leader have now been held hostage in Yemen for coming up on four months.",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, I think it certainly brings home, one, the scale of this war. Odessa is nowhere near the frontlines but it's still regularly targeted, and two, the potential, I think more importantly in this case, the potential for the war to escalate suddenly, and without warning. Obviously, President Zelenskyy's proximity to this strike along with the Prime Minister of Greece, the head of state of a NATO country, raises those fears, even though as you say, neither of them were injured in this incident.And Russia claims that it hit its target, which it says was a hangar where Ukraine was preparing for the combat use of unmanned sea drones, essentially. So, that's what it says. It was targeting, I think it's possible we'll never know, whether or not it actually knew of President Zelenskyy along with the Greek Prime Minister in that area. But, I think, look, it could potentially move the needle in Europe. I want to show you a tweet from the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on Wednesday, who said essentially \"No one is intimidated by this new attempt at terror, certainly not the two leaders on the ground nor the brave people of Ukraine.\" She said \"More than ever, we stand by Ukraine.\" But, as for the U.S., even though the White House would like it to be so, it seems that the Ukraine funding issue is still tangled up in domestic issues, namely the U.S. border and that Congress and the Republicans in the House are still very divided on whether a new bill that has been crafted could get anywhere on the House floor. So, that is the current state of things as of now. And I think this is something that Ukraine is still grappling with, even though incidents like this, and frankly Odessa was the site of one of the most deadly attacks on civilians in recent weeks, 12 civilians killed on March 2, continue to happen.",

In Dusseldorf, airport security workers walked off the job without prior warning. Train drivers were also on strike with their GDL union expecting a massive impact on the country's rail operations. Salary negotiations are at the heart here of this unrest, high inflation, of course, eating into real wages. And it's only the latest wave of industrial disruption affecting the country. We have more details now. Fred Pleitgen joining us live from Berlin. So, talk about a bit of the standstill today. First of all, we have, I guess, two things happening here. There is the wage negotiations, right, and the demands, the request from workers and then the ensuing impact. Let's start off with what they're asking for.",

On the one hand, you have Lufthansa where the staff there is demanding more pay, which coincidentally also comes on the day that Lufthansa just announced the third best results of the company, financial results in the company's history. And the staff, they're now saying, the ground staff saying that they want around 12 percent more wage. And Lufthansa obviously saying that is not going to happen. They're offering four percent.All this has been going on for a very long time between the ground staff and between the union that represents the ground staff, the Services Union. And so far, the negotiations obviously haven't come to any sort of conclusion. They also want some sort of extra additional money, because of the inflation that obviously has taken place in Germany, like in so many other places as well. So, the negotiations have been going on, but they don't appear to be anywhere close to some sort of resolution of all of this. Then you have the security staff where you have your own wage issues as well. It's different as far as the railway strike is concerned, Erica. The train drivers' union are saying what they actually want is that they want shift workers to work less. They want them to work instead of 38 hours, 35 hours. And it seems as though they're also in that negotiation, is not really close to a conclusion either. This is a round of strikes where we've seen this repeat over the past couple of months here in this country for Lufthansa, but also for the train drivers as well, where this is not the first round of strikes. So, certainly, commuters here in Germany knew this was coming. Nevertheless, of course, traffic has been very difficult for a lot of people. Getting around has been difficult for a lot of people because especially as far as the railway services is concerned, of course, as you know, here in Europe, railway is extremely important to getting people from point A to point B, and it's really long distance and commuter travel that is highly affected here in this country, Erica.",

They are bringing guns into Haiti, and that's why they have more gun power than the police. So, they are protecting their illegal businesses, and they don't want to give those up.And when they saw the news that perhaps 1,000 Kenyan soldiers could be deployed to Haiti, of course, that set off alarm bells and actually caused some of these gangs to unite, something that's very unusual because they're usually fighting each other and the government at the same time, and take on the government, and that's why you have seen -- well, Haiti has teetered on the edge of collapse for so long. It's really just the last few days where the gangs uniting, fighting against the government, appears to push Haiti to the point of collapse now. And so, what has to happen? The U.S. would like to see Ariel Henry, however, they want to call it, begin a transition. Call for elections. Put that process forward. Because of course, we're talking about a Prime Minister who is in power after the assassination of the President about three years ago. So, it's hard to say, though, how you do that, though, without security, and how do you have security without some sort of international force coming in? That's not going to happen anytime soon. It appears at least certainly with the political stalemate that's going on. And if your government like the United States, like the other governments in the region, well, how do you negotiate with gangs directly and gangs that won't allow the Prime Minister come back in, won't allow the airport to reopen and really holding an entire country hostage?",

It's his chance to make his case directly to the American people for a second term in the White House. This all coming, of course, during the annual State of the Union address. And along with touting his accomplishments, the President is expected to showcase economic policies which he hopes will really strike a chord with voters, things like a new tax plan targeting corporations and the wealthy.

There is the groups who have voted uncommitted in the Democratic primaries, really a protest vote against the President for his continued support of Netanyahu and the way that he has handled this conflict in Gaza.So, it will be interesting to see how the President will try to thread the needle, whether he will try to make some overt appeal to those Democrats who are frustrated with his approach, because this is an issue that could prove troublesome for him heading into November. It's not just Arab American and Muslim communities that are frustrated. It's also young voters who are frustrated. So, this is an issue that the President will continue to have to navigate. And perhaps the State of the Union will offer one glimpse into how -- what he sees as the path forward, and not just when it comes to the conflict in Gaza, but also how to win back some of those voters who are very frustrated at this time.",
