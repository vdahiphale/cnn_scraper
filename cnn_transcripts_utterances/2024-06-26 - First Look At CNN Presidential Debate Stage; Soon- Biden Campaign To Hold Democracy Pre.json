      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, great expectations with CNN's historic presidential debate just 33 hours away. We're getting new insights from the Biden and Trump teams. As we reveal a behind the scenes look inside the debate hall that you're about to see for the first time.Plus, a supreme decision on free speech. The highest court of the land rejecting Republican lawsuit, challenging the Biden administration's efforts to combat misinformation on social media. And one of the most progressive Democrats in Congress out of a job. We'll tell you about Jamaal Bowman's laws and what it means for the future of the squad and for Democrats on the ballot in November. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. And we start with video debuting here on Inside Politics. You're looking at the debate stage at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta, where Joe Biden and Donald Trump will stand tomorrow night, just eight feet apart. This is where the event that may define this entire presidential race will take place. There will be no audience and here are the podiums. Biden will be on the right. Trump on the left. If Biden won a coin flip to pick which side he wanted. And this is where Dana Bash and Jake Tapper will sit as they moderate the 90-minute debate. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Atlanta, of course, getting ready for the big night. So, Jeff, the stage as you see there literally set, it's almost go-time. What are you hearing? JEFF ZELENY, CNN'S CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Manu, the stage is set and a history making one indeed. But the history books have little guidance for what we're going to see tomorrow evening. The 45th and 46th presidents of the United States, making their case to the American voters and indeed a global audience for why they believe they deserve a second term in office. Of course, so much has changed since the last time the two men were in the same room together on the debate stage four years ago this fall. Of course, there is the invasion of Ukraine, war in the Middle East here at home, of course, inflation front and center. Voters of course will have their eyes on all of this. We know that President Biden has been hunkered down at Camp David, taking debate to preparations very seriously. Donald Trump also taking debate preparations more seriously than he may have been letting on. Also trying to expectations set along the way. We've been talking with some voters who of course are going to be tuning into this. It's also in battleground Georgia, a key battleground state that Donald Trump narrowly lost to Joe Biden four years ago. Kelvin King is a conservative Republican, a longtime leader here. He said he has his eye on this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I'll put it this way. Anyone who argues they know which version of Donald Trump you're going to get on the debate stage tomorrow is lying. Even Donald Trump's advisers admit that, look, we want to push him toward talking about kitchen table issues. We don't want him to focus on his grievances. We want him to talk about those three topics, the economy, crime, the border. All things Donald Trump is pulling better than Joe Biden in for the most part. And all the issues they think that he will do well on come November.However, they also recognize that it really does depend on some of the answers how Donald Trump is feeling in the room. He obviously likes to meander and can -- depending on what Biden says react in a certain way. We see some meanness come out. However, I will also add that, you know, it's interesting in some of my conversations with Trump's advisers, initially when they got the rules for the CNN debates where you're not going to -- where you're going to be able to shut off the mics. They're going to be turning the mics off, as well as, I'm having no audience. There was skepticism around that. Now in recent days, I've actually been told that they think those rules may actually help Donald Trump. One is with the mics. We remember back in 2020, on that first debate that they had between Biden and Trump. Donald Trump repeatedly talked over Joe Biden, wouldn't let him get a word in at some points and we saw him Donald Trump fall in the polls shortly after that. It's something Trump himself remarked on the other day. With the audience, he also likes to feed off a crowd. And so, some of his advisers and people close to Trump have argued, you know, maybe without the audience and can actually help him stay on message. So that's kind of what the discussion has also been about behind the scenes. How to try to rein in some of that rhetoric and make sure he's in the right place, so that he does a good job on the debate stage.",

LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR, WASHINGTON POST'S \"EARLY BRIEF\" NEWSLETTERBut everything that Trump is doing, leading into the debate has been quite predictable. It's the same tactics that he used in 2020 and 2016. I was speaking to a person close to him yesterday and said, look, none of this is shocking. This is the exact playbook about attacking the moderators or saying that Joe Biden is going to have to be on drugs. He did that in 2020. He did it in 2016 with Hillary Clinton as well. And so, it's an -- it's an attempt strategy to discredit the entire process, should he not do well.",

MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I expect he's going to be up on energy drinks or whatever they're going to give him. And he did. He was overly aggressive at the State of the Union. He jumped right over the introduction because he was so hyped up. I expect that's the Joe will see at the debate -- REP. MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS (R-IA): Many of the doctors in Congress felt that he was on some type of stimulant, whether it was Ritalin or steroids or something else. So, we anticipate that for this first debate, he will be on something. CHRIS LACIVITA, TRUMP CO-CAMPAIGN MANAGER (voiceover): You know, he's probably going to be filled with Adderall, like he was at the night of the State of the Union. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, it wasn't too long ago that I remember, former President Trump saying that Joe Biden was the worst debater. Now we're hearing, oh, he might be on stimulants. Again, without any evidence. We're hearing he might be a worthy debater that it seems like as we're getting closer to this actual debate. We are starting, you know, one consequence of these statements is you're starting to see the bar lowered a little bit as well with, you know, some of the kind of misleading videos we've seen on social media as well of Biden as particularly at the G7. You have to wonder if there is anxiety as well, when it comes to the Trump camp and Republicans that the bar has now been lowered as well for President Biden, particularly here as you see this shifting -- EDWARD-ISAAC: This is one of those say it was -- where we say, oh, it's unsubstantiated. They're saying without evidence. They're not. They're just making it up. They're saying it's not they -- (CROSSTALK) EDWARD-ISAAC: This is not like some belief that they have like, maybe there'll be a movie star one day, right? This is made up and it's made up with an intention. Look, in 2020 remember, there was a whole thing was Biden wearing some kind of listening device that was feeding him and I was looking at the creases in his shirt, it was the rosary that his late son Beau wore. Like you said, the drug stuff has come up before. This is intentional. And it's to make it part of the conversation, but that Mariannette Miller-Meeks, she's a doctor.

And that was when they realized that Biden was going to be spending an entire week at Camp David, solely focused on debate prep.That's when they were like, OK, we need to start changing the narrative around this because he is going to be in there. Jason Miller said this on a call with reporters yesterday. He said he's going to be super soldiered up. That is kind of -- there was a turning point once they realized.

This case was about government efforts to direct social media companies -- alleged or efforts to direct social media companies for how they handled COVID related disinformation but also election related disinformation.And so, although the Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiffs on the standing issue, the impact will be that it will give government agencies at the professional levels more opportunity to be able to coordinate with social media companies as it relates to election disinformation. And there is already information that there could be foreign efforts to influence the election. It will help the government be able to have those open channels of communication with the social media companies as it relates to election, cybersecurity issues, as well. So, it really will have a practical impact on freeing up the government to be able to do the work that it thinks it needs to do to protect in those areas.",

The argument here is about whether the government suggesting that some content be taken down or moderated or, you know, demoted in some way in the algorithm comes with an implicit or else, right? That's what part of the concern here is.Is it a suggestion? Is it an urge? And then the companies themselves have the freedom to either accept that request or deny it? Or are there potential consequences implicit in that request. And to our knowledge, so far, that has not been the case. But one might imagine that under a different administration, those orders or those requests, or just whatever you want to call them, might be delivered differently and heard very differently. After all, we saw time and again, when Trump was president before that he threatened media companies, for example, to take away their licenses or the like, if he did not like the content that they were producing. One might imagine that with the social media platforms, there might similarly -- at least be some bluster, some verbiage, suggesting that if the companies don't comply with whatever content moderation policies, the president and his staff prefer that there could be some consequences. And in that situation, it's really hard to know how a company -- how a CEO or the board for that matter might react, might they try to be more conservative, and therefore, conservative in terms of limiting potential retaliation, and therefore be more compliance. And that's where I think we don't know where this is headed. You know, to what extent is this suggestion, to what extent is this an order?",
