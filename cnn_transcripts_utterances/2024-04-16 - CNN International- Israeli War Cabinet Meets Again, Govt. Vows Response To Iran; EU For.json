Israel's war cabinet has met again to decide how to respond to this weekend's attack by Iran. A senior Biden administration official tells CNN that Israel's response will be limited in scope. Second source says that U.S. intelligence suggests that Israel is weighing a narrow strike inside Iran. Also happening today, the Israel Defense Forces conducting a military exercise in northern Israel. This is part of its annual training plan. Meanwhile, Iran's President warning that any Israeli action will be met with what he is calling a quote, \"severe, extensive and painful response.\" He says that Iran's attack on Israel was an act of legitimate defense.Let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson, who joins us now from Jerusalem. So, Nic, this meeting, this third meeting now, the war cabinet just wrapping up, what was the outcome?",

      "sentences": "We don't know. We know that it lasted well over four hours, and that since Iran's attack over the weekend, it is the fifth war cabinet, and we're not getting precise readouts from those meetings, of course, the cabinet itself, the core of it, the Prime Minister, Defense Minister, and Benny Gantz, who would formally have been described as a sort of lead opposition politician to Prime Minister Netanyahu, but is in the war cabinet. Others have bought in around the table. We're told that there were fewer people around the table today, but we know over the past few days, that's included defense chiefs, intelligence chiefs, all the sorts of people you would expect to be around the table to be involved in what may be a complex and sophisticated and far reaching-military action. Now, the United States is indicating that they believe that there isgoing to be some action limited in scope. But, as we've seen in the past, Israel can keep its secrets very close to its chest, when it comes to the sort of strike it will take on its enemies, 1981, taking out the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor 2007, taking out serious nuclear reactor, and it was 11 years before they admitted to that. So, Israel, well versed in putting together these long-range military operations that have very specific targets. But, again, we don't know what's on the table. What we do understand is that it's a question of not if there is going to be a strike, but when and the scale and scope of it. We know that the military last night, the defense chief was telling troops that there will be a response and reaction, but we also expect part of the response to be to try to build up an international coalition of support to put more sanctions on Iran. But, I think the key takeaway here, or what we should perhaps be guided by, is that Israel is not going to come out of a meeting where it's deciding what action if or not to take it against Iran, and saying of it publicly. If it's going to happen, it will happen without advance notice, although we do understand that commitments have been made by the Defense Secretary -- by the Defense Minister here to the U.S. Secretary of Defense to share with the United States their plans, but of course, the U.S. is not going to be any part, they say, of any offensive action against Iran.",

But, at the same time, you do have a lot of tough talk going on. You were mentioning that EU meeting, that, of course, that is something that is pretty significant. In fact, that German Foreign Minister has now announced that she is going to be traveling to Israel in the coming days to try and help de-escalate the situation there. To what extent that's possible, is really difficult to ascertain.But, the Iranians, for their part, have been saying essentially two things. They've been coming out and speaking to some of their partners, but also some of the nations that are quite critical of them and saying, look, they believe that their strikes against Israeli territories, much of which, of course, were taken down by the U.S., its allies and the Israelis, that those were limited in scope, and that those were justified as well. That's the message that we're getting from an array of Iranian actors from the Iranian military, the Revolutionary Guard, but then also from politics, like, for instance, the President Ibrahim Raisi today in a phone call with Vladimir Putin. At the same time, they do say, though, that there will be a severe response from the Iranians if the Israelis attack in a significant way. I thought some of the wording was quite interesting, what you mentioned earlier, of Ibrahim Raisi saying that if there was even a small act on the part of outside actors, he put it, of course, most probably, meaning the Israelis and possibly the U.S. as well, that there would be a severe and painful response coming from the Iranians. The Iranians, of course, at the same time have also essentially announced a new strategy that they have towards Israel, where they say that if their personnel is attacked, their facilities are attacked, that they will strike back from Iranian territory. That really is quite a statement from the Iranians, considering, of course, how powerful militarily the Israelis are. So, they clearly have some bold words coming from Tehran. And then, finally, there is that warning to the U.S., telling the U.S. not to get involved, or else U.S. facilities in the Middle East to become targets as well, Rahel.",

Yesterday, the jurors, they were asked, 96 of them brought into the courtroom and asked point blank by the judge, can you be fair and impartial in a case related to Donald Trump? Half, more than half, raised their hands and said they could not, and those people were taken out of the jury pool right away. There has been an overnight for people to think about yesterday.They were in the room with Donald Trump as a criminal defendant in the same courtroom yesterday, answering questions as potential jurors. And this morning, we're already seeing several come back and say, I cannot be fair and impartial in this case. And so, they are being asked to leave, being removed from the jury pool. So, this is a process, Erica, one where there are hundreds of jurors summoned to potentially sit on the jury in this case. Ultimately, there needs to be 12 Jurors plus six alternates. So, 18 total, who say they can be fair and impartial and have no other issues, health conditions, job issues, vacations coming up. There was a man yesterday dismissed because he has a wedding of a child at the end of when the trial may be taking place late May or early June. And so, the people without those sorts of conflicts are remaining. And now, it is coming down to, can you be unbiased in serving in this jury against Donald Trump? They are still working through the people that have they have called back to the courthouse today. They're down to a bit under 30 people, but there are hundreds more to work through once they get through this batch. So, we're going to have to just watch and see how things continue to go. People on this jury that are being questioned or people that could be on this jury, they clearly have heard of Donald Trump before. Just a few minutes ago, our reporters in the courtroom, Erica, heard one prospective juror say he had read some of Donald Trump's books and ticked off the names of them, \"Art of the Deal\", and Donald Trump, of course, sitting there listening, was nodding along.",

It has to be on the next level where somebody maybe has a non-refundable ticket, a wedding, like you said, a vacation, or maybe somebody regularly cares for an elderly person or child care. So, the judge is going to have to look through that, and that's part of the reason why, not just the familiarity with Donald Trump and everything that he stands for to New Yorkers, but it's also a hardship issue for a lot of jurors.So, this is why hundreds of jurors are being brought in and questioned, and ultimately the magic number is only 38, because once everybody is qualified, jurors make it through the initial phase. Then once you're at 38, each side gets to dismiss 10 jurors without giving a reason. And so, that brings it down to 18. There is your 12 jurors and six alternates.",

But then, once you get to court, you see not just the reporters, but you're in court, the judges around and the lawyers are there, and of course, the most well-known criminal defendant in probably the history of cases, he is sitting right there.So, it might evoke some emotion in a juror or two, or a handful of jurors, as the process unfolds. And then, they start to think, well, you know what, now that I'm here, I'm not sure I can do this. Maybe somebody else is better equipped to do it.

So, zoom out for a second and remember that more than 1,400 Americans have been charged with crimes related to January 6. Only about a quarter of them were actually charged with this specific statute. So, we're talking about a subset of the rioters. It's a federal obstruction statute that makes it a crime to destroy documents or to forge documents. It's -- it was put on the books after the Enron scandal in the early 2000s. However, there is a provision that says anyone who otherwise obstruct an official proceeding, they also could be charged.The debate today is about that term \"otherwise\". Is it as broad as the Justice Department has argued that it is, and it covers January 6, or is it narrow, and does the law only apply to document destruction, which would mean that possibly hundreds of rioters could either get their charges thrown out or get their sentences reduced? That's the big question on the table that's currently being debated. I want to play for you a clip from one of the liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor. She gave an analogy for basically why she agrees or appears to agree with the Justice Department's broad interpretation of this law. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOICE OF JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR, U.S. SUPREME COURT: Let me give you an example. There is a sign on the theater, you will be kicked out of the theater if you photograph or record the actors, or otherwise disrupt the performance.

As I mentioned, those individual rioters could see their sentences reduced, or some of their charges thrown out if the justice -- if the Supreme Court agrees with them. But, it's so much bigger than that. Two of the four charges that former President Trump is facing in his federal election subversion trial are related to this specific law. So, if the Justice Department loses here, in this case, they may have some more fights down the road, because you can bet that Trump will try to bring a very similar challenge in his case as well.",

What the prosecutors want for that sanction is $1,000 fine for each time there has been a social media post from Donald Trump in violation of it. The gag order is something the judge set in this case to protect witnesses and others, court staff, line prosecutors, from harassment and intimidation.

We're already into day two of jury selection. They've been piecing through these prospective jurors, asking them additional questions, dismissing a handful already this morning who said they couldn't be fair or had other issues. But, outside of working with the jury, there often are legal arguments and other business the court has to attend to in a criminal case like this. One thing we're also waiting for is more discussion about what prosecutors would be able to ask Donald Trump if he chooses to take the stand in his own defense. So, when that plays out, we may get an inkling from his team about what they're thinking is there and if he wants to testify in this case before the jury, but all of that often comes down to last-minute decision-making.

Yesterday, one person, our reporters in the courtroom say, that was on the stand talking about exactly how she was feeling about fairness and said I believe no one is above the law. So, I guess that's a strong opinion. A lot of this is going to be coming down to the calls that the judges make. Do these people get removed from the jury pool, or have they been questioned enough that that person can be fair? It's all judgment, and that's why there is a judge in the room.",

You contrast that with Donald Trump, who essentially has a three-point plan to go back to trickle-down economics, give billionaires tax cuts, cut Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, cut the Affordable Care Act. The reason I love that ad is because that ad is so true. Those are real people in a real town getting real jobs because of the work that President Biden has done, and he is going to go to Scranton to talk about that today. Then he is going to Pittsburgh.

Certainly, the White House's words, the President's warnings are \"Give the Israelis pause.\" But, it does seem to me that they're reading it as, if you do this, you're on your own.

The Saudis issued a statement saying that they didn't play a role in intercepting the drones. Now, you can parse that as you will. There is a lot of things the Saudis could have done, besides intercepting drones.

There is an escalation risk in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain, all of whom are essentially unprotected, do not have the kind of layered air defense system that the Israelis enjoy. And thus, their cities would be vulnerable in the event of a major regional escalation. Then the Iranians have essentially threatened that they would go after those places.So, it's very, very significant. And that's the reason why we haven't heard a lot about Gaza, and why the Speaker of the House has sought to bring forward security assistance for Israel. That seems to be running into some political difficulty because it's also tied to Ukraine. But, nevertheless, there is far less overt criticism of Israel because of what Iran did over last weekend.",
