And most people watching this program may not have even been alive when Jimmy Carter was president. And so he's had a dynamic post-presidency. But the years when he was president, I think, I would like to say were marked by a number of things that were not even mentioned in Wolf's obituary, and that was faith. A man of dynamic, intense personal faith. In fact, the Sunday after the camp David Accords, when most presidents would be taking a victory lap on the Sunday shows, President Carter taught Sunday school at the first Baptist Church here in Washington, D.C.

So look, as you say, Putin is clearly in damage control mode. He did apologize in a way, in a phone call that he initiated on Saturday. He said that he was sorry for this tragic incident happening in Russian airspace according to a Kremlin readout of that call. So an apology, but no admission of guilt there. And the apology seems to have been accepted by Azerbaijan's president, but he has three demands, right? One, that Russia apologize; one that it admits its guilt, which it hasn't done yet, though of course, the investigation is ongoing. And thirdly, that it punish those responsible and pay compensation.
