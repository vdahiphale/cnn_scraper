Israel is firing back at Hamas with strikes on cities in Gaza after the stage terrorist attack. Unlike anything Israel has ever seen before one Israeli airstrike hitting near a Palestinian mosque.Israel also intercepting a number of rockets by Hamas tonight, near the Gaza border. Intense fighting is still underway. At least 300 Israelis were killed and at least 1500 wounded after Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented attack by land, by air and by sea, focusing on Israeli civilians taking the country completely by surprise. A fresh round of rocket attacks in Tel Aviv and other areas this evening. It is almost daybreak in Israel now just after, 5 am local time. Let's get the very latest now from CNN Correspondent Hadas Gold in Jerusalem. Hadas, tell us what it's like on the ground right now.",

Hadas Gold, thank you so much. Really appreciate it. The Israeli defense forces say that a senior officer was killed during the fighting a 42 year old Colonel Jonathan Steinberg, led to the Nahal brigade, which is one of the IDF main infantry units.I'm joined now by the Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren. Ambassador Oren thanks for joining us. What is Israel looking for from the United States in this situation? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Good evening, Jake. Good evening and I'm going to express my condolences to the Steinberg family. I knew General Steinberg, extraordinary man, extraordinary defender of Israel and the Jewish people. What Israel is expecting from the United States now is to stand for score with us. That was very much the essence of President Biden's speech today his statement, which was extraordinary. I don't think Israel could have wanted anything more to say that United States will stand solidly with Israel. It will give Israel everything it needs and if I can unpack that for a second. In every round of fighting we've had with Hamas and dealing with Hezbollah in Lebanon. We tend to run out of certain types of ammunition without preposition beneath the state of Israel, in large amounts of American military equipment, including ammunition. We asked administrations during wartime can for the keys, as we say to these Israel -- , and we are allowed to go in and take what we need. We write it down and pay for it later. It's replenished. There's only one time back in 2014, where that permission was denied during another round of fighting with Hamas and Biden administration did not accede to our request for some types of helicopter ammunition. But it's very, very rare. I think that what we understood from President Biden statement today was that whatever we need, we're going to get, and I'm very sorry to say that we're going to need a great amount. TAPPER: Do you have any concerns about the U.S. government's ability to provide what you need, given the political paralysis in Washington. We don't even have a Speaker of the House right now.",

One of them is the ability of Israel to request emergency aid for certainly for aid systems like Iron Dome, and we've done that in the past. I think that'd be very difficult right now, if Congress is dysfunctional. There are other considerations.Reports have stated that the United States has removed large amounts of munitions from those pre-positioned munitions under the state of Israel and have transferred them to Ukraine. I can't be completely convinced that the Hamas wasn't aware of this, especially as the current conflict can very easily mushroom into a regional conflict involving not only Hamas in Judea, Samaria, the West Bank, but more importantly, more crucially, Hezbollah in Lebanon.",

They're all in bomb shelters tonight. Everybody, my kids, my grandchildren are all in bomb shelters tonight. And by the way, they've all known people who are already fallen victim to this as a small country. There's been lots of comparisons with 9/11 you've heard them.

We've now had that status quo restorative for five rounds of fighting with Hamas, it is not productive.Israel is ready to make a fundamental change in that status quo, at a great price to Israeli lives, certainly. And we have no desire to inflict casualties on the other side, but we have an enemy that is usually using its civilians, and now our civilians, as human shields will have to take that into consideration. But we cannot endure this anymore. This is literally inseparable for any modern nation, certainly, the State of Israel. And my assumption would be aid that Israel will take further steps to read Hamas through Gaza of Hamas. And then the big question, will Hezbollah sit on the sidelines? I have my doubts of Hamas and Judea and Samaria, sit on the sidelines, will radical elements among the Arab population of Israel sit on the sidelines.

That maybe Israel just realizing, you know, too much on signals intelligence, drones and spyware, and not enough on human intelligence, because we just don't, the Western world, and Israel just doesn't have the spies in Gaza anymore. CLAPPER: Well, I can speak historically, here. I don't have current inside baseball. But last time I visited the West Bank and toured along the line between Gaza and the West Bank, or Israel. I was blown away with the suffocating surveillance that the Israelis maintained all along the Gaza Strip, and Shin Bet, which is the Domestic Intelligence Organization. At least most of the impression I came away with was they had really great insight into what was going on in the Gaza. Now, that's some years ago, whether Israel has become more pre-occupied with the West Bank took their eye off the ball with respect to Hamas. I don't know. But at least at one point, I had great insight into Hamas. I think Beth pointed out the difficulty of conducting human operations in the Gaza. That's a tough place for Israelis to operate, but they certainly used and whether they depended on it too much. I don't know. But they certainly had visual surveillance, overhead surveillance, signals intelligence meeting cell phones and this sort of thing. Perhaps, I would surmise Hamas went to school and all that.",

And there's no U.S. Ambassador to Israel, although some senators are suggesting that when the Senate comes back in session that confirming that nominee Jack Lew, the Former Treasury Secretary, as Ambassador should be the first order of business. So how that calendar comes together will be important, but there is an expectation from the administration that there would be strong bipartisan support for a new security package. It's just getting all the ducks in a row to be able to pass it, Jake.",

So no, I think this is Gaza is like a lost child right now, as you pointed out, it's an open air prison and employment is over 50 percent terrible, psychological and social problems. I think that that we're watching a situation without a determined or definitive and I can say with great authority, Jake. I don't make predictions, but this situation is going to get worse before it gets much worse. We're in for a very, very rocky ride over the next several weeks, or even months.",
