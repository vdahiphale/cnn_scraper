Police say this 38-year-old opened fire on a family next door when they asked him to stop firing a rifle in his front yard because their baby was trying to sleep. Now five people are dead including an 8-year-old child. Minutes ago the sheriff and the FBI held a news conference in that area saying the suspect may have fled from that vicinity. This latest gruesome attack unfolded about 40 miles northeast of Houston. And CNN's Ryan Young is following all the latest developments for us. He joins us live. Ryan, the sheriff and the FBI, they just wrapped up a news conference a few moments ago. What did we learn?",

And of course we'll put that face up one more time because they're looking for Francisco Oropeza. But what we're learning from the sheriff's department and the FBI right now, they seem like they were tracking a device which we believe was a cell phone. And at some point they were getting pings from that cell phone. They've now located the device but they have not located this man.Let's all remember that this man apparently was asked to stop shooting his gun in the front yard. Then eventually went next door according to the sheriff's department and opened fire on this family that was inside this home, killing five people, including an 8-year-old. And as we look at the ages that have just been released, along with some of the names here, we see a 25-year-old, a 21-year-old, a 31-year-old, an 18-year-old, and an 8-year-old, all shot during the shooting. This is something that has shaken that community. Listen to the FBI talk about who they consider this man to be right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course that's why that picture that we're putting up is so important because the more eyes on that picture, which they weren't sharing earlier in the day, maybe the more phone calls they can get into their centers that they've set up, to increase this manhunt.So we now know they have a device, electronic device, that they were tracking at some point. That's no longer with this man. And you have those five people who were killed inside this home. On top of that, Jim, there were two other children in their home that two of the dead women's bodies were on top of because it appears they were shielding those kids from the bullets.

This as the federal government gets ready to lift pandemic-era health restrictions on U.S. entry. Meanwhile in New York City, the mayor there, Eric Adams, is asking FEMA to stop sending federal funding to cities whose leaders are busing migrants to the Big Apple. The mayor said the city's overburdened shelter system is also struggling to keep up. CNN's Polo Sandoval is following this from New York for us, so is White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez.

      "sentences": "You know, Jim, when you hear from city officials here in New York, there is sort of this consensus and also a deep sense of preparing for welcoming these asylum seekers in a post-Title 42 world may look like. Currently, they're arriving at about 200 a day. Many of them coming here on their own after hearing about some of the services that are available here in New York.But there is concern, especially when you see some of those pictures coming from some 2,000 miles south of here, along the southern border, that an increase in the coming weeks, perhaps months, were likely translate to an increase in people arriving here in New York. So far about 58,000 have arrived in New York. Of them about 36,000 are still in the care of New York City officials, providing housing for them. And that is really racking up quite the tab, with well over $800 million already in spending. And if those projections continue, according to the city, that number is likely to perhaps reach close to $1.5 billion by the end of June. And so that is why we're hearing really that critical voice coming from New York City, Eric Adams, directed at the White House. They feel that a potential solution is in the lack of the executive branch. Not only Eric Adams but mayors from dozens of other cities are of the idea that they would like to see the administration do more. Potentially even extending a form of humanitarian relief that would make work authorizations available for some of these individuals because that is really at the heart of this onion, Jim. We've been telling the story for the last year of the New York City migrant crisis. Time and time again we hear not just from officials but also from the migrants themselves that, you know, this asylum process, it comes with bureaucracies and it comes with backlogs.",

That is a number that fluctuates throughout the day. But what it tells us is that the number of migrants starting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border is increasing in anticipation of that COVID-era restriction known as Title 42 ending.Now that is going to end on May 11th when the public health emergency also ends. And what it means is that authorities are going to have to go back to decades-long protocols to process migrants. But that is difficult to do when there is unprecedented mass migration in the western hemisphere. So administration officials have been racing behind the scenes to set policies in place and to make sure that they have capacity at the border as the date approaches. So this week the White House announced that they are going to set up regional centers in Latin America where migrants can apply to come to the U.S. legally. They also underscored programs that they've already launched where migrants can apply from where they are to come to the United States. [19:10:02] Now, also, they're going to have to focus on the border and setting up capacity there because as we just mentioned those numbers are going up. So Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas making it quite clear that this is a challenge in the coming weeks. And as you and I know, Jim, it is also a vulnerability for this White House which has been getting criticism from the left and the right on the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.",

The combat drone flew around the entire island Friday, a highly provocative flight path publicized for the first time by the island's Defense Ministry, a brazen act.

The drone flight also came as former national security adviser, John Bolton was in Taipei, voicing support for Taiwan independence. We don't know if the drone flight is connected. Beijing is keeping quiet.
