He is the lone Black Republican senator in Congress at this moment.And in his announcement launch, he really leaned into his own personal history. That's something that people close to him believe is something that will be a big selling point with people, the son of a single mother who grew up in poverty, and he really emphasized that as he tried to talk about what he can offer to the American people, but also offer some type of connections with them as well.",

So, in some industries, we're seeing that wages have actually outpaced inflation. But by and large, you know, I mean, certainly when inflation was at 9%, I mean, unless you got a 10% bump, it wasn't right. And so, I think that is the tough reality of this environment that we're in, that job creation is plentiful. Can you get a job? Absolutely. Maybe you got a raise. That's great. But is it keeping up with inflation? Maybe not.And so, even if you are making more, you still feel like you're bringing home less. And that is a really tough position to be in.",

So, I think that's something that we will be watching to see, whether the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rules on that. Additionally, Joe Biden is off being Joe Biden in Ireland. And so, we will see what other antics he gets up to during the day. I think tomorrow is a lot more official.
