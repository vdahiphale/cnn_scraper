Federal prosecutors telling Trump he is a target in the January 6th probe. This as a Trump-appointed judge in another DOJ probe signals she may be siding with him.Plus, 16 Republicans just charged with trying to help Trump overturn the election results, the so-called fake electors in Michigan, the first in the country to face charges. How this now also points to Trump himself. And new satellite images of Wagner soldiers on the move for the first time since Prigozhin's failed rebellion, a big development. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening to all. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, closing in. Trump facing a barrage of developments in multiple federal criminal investigations tonight. And a judge may rule this evening tonight on when the Mar-a-Lago documents case can go to trial. So far, the Trump-appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, signaling she's siding with Trump. But we don't know and we may find this one out any moment. So, of course, we're watching for that as we are covering all this news for you. Because also tonight, 16 fake Trump electors have been charged in the state of Michigan. Also significant, and we're going to have more on these moving developments in a moment. But first, Trump announcing today that he is now officially a target in the investigation into the 2020 election. And sources tell CNN that this target letter caught Trump's team off guard. They actually got a formal letter. It's called a target letter from the DOJ. They say they had not been anticipating charges against Trump at all, never mind expecting a target letter now. Now, this target letter comes in the face of an enormous amount of recent news in that case. We've learned the grand jury has heard from a long list of Trump confidants and inner circle members, including the former Vice President Mike Pence, the chief of staff Mark Meadows, his son of law Jared Kushner and many others who were behind closed doors with the president privy to what he said privately and not publicly. And we have learned prosecutors have interviewed election officials in the seven battleground states where Trump's team falsely claimed fraud and put forward fake electors. And as I mentioned in the state of Michigan for the first time today, 16 of those fake electors were charged with felonies. So this is significant. You've got all those other states out there, and 16 people now charged with federal crimes. We are awaiting news, of course, from another one of those states, Georgia, which could pertain to the president himself where Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who also appeared before the special counsel's grand jury was on the receiving end of this infamous phone call from Trump.

If you remember, he sent a letter claiming that there was misconduct on the part of the special counsel, work towards getting a meeting with senior career officials at the Justice Department, again, trying to forestall what became inevitable, which was the indictment there.We also know that the special counsel had to start moving the case down to the southern district of Florida where they had to read in that grand jury to all of the testimony that had been taken by the grand jury here in Washington. None of that, of course, is expected to happen in this case. The Trump team has not indicated whether they want to avail himself, whether the former president wants to avail himself of the opportunity to go to the grand jury on Thursday. We know that at least one Trump ally, Will Russell, an aide to the former president, is expected to go before that grand jury on Thursday. But simply put, at the end of that, they could simply vote to indict the former president. The indication from this letter is that they are ready to go. So, as soon as Thursday evening, the former president could be getting that phone call. And then, of course, he'll go on Truth Social and tell us all about it.",

So there are a lot of things they say they still need to fight over between now and picking a trial date. She says that she seems to be inclined to pick a trial date, though not here as soon as December. We'll see, though, what date she does choose.

I don't think he can be charged with incitement, by the way, although that's out there, and some people are arguing it.

Ryan, let me start with you, listening to what Ty had to say, interesting his view. Just because others didn't get a target letter, he does not think that that is necessarily significant to indicate anything here. What do you think? RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: I had the same thought process that he had about Giuliani that Giuliani just spent two days with the prosecutors in which if he were a target, they would have known it by then, and they would have communicated it or could've communicated it to him. So the fact that he didn't get a formal letter at this stage doesn't necessarily mean much of anything.

But now they're being charged by the attorney general with eight different counts, multiple felonies, all of which, if convicted, they could face decades in prison here. Now, these are Republicans who supported Trump, but they were also former and current GOP officials. One was a member of the Republican national committee. One is a sitting mayor. One was a member of the school board. But all of them believe that as Republicans that they were the rightful electors for Donald Trump.

It'd be kind of odd to not charge one person out of all of this. Some of the evidence in Michigan that the attorney general points to is language on the fake elector slate that was submitted to Congress. So they submit this to congress. And in that you saw something very important. It said, we convened and organized in the state capitol. So if you're an elector, you're going to convene there. They said that's what they did. But they actually met at the Republican state headquarters, according to the January 6th committee report, which I guess is not in the state capitol, the pro-Trump attorney flagged this as slightly problematic in a memo to the Trump campaign.

For example, when a bomber is sent up in Russia, we can hear an air raid siren all across the country because we simply don't know where that Russian bomber is going to target.And, so, Ukrainian authorities want their citizens to take cover and go into basements so that they aren't hurt. They want them to stay away from windows so that if there is an explosion that they don't get hurt. It's hard to say, but there certainly were air raid sirens earlier in the evening. There has been a lot going on, Erin. I really can't overstate that enough. It has been just an extraordinary mix of these antiaircraft machine guns firing into the air. We have seen what appear to be drones falling out of the sky or at least some kind of object on fire streaking out of the sky. We saw that last night as well. And then these extraordinary sounds of impact so loud that it has set off car alarms all around town. It's very difficult to say where those impacts were, how far away from us. But certainly enough to shake the building that we're in and cause the cars around us to have their alarms go off, Erin. BURNETT: So, Alex, what is the sense of how much this escalates from here? Obviously, you're in Odesa, current home of the Ukrainian navy, such that there still is. Crimea off in the distance. It's a crucial location, as you point out.

Go back nine months ago, Erin, after the first attack on the Kerch Bridge.We saw the biggest wave of strikes by Russia since the war had begun. The Kremlin warned that they would also respond after this latest Kerch Bridge strike. And that started last night, some 24 hours after that Ukrainian attack. So here we are two nights in a row, Russia clearly sending a message, and a message of response to that attack. You know, of course, the Ukrainians took out this bridge that was not just hugely important as a vital supply route but also hugely symbolic. A pet project of Putin's to connect Russia to illegally annex Crimea. This is the Putin response. This is the Kremlin response to that attack. Where it goes from here is unclear. It might be over for now. It could very well start up in just -- at a moment's notice. It's an extremely fluid situation, Erin.",

This is part of their election strategy because they are going to continue to paint this as a witch hunt and a hoax. And that is when you start to see these two strategies merge. We know the former president likes to play things out in the court of public opinion. And that is what he is going to continue to do. And that is what his team is going to continue to do. Now, we do also know because we saw those SEC filings from the campaign, those finance reports, that the strategy of essentially fundraising off of these indictments is working for the former president. The number -- the numbers don't lie. They show an enormous amount of money in the last quarter, more than the first quarter, more after the indictments and those arraignments.

Here's where we are this moment, and things could change a lot over the next few days, but two indictments for Trump this year so far. One of his Republican rivals, Asa Hutchinson, I have said from the beginning that Donald Trump's actions on January 6th should disqualify him from ever being president again. Anyone who truly loves this country and is willing to put the country over themselves would suspend their campaign for president of the United States immediately. Do you agree, Governor? And is an indictment in the January 6th probe, as we anticipate there may be one in the next two days, disqualifying? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE: It should be, but -- but it's just not. He's not going to get out. In fact, as much as these indictments roll out, it just helps him. It's building a lot of sympathy on his side. His poll numbers go up. So, you know, he looks dour and all this kind of stuff. He obviously doesn't have the fast ball and the energy that he used to have. He gets up there in his rallies. Instead of 90 minutes of getting people excited in, about disrupting and being an outsider like he did in 2016, he gets up and does 90 minutes of a droning legal recital of the indictments and the woe is me and it builds this sympathy. It's like a sad Lenny Bruce repeating itself in 2023. But it builds all this sympathy. There is no question there's a lot of Democrats cheering this on because they completely see how this will play out. This allows him to gain sympathy, likely win the Republican nomination, and get absolutely crushed in November of '24 because there's no independent, there's no undecided voter who's going to see all this and see all the drama, see the soap opera that is Donald Trump life and say, oh, you know what, I've changed my mind, I'm back to that guy.
