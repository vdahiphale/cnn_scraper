PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, even as another day passed without the recovery of three objects that were shot down by U.S. fighter jets over the weekend. MATTINGLY (voice over): Without any clear answers, still, at least definitively to what they actually were, U.S. officials now saying they at least have a leading theory. And that theory is that these objects weren't a threat. They weren't state owned, and they weren't really that problematic at all, despite the action that was ordered by President Biden. As for President Biden, he is still not speaking publicly about the issue. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The intelligence community did say that they are considering or looking this -- at this to be potentially benign. The president is taking this very seriously. And he's receiving briefings regularly, we are sharing as much information as we can, as possible. And but we do want to make sure that the Americans -- American people understand that there's no need to panic. (END VIDEO CLIP) MATTINGLY (on camera): Now, White House officials acknowledge there are still a lot of unanswered questions. They had top administration officials on Capitol Hill, briefing all 100 senators in a classified setting to give them as much information as they possibly could. But to some degree, given just how difficult and arduous the recovery process has been because of weather related issues, they acknowledge that they may not ever have some of the answers that they're looking for. And that, more than anything else is what is driving a parallel effort that administration officials are undertaking, putting together an interagency task force to try and at least give some sense of what operational mentality will be like going forward on issues like this. Putting protocols into place in terms of when an object would need to be or merit some type of force -- some type of action like we saw over the course of the last weekend. Those protocols are expected by the end of this week, they will be driving the administration's approach going forward. But again, given how many unanswered questions remain certainly a lot of work to do behind the scenes, administration officials acknowledge, the certainly took them by surprise, it is certainly something they didn't plan to be grappling with at this moment in time. And that, that element of uncertainty has driven what has been a very real process behind the scenes to get some type of coordinated policy approach on the books and then move from there. Hopefully, when you talk to officials, with more information from these objects that they're still in the process of trying to recover it. Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House.",

And it turns out that both the criminal justice research as well as the social sciences research suggests that there are what we call sort of trigger points. Moments in which the appropriate intervention by family, by social services or law enforcement can assist. This is what the FBI is trying to get a handle on, to try to stop the mass shootings. Of course, this is all defense in many ways. I mean, it isacknowledging that there are people who have access to guns that can kill lots of people quickly, but that is why we continue to study motive to begin to understand a phenomenon that is, as you said, a sort of purely, uniquely American phenomenon. That here we don't seem to get that, like we don't seem to see just how horrific this legacy is that we've created. When you think of these MSU students, I saw pictures of the three students who passed away. This is the generation that people might feel called Generation Lockdown. These are the kids that sort of came out of Columbine or the post-Columbine world, they are being raised K-12, Sandy Hook. They are -- they're doing the lockdown drills, they even graduate from K-12. They go to their adult settings, colleges and universities, and one would hope, that this would be an experience that could be open, and free for them. And now, what this is it -- case shows is this that sort of -- they are -- they are generation locked down for life, until we figure out this challenge that we have in the United States.",
