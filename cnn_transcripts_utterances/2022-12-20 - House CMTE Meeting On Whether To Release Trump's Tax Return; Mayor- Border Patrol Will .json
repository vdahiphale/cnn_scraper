It's unclear exactly which kind they'll be getting.

Happening right now, a House committee is gathering to decide what to do with Donald Trump's taxes, live look here, after years of delays in legal battles. Today the House Ways and Means Committee will vote on whether to release details of Trump's tax returns to the public. Now, the committee just got access to the Trump tax documents last month. Unlike his predecessors, Trump never released his tax information as a candidate or while in office. Let's get straight now to CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill. So Lauren, tell us what we should expect from this meeting, what we're going to see and what we will not see as they continue to discuss?",

Then they will deliberate for several hours to decide what to do about the President's tax returns the former President's tax returns, are they going to reveal any of the information, are they going to reveal some kind of report, are they going to reveal the raw returns that we do not know at this moment. Once they are done deliberating, they will invite press back into the room, cameras back into the room and they will have a vote to decide what steps they are going to take. Obviously, this is a momentous day, years in the making, the court fight happening for several years after House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal requested the former President's tax returns. They are clearing the room right now, Victor. And I think that that's important, because this is exactly what we expected to happen. We will keep you posted and updated as we get more information.",

Good to have you all.Gloria, I'm going to start with you and big picture here. Donald Trump has been promising to release his tax returns for a decade now. First, he linked them to former President Obama's birth certificate and he said if he releases that, I'll release my tax returns and, of course, the candidacies. He's a candidate again, significance now of seeing these returns potentially.",

Then he said, well, these are very complex, it would take a long time to compile them. I'm sure they are complex.We've also seen his longtime accountant just testify in the case against the Trump organization and say that, look, this is a person who has claimed losses from the years 2011 to 2018, very significant losses I might add, and he is someone who has also said, look, I'm really rich, and that has been a part of his whole brand, which is that he's a very wealthy guy. And when the New York Times reported that he paid $750 in taxes for a couple of years, his answer was when raising a debate, I'm smart, essentially he knows how to game the system and he was applauded by supporters for that. So this is a big moment for Donald Trump and his own sort of self identity, who he is, what he's about, which is how rich he is.",

There's a couple of things behind that.First of all, the committee only has these tax returns as the result of a prolonged fight in the federal courts. The committee, I think, correctly pointed to a federal law that says, we get the - we get an individual's tax returns from the IRS upon request, they shall furnish it to us, went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed with the Ways and Means Committee. Yes, you can get individual returns. However, that very same law says you have to maintain them confidentially. You can only deal with them in closed session. The other thing is during that court fight, that committee repeatedly said in their briefs to the Supreme Court and other federal courts, the reason we want these returns is not because we're trying to investigate Donald Trump or expose him, but because we need to legislate. They've not legislated in the (inaudible) and here we are on the eve of this committee's time as the majority, Democratic majority running out and now they're talking about just turning it over to the world. So if they are going to release these, I'm really curious to see what their legal justification is.",

We've got the criminal referrals that happened just yesterday, you've got so many lawsuits and investigations, place this on the scale of urgency and severity for Trump if this information would have become public?MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, DONALD TRUMP BIOGRAPHER: Well, obviously, it's the first item up on the agenda. So it's a vital importance right now and I expect that it's, as Gloria said, really essential - an essential attack on his identity. I don't know if he's prepared for that. A regular person would be prepared for that. But he kind of wings everything, so he may act very wounded, I think he will be very wounded. This, in my mind, goes back to about 2005 or '06 when he responded in a deposition about his net worth and he said it all dependent on how he feels. So, so much about him depends on this emotional investment in this identity of great wealth. I think that it is shocking that this is being revealed. And if it is revealed in its entirety, as Elie said, that will be a very unusual event. And that may be the core of his response is that, once again I'm being persecuted, once again those awful Democrats don't know when to stop and that could rally his base and rally his fundraising, so it will be a total loss for him.",

But that was not the law. And so the law says that only under very narrow circumstances can Ways and Means get these tax returns.

This is the federal aid for sanctuary cities in the new spending bill. CNN's Polo Sandoval is following this piece of the story for us.

We all thought that was going to come off tomorrow, but obviously we saw the developments to the Supreme Court, we have to see what happens after five o'clock and we have to see what the Biden administration says.So there's still a lot of, as you pointed out, a lot of uncertainty, Victor. But at the end of the day, you have cities all across the country, and New York City is one of them, that are still proceeding with planning on how you best bolster the abilities to receive an increase in numbers. Eric Adams, the mayor here in New York City recognizes that a surge there where Rosa and the rest of her colleagues are along the border almost guarantees that we'll see a surge here as we saw earlier this summer. So that's why you've been seeing these calls for increased funding, for example. Extra funding, we've learned, will be included - is likely to be included in that omnibus bill that's currently in the hands of lawmakers in Washington. A source close to Chuck Schumer telling my colleague, Mark Morales (ph), at the New York senator even managed to negotiate an increase in the total funding that's usually afforded to cities that bring in some of these asylum seekers from - about $150 million to close to $800 million. And we've learned that New York City would likely receive a large portion of that to assist in the city's efforts which, again, we hear time and time again since we began to see this increased number of Venezuelan migrants that the need is great to fund these kinds of programs because - you use such a key word, Victor, uncertainty. That's almost - the word of not just the day, but of this week when we're talking about Title 42. There's so much uncertainty not just in the border regions there, the camps that's I've had an opportunity to visit, the camps that our colleagues are bringing some amazing reporting from. But also here in New York City, I learned during a city commission meeting yesterday or a hearing that another Venezuelan asylum seeker took their own life on Monday at a city shelter. [15:25:01] Clearly, there is a sense of frustration among many of these families that have already made it here and they don't have the ability to work legally right now. But sadly, that is also reminding a lot of folks that it's more than just funding, you need to increase shelter capacity, which the city hopes to do for a post Title 42 climate and also an increased need in social workers as well to hear the concerns of many of these men, women and children as well about what they've seen on their way here and the uncertainty that they still face there.",

We need really a national plan here on how to redistribute migrants who are here seeking asylum through cities and states across the country that has capacity. Right now, we've outsourced that to Gov. Abbott whose motives are purely political, and cynical and xenophobic. We need to have a national plan to distribute these arrivals based on capacity, based on family networks and finally we need these migrants to get work permits.

Yesterday, we got four buses, over 200 individuals. It could be a thousand a day arriving and that's going to require really dramatic measures that we're going to need federal support for. We're going to need federal funding. And FEMA has a program, it's the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. States like Texas have been benefiting from that for years.
