He's being investigated for a slew of alleged crimes, including accusations that Telegram turns a blind eye to fraudsters, drug traffickers and other criminals. CNN chief global affairs correspondent, Matthew Chance, is in London with the latest on this story. Matthew, what can you tell us? (TECHNICAL PROBLEM)",

      "sentences": "There are. And the biggest unanswered question tonight is, what will happen to Pavel Durov, who's one of the world's richest men?He's a billionaire, entrepreneur, the founder and the owner of Telegram, which is one of the world's most popular social media platforms with something like 950 million users. He's been held by the -- by the French authorities for the past 96 hours. He's been transferred to a courthouse now in Paris, where we're waiting to hear what the judge says, whether the judge is going to indict and charge him, designated a witness in this case, or just simply set him free? I mean, to be clear, what -- what he's being accused of is allowing Telegram, this social media platform, to be used as a way of -- you know, being used by criminals, like pedophiles, by political extremists, by Neo-Nazis and anti-Semites and things like that, and other criminals, to congregate together and to operate freely. Indeed, Telegram has sort of, you know, prided itself on the fact that it is relatively unmoderated compared to other social media platforms like Facebook or X or some of the others. And that was a gamble, which Pavel Durov has turned into billions of dollars. It's made him immensely successful. But of course, it's put them in the firing line when it comes to at least the French authorities in this instance, as a French citizen. Telegram, back in 2015, was used by the terror attackers in Paris on their Bataclan terror attacks back then as well. And so Telegram has pretty much been in the crosshairs of the French authorities for some time now. And so we're waiting to see what the French authorities will do. Will they hold the owner of this social media platform accountable for the content that it carries? That would be a really significant step if the authorities go ahead and prosecute Pavel Durov for that.",

Ukrainians use it as well.As I say, criminal gangs use it, pedophiles, Nazis, you know, you name it. They -- they use Telegram and are very much in favor of the sort of unmoderated way in which operates. And so it's led to this very strange sort of coalition of supporters for Pavel Durov, including autocrats and criminals and pedophiles. It's an extraordinary situation.",

The investigation so far has also not identified any co-conspirators.We're getting this from a call that the FBI is holding with reporters updating the investigation into the shooting at Trump's rally on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. As we get these details, we want to discuss with CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Charles Ramsey. Sir, thank you so much for being with us. Investigators have gotten considerable insight into the shooter's mindset from his Internet searches. But again, they don't have a specific motive that they've identified. What do you make of that?",

And unless he leaves behind something in writing or he spoke with someone or what have you, it's very difficult to actually come up with a precise motive. And that's exactly what they're trying to do now. I'm sure they've gone through as digital footprint to find out what's going on. They interviewed family, interviewed friends to see whether or not he gave any indication as to what he was going to do and why he was going to do it. So they've got a lot of information, but it's not unusual to have difficulty of not ever finding a motive.",

It won't necessarily lead them to a motive. But that's part of an investigative process that takes place in, not only a high-profile case like this, but in homicides in general.",

There may be some additional information that may come out of the congressional inquiry and they should certainly go ahead and do it. Because, again, we can't have anything like this happen again, not just this election season, but at any point in time. I mean, we have very high-profile elected officials -- Secret Service has responsibility for maintaining the safety and security of the president, vice president, the candidates. And they just -- something happened and they just didn't do it. And so someone has to take a deep dive into this to find out, is this a procedural error? What kind of mistakes were made? How do we correct them? The congressional inquiry will really be of some benefit, but it's the criminal investigation that I think is the one that would lead to any kind of motive or more concrete information about the shooter himself.",

But there's a difference between saying something is important and making it a priority.And if we're going to really make supporting parents a priority, then we've got to have a major culture shift in our country, such that we see parenting as central to the health and well-being of society. Parent well-being is not just a moment for parents, but the mental health of parents affects the mental health of kids. And if we want to raise kids who are healthy and strong and, you know, create a foundation for our future, that we should care about parenting. And that's got to drive changes in three areas in policies, in community programs and individual-action policies. We need more leave for parents so that they can take time off to be with a sick kid, for example. We need parents to be able to get access to affordable childcare, to high-quality mental health care for themselves and their kids. And on a programmatic level in workplaces, we need not just cultures and policies that support parents, providing predictable schedules, for example, that allow them to accommodate work-life demands. But finally, I want to say, never forget about the individual actions that we can take. All of us know parents in our life, most likely. We may not know that those parents are struggling. But in understanding the numbers that we do now we know that many parents are. So simply showing up for those parents to check on them, to remind them that they're not alone, to offer to help run an errand for them or to watch their kid for a short period of time so they can just simply sit down, breathe, take a shower, get a bite to eat. These seem like small things, but they go a long way toward helping parents feel supported and seen.",

I wonder if you can talk about it because you have advisories on social media, youth mental health, loneliness, firearm violence, now -- now this, parental distress, if I can call it that. How would you kind of characterize this -- this approach? It's a little different.",

So I've made much of my focus on mental health and well-being, and trying to understand fundamentally what is driving the deeper struggles that people are experiencing. And that's what led us to focus on youth in the mental health crisis and on other factors that are driving it, like loneliness and social media.
