Now, no charges have been filed since the raids in three counties last week. The attorney general's office says they were all tied to allegations of voter fraud. The League of Latin American Citizens says it was a direct attempt to suppress the Latino vote.Let's get right to CNN's Ed Lavandera in Dallas with the latest on this.

The attorney general says that this is part of an effort to secure elections. That it was part of a voter harvesting fraud investigation. And that is something that LULAC officials say is simply not the case. That this has everything to do with voter intimidation. One of those people who had their home raided last week was 87-year- old Lidia Martinez. She says the whole episode left her embarrassed and that she is not guilty of any election fraud.

It was hyped up by the media. It was hyped up by, at the time, the Clinton campaign saying look at all these foreign policy experts who oppose Donald Trump. Well, you know, Donald Trump ended up winning because the American people said those are the people who got us into these problems in the first place. And so, you know, I'm not saying that's the scenario for every single one of the former officials or something like that, but for a lot of them. And politically speaking, the American people say these are the people who are in the bubble in D.C. These are the people who are used to the status quo and the way things work, and the traditional procedures, and everything else. Trump obviously was not elected to accommodate that style. He was elected to essentially be a big middle finger to the system in a lot of ways in Washington, D.C., and that's what a lot of voters are looking for from him. And so, when folks come out, whether they are -- work for him or not, a lot of them just see it as kind of part of this D.C. bubble and D.C. blob that they say great -- if they don't support him, no problem.

You know, a lot of folks had come in and out of the Bush administration. Back then it was all about how do we nation build, and foreign intervention, and some democracy promotion, and things like that. Donald Trump changed the playbook on national security and foreign policy issues for Republicans. There was always this consternation between some of the more hawkish conservative figures in the administration and Donald Trump's more real politic instincts so to speak. And so you're seeing some of that play out. And look, when someone first gets elected as an outsider you don't really know how they're going to govern. I think a lot of folks went into the administration thinking well maybe this will actually be closer to a traditional neoconservative foreign policy thinking when realistically, Donald Trump wanted to govern the way he campaigned on.",

The vice president wants to move us forward and not back. She's fighting for the middle class, and Donald Trump is in it for himself and his billionaire friends. And I think when they're on this stage she will really be able to show the leader that she is and the vision that she has, and that people who are already excited about her can feel more galvanized about helping her win in November.

Check Judge out here skying in the air to rob this home run, then he fired it back to the infield for the double play. Then Judge would come up to the plate in the ninth with a single to right field. That was the 1,000th hit of his career. The Yankees win for the fifth time in six games 5-2 over the Nationals. And it was another night, another record for Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark. She tied the all-time WNBA rookie three-point record last night with a step-back three in the fourth quarter over the Dream's Rhyne Howard. Fun fact: Howard was the previous recordholder with 85 back in 2022. Clark would finish the game with 19 points. The Fever would win 84-79 in front of a crowd of more than 17,000 there in Atlanta. That was the 14th win of the season for the Fever, their most since 2016. John, it's going to be fun to see if Clark and the Fever can make a run come playoffs next month. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You can also search through old photos and ask really natural questions, like when did my kid learn how to swim, and it will find you that date based on your photos.

So if you ingest microplastics they can actually take up residence in ourselves, particularly our fat cells, and then travel to our organs. And the brain itself is 60 percent fat, so think about that.Now, in this new study, it is a preprint paper. It's early research. But scientists looked at tissue samples taken from autopsies performed in 2016 and autopsies performed earlier this year in 2024. They looked particularly at brain tissue, liver tissue, and kidney tissue. Here is what they found, John. They found that the brain tissue contained seven to 30 times more plastic than the tissue samples taken from those other organs. And they found more plastic in the 2016 samples compared with the 2024 samples, which suggests our exposure to microplastics has been increasing over time. And when I say microplastics, they are less than the width of a human hair. So that's what I'm talking about being present in our bodies, John.",
