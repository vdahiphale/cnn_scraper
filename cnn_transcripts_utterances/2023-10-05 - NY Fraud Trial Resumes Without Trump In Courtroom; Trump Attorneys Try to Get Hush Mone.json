His son, Eric, who's also charged in the civil case, absent as well.Donald Trump spent the first three days of the trial attacking the judge and the attorney general. Back on the stand today, though, Trump's former long-time accountant. Let's get an update with CNN's Kara Scannell, who's live for us outside the courthouse. She's been watching today's proceedings. So, Kara, what's been going on?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so Trump's legal team filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in the hush money case brought here in New York.And one of their arguments is they're saying that the state had taken too long to bring this case because it has been something they investigated for almost five years before they seated this grand jury and asked the grand jury to indict the former president. And they're saying that the timing here is suspect, that it was brought just a few weeks after Trump declared that he was running for re-election in 2024. So trying to make the argument of election interference. This is a common argument we've heard from Trump. He's made it in some other cases. He certainly makes it publicly as he is trying to say that all of these indictments he's facing are politically motivated in an attempt to interfere in the election. It's a long shot-argument. They've also made some other legal arguments here. And they're hoping to get a hearing before the judge on some of these issues. And in the classified documents case, his lawyers today making the pitch to delay the trial until after the election. It's currently scheduled for May. But they're saying that they have not gotten the evidence that they should from prosecutors and even citing that one of the attorneys on that case is in the courthouse right behind me -- Boris?",

And it really makes you think. For more perspective, let's bring in our chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir. Bill, I mean, these average temperatures appear to be above the threshold that many countries had promised to avoid in the Paris climate agreement. What has been done so far to lower these temps? And is there anything more world leaders can do to combat this extreme heat?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Pam. There's so much that can be done.First let's just go back to that chart that Chad had up there. I think it's worth showing again. I'm reading some -- these are esteemed climate scientists from around the world looking at this Copernicus Chart. \"Surprising, astounding, staggering bewildering, flabbergasting.\" Professor Steven Ramsdorf, at Potsdam, says, \"We understand global warming caused by fossil fuels for four decades has been going as predicted. We don't understand that red stripe at the right side there, the surprise upward leap that's happening now. And that worries me,\" he writes. So, yes, we are in uncharted territory. But at the same time, there's a new report from the International Energy Agency, not exactly a group of tree-hugging hippies. These are folks who pooh-poohed clean energy for a long time. And look at these charts. This is solar and electric car vehicle sales and heat pumps and battery storage additions. So much of this clean technology is becoming so cheap and widespread really fast they now predict -- a couple of years ago, 2011, they were predicting we would hit 4.8 degrees warming. That would be the end of life as we know it on this earth. Right now, the IEA is predicting we're on track for 2.4 degrees warming. Still not the Paris Accords of 1.5. Still means probably losing coral reefs and making a lot of the belly of the earth uninhabitable. But a lot better than where we were headed before. And now it's just a question of how hard the big petrol states, the big companies fight this transition. IEA predicts we're going to hit peak planet-cooking pollution this decade maybe by 2025, in just a couple of years, and then start to flatten that curve down there. But it's just a matter of how much the vested interests want to fight this transition. (CROSSTALK)",

The Secret Service acknowledged 11.But sources tell CNN's Betsy Klein that that number is actually higher and it includes executive staff and other White House workers. And the bites have ranged in severity, with at least one requiring hospitalization. So while the first family works for a solution for this ongoing issue, CNN has learned that Commander is gone from the White House. Brandon McMillan joins us. He's the three-time Emmy-winning host of \"Lucky Dog\" and author of \"The Story of Your Dog, A Straight-Forward Guide to a Complicated Animal.\" All right, I'm going to start this segment just letting everyone know I am a dog lover. I've had all kinds of breeds. I love dogs. I think this is pretty crazy that this dog that was at the White House bit so many people and remained there. Now, according to my colleague's Betsy Klein's reporting, excellent reporting, he's off the White House premises. Help us put this in perspective. Commander is 2. He's still a repeat biter. Is this something that actually can be fixed? Can you make him a non-biter now?
