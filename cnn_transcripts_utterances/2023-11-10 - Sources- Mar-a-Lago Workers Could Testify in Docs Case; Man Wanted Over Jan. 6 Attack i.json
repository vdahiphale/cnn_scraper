So, I think what you're seeing is how thorough Jack Smith's investigation has been, and that there's no one who has seen or heard anything at Mar-a-Lago regarding these documents, who is going to be immune from testifying if they believe they have vanity information.

You know, this complaint I think Stefanik should have done more legal research because there is a lot in there that's sort of legally wrong and she discusses the summary judgment opinion issued by the court and seems to sort of discredit that opinion. I mean, that is sort of a normal process in every civil case in this country that there's an opportunity to seek some re-judgment, which is what both parties did here.So I think she has some legal infirmities in her complaint here that they are going to make the commission rather dismissive of it.",

Police in New Jersey confirming in thelast few moments that he surrendered to authorities, turned himself into authorities without incident. Quick background on this. It was about two days ago authorities moved in on his home to exit a search warrant. According to authorities, Yetman fled by jumping over a fence. Yetman previously served in the New Jersey army national guard as a military police officer. He also mentioned he had previously spoken to \"USA Today\" saying he had been at the Capitol the day of the attacks, but he insisted that he did not commit a crime. In fact, that he was even interviewed by federal authorities and that everything had been sorted out the way the least had been resolved in his own words. But here we are now just two days after the search was launched for him and authorities do have him in custody. Main question to answer still and we're working to track this down for folks, Omar, are the details of that. Warrants the authorities were trying to execute when Yetman fled.",

There are two of them airlifted to Tampa General Hospital to undergo surgery to try to save their lives and their legs.One of the deputies may actually lose his leg. That is according to Sheriff Chad Chronister of the Hillsboro County Sheriff's office who said that leg might have to be amputated. So let me walk you through this. This happened in Brandon. This is about 10 miles east of Tampa. These deputies critically injured after responding to a 911 call by a man that the sheriff says, as you mentioned, determined to kill deputy sheriffs. On Thursday, a woman, she called 911 indicating that she was in fear for her life of her son, who was behaving erratically. So deputies showed up to the scene there and tried to keep with Ralph Bouzy, who was in his car in the driver's seat, but said that Bouzy refused to speak to them, and then backed up off the driveway and drove off. But then he came back. We're going to show you a closer look at this video. But first, another warning, this is extremely graphic. You see Bouzy coming back in his car, and rounding the cul-de-sac and then speeding up. One deputy actually jumps out of the way to avoid getting hit. There he goes. He violently collides with Corporal Carlos Brito and Deputy Manuel Santos who were standing outside of the patrol car 10 feet away when they got hit. [09:50:09] Here's the sheriff.

This is linked to the IRS releasing new tax brackets to tamp down inflation. Let's bring in CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich. She's got more details on this. So, Vanessa, how much of a difference are people going to see with this? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  It could be significant for a lot of Americans. Every year, the IRS readjusts the tax brackets, and they have widened all of them this year. So, let's take an example if you were making $45,000 in 2023, your tax bracket was 22 percent. This year, because of the widening of the brackets, you are only going to be taxed at 12 percent. So that is significant savings for everyday Americans. Now, one of the ways that people can also save is through deductions. You can deduct a certain amount that will not be counted against your income and you will not be taxed on that. So for married couples, that amount increases by $1,500, and for single taxpayers, it is $750, and head of the household it is up to $1,100 and those small amounts could push you into a lower tax bracket. And then for folks who have children, if you qualify for the child tax bracket and if you have three or more children, it is increasing up to $7,830 up from $4,530. So a couple of hundred dollars to come back from the federal government. Remember, this applies to income starting next year and going into effect when you file for your taxes in 2025, but something to look forward to. The IRS is clearly taking into account that people are paying more every single day and they want to make sure that we are all taking a little bit more home in our paychecks, so good news starting in 2024.",
