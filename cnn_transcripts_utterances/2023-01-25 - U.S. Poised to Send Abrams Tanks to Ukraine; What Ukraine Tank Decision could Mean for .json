We'll hear more from U.S. President Joe Biden, in the next hour. Now Russia's ambassador to Germany warned sending German tanks to Ukraine will create a new level of confrontation. We've got Nick Paton Walsh with us this hour from London. Nick, I just read your article on cnn.com. Why sending Ukraine tanks represent a fierce new step by the West? I'm really insightful; there were a few lines that really stuck out. But you know, at the top, you say a West contemplating sending its most aggressive armor. A two estate it considered unfit to even to discuss NATO membership seriously with a year ago. I find that really fascinating to see how the West is stepping up assistance, the fact that Germany is now sending Leopard 2 tanks, and of course, we're waiting for that announcement from the United States. In your mind are you seeing a mega shift in the way the West is viewing the fight in Ukraine?",

But the broader picture is quite astounding.It's important to remember that just over a month ago, we had U.S. saying that it would send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine and the training on that is beginning. But that was after months of saying no, no, no way we could possibly do that it would be logistically hard and to escalatory. Now we have tanks likely to be announced by the White House in the hours ahead. Small in numbers certainly complex logistically, the M1 Abrams is not something that immediately can be learned overnight, or easily resupplied or repaired. And on top of that, that appears the America announcement to have given some wind in the sails of many European powers that like Germany perhaps have been prevaricating or like Poland, have been looking for German permission. And that broader message from Europe's NATO members at times now still a little bit scant on details. We don't really know precisely how many are going to be put onto the battlefield in the months ahead? Although Germany thinks it can get 14 in the next three months there. They will make an enormous immediate difference to the battle as of the spring offensive; it's probably fair to say. But they give a very clear message of European NATO and American NATO membership, very much less afraid of what you're referring to there as the red lines that Moscow used to cast around or suggest might be something they would reach in the event that NATO or the West continued to supply Ukraine with weapons quite so consistently. It's a startling development, certainly, and it's one that makes the possibility of Ukrainian offensive to retake territory more real. And possibly also closes the window into a matter of months into till those weapons are on the ground. And Russia has even less potential to influence matters on the battlefield, Eleni.",

There's a problem with that latter solution, because if the Ukrainians are not adequately well versed in how to resupply, refit, repair tanks that will probably see if it had been damaged. If they're used in offensive operations, then those tanks could potentially lay idle and nobody necessarily wants that. So it is going to be either a lengthy lag until Ukrainians are ready to do that job themselves across Ukraine, or a complex supply chain back to somewhere like Poland, where U.S. troops would do it themselves. All of this part of a very time consuming logistical operation. That's been part of the reason I think why Washington were reluctant to get into this. But it is happening, it seems it will increase in pace, as well. The most important thing here, Eleni, this broad message from the West, but they're not worried about what Russia necessarily thinks they don't think Russia has that many cards left to play on the battlefield.

Clearly the product sorry clearly influenced their thoughts there by intense U.S. signaling about Russian sorry, an American response to any use of nuclear weapons at all. It seems a Chinese have been pretty vocal on this. The Indians have been extremely vocal on this.

So but that doesn't mean on the strategic level that the war is solved in Ukraine's favor. So I think it's very important to put that into that context.

And it took us quite a while to make, you know, to take those decisions, because obviously, we are democracies, there is more deliberation than in Russia. However, the reality is that time matters and time cost lives in Ukraine. So we are always in this instrumentalist approach of ours. We have always proven to be one or two escalation too late.

And then the FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division came in, they'll do a review now on how this happened. Now, Pence he, after he left with the vice presidency has said that he did not have any classified documents in his possession even two years later. But in a letter we've obtained from his representative to the archives this month, his counsel says he wasn't aware that these sensitive documents were in his home and now he would fully cooperate with any inquiries. So we're watching closely how the Justice Department may respond going forward to this and to the other situations with the documents over last year being found in Donald Trump's beach house in Mar-a-Lago in Florida, also in a storage facility in Florida. And then the vice presidential material found in Joe Biden's Delaware home and a private office in Washington DC. Those two situations have led to criminal investigations by newly appointed special counsels that are still active. They're working with the Justice Department or under the Justice Department. Of course, Donald Trump's team is in a different situation than the others at this point, because according to the court record, investigators have had concerns that records he had were being concealed or removed after the federal government sought to get them back. That's much different than the response both the Pence team and Joe Biden's advisors had made to the Justice Department.
