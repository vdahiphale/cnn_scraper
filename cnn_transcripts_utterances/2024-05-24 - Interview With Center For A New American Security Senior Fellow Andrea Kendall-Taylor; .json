(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a shortage of air defense systems that are actually available in the world.

We've talked a lot about the morale issues plaguing the Ukrainian military now over two yearsinto the war and the heavy toll it's had on them as we've been waiting desperately as Ukraine has been waiting for this additional $60 billion in supplemental additional aid. I'm curious. If we do see a policy change from this administration, do you think that it should be or would be announced in the sense that wouldn't that ruin the surprise from the Russian standpoint if we got public change in policy from the White House at this point? KENDALL-TAYLOR: Well, I think if it were not announced and Ukraine was free to strike those targets, you would see, I think, a short window of opportunity where they could hold at risk and certainly damage or destroy some of the missile launchers and other capabilities that the Ukrainian officer just talked about. But we also know that Ukraine does -- sorry that Russia does adapt to Russia -- to Ukraine's tactics. And so, I think that that window of opportunity would close relatively soon. Announce it or not announce it, I think the most important thing is that that restriction changes because it no longer makes sense. And I'm optimistic that it will change. I think what we have seen from the Biden administration is their willingness to adapt to Ukraine's changing needs on the battlefield. Many would argue that we're adapting far too slowly, and that's definitely a reasonable criticism. But we do adapt as Ukraine's needs change. And so, I do think now it is very clear with what's happening in Kharkiv that we're really in a different phase of this conflict. And it's time for us to make a change in our policy.",

There's just been anannouncement of a new defense secretary minister appointed. And there's an alarming report in \"The New York Times\" now about Starlink being disrupted as well by the Russians. Ukrainians have been quite successful and nimble using drones to their advantage over the past several months, especially as they've been waiting in this interim period for more advanced weaponry. How alarming is that, that we're finally seeing Russia being able to penetrate that adaptivity that they've had and their internet access? KENDALL-TAYLOR: Well, I think just very broadly speaking, we're at a critical point in the war where we are seeing Russia not only adapt, but also exploit some of these restrictions and some of the vulnerabilities that we see in Ukraine. So, you mentioned, Bianna, the delay and aid getting to Ukraine, which has meant that they've had a significant shortage and things like ammunition and air defenses. We see Ukraine continuing to struggle with their manpower issues, and they've been relatively slow at building up some of their defensive lines, building fortifications, dragon's teeth, other barriers to slow Russia's advance. They've been able to take advantage of that, particularly around Kharkiv, but also other points of the front, such that they are making progress. So, the story of the war, the story of things like Starlink is that Russia is very quick to exploit these openings, exploit these opportunities. And so, it really is incumbent on the United States and Europe to continue to sustain the aid to Ukraine so that they can hold these defensive lines with the goal then of reconstituting new units that we can equip and train so that they can reapply pressure in the future.",

Estonia is accusing Russian border guards of removing navigation buoys fromthe Estonian side of the river that's separating the two countries. That's sparking a lot of concern among E.U. members and NATO members as well. And of course, we have a looming U.S. election here in November and there's already talk, as you are well aware, of how to best prepare Ukraine to be in the most secure position possible if, in fact, there is a second Trump presidency because we know Former President Trump has said that, from day one, if he wins, that this war would end in one day. Do you think that enough measures are being put into place or at least considered now to make sure Ukraine's in the best position possible if that does come and Ukraine does or is forced to the negotiating table by the end of the year? KENDALL-TAYLOR: Well, two quick points. One on your point about what's happening in Estonia with the buoys. I mean, I think there's a broader point that Putin is emboldened. So emboldened, not just on the battlefield in Ukraine, but emboldened in this broader confrontation with the West. And we've seen a significant uptick in these hybrid tactics targeting different European countries, France and Germany and Estonia, sabotage, arson, GPS jamming. So, we have to understand, I think that's the backdrop that we have to think about how do we fortify Ukraine because Putin is emboldened, not just there, but in Europe more broadly. And so, the Europeans are quite worried, and rightly so, about the sustainability of U.S. assistance. And so, they are thinking, how can we quote \"Trump proof\" the NATO alliance, for example? Should we shift some of the capabilities or the duties that the United States conducts in the Randstein format and other things in terms of coordinating aid for Ukraine? Should that move from a sole U.S. responsibility to a NATO responsibility?",

Even as the trial grinds on, the presumptive Republican nominee manages to stand astride his party like a colossus. This week, Nikki Haley, perhaps the last, best hope of once mainstream Republicans, pledged her allegiance to the MAGA cause. Veteran political analyst Susan Glasser wrote about Haley's announcement and a torrent of recent Trump provocations in an article in \"The New Yorker\" called \"There is literally nothing Trump can say that will stop Republicans from voting for him.\" And Susan Glasser joins the program now. Susan, I think perhaps those same words could have been uttered for Haley for a while now. Do you think that it was ultimately Nikki Haley, despite everything she said about him and the threat that he posed to the United States and the world announcing that she would, in fact, support him, that ultimately solidified that view? Susan GLASSER, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER: It is a remarkable moment, I think, in the Republican Party. And it's hard, right, because we've become inured to it after so many years of this phenomenon of sort of watching Republicans flip flop on Donald Trump, they come out like Nikki Haley did with very scathing criticism of Trump. It was just in February that she said he was literally unhinged and unfit for office. And when she suspended her campaign back then, she refused to endorse Trump. Now, a couple of months have passed, Donald Trump doesn't look like he's a lot more hinged than he did back in February. There's been no noticeable effort to assuage the concerns of Haley or the millions of Republican primary voters who voted for Haley and not for Donald Trump. And yet, nonetheless, she announced that she was going to vote for Trump in November. I think it really tells you a lot about the Republican Party today really being Donald Trump's Republican Party.",

Again, as you said quite a change from toxic and unhinged is how she described him just a few months ago. Let's put together -- let's play for our viewers an actual video of previous sound from not so long ago of Nikki Haley voicing her views on Donald Trump at the time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How much more losing do we have to do before we realize maybe Donald Trump is the problem? After New Hampshire, when I got 43 percent of the vote, he was unhinged. The president should have moral clarity. And he's just toxic.

      "sentences": "Well, Donald Trump would like you to believe that only Donald Trump is the one that matters. And I think that is -- his view actuallypretty much of the election and of a future administration if you were to serve in it. You know, what's remarkable about Trump as a phenomenon is that it reveals what's in other people as well as him, and for many Republicans, it's shown that the principles that they very loudly proclaimed are not in fact core principles for them. Nikki Haley, in saying that she couldn't vote for Trump -- sorry, that she would vote for Trump because Biden was \"a catastrophe,\" that's the template that we've seen followed by many other public critics of Trump just in the last couple of months. You had Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. who literally blamed Donald Trump for unleashing the mob at the Capitol on January 6th. Nonetheless, he said that he would be voting for Donald Trump. You had the same thing with the governor of New Hampshire, also a very public critic of Donald Trump. You know, and on and on the list goes. So, I think if you were surprised by this, then on some level, right, just as an observer, you haven't really been paying attention. But Nikki Haley is a particularly interesting case because she was -- made her announcement about supporting Trump in the middle of a speech at the Hudson Institute in which she was, once again, seeking to prove her conservative, hawkish credentials as a national security expert in her party. Well, she was scathing about this sort of Trump in America first view of the world. She believes that Trump and those who support him on foreign policy are essentially too weak, not supporting American allies, Ukraine and Israe. And, you know, literally, she has publicly said that you can't be admiring Vladimir Putin and he the leader of the country, and yet, here she is endorsing Trump, who is a great public admirer of Vladimir Putin.",

Quite disturbing to say the least. Let me make a bit of a pivot, but it does relate to some of the policies and some of the real-life consequences that we've seen from a Trump administration. What we could see from a second one, and that is his control over the Supreme Court. We know that he appointed three Supreme Court justices where we saw Roe v. Wade overturned in the last. term. One of those justices was not appointed by Donald Trump, but just added to the conservative bench and that is Justice Samuel Alito. And I want to get your reaction and thoughts about this flag gate controversy that we've seen. Clearly, he and his wife have an affinity for flags. There had been reports earlier that there had been an upside-down flag of the United States at their home. And that was -- again, he blamed his wife for this. Actually, both times now, blaming his wife for a flag that seemed to support not only the MAGA movement but to stop the steel movement following January 6th. And then another flag that was seen at a vacation home in New Jersey that shows an appeal to heaven flag and has a history dating to the Revolutionary War and come to symbolize Trump's supporters as well. What do you make of this blatant sort of political endorsement, even if it was his wife? I mean, the fact that this is a Supreme Court justice who's deciding on issues and cases related directly to January 6th and others, how should we interpret this?",

Consider for a moment the lives of Timothy's heroes. Faulkner had come of age in the Jim Crow South, a time and place with its own idiosyncratic language. Hemingway had been a journalist and driven an ambulance in the First World War before hunting lines in the African savanna. And Dostoevsky, he went to Siberia. You go on like that. How could one expect a craft and novel of grace and significance when one's greatest inconvenience had included the mowing of lawns in the spring and the raking of leaves in the autumn and the shoveling of snow in the winter?

And that was the beginning of \"A Gentleman in Moscow.\" And when I have an idea like that, I tend to very quickly -- as I realize, oh, that's an interesting story, I tend to see things very quickly that are the basics. So, right away there, I was like, oh, it could be in Russia. He could be an aristocrat sentenced to house arrest in a fancy hotel near the Kremlin. The story can span from the revolution to the Cold War. And all of that I knew in a matter of minutes. But then, it's what you describe, you start to build out the idea over time. And I'll spend a couple of years designing a book, where I will try to imagine everything that happens. All the settings, the people in their backgrounds, their psychology, filling notebooks by hand, as I, in essence, build the world. And it's not in an order. It's not in order. What you're doing is you are kind of building each element of it side by side. You get a little bit better sense of the place, better sense of the people, better sense of what happens. And then you kind of start again and advance and then advance and slowly, you know, build this world.

You would write short stories from as manydifferent perspectives as possible, taking on different lives. And by doing so, you know -- rather than just writing about my own experiences, let's say. It was because by writing about different people, it forces me or any young writer to try to imagine what would it be like to be in that situation? What would be my vocabulary? How would I -- how would be my morals? What would be -- how would I describe a situation that I stepped into if I was an 18-year-old woman in Berkeley in the '60s versus, you know, a Viennese violin repairman in the 19th century. They would see the world differently. They would talk about the world differently.

The novel is pretty unique for me interms of the arts in that it can place us in the position of another human being. And it can do it so powerfully that we as readers, if something in the main character that we're really embedded in our story, something funny happens to the character, we laugh out loud while we're reading. If something tragic happens, we may actually shed tears as we're reading. When the character has a victory, a minor victory, we feel -- you know, and when they have -- something's being mean is done to them, we feel indignant. You know, we start to see the world to some degree, we can see the world from the perspective of a character who we've become interested in. So, the novel really has this relatively unique way. I don't think the film can achieve this. I don't think that, you know, nonfiction achieves this in the same way, this idea of sort of giving yourself over to the character and seeing the world as it unfolds and -- to them, but taking it very personally. And that opens the door to this extraordinary dynamic where, obviously, empathy grows out of that, where we suddenly can take the feelings of others more seriously, our ability to imagine ourselves and experiences that we have not had, which adds to both empathy and adventure and curiosity unfolds. And so, I think that, you know, this is really the great power of the novel, is that it can enter -- allow us to enter the world from new angles to see experiences we have not witnessed ourselves to imagine them in a very personal way, in a way that opens both our heart and our mind.",
