It is Friday, October the 18th, 9 a.m. here in London and 11 a.m. in Gaza and Israel, where emotions are running high over the unexpected killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. There were sweets passed around and celebratory honking at the checkpoint in southern Israel. American and Israeli leaders have said the world is a better place without Sinwar, who was considered the mastermind of the October 7th terror attacks. His death is being called a possible watershed moment for the war in Gaza, but the Israeli prime minister has made clear there's still work to be done on the battlefield. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Today, evil has suffered a heavy blow, but the task before us is not yet complete. To the dear families of the hostages, I say, this is an important moment in the war. We will continue with all our strength until the return home of all of your loved ones, who are our loved ones.

We've been hearing from the Biden administration calling for restraint. They've urged the Israeli government not to target nuclear oil facilities in Iran. We're still seeing the Israeli military deepening its ground incursion in southern Lebanon. The region still very much feels as though it is on a knife's edge. How this, the killing of Yahya Sinwar, impacts that remains to be seen.

And the fact that he was killed by a private in the Israeli army, almost by coincidence, is something which is quite symbolic.What we see now is that Israel does have a strategy against its enemies and we're watching it unfold before our eyes. And it's going from one dictator to the other, eliminating the threat. It began with Hamas, then it moved to Hezbollah in Lebanon, and next might be Iran. So after Sinwar's removal from this scene, I think it's quite a symbolic moment. But more than that, it gives a chance to move forward in directions that might not have been possible before.",

Hamas was acting half independently, but you saw it invoked a war against Hezbollah.Hezbollah started rocketing Israel almost a year ago, and then the Houthis from Yemen, and then Iran. So perhaps the solution should be not isolated, not merely to Gaza. We have a war between the axis of resistance, as they call themselves, Iran and its allies, and Israel and the moderate Arab-Muslim state. So I guess the killing of Sinwar signals two things. One is that the only place on earth in which the Muslim Brotherhood controlled a ground, a state, an alleged state like Gaza, no longer exists. It's quite important for both Saudi Arabia, the end rates, and of course for Israel. And the second thing is that it opens the door for a wider agreement, a wider agreement between Israel and its partners, and the United States and Europe, how to fight those enemies that actually threaten the lives of many, many Israelis, Westerns, and the Arabs alike.",

They can't go anywhere, which is why people are pushing for some sort of ceasefire, particularly hard there. They can move out of the danger zone in Lebanon and potentially in Iran as well, and you could argue that in Yemen as well. But, you know, Gaza is an exceptional case because it's surrounded and no one can get out. So they need extra support, at least in terms of aid or some way of getting to safety.",

I think that could have been something else, and I think the solution might be combining the moderate Muslim Arab states, but now Israel has to win the war. And in order to win the war and bring back the hostages, it has to attack Hamas in Gaza, which is, by the way, was elected democratically by the Palestinians and enjoys the popular support of the Gazans. 70 percent of Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank, in Judea and Samaria, actually support the October 7th massacre.It's not a dictatorship or a murderous dictatorship that just emerged and took over the country. No, they actually won the popular vote in Gaza, and they enjoy, even today, the support of Gazans. Now, if we take a look at what happens in Gaza, I think the solution is by actually enabling something else to emerge. So Israel does provide humanitarian supply, by the way. I think it's the only incidence in the last 50 years in which one side gives its enemy huge humanitarian aid. It's not the case in Ukraine, it wasn't the case in World War II, it wasn't the case in the Falkland War, etc., and once Hamas is eliminated and the killing of Sinwar is a crucial step on the way to actually have a different leadership, a different government in Gaza.",

The Biden administration sent a letter to Israel and said that if the humanitarian situation in Gaza does not improve, then there would potentially be new conditions placed on aid that the U.S. provides to Israel.And remember that many of the European allies in discussions with the U.S. at the UN General Assembly just a few weeks ago had all been pushing for a ceasefire, a temporary three-week ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. And so allies have been working behind the scenes for many weeks, many months at this point to try to bring about a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in the Middle East. And officials tell me that now with Sinwar's death, this is appearing to be a watershed moment in this conflict. Yesterday, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and when he relayed his conversation to reporters upon arriving in Berlin last night, he said that now is the time to move on, now is the time for the war to end, in Biden's words. So that will certainly be front and center in the meetings that President Biden has here in Berlin today. We expect him to arrive at the palace and then the Chancellery for official meetings with the President and the Chancellor of Germany to discuss the alliance between the U.S. and Germany, of course, with the election looming in the United States and things like aid for Ukraine now uncertain -- Max.",

But certainly allies are divided on what happens next. They agree that Ukraine faces real challenges on the battlefield as this war continues in a protracted manner and faces yet another difficult winter where Zelenskyy is warning of potential nuclear war. But they remain divided on how to move beyond that, how to tackle that. We know that the U.K. prime minister has suggested that U.K.-made long-range missiles should be allowed to be used deeper inside of Russia. It is unclear whether President Biden has come around to that idea, although some amount of time has passed since they've discussed that, so we will see whether any progress is made, but we don't expect any specific deliverables at least happening from today's meeting -- Max.",
