But does all this wet weather mean the state's historic drought is over. We will speak with a leading snow lab scientist.

Rupert Murdoch has admitted under oath that some Fox News anchors endorsed false claims on air about the 2020 U.S. presidential election being stolen. Now these are the fox anchors Murdoch said spread former President Donald Trump's lies about election fraud.Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity. Murdoch made it clear that he doesn't believe the right wing talk network as an entity promoted the lies but the Fox Corporation chairman admitted that he wished Fox News had issued a more forceful response. Murdoch testified, I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing in hindsight. And when asked what the consequences should be for Fox executives who knowingly allowed lies to be broadcast, Murdoch replied \"They shouldn't be reprimanded. They should be reprimanded, maybe got rid of.\" His shocking remarks came during a deposition taken by Dominion Voting Systems. The voting technology company is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion over unproven fraud claims from its 2020 election coverage. Douglas Brinkley is a presidential historian and professor of history at Rice University. And he joins me now from Austin, Texas. A pleasure to have you with us.",

But it's very clear that Fox overstepped its bounds, that it promoted the idea that our election was stolen, it played into the Trump big lie. And so alas, I think foxes can have to clean up their act. This could end up going to the Supreme Court.It's hard to win defamation cases, you know, like Dominion Voting Systems trying to do, but nevertheless, the records pretty clear that Fox knew that this whole Trump thing about the stolen election and the rigged election was bogus, but they ran with it on the air anyway.

The White House has to act and speak quickly. Barack Obama got pummeled for not talking more forcefully when there was the B.P. oil spill. So, the Biden administration did all the right things from a networking and legal and safety point of view.But they got the optics wrong. I mean, Biden needed to have -- I think, have offered a quick message to the people of Ohio in a dramatic way. Perhaps Kamala Harris, certainly Pete Buttigieg should have been there sooner than he was. So, the Republicans are going to dine out on this East Palestinian as, you know, is on the Pennsylvania border. That's a very important voting area there in Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio. And I think if the Biden administration had an opportunity, again, they would have done everything they did.

Everybody feels badly for the people of East Palestine.But this is going to end up being used, I'm afraid, by the Republican Party as a way to beat up on the Biden administration. And on the other hand, Biden is going to say quite correctly, that it was deregulation under the Trump years. So, the railroad industries that made these chemical trains less safe. It's sad that it's a political football. It is one that hence that's politics in America. Does that mean Biden should have gone to the Ukraine and gone Ohio? No, his trip to the Ukraine was needed to be prioritized. It was epic. But his administration could have done a little bit better, showing a little more compassion out of the gate, and there were no deaths. I think they thought it might fade from the news cycle and the EPA and others would take care of the problems down the line.",

I think, given all the precipitation that we've had, and the abundance that we've had, just means that we're in a really good spot.And although we can't officially say the droughts over yet, because we have been in such a severe drought for multiple years, we are definitely lessening it. Now if we continue to just get plenty of snow and plenty of rain, and we get double what we would expect in a normal year, then maybe we can start talking about that longer term drought. But that being said, we are coming off the heels of the driest 23-year period in 1200 years.

So, we've seen things here in California like flooding recently.And if we do get warmer events coming in, things like atmospheric rivers that are rain instead of snowfall or warmer periods of air temperatures that are prolonged, we can get catastrophic flooding out of the current conditions as well given how much we've already gotten. So, there is a little bit of hesitancy to say that all of this snow and rain has been good. But that being said, it's much better than the alternative of another dry year.",

The wooden ship broke apart on rocks off the coast of Calabria. Italian politics have been shaped for years by the debate over what to do with migrants crossing the Mediterranean. And CNN's Ben Wedeman reports Sunday's tragedy has drawn a response from Rome and the Vatican. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTENATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The tide brings in wreckage of a boat, the wreckage of more lives lost in the Mediterranean. Among the dead to wash up on this lonely Calabrian Beach, an eight-month-old infant. The 20-meter-long wooden boat reportedly took to see from Turkey, Thursday, with perhaps as many as 250 people on board, coming from, among other places, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Syria. Fishermen Luciano Vincenzo (ph) was one of the first on the scene before dawn. When we arrived, we found 10 dead, he said. And as dawn broke, we found more and more. Only around 80 people survived the ship wreck. The rest perhaps well over 100 either dead or missing. This type of tragedy should have been avoided, said the governor of Calabria, Roberto Occhiuto. Sunday, Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peters Square, I pray for each of them, for the missing and for the other migrants who survived. But thoughts and prayers won't save lives. Since 2014, more than 20,000 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean. Escaping war, famine, repression, chaos, and hopelessness. Increasingly, Europe, including Italy, is taking a hard line on those from the global south fleeing their native lands. In a statement, Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed what she called her profound pain at the disaster. But Meloni, rode to power on an anti-immigrant platform. And last week, the Italian parliament approved new laws making it ever more difficult for volunteer groups to carry out rescues at sea. What Europe can do for those in need has been made vividly clear by its embrace of millions of Ukrainian refugees. An embrace that does not extend to those braving deadly voyages such as these to reach Europe's shores. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Rome.",
