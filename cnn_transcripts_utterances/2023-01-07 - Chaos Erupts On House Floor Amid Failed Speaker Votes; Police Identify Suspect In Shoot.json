The ongoing eruption remains confined to a crater within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and officials say there is no threat to communities nearby. The eruption comes weeks after neighboring volcano, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in decades.Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. It was painstaking it was complicated. But after four days of exhaustive negotiations, the House finally has a new Speaker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): The gentleman from the great State of California, and the next Speaker of the 118th Congress, Kevin McCarthy. WHITFIELD (voice over): Kevin McCarthy grabbing the gavel after 15 rounds of voting. It was the longest Speaker contest in 164 years, despite the sometimes contentious days of negotiations with a narrow faction of his conference, Republicans in the end rallied around McCarthy and his vision for America. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I make this promise. I will never give up for you, the American people. And I will never give up on keeping our commitment to America. Our nation is worth fighting for. Our rights are worth fighting for. Our dreams are worth fighting for. Our --",

Eva, so what finally pushed McCarthy over the edge for these Republican holdouts?EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER (on camera): Well, he was able to convince those never-Kevin lawmakers ultimately vote present. And that is how he secured this victory on the 15th try, Fred. But also by making some key concessions. So, for instance, those hardline Republicans, they are going to have the opportunity to serve on the House Rules Committee. That is a powerful committee. MCKEND (voice over): As well as also a lot of votes on issues that are important to conservatives. And then, also key having 72 hours to read a bill. And that actually is something that rank-and-file members on both sides of the aisle, lament that there is not enough time to actually read legislation of consequence before they vote on them. MCKEND (on camera): You know, a thorn on his side throughout this process was Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. A little bit of drama in the -- in the -- during the 14th vote when he voted president and it was just a vote shine of allowing McCarthy to secure a victory. But he of course, there was enough other lawmakers that also voted present in the 15th vote. And that is how McCarthy ultimately won the speakership. But a very, very messy week, and a messy process.

You had a member from North Carolina, trying to restrain Mike Rogers, just soon after that. So, yes. So, a really dramatic moment, Kevin McCarthy sort of walking away in disgust. And I think that, that just really illustrates what this week looked like on Capitol Hill. You know, the vast majority of Republicans supported McCarthy for the speakership. So, just a frustrating process as there was a vote after vote. But ultimately, you know, these Republicans are claiming victory.

But where they disagree is on the tactics. The what -- the best way to get it done. And, you know, some of the more moderate Republicans see ways to reach out to Democrats to get some of that stuff done, simply because, you know, Democrats are in control of the Senate, and Joe Biden is the President of the United States, right? It's not -- it's not like Republicans control every lever of power here in Washington. They control one half of one branch of government.

Are you seeing any evidence of a ceasefire there? SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTOf course, Fredricka, today is a Christmas Day in the Orthodox faith, and so people across this country were celebrating Christmas mass and in Kyiv for the first time in a very long time, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine held a Christmas service inside one of the most famous cathedrals in this country. We were there to witness this ourselves. The Assumption Cathedral was previously used by the branch of the Orthodox faith that formerly had links to the Russian Orthodox Church. But, of course, since the full scale invasion began, there's been plenty of scrutiny on the leadership of that branch of the church, amid accusations that they are still somehow under the influence of Russia, something that they vehemently deny. But, look, I spoke to people who attended that branch of the church and also the Orthodox church of Ukraine. And regardless of which church you're attending, everyone that we met said that this Christmas, given the war, given the uncertainty, their Christmas prayers have never seemed so important, Fredricka.",

And there are a few factors that are driving these prices higher. We have a deadly avian flu last year which killed millions of hens and turkeys, and it was the worst avian flu since 2015. So that tightens supply. You have fewer birds, and it's also been exacerbated by higher feed and energy costs that producers and farmers are facing. And then, of course, higher demand from customers.We're all using eggs to bake over the holidays. So tight supply, high demand, that's pushed egg prices up.
