America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel saying in a statement, quote, \"We are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice. Most upsetting is the unabashed exploitation of domestic violence survivors' stories to silence a woman who asked for safety.\" Going on to say, \"The hypocrisy is astounding.\" CNN entertainment correspondent, Elizabeth Wagmeister, joining me now. Elizabeth, when this dropped over the weekend, a lot of people's jaws dropped. Walk us through what Blake Lively says happened to her and others on set.",

There's a screenshot of a text.It says, and I'm quoting here, \"It's actually sad because it just shows you have people really want to hate on women.\" This coming from another woman, allegedly. When we look at this, you know, you point out, which I think is important here too, in this filing, right, it goes through and alleges the complaints that we're lodged with H.R. on the set by other women. The concerns that we're raised, again, not just by Blake Lively. Part of that agreement, then afterwards, as filming continues, was not only an intimacy coordinator, but it also included an agreement during filming that the studio wouldn't retaliate against Blake Lively. How could that come into play?",

H.R. participates in the retaliation. That's the reality that I have seen for more than 40 years, representing women who complain about sexual harassment. So that's why we need to go to courts. That's why we need jury trials. That's why it's so important that we have now outlawed forced arbitration of sexual harassment claims. So they're public. And so they can't protect the harassers and go after the women like this. Let's have a public airing of how this happened. There are a lot of enablers in this case. And they're powerful enablers.",

Police say a man has been arrested after he set a woman on fire inside of a train on Sunday morning, then sat and watched her burn to death as police tried to save her life.Now the suspect fled the scene, but investigators used surveillance and police body cam video to create these wanted posters. He was caught several hours later. For more on this, let's get over to CNN national correspondent Gloria Pazmino. Gloria, I understand you have new details about the suspect. Tell us, what are you learning?",

We have just learned that his name is Sebastian Zapata Carlisle.And he is a 33-year-old Guatemalan citizen, according to Customs and Border Patrol officials who have confirmed the identity for us. Now, we were learning -- we were waiting to learn more details about the identity of the suspect. We did learn last night, after he was arrested, that he had entered the United States in 2018 from Guatemala. We don't know much more about his immigration status right now. We do know that he was apprehended at one point in 2018. He was served with an order for expedited removal and was actually deported back to Guatemala six days later. However, the officials at Customs and Border Patrol tell us that he unlawfully reentered the country at an unknown date. So it's important to highlight that it appears the suspect has been in the country for several years at this point. We are also waiting to hear more about what charges he may be facing. I'm told by sources that investigators have been trying to get more details about exactly what happened and how -- and how it happened, before they announced charges. Now I just want to kind of go over what we know so far. This incident happened on Sunday morning. It happened in Brooklyn at the end of the F train line. That's where police say that a suspect approached a woman who appeared to be asleep inside of the subway train. They say that he used a lighter -- a lighter to light her on fire. She was wearing a lot of clothes, including a blanket, which quickly was engulfed in flames. Police that were patrolling the station at the time actually responded when they saw the smoke. They tried to put her out, but, unfortunately, they were not able to save her. Now, Danny, as you said, it was because of those patrol officers on the platform as well as video that was captured on surveillance cameras that they we're able to disseminate photos of the suspect very quickly. And he was apprehended about eight hours later riding the same train line, the F train, this time in Manhattan. He was arrested there by NYPD police officers yesterday afternoon. And we are awaiting to hear more details about the faces -- the charges that he is facing -- Danny?",
