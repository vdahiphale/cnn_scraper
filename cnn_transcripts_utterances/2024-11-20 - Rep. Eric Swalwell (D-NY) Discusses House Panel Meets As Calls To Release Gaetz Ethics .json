And he's actually told us that's what he's going to do. This report, again, undermines his ability to be taken seriously by the people who are going to work for him and the American people who need to trust him. But the bigger issue is -- and this is not what I'm telling you. My Republican friends in Congress are laughing that he is the appointee, and no one actually thinks that he's going to be confirmed.

And you should know that Sheila Ross is just an excellent prosecutor. As someone who's covered Fulton County and a lot of metro Atlanta for years, you know that Sheila Ross has a way of taking the evidence that's given to her by detectives and really pulling it out and showing a side of the evidence that is really easy to follow along with. And even in her closing statements today that lasted some 55 minutes, she did three things that we're very solid. One, she obviously made the point that Laken Riley did not deserve this, and she was brutally attacked. And even went over the fact of the evidence again, that there were scratches, there was DNA evidence. But she also found a way to humanize her beyond a point at this juncture where, for the first time, we heard from the family in such a way that we had not had a chance to hear from the family this way. And when you put on top of that, this judge is a no-nonsense judge who's been on the bench since 2011. And anyone who's ever been in his courtroom understands this man follows the law to a T, doesn't take any trouble in his courtroom. So you knew that the hands of justice were turning in a certain direction. This case has moved really quickly. Something that happened while you guys were away, and I want to share this with you. They showed this body camera video. Laken Riley's family finding out about the death shortly after cops discovered it. It's body camera footage, and you see her family arrive. I'll be quiet for a second so you can just see their reaction. This was heartbreaking. Just take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CRYING)",

And even the day we were there for her memorial service, you could feel the impact for so many of these young people. I think about the young lady who was wearing her blouse there, doing the victim impact statement, saying that she kept that blouse and she wanted to be able to smell her friend. I mean, imagine that as a young person being able to talk about losing a best friend that way. It's just heartbreaking. Some of the words that were used today was \"predator\" and \"monster.\" And even the idea of not having a motive for what this -- why this happened is something I think will leave all of us sort of questioning exactly what happened on that day. Because she was running. It clearly shows they had no prior encounter. And then, all of a sudden, this attack occurred and she was dragged off that running trail. This has really changed the fates of so many people on that campus because people are still in fear for the idea of running around there. But the judge sending a very strong message, backed by that evidence today, life without parole. You can tell, certain folks feel good about this justice. You brought up the idea earlier, talking about the death penalty. The D.A. who decided not to seek the death penalty in this before moving it to Sheila Ross, also lost reelection.

We heard Laken Riley's mother, Allyson Phillips, step-father, John Phillips, sister, Lauren Phillips. We heard from numerous classmates, friends, roommates that all had to say the same thing, that she was a very bright individual with a contagious smile that was always willing to help anybody. Her step-father, John Phillips, read a letter that she wrote in December of last year. And the letter was addressed to a husband in the future. And a lot of the testimony that we heard today has to do with that. How the brutal heinous murder of Laken Riley has robbed not only her but her family, friends and the entire community of that peace, that joy that she had. It was not a big surprise, to be totally honest with you, Boris, that Judge H. Patrick Haggard decided to give the defendant the maximum sentence of -under -- in this case, for that matter, of life without the possibility of parole. But there was always a question there.

And here's how it's impacting all of these individuals that surrounded her. That's one piece of it. The other piece of it is the legal statutory requirements. And it's in the judicial discretion to give life without the possibility of parole when somebody is convicted of felony murder, of malice murder, when there are aggravating factors. And we heard the prosecutor go through those. And those aggravating factors relate directly to the other charges that he is now convicted of, kidnaping, the attempted rape. All of those factors into that determination.

So they merge into one. That's why we heard him say that he's sentencing Ibarra on life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on malice murder. So all of those felony murder counts merged into that. And that includes lesser included offense, of aggravated assault. All of those merge into that malice murder conviction, life without the possibility of parole. And then, Brianna, we have the other charges where he was given years certain, one, life without -- or life with the possibility of parole, 20 years for others. All of those are consecutive, meaning -- or all of those are, excuse me, concurrent meaning they happen at the same time. So all of those sentences will be served at the same time as the life without possibility of parole. What he carved out was the misdemeanor charges.
