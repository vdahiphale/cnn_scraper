The Palestinian Ministry of Health, from their perspective, they say that strikes like this one are now damaging and shutting hospitals down. In Southern Gaza, where Palestinians have been told to evacuate to, to flee to, this was the scene outside a hospital there, one of the hospitals still running, ambulances urgently rushing new victims in for care -- John.",

Those rockets have been fired from inside Gaza.And it is important to point out, these are the kibbutzim where some 1,400 people were killed more than a week ago. That is the basis of this current conflict that we're seeing right now between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. One other thing we should note, this is the Rafah Crossing between Egypt and Gaza. A senior Israeli official is now saying that they will allow some aid in, but if any of it falls into Hamas hands, Israel says they would stop any aid from going over that border. And it'll be very difficult to keep Hamas away from whatever crosses from Egypt into Gaza. Our Sara Sidner is now standing by in Tel Aviv. Sara, tell us what you're seeing.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this meeting is an urgently needed one.The situation in Gaza, by all accounts, is rapidly escalating out of control. We have been hearing a steady stream of strikes on Gaza in the distance, but also, more alarmingly, earlier on today, reports of multiple strikes near that border crossing, Rafah. That's the border crossing with Egypt. That's where all these intensive diplomatic efforts are focused on trying to open up right now to allow desperately needed aid into that southern part of Gaza. The issue is that the Egyptians are basically saying there's no guarantee of security as long as there are continued strikes going on. That's from the Egyptian perspective. The Israelis, of course, are pointing the fingers at Hamas. Hamas is pointing their fingers at the Israelis. And, in the meantime, it's the oldest cliche of war, but it's true. It really is the civilians who are suffering the most profoundly; 3,000 Palestinians have now been killed since Hamas' bloody attacks 10 days ago, the U.N. warning that 600,000 people have been displaced from their homes, told to evacuate to the southern part of the enclave. But there is not enough electricity. There is not enough food. There is not enough medicine. One of the doctors at MSF, a Medecins Sans Frontieres, Doctors Without Borders-sponsored hospital in Gaza saying that they are being forced to perform surgeries at the moment without painkillers. Now, the mechanisms for establishing a way to get that aid in, to allow foreign nationals out, to allow the most seriously wounded out is the topic that everybody is waiting for some kind of a breakthrough on. It's complex for many reasons. That's why this meeting, of course, between Blinken and Abbas is so important. Presumably, they will also be talking, Sara, about, if there is an Israeli ground offensive into Gaza, if Israel does carry out on its promise to essentially decapitate Hamas, what kind of power will be established to take over to ensure that there is no vacuum? So, no shortage of very important, pressing issues for those two leaders to discuss, but, of course, the primary being trying to get that desperately needed aid in as quickly as possible, Sara.",

This will obviously be a very strong show of solidarity, that kind of no- daylight mantra that we have been hearing from the White House over the last a week and change since this war began. That is going to continue tomorrow, when President Biden stands shoulder to shoulder with the Israeli prime minister. But then, of course, there are also the practical implications of the visit, and what perhaps might be announced when the president comes here. It follows visits by his minister -- his secretary of defense, his secretary of state. And, typically, that would be the lead-up to some kind of announcement when a president actually comes here. We know that he's going to be focused on the situation -- the humanitarian situation inside of Gaza, the situation of Americans being able to leave through that Rafah Crossing into Egypt, as well, of course, as the issue of hostages. Here's the National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, explaining why the president feels now is the right time to come. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They have announced it ahead of time, rather than making it a secret. The White House says they're comfortable with those security measures. But there is still an element of risk. Even just yesterday, when Secretary Blinken was meeting with the Israeli prime minister for nearly eight hours at IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, sirens, rocket sirens, went off twice during that visit, and they had to go to those bomb shelters. And as you have been hearing today, Sara, there have been rockets being fired in the direction of Tel Aviv, near south Tel Aviv.

His record is not much of one when it comes to passing any bills, I think one resolution the whole time he's been here.
