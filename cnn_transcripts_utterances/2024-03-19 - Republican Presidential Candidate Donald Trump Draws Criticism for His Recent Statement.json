The conversation was centered around Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's recent call for new elections in Israel and his criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump slammed Schumer and accused the highest-ranking Jewish election official in the U.S. of being anti-Israel.Joining us now, CNN's Alayna Treene on this. His remarks drew intense criticism, for good reasons, by the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Biden campaign, among others.

We actually heard him speak critically of Netanyahu, and really a lot of that has stemmed from what Donald Trump felt was Netanyahu's misguided support of Joe Biden after Joe Biden had won. He felt that Netanyahu was betraying him by coming out and acknowledging that Joe Biden had won the election and agreeing to work with him. It's something that we've continued to see in Donald Trump's remarks on the campaign trail over the last several months and last year. Donald Trump really believes that, like I said, that he has been a strong supporter of Israel, and that Netanyahu should be recognizing that and he should not be embracing or working with the Biden administration.And so it's interesting thing as Donald Trump continues to argue that he would -- he often argues that he thinks the war in Israel wouldn't have happened if he were an office.

In 2019, he said that any Jew who supports Democrats is either disloyal or uninformed. And he's conveying this message of contempt anger toward Jewish Americans because he knows that three- quarters of us will never support him.So our message to Trump as he continues to demonstrate animus towards Jewish Americans, the feeling is mutual. It's only going to continue to grow as we head into November. And according to the latest poll by Pew, 79 percent of Jewish voters disapprove of Trump. It's among the highest disapproval of any religious group. So why is that? It's because he says he wants to be a dictator on day one. He aligns and admires dictators like Putin and Orban. And we've seen the horrific consequences of dictatorship. We want no part of it. He refused to condemn white supremacy. He's emboldened dangerous rightwing extremists who pose a threat to our security. And he has threatened our democracy and our freedom. So he's a threat to our community and our values. And there's nothing he can say between now and November to change that. In fact, as he continues to speak more and more about American Jews, he's only going in to continue to lose more support among American Jewish voters.",

Various sources saying she is going to be out after Easter. She might be out at Easter. And then this farm shop visit, which yes, the paps weren't there, the paparazzi weren't there, but I do think they were expecting and hoping that people might see them, might take a photo of Kate looking great, looking healthy, walking. So that does put to rest a lot of the rumors, these rumors that she was -- she disappeared, she ran away. But there is still are other rumors all around. This hasn't quelled everything. The Palace does need to do more. And I think it does need to put out at some kind of, I'd say a statement or a little photo of Kate in a week or so of her looking at her thank you cards. That's what the  King did in the end of February saying, thank you so much for my cards. I think that's what Kate needs to do now because there are still rumors and they are very damaging.",

But on the inside, he will be able to can make phone calls. He will have use of e-mail. He will be able to watch the news, perhaps he will even follow the 2024 campaign. There are about a dozen TV sets, some in English, some in Spanish, we are told by this prison consultant. And just a little bit about this prison, it is one of the oldest prison camps in the country and there are quite a few inmates here from Puerto Rico because it is the closest Federal Bureau of Prisons facility to that territory.
