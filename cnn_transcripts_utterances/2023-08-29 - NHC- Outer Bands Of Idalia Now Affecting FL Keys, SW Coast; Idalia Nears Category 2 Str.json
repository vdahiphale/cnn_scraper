Authorities are continuing to piece together what happened as the community mourns the victims of a racist attack.We are following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Right now, parts of South Florida are already feeling Hurricane Idalia. Its outermost bands are bringing heavy rain to the Florida Keys. You can see here squalls are coming onshore as well and yet people are still taking photographs. The storm surge is causing water levels to rise at least two feet above normal in parts of southwestern Florida. That's just so far. Idalia is intensifying on the brink of becoming a Category 2 hurricane, just hours away from its expected landfall in what's known as the Big Bend region as a Category 3 hurricane. And when it hits, the storm surge could be catastrophic, possibly up to 15 feet in some areas. Director of the National Hurricane Center, Michael Brennan, joins me now. It's good to have you, sir. I know you have a lot to track. What's the best storm track that we know at this point? I know it's always changing up into the final moment, but what's your best estimate as to where it's going to hit land?",

So when you have a rapidly developing and strengthening storm heading for land and reaching land at its peak intensity, there can always be a lag in how people respond and take action. So we really try to get the message out that, hey, we're expecting this to be a major hurricane. You have to get ready for those impacts. You have to take those preparation steps today.",

[15So if we assume that these values assume that storm surge occurs at the time of high tide, that's why we're expecting that 10 to 15 feet of inundation somewhere between Aucilla River and Yankeetown in that Big Bend area.

That is home to the Clearwater, St. Pete area.As you mentioned, the concern in this part of Hillsborough County, the downtown Tampa area is the flooding associated with this hurricane. As you noted, we're talking about a storm surge anywhere between four to seven feet. And when you take a look at the bay here behind me, you can see it's not going to take a whole lot of water out here in order for some of this flooding to take place. This time tomorrow, we'll have taken into account the rain, which has already started to fall, as well as high tide and the storm surge. A number of hurricane shelters have opened here in Hillsborough County. We're told those can house up to 20,000 people. And so right now, emergency officials are trying to get folks that live in this part of Hillsborough County, which is pretty low-lying area, they're trying to get them out of their apartments, out of their condos and their homes, and they're just trying to get them to higher ground. Now, the flooding concern, of course, is not just only here in the Tampa Bay area. Gov. Ron DeSantis, he had an emergency briefing earlier this afternoon where he talked about some of the flooding that we're going to see in a lot of these inland counties up and down the western coast of Florida from, of course, the Big Bend all the way down here to Tampa Bay. Here's a bit of what he said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R) FLORIDA: This storm is going to impact inland counties. And particularly in northern Florida, you are going to see significant impacts. By the path, it doesn't mean just in the cone, because there's going to be impacts that are going to be outside whatever the National Hurricane Center says is the path of the storm. (END VIDEO CLIP) And because of this forecasted path, we expect all of this water to just come into the Tampa Bay area, which again, the concern is it's going to lead to a good amount of flooding. We're told at least 60,000 sandbags have been distributed out in Pinellas County, which is home again to Clearwater and St. Pete. Brianna and Jim?",

We got this brief gust of wind, about 40 miles per hour, heavy downpours of rain and then it came to an end. That's what we should expect to see gradually increase in frequency through the course of the next few hours before conditions completely deteriorate overnight.Now, I want to show you on our graphics because Hurricane Idalia is really starting to get its act together. And what I mean by this is notice that kind of spiral wrapping around the storm system. That is indicating that it's really starting to become more organized, it's strengthening, it's deepening, exactly what we anticipated because it is fueling itself off of the record warm water temperatures across Eastern Gulf of Mexico that sits directly over my shoulder. Here's the latest radar information and you can see those initial rain bands that have already impacted Key West, 50-mile an hour wind gusts there earlier today, choppy waves on the water and that is several hundred miles away from the center of where Idalia is located. So my point being is that the impacts will be felt well outside of where this storm actually makes landfall, so very key, very important. Fort Myers getting some hefty thunderstorms right now. There was a tornado warning near Marco Island earlier today. And something that - to pass along to our viewers here, we've got what is called a mesoscale discussion.

We know that there are several counties that are under mandatory evacuation and others who are under voluntary evacuation. And the most critical thing, whether you've lived in Florida your whole life and weathered storms before or maybe this is your first time going through it, is to listen to that evacuation orders and the guidance from local officials.FloridaDisaster.org, Ready.gov and Listo.gov all have great information about preparedness kits, what you should have to take care of your family, your loved ones and your pets.

We can tell you and I know you had Director Brennan from the National Hurricane Center on earlier and we're seeing the storm forecasting as it goes, right now Category 3 undergoing additional rapid intensification. But it's not just the wind itself that people are - should be concerned about. It's that storm surge. We'll see up to 10, 12 feet of storm surge in certain areas being pushed inland. So while homes can be rebuilt and power lines can be restrung, we want to ensure that everyone is safe riding out the storm. So to do that, please listen to the evacuation guidance. And if you're told to leave, please leave.",
