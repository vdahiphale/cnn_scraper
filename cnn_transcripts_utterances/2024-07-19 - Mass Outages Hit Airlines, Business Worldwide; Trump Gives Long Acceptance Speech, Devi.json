This is a cybersecurity firm that Microsoft uses to help provide cybersecurity for its online products. And now we are hearing from this president and CEO, George Kurtz. He says that CrowdStrike is actively working with customers to deal with a defect found in an update for Microsoft Windows. He goes on to say this is not a security incident or some kind of global cyberattack, making a point of saying that this issue has been identified and fixes -- if you will, repairs -- are now being deployed. So, the good news in all of this is that this potential problem, this problem, has now been identified. The issue is that it has had a lot of ramifications worldwide. Here in Asia, but as we are seeing as people wake up in the United States, it's also having far-reaching problems in Europe, as well as in the U.S. As you mentioned, airports and airlines are being affected, including Delta, Allegiant. It appears that American Airlines is having some resolution with its flights, but a lot of carriers, not only in the U.S. but also worldwide, have been dealing with -- with problems such as Cathay Pacific here in Asia, as well as KLM in Europe. So, we could see some lingering effects in the problems there. Banking and finance also seeing a big impact. It was this afternoon in Asia when a lot of people working at offices suddenly saw blue screens. But this is impacting so many sectors of life. Kasie, in particular, we learned of a grocery store chain in Australia that was having problems taking orders. So, the problem's big and small, but if it's happening to you, it's certainly -- it's certainly significant.",

This is a live look at Philadelphia [SIC] International Airport, where it doesn't seem -- or I'm sorry, it's Atlanta International Airport, which honestly, there should be a little bit more activity going on there, I would think.This airport is one of the many experiencing major tech issues around the world, causing delays and issues for travelers. The FAA saying that several major U.S. carriers, including Delta, United and Spirit are under a full ground stop. American Airlines tells us that they have reportedly resolved their issue. We're also learning that public transportation, including trains and buses in Washington, D.C., have also been impacted by the outage. In Europe and in Asia, airports, banks, hospitals, news outlets, and stock exchanges, all suffering similar outages. The tech disruptions appear to stem from a software update issued by the firm CrowdStrike. The company's CEO says that the issue has been identified, and a fix is in the works. CNN's transportation analyst, Mary Schiavo, joins me live now. She is the former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well, and can help us understand the impacts here. Mary, this seems like a very remarkable event. How often does something like this happen? And what can people expect in terms of trying to get back -- you know, when things are going to get back up and running in a normal way?",

This is different in that it includes data and transmissions on the cloud and cloud storage systems and connectivity and communications. So that affects all the scheduling, the timing, the crew scheduling, getting the planes up and out. So, it's a little different than what we've seen sometimes in the past. But this is a massive outage. And -- and obviously, it's software that affects other companies. Getting back to normal, well, for aviation, if you have a hiccup in the morning, by the afternoon, you're in total meltdown. So, it won't be back to normal today. But the good news is, is the company has said -- the software company said -- has -- says they have rolled out a fix. So, you know, by tomorrow, things should be normal.",

One widely circulated internal -- internal memo said this: \"Defending Biden's fitness for office is an untenable position for down-ballot Democrats.\" Joining me now is former Democratic Congressman from Ohio, Tim Ryan.
