Now that there is a degree of calm and control in the city, who are seeing people come out and, finally, just this outpouring of jubilation after more than 50 years under the totalitarian regime, totalitarian regime of Bashar Al-Assad and Hafez Al-Assad, the father before him. After 14 years of the most brutal and ugly civil war, these people want the world to know that Syria has its new beginning, a new chapter. I mean, the corruption that we saw in the presidential palace compound that we just visited is astonishing. While people in Syria were starving, were being bombed, were being killed, were being tortured, he was living in lavish opulence with huge garages full of luxury cars. I'm just pointing over here. And I don't know if we can get it at all. It's probably a bit tough without a tripod, but cameraman, Scott McWhinnie. If you can see, we're in Umayyad, central Damascus, Umayyad Square on the top of that monument. You can see one individual who has been waving a flag. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So they'll have to go through the evidence. And we've already described the manifesto, the ghost gun, the images that we saw, even the -- even the eyewitness. And they may even bring in some of the eyewitnesses who was discovered. The officer, the arresting officer in Pennsylvania will come forward and talk about the exchange that he had with Mangione. It's already been reported that that arresting officer, when asked Mangione, the first words out of his mouth, it's been reported, he asked Mangione, were you in New York? And his -- and certainly Mangione, at least this officer claims that he was very nervous when asked that question. So there will be testimony. There will be evidence. But Mangione can waive it. I mean, depending on whether he waves it, it doesn't sound -- to Brianna's point, doesn't sound like he may waive extradition, may waive the hearing. And if he does waive the hearing, then he will be extradited without any further process. It doesn't sound like that's going to happen. It will have to be -- it certainly sounds like there will be this process with witnesses and evidence being set forth before the judge. And the judge will make the ultimate ruling that there is probable cause to establish that Mangione is, in fact, the alleged killer of Brian Thompson.",

And although firefighters said that there was minimal damage, they haven't given us an exact amount of structures that have been burned. But we actually did see one that has burned to the ground.If you actually look behind me, there's some smoke coming out from the canyon, down below the canyon there. That's where we went back to. And we did see at least one home that was completely destroyed. We also saw another home that was burning that firefighters were trying to douse with water. We spoke with a woman who lives back there. She said she barely escaped with her life last night. She was able to get a horse out, and she was able to get some of her animals to safety. But the barn burned down, luckily, right after the animals were set free. And she said that it was incredibly traumatizing because they had no power. She -- so her phone had died. She had no service. And therefore, she didn't get any kind of alert. She just woke up and looked outside and the entire hillside was covered in flames, and they just had minutes to spare. So that is a bit of a concern that -- that may be discussed in the coming days, that because the power was shut off, some people did not have access to cell phone service. And we've had a lot of issues today with having any kind of reception here. So as you can see, the winds have died down right now, but there is concern that they're going to pick back up again this evening. I do want to mention that my cell phone actually just now cut out.
