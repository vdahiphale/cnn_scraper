Regulators close and seize Silicon Valley Bank, rattling financial markets and raising fears that other banks might collapse.Also tonight, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is making his debut in the key 2024 battleground state of Iowa. He has an event soon putting his presidential ambitions very much in the spotlight just days before Donald Trump campaigns in the state. This, as Trump has been invited to appear before a grand jury investigating his alleged role in covering up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The move signaling a decision on whether to charge Trump may happen soon. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the historic collapse of a California bank. U.S. stock prices sliding amid questions about whether this is an isolated case or a sign of things to come. CNN's Chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly is following the story for us, along with economist Mark Zandi and our own Matt Egan. Matt, first to you. How serious is this bank collapse?",

That makes this the biggest collapse of a bank in the United States since Washington Mutual back in 2008. Now, the FDIC has seized control of the bank. They say that depositors will get their money by Monday morning, up to the $250,000 insurance limit. But we know that some individuals and startups, they have more than that in the bank, and it's not clear what's going to happen to them.So, how did this happen and how did it happen so quickly? Look at this dramatic decline in the share price of the parent company. It dropped 60 percent yesterday alone after the bank warned that they need to rapidly raise cash. Now, that appeared to spark a panic in a run on the bank. This is also a symptom of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, designed to tame inflation, because we know that these rate hike spikes, they tend to break things in financial markets. They've also hurt the value of tech startups like the ones that this bank caters to. Now, all of this is rattling investors. We see the market. The Dow closed down almost 350 points, 1.1 percent. That's after a sell off yesterday. Investors are wondering, is this a canary in the coal mine or is this a one off? U.S. financial regulators, they held an unscheduled meeting. And I just talked to the Deputy Treasury Secretary, Wally Adeyemo, and he told me that he's very confident, Wolf, in the resilience of the system and that regulators have the tools they need to deal with this situation.",

And that meeting earlier today between Secretary Yellen and the top regulatory officials at the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve was a critical component of the response up to this point.But one point White House officials make, as has been repeated by regulators as well, is that the U.S. financial system, the banking system writ large, is in a very different place than it was in 2008. And that is because of significant changes in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis related to capital controls, capital levels, how banks are essentially kind of have buffers to moments like this to try and address when certain risks or certain crises start to come to pass. Now, it's interesting to note, Wolf, it has been several years since the FDIC has had to take a bank into a receivership. Even that is kind of strange when you think back to the 2008 financial crisis, when hundreds of banks were going down on a regular basis. It goes to the reality of this moment. This is a different type of scenario than this White House has had to face at any point during President Biden's time in office. However, they make very clear that the industry, they believe, is in a fundamentally different place. The regulators have the tools they need to address this specific issue and any issues that come from it. And they believe, at least at this point in time, they're well positioned going forward.",

And I think even economists inside the White House thought they would be in at this moment in time, given how rapidly the Federal Reserve has acted to raise interest rates.What they say underscores the fact that there is real strength in the U.S. economy going forward. The only concern to some degree, although officials won't talk about it publicly for fear of getting involved with the Federal Reserve in any way, shape or form, is that this will only cause the Fed to continue to raise rates at a faster pace, therefore threatening the economic recovery that has been so rapid.

And prosecutors are looking at not just the payment, but how it was reimbursed. You remember the former president had signed those checks to Michael Cohen, reimbursing him for advancing the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. Now, possible charge on the table here could be a misdemeanor for falsifying business records that would relate to how the Trump Organization recorded these reimbursement checks in their own books and records. And if they were to try to prove a felony, they would move to look for falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. And in this case, it would be possible campaign finance charges, since those payments to Daniels were made just days before the 2016 presidential election. Now, the former president has denied any knowledge of the payments. And last night on his platform, Truth Social, he expanded on his denial, saying, \"I did absolutely nothing wrong. I never had an affair with Stormy Daniels, nor would I have wanted to have an affair with Stormy Daniels.

I just think within a primary, it may actually give him a boost. Now, I don't think the same thing would happen whether it's Georgia or January 6, but I hope I'm wrong. I think in this case, it may give him a boost in a primary.",

So by tomorrow morning, that's three days that ordinary people have been unable to wash, unable to heat themselves, essentially living in their homes as they would do in caves. And it's pretty cold out here.What we're seeing though, in terms of military activity, along that front line is an uptick. We spent the day in Kopychyntsi (ph), which is here in Kharkiv region. We saw an awful lot of incoming and outgoing artillery, Wolf, but we also heard that it was mainly around Bakhmut. That is what the Ukrainian forces are saying. Once again, that is the hottest point along that long front line against which the Russians have been pushing, trying to get it to go westwards these last few days. An awful lot of activity that's once again seen Wagner mercenaries claiming taking one of the villages to the north of Bakhmut. We have no way of independently confirming that. But one video released by Yevgeny Prigozhin showing his men, the musicians, as they're known, with their instruments, eerily playing their music in that village, he says.",

And Holmes told me that McConnell is lobbying hospital staff to essentially get out. He's being -- he's impatient, wants to come back to work, wants to get back out, get out of the hospital, go back home. The question is exactly when that will happen.He is being treated for a concussion after the 81-year-old fell, after speaking at an event for his super PAC at the Waldorf Historian Hotel here in Washington. After he fell, he was rushed to the hospital and has been there since Thursday night. He's -- it's unclear exactly when he will be discharged. But I am told that he is back. He's taking meetings. He's acting like his normal self. He took political meetings to talk about the Senate 2024 map. He got a readout of their closed door meeting of the Republican conference members yesterday, lamented the fact that they were served halibut behind closed doors and he did not have any. He said he wished he was there for the halibut. But more importantly, the questions about his own fitness to serve. I'm told that there is no question that he'll be back and that he will serve as Republican leader. And that was -- there's no question about it whatsoever according to Holmes, his senior -- Josh Holmes, his senior advisor. So, Mitch McConnell expected to be back. When that will happen is uncertain, Wolf, but likely next week. Of course, Wolf, this is not his first time he has fallen. Also falling in 2019, fractured his shoulder at the time. Someone who grew up having polio as a child has walked with a slight limp, so, sometimes has issues walking. But we're told from his close adviser that he is on the mend and expected out of the hospital soon and he wants out soon. Wolf.",

If you look from above, you can see all the workers who started to line up here, who started using the heavy equipment to start moving some of these rail cars back toward the track. This has been going on since 6We're about 70 miles away from Birmingham. And from what we're told, this train derailed here. Now this is near a home and I actually talked to the homeowner he said this is only the second time he knows of a train derailment in this area. Investigators, of course, are trying to figure out what exactly happened here. But as you can see from above from this drone, look at the destruction that was caused here by this derailment. You can see that they're trying to move the heavy equipment in to write some of these rail cars up. The good news here is there's no hazardous chemicals on board and we don't believe they're going to have to do any environmental cleanup in this area. But if you think about it, railway is a way that all the goods in this country get moved across this country. So people are focused on this. What exactly is going on? In this community alone, they are asking why -- what happened and should they be worried about these derailments that are happening throughout the country. So we wanted to show you this to you, Wolf, because obviously, in just the last half hour or so this heavy piece of the equipment have been brought in to sort of -- put these rail tracks back together because this has been blocked for several hours. And of course, they got to get it back open to get the railway moving back toward Birmingham. But as we speak, they're still trying to figure out exactly what happened. Wolf.",
