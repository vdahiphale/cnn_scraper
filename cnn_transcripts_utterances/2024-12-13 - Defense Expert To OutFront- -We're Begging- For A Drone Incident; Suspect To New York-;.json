And the government admits they don't know what's going on. That's what they say. Also breaking, New York authorities now saying they may get their hands on the alleged CEO assassin sooner than they expected. As we're learning, the FBI may have known who the alleged gunman was days before he was arrested. And Putin on the run. We've got brand new satellite images tonight showing Russia scrambling to pull its forces from one battle zone and fast. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. We're begging for an incident, those are the words of a former member of U.S. Special Operations Command on the drones flying over parts of the Eastern Seaboard tonight. Authorities across the northeast are right now on guard and prepared for more alarming drone sightings. Sightings that now surround New York City and are dangerously close to a number of sensitive sites, including a nuclear power plant from New Jersey to Connecticut. As you can see there on the map is were showing the number of sightings has been growing. People want answers. The Democratic Governor Shapiro, Josh Shapiro, spoke just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D), PENNSYLVANIA: I know they'll be flying helos. We'll be flying helicopters to try and determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are. We've been conducting exercises. We'll be doing more this evening as well, and try and get to the bottom of it here in Pennsylvania. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He tells us that firefighters are now being advised to wear hazmat suits when responding to a downed drone. Police being told to call the bomb squad.

And that's why I've demanded answers from them at the very least, to tell us what they are doing to determine what's going on. There is a system of rules relating to the altitude that's permissible for these drones. The kind of remote identification that is necessary when they are flown. There is a whole fabric of restrictions on where they can go in terms of sensitive sites, and there's no explanation for why these agencies the FAA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and others like the FBI have no knowledge about apparently any of these drones. And now there are hundreds of them. People are texting me.

And, Seth, I know you've talked about you know, this is begging for an incident. I know you have some new intel about these drones that have now been spotted, frankly, across multiple states up and down the east coast. What can you share? SETH JONES, PRESIDENT, DEFENSE &amp; SECURITY DEPARTMENT, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, Erin, I think the issue here is this is a national problem. I know the recent focus has been on states like Connecticut and New Jersey, but if you even look at the last month or so, I'll just point to two interesting incidents in November of 2024, there was a man arrested in the Nashville area for an armed drone plotting an attack against an electricity substation. So that's -- that is clearly the use of a drone for an attack and a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, again using a drone. The second is there was an arrest this week in California of a Chinese citizen illegally, allegedly illegally flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force base in California. He was arrested for taking photo reconnaissance of a very sensitive location. So these are just two examples where we have individuals that have been arrested, one for an armed alleged armed attack, the other for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. In addition, we have information of almost 100,000 cases based on sensor pickup of observed drones flying over critical infrastructure in the United States. So there's a big problem here.",

There are big intelligence gaps. And again, another reason this is a challenge, as we've seen in countries like Ukraine and Israel, drones can be used for very nefarious purposes, purposes for collecting intelligence and strike.So the fact that we have so many instances where we actually don't know means we've got to find a way to collect better information on it.",

So the question here, now, we know that the San Francisco PoliceDepartment had flagged Mangione for the FBI. The FBI has confirmed that they passed on that name to the NYPD. So the question becomes, you know, was there some sort of communication breakdown along the way? Did the NYPD take this tip seriously? What action did they take once they got this tip? So there's a lot of open questions, a lot of open questions. And of course, there we don't know yet whether he was planning to do something additional. Obviously if he did, he didn't get to that point. But every day that was lost could have been a day that something horrific could have happened. So obviously this is hugely significant. And Michael, thank you very much. As I said, reporter for \"The San Francisco Chronicle\", breaking this important part of the story. I want to bring in Andrew McCabe, now former FBI deputy director. So Director McCabe, can I just start actually with something that Michael emphasized? It's really important. Within one day of the shooting, when we first get that image right, when he's, you know, flirting with the person, checking him into the hostel in New York, that picture goes out. Okay. And within hours, San Francisco police officer calls and says, this looks like Luigi Mangione, okay. Not his mother, not his siblings, not his father, not any of his friends, not anyone else in his family. It just worth a moment to just, you know, his mother knew he was missing and had reported him and they didn't -- they saw this picture and didn't say anything, at least so far as we know.",

It's something I've been thinking about for days, even outside the context of this tip, you have to assume that there are probably if you if you diagramed out Mangione entire network of friends, associates, relatives, people. He shared hotel rooms with, people he traveled with. You're talking about hundreds of people who were familiar with what he looked like, probably recently familiar with what he looked like.That photograph was everywhere, and as far as we know, none of those people recognized it or called in. And here you have one isolated police officer or detective in San Francisco who has, you know, knows Mangione only through the report made by his mother, and he's able to pick him out from that imperfect photograph. Now, he's a professional. He looks at photographs all the time and trying to identify people from them, but it's still a remarkable contrast. I mean, it raises a lot of questions.",

This San Francisco Police Department detective or officer calls the FBI and says, I think this is Luigi Mangione. Within one day, and then days go by, the NYPD says they were never given the name. It was never in their pile. What do you think happened here?",

And then what that person or system did with it. When the public calls the FBI through the public tip line, those phone calls or emails or whatever form they come in are very carefully logged and recorded and then distributed.And there's a -- there's a trail you can kind of after the fact, go back and see how that happens. That's not always the case when someone in the law enforcement community has a piece of information to pass along, and they want to do it quickly, they might just call someone they know in the other agency, or they might call the headquarters office or the field office. So we really need to know more about how that information was handed off. Like a like a baton in a relay, right? So but clearly somewhere the sort of urgency and that that information should have commanded didn't happen. And that's really important for the NYPD and the FBI to understand how if there was a ball dropped here, how that happened and how do we avoid it in the future.",

Were there other things they were worried about? Were there concerns that were based on communications or the lack thereof, that they thought he might do something dangerous to himself or others? There's a lot of this story on what we call left of boom, right before the attack took place that we just don't know yet, and it would be important for us to figure out, to understand what the scope of this threat is.",

Now, her office is not releasing many additional details, but they are saying this, quote: Speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation. The speaker is currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she's unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL's engagement. She looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon. Now, two key details there. The former speaker continuing to work. Obviously, that is something that does not surprise us who watch her on Capitol Hill every day, despite the fact that she is no longer the speaker, she is still obviously a very key leader in the Democratic Party, someone who has a lot of influence over her Democratic colleagues. Also, we are not getting key details about when she would return to the United States.
