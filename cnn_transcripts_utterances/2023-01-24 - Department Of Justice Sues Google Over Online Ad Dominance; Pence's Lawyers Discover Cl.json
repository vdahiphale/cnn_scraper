Any moment, we expect the attorney general to speak about the U.S. government's new antitrust lawsuit against Google. We'll bring you that press conference, you can see there, as soon as it happens. A top Justice Department official may be asked about yet another famous politician being dragged into the classified document crisis. Mike Pence is the latest former West Winger to have documents found at his home. Also this hour, and it's a very busy hour, we are learning that U.S. officials are finalizing plans to send Abrams tanks to Ukraine. A busy day, but we start in Germany. Because Germany is set to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine according to German newspaper \"Der Spiegel\". It comes after weeks of pressure on the government from Ukraine as well as western allies. CNN has learned the White House is also finalizing plans to send U.S.-made Abrams tanks to Ukraine. And that is according to three U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations. The announcement could be made as soon as this week. Our international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in London. So, Nic, all this week, and in fact, last week, you and I were talking about, you know, why the U.S. wouldn't send Abrams tanks and why -- and why Germany was taking so long to agree. According to \"Der Spiegel\", they now may be considering it.",

      "sentences": "And it does seem to be a remarkable turn about. The U.S. position had been that the Abrams tankswere just unsuitable for use in Ukraine. They use jet fuel, they weigh 70 tons, they burn through a lot of that jet fuel just to move them at relatively short distance. They're very difficult to maintain. They have jet engines just like an aircraft in them, where as the German Leopard 2 tanks, the U.S. said was much more suitable. There was many more of them available, they're easier to maintain. They can go a greater distance. And therefore, the assessment was, much better suited for Ukraine's immediate needs. Germany made a real point of saying -- Olaf Scholz; the German chancellor made a real point of saying, look, I don't want to send my tanks. I don't want to get in this position without the U.S. sending theirs, without President Biden making a similar constructive move. And that really sort of put both sides at loggerheads. And then you had all the other nations in Europe that had the Leopard 2 tanks as well, they had purchased them from Germany. They couldn't re- export them to Ukraine without Germany say so. So, you have this backlog of countries, Poland was the most vociferous, but the Netherlands was in there, Norway was in there as well, all getting ready to potentially send their Leopard 2 tanks, but they couldn't without the German authorization. So there was this real bottleneck, and until really the past hour or so, it appeared that this bottleneck was still a logjam. But this new reporting by \"Der Spiegel\" does seem to indicate U.S. deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman saying that at this moment, she now expects in the coming days to hear from Germany that they will make a move, make a commitment on their tanks. Details of course, we don't have those as yet.",

It's quite similar to one from the EU Commission. And it's really looking at how Google owns and controls different parts of the digital advertising space. So, essentially, what it is saying, as a result of Google's control, the DOJ says that website creators end up earning less and advertisers have to pay more, because they say, there is an unfettered competitive pressure for prices. Now, they are saying that, on average, Google keeps at least 30 cents, sometimes more, of each advertising dollar that flows from the advertiser to the website publisher, because it owns little different parts of the space. And they say that Google has gone out of its way to eliminate competition by acquiring businesses that are also in that space, and putting pressure on lots of businesses to use their technology. So this isn't necessarily a new complaint, but this is a big case in the pipeline.",

Pence's former presidential partner, Donald Trump, and current U.S. President Joe Biden, are both under investigation for their handling of classified documents.

It appears, based on the facts that we know right now, that these documents were packed up in boxes, moved to his temporary residence, and then they were moved along to Indiana. Now, these were not in a secure storage area. That is a problem. But former President Trump and current President Biden, their cases became more complicated because of what they and their attorneys did after they discovered documents. It appears here that Pence did the search out of an abundance of caution, and then as soon as they discovered something, they passed it on to the FBI. We know former President Trump did not cooperate with the Justice Department. He was retaining hundreds of classified documents and allegedly tried to obstruct the investigation. Now President Biden, they have tried to be much more cooperative after they found classified documents, but there have been frustrations inside the Justice Department that it took them so long to search his houses. That they did a search of one of his houses without telling them, and then they weren't fully transparent with the American public. So, while you have special counsels appointed in both of those cases, if Pence's people are being fully transparent, and this is all that happened, it's unlikely this is going to prompt a criminal investigation.

He was discovered in the parking lot of the police substation and was taken into custody relatively without any issues. He's expected to be in court tomorrow.

Some residents say, the authorities are targeting them from being part of those rallies. CNN's Selina Wang spoke, has this story, in fact. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  \"If you're seeing this video, that means I've already been taken by the police.\" These are the chilling words of a young woman in China who took part in this demonstration in Beijing on November 27th. It was one of dozens of anti-zero COVID protests that erupted in cities across China. They're chanting that they don't want COVID tests. They want freedom. Police mind the streets but the mood was calm and peaceful. Many were there to mourn the lives lost and China's Urumqi city where a deadly fire broke out in a lockdown building. This 26-year-old woman, an editor at a publishing house said that is why she and her friends took to the streets. She said they follow the rules and didn't have any conflict with the police. Soon after filming this, she was arrested. She knew her time was nearing. CNN has learned from sources that weeks after the protest, police started rounding up her friends one by one. Most of them also young female professionals. We tracked down and interviewed one of her friends who's been tirelessly searching for her for not revealing her name or any of the sources we've spoken to because of concerns of retribution from the Chinese state. Authorities want to intimidate ordinary people, she said, they want to turn people into emotionless machines. We can't even gather together to grieve. Police swiftly crackdown on the protesters in some cities violently pushing and dragging the demonstrators but the Beijing protesters peacefully dispersed. Afterwards, police blanketed protest sites. In some places, authorities check cell phones for virtual private networks and track down participants with cell phone data. Soon after, China dropped its zero COVID policy and opened up. In his New Year's Eve address, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said it was \"only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue.\" But behind the scenes, their loved ones say the retribution continues. \"She's paying a heavy price. We were born into this land so naturally we would want to make China better. But now I feel there's nothing that we can do,\" she says, breaking down into tears. Authorities have made no official comment about the detention and will likely never know how many people have been detained in connection with the protests if it's dozens hundreds or more. As people across China are celebrating the Lunar New Year with their newfound freedom. The young woman says the mothers of her and her friends want to know why their daughters were taken from them. In her final words in the video message, she made this call for help. \"Don't let us be taken away or convicted arbitrarily. Don't let us disappear from this world unjustly.\"",
