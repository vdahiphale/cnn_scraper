We kick off another important week for global marketsU.S. politics, as well as the fight to protect our planet. The opening ceremony at the UN Climate Conference, COP 27 began with a stark warning from the UN Secretary General saying we're on a \"Highway to climate hell\". Now the challenge is only exacerbated of course by the spending splurge during the COVID pandemic and the energy crisis following the war in Ukraine. Climate justice though too in the spotlight, with developing nations hard hit by the global warming crisis, they say they did not create and they're asking the industrialized world for billions of dollars in compensation to help them adapt. We can't separate the burden of course of climate change too, on global health systems. We'll hear from Dr. Vanessa Kerry, the Co-Founder and CEO of Seed Global Health, who says the medical community, has barely begun to plan for the climate emergencies to come. In the meantime, the market climate cautious after last week's sharp losses and with political risk, of course, ahead with the U.S. midterm elections, polls show control of the Senate still up for grabs investors hoping above all, I think for a clean and quick outcome. And tech travels remain in the spotlight too after the NASDAQ 5 percent tumble last week. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Meta, the parent company of Facebook is about to lay off thousands of workers as the company grapples with a serious advertising sales slowdown and of course, growing uncertainty over its Metaverse moonshot spending as we've discussed on the show. Now add to that Apple warning of an iPhone delivery pressures as driven by China's COVID restrictions at the Foxconn manufacturing plant. We don't really get a sense yet of the scale of that. But in the meantime, Asia is higher, even as China pushes back on speculation that those zero COVID policies might soon ease. Goldman Sachs today saying Beijing is still \"Months away from any zero COVID walk back\". So a busy show as always, let's begin with the latest from the COP 27 Summit in Egypt and Becky Anderson, is there for us, Becky, great to have you with us! And I think the UN Secretary General laid out the scale of the challenge really well.",

But look what Apple is saying here is if you'replanning to buy the new iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max well, you're going to have to wait a little bit longer to get those new products because the latest lineup of products are being impacted by these COVID restrictions in China. This doesn't come as a surprise given the lock downs and the COVID situation in Zhengzhou which is where Apple's biggest iPhone assembly facility is located where analysts estimate that up to 85 percent of the iPhone capacity is running for that assembly. So Apple is saying that the capacity there has been significantly reduced. Apple here is really just the latest victim to China's zero COVID policies. Chinese businesses, global businesses, they're all being hit by this endless cycle of lockdowns, quarantines, mass testing, taking a massive and growing toll on the economy and on people's lives. And since mid-October, that factory in Zhengzhou, has been struggling to deal with a COVID outbreak. Last week we talked about those viral videos showing migrant workers fleeing the factory trying to get away from those COVID restrictions walking miles on highways to try and get back to their homes. And last week, authorities also imposed a seven day lockdown over the area there are houses there are factories so, all of this putting huge pressure on Apple and its major supplier Foxconn right before this key holiday shopping season. Now we also talked about last week how there were these unfounded rumors that China was going to start to exit its zero COVID policy. Investors they are desperate for any piece of good news that those rumors caused a big share jump. However, authorities this weekend they quashed those rumors and oppressor they said China is unwaveringly sticking to zero COVID. We are seeing authorities double down on this policy with more lockdowns, more mass testing more quarantines, protests even breaking out in some areas, including Tibet, in Lhasa, Tibet where they've been locked down for three months. This is continuing and year three of the pandemic it means that China is a less attractive place for foreign investment. It means that this country is getting more and more isolated as well Julia.",

TheWorld Health Organization has reported that less than 1 percent of multilateral climate finance is currently directed to health related projects. Well, our next guest says investing in health systems around the world is essential to economic and social well-being as well as national security. And that includes protection against climate related shocks by investing in our healthcare workforces. The W.H.O. also estimates there will be a shortfall of 18 million health workers by 2030. Now for the past 10 years Seed Global Health has been working to strengthen those health systems since its founding. It has partnered with four countries Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia and 30 institutional partners. The organization has placed over 200 physicians, nurse and midwife educators and taught nearly 28,000 trainees.

And I think that it's, you know, most people don't realize, but there's very strong data between better health and better GDP growth, and or whether a household lives above or below the poverty line? And a lot of that is tied to creating jobs for women, a lot of that is tied to making an investment in somebody's their main asset, which is their ability to go to work.

I think this really underscores the pace at which things are happening, because as you mightremember, it was just October 27, that Elon Musk actually took control of Twitter. And so some 10 days later, I mean, Twitter, of course, has let go. Its top executive is Elon Musk has let go some of the top executives at Twitter, we know half the staff was laid off as of Friday. And then these reports surfaced just days later that apparently, Elon Musk and some of the top at Twitter actually want some of these folks to come back. And it is unclear at this point, Julia, if that's because these people were not supposed to be let go to begin with. Or if it was a big oops, actually, we really might need you now I can tell you that we here at CNN have reached out to Twitter. But here's something that's interesting, folks who we have communicated with before who we have worked with before. Well, those emails are bouncing back implying that they too may have been let go. So it really just speaks to the dizzying pace at which things are happening. And it is, of course unsettling, perhaps to the employees both presently and former, but also advertisers. And you're starting to hear big advertisers start to pump the brakes and pull back as folks wonder what is going on inside of Twitter. Some new features have also been unveiled, but then they've been pulled back including, as you mentioned, Julia of the blue check verification program for $8 a month that on Saturday was unveiled in a launch and an update. But then we got word here at CNN that the sprint to our launch continues. But some folks may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real time, Julia again in real time, so things are happening very quickly at Twitter and I would argue for some perhaps a bit too quickly.",
