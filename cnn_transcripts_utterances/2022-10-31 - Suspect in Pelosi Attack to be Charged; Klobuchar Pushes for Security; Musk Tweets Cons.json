      "sentences": "Good Monday morning. I'm Erica Hill.It is a very busy start to the week today. We are following a number of major stories this hour. A violent assault. The man accused of attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband expected to be charged with multiple felonies today. CNN has learned he had zip ties, duct tape and a hammer during that attack. We are live in San Francisco. Plus, deadly crush. More than 150 people killed after being caught in a suffocating crowd at a Halloween festival in Seoul, South Korea. What we're now learning about the two Americans who are among the dead. And next hour the Supreme Court set to hear arguments in two cases that could upend how college admissions are decided by eliminating or restricting race-conscious programs. Let's begin this hour with the latest on that investigation, though, into the violent attack on Paul Pelosi. CNN correspondent Veronica Miracle is in San Francisco. Melanie Zanona is on Capitol Hill. Veronica, let's begin with you. The suspect set to be charged today. What more are we learning about what happened in those early hours at the Pelosi residence?",

      "sentences": "Well, good morning, Erica.The details that we're learning this morning are very disturbing. We're told by the San Francisco district attorney's office that the suspect, David DePape, went upstairs into the bedroom where Paul Pelosi was sleeping before the attack. We understand that he tried to tie him up and was yelling, where is Nancy? That's according to sources close to the investigation. We're also told that he brought zip ties, duct tape and a hammer that was used in the attack. Sources have told us that Paul Pelosi is expected to make a full recovery, but he is dealing with very serious injuries, recovering from a skull fracture, injuries to his arm and his hands after being attacked by a hammer. And in addition to that, later today, the suspect, David DePape, is expected to be charged with multiple felonies. We understand that he is going to be facing attempted homicide, elder abuse, as well as assault with a deadly weapon. And federal officials are in discussions of possibly charging DePape with a federal crime. We understand that is specifically related to the -- to -- excuse me -- the assault, kidnapping or murder of a family member of certain federal officials. And that decision could come as early as this week according to a law enforcement source. Now, we briefly saw Speaker Pelosi leave her house yesterday. She came out of her garage quickly, got into her motorcade and took off. But she has sent a letter to her colleagues in the House of Representatives just explaining how difficult this has been for her and for her family. Erica.",

And lawmakers are particularly vulnerable when they are back home or on the campaign trail, as opposed to here in the secure Capitol where there's just police everywhere.Now, of course, the threat of political violence is not new. There was a shooting in 2017 on a GOP baseball practice. But the level of threats have spiked significantly since January 6th. And the environment has just certainly gotten uglier since then. But the Capitol Police Department is dealing with really limited resources. And it is just not realistic to give every single member a security detail. But Congress did provide $10,000 for each office to secure their homes and the United States Capitol Police sent out an email over the weekend reminding lawmakers what resources are available to them. And that includes residential security assessments, coordinating with local law enforcement, security briefings and patrols of members' homes. But some lawmakers say that isn't enough. Listen to Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): There has to be a different level of threat that allow members to get protection. Maybe it's local police. Maybe it's more funding for the marshals. I have a bipartisan amendment that will allow members to take their private information off of the Internet. There is a similar provision that has been put forth for judges. And this is part of the National Defense Reauthorization Act. So, I'm very hopeful that finally I'll be able to get the support to get this done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, frankly, one would think that if they were to have promoted it and they realized that it wasn't true, that they would be a little bit more remorseful.Elon Musk, he deleted this tweet yesterday afternoon and he hasn't really address it outside of attacking \"The New York Times\" for promoting it. So, I'll read you his tweet. He's kind of just dismissing this as a joke. He says, this is fake. I did not tweet out a link to \"The New York Times\" when \"The Times\" reported that he had linked to a site known to promote false news and conspiracy theories. Erica, I think larger -- more largely this really just points to how broken our information environment is where just a couple days after this brutal attack on the speaker's husband you have someone like Elon Musk tweeting this conspiracy theory. And it's not just him.  It's being pushed by a lot of prominent right wing media personalities. Frankly, though, someone like Elon Musk, who is in control of Twitter and does play a key role in this information environment should be working to clean it up, not really contaminating it himself.",

They're expected to tell the jury that the Trump Organization had failed to report and pay payroll taxes on certain compensation and benefits that they gave to top Trump Organization officials. One of those executives, the former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty. He's expected to testify in this case for the prosecution. And he's going to tell the jury that he received cars, he received an apartment in Manhattan and he received private school tuition for his grandchildren that he never paid taxes on. Now, next up will be the defense. And there are two Trump entities that are indicted in this case. So that means there will be two opening statements. Two efforts for them to tell their story to the jury. We expect that they are going to say that Weisselberg was a rogue employee who made these deals and these arrangements in order to enrich himself but not to benefit the Trump Organization. Now, after that, the prosecution will call their first witness. We're expecting that to be a current member of the Trump Organization, the current controller, Jeffrey McConney. Now, he testified under an immunity deal with the Manhattan district attorney's office, but they say that he is a co-conspirator in this alleged scheme. He will provide some insight of the company, details and information to walk the jury through this. But the judge has told the jury to expect that this trial will last six weeks.

Now, these documents, from late 2020, were handed over to lawmakers on Friday after a federal judge ordered them to be released, and they include four communications between Trump attorneys that appear to show that they knew the details they submitted to courts in their challenges to the elections were false. Now, the other four emails show lawyers discussing filing lawsuits as a strategy to hold off the congressional certification of Trump's loss. Now, one email even lays out the concerns that lawyers had about submitting a declaration signed by Trump personally affirming the election fraud allegations that it presented to the court were true, even after the former president had been made aware that some of those allegations were indeed not true. Now, the judge in this case, as you noted, has suggested that these emails could be evidence of a conspiracy to defraud the United States, which is why they're being released. Now, the judge said that these materials fit what is called the crime fraud exception, which allows the disclosure of otherwise privileged materials if those communications were related to the furtherance of a crime. Now, Eastman is appealing. He wants a federal appeals court to tell the House to return or destroy these eight emails. Now, the Ninth Circuit is moving fast on that long shot request.
