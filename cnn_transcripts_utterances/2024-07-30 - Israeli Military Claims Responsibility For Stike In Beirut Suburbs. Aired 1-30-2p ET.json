David, your response to this apparent strike by the IDF in Beirut? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it sounds to me like General Hertling's got this just right if this is the response. In other words, if this is not the leading edge of something else. Yes, I think it's closer to what the United States was urging, a targeted attack, presumably, on commanders who we're responsible, in Israel's view, for that horrific attack on the playground and soccer field that resulted in the deaths of those children. If it is the beginning of something larger, then we're into something different. We've just seen a tweet on X from the defense minister of Israel, Defense Minister Gallant, saying that Hezbollah had crossed a red line. But he didn't give any suggestion that there is a larger response underway. So the dynamic we have seen is that neither Hezbollah nor the Israelis feel prepared this moment, or the Iranians for that matter, to get into a wider conflict, as General Hertling already noted. Israel's forces are stretched quite thin. Hezbollah doesn't want to miscalculate here and result in a general war in Lebanon. And the Iranians have shown time and again that while they are willing to arm and strike out, they don't want to be in a general war either. Thus, their -- their pull back in April. So if this is it, and if we don't see very widespread civilian casualties, then I would say the administration got what it was seeking from the Israelis.",

So on the Israeli side, if there we're widespread civilian casualties, even if they said that they were going after a Hezbollah commander unit, you'd have the same kind of issues that we've seen in Gaza where they said they we're were going after Hamas commanders, but we've repeatedly seen major -- major troubles.Not clear at all at this point how widespread the damage is. That's just going to take time to figure out. If Hezbollah, right, reacts and attacks again in northern Israel and has civilian casualties, that, too, could be a trigger. But the hope is here that both sides step back.",

Because what the Israeli military statement says, the IDF statement says is this was a targeted strike.I've got the statement in front of me here. A strike on the commander, the Hezbollah commander responsible for the murder of the children in Majdal Shams that that rocket attack on the soccer pitch at the weekend in the Golan -- the Golan Heights. Also the killing of other Israeli civilians as well. And so what the Israeli military are saying is that this was a very targeted strike on specifically the Hezbollah commander, who they hold responsible for the deaths of those 12 people from the Druze community inside northern Israel at the weekend. The indications from the Israeli government and the authorities is that is that this is a specific, precise response to that. It doesn't necessarily indicate that this is the start of a broader campaign to push Hezbollah back from the border of northern Israel, in southern -- in southern Lebanon. It may become that but, at the moment, that's not what the Israelis seem to be indicating.",

There was, of course, the attack in April on the Iranian consular access that targeted Revolutionary Guard from Iran and the Quds Force commanders. But this isn't something -- even if this is considered a small strike -- we don't see the pancaking of buildings -- this is something that is really going to be seen by people in Beirut as something very significant.",

It's also been done before and there's usually been a pretty big reaction, as you mentioned, about targeting the Iranian commanders earlier this year.But in this case, that neighborhood where they have struck appears to be the area near where the Shura Council meets, which is the sort of governing council of Hezbollah. The Israelis have said they had a specific commander in mind. I don't think they've named that commander. And we don't know whether that commander was killed, injured, or even there during the time of the strike. But the pattern of destruction here seems to radiate the thought that this was a targeted strike, not a general one. And you know, it's interesting, you wonder whether the Israelis are beginning to take on board the American criticisms, which we're in response to some of the strikes against Hamas down in Gaza about using large bombs in crowded neighborhoods. That doesn't mean that there weren't civilian casualties here. I can't imagine that there weren't. But it was a much more targeted weapon. And we heard from the State Department just today that their biggest hope here is to avoid escalation. So all a question now of how many we're killed and how Hamas -- how Hezbollah responds?",
