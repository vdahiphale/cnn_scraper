Ahead here on \"CNN Newsroom,\" Ukraine is strengthening its true positions against Russia bracing for the heaviest battles ahead in the fight for Kherson. CNN is on the frontlines as Putin lobs a new threat at the west.Plus, Kim Jong-un continues to fire an unprecedented number of missiles with two more just in the last few hours, while a live report coming up. And Twitter has got a brand-new boss as Elon Musk's takeover is finally official. And the new era starting with a flurry of firings. We begin this hour in Russia where President Vladimir Putin appears to be playing down fears of a nuclear standoff with the west. He denies threatening to use nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine saying he was only responding to nuclear blackmail from western leaders. Putin also accused western at least of playing a, quote, \"dangerous, bloody and dirty game\" by blaming Russia from the world's problems. Fighting on the ground in Ukraine has slowed in the past few days with Kyiv's forces slowed by rough terrain and bad weather in the Kherson region. Ukraine's military reports Russian troops there are facing shortages of equipment and warm winter clothing. But Russian strikes on Ukraine's power grid are taking their toll. The capital city is on the brink of complete blackouts with severe and unprecedented restrictions on power use. Ukraine's president says the country must be prepared. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation): Shelling will not break us. To hear the enemies anthem on our land is scarier than the enemies rockets in our sky.

And yet, when we saw the results, the -- Bolsonaro came up with about 42.4 percent and Lula 48 percent.So it's actually the polls don't necessarily reflect the results. There's a lot of reasons for that. We see this across the world. A response to pollsters is not only always genuine. Voting intentions may have changed. It's almost been a month since the first round, and both candidates have been doing their best to harness support from parts of the base of the opponent. And it's also not clear yet where the 7 percent that the two -- the third and fourth candidates received would go. So, the polls are looking good for Lula, but they're not showing a result that would make us certain that he's going to secure the win. And also, what I think is very clear, unless we're very surprised is that whoever wins will have a very small lead, which of course, as we know, including from other countries means a polarized country, a very difficult is in harnessing congressional support.

Authorities say the painting didn't suffer damage and will be back on display as soon as possible.

The painting was pelted with mashed potatoes but was unharmed since it was covered by glass.
