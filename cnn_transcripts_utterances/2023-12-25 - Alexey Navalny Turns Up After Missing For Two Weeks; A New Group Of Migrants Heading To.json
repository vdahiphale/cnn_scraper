We are just getting more details about his current whereabouts from his legal team. And, of course, the director of his Anti-Corruption Foundation. We are now learning that he is being held, and has been moved to a penal colony near Siberia, some 2,000 miles away from Moscow, in comparison to the penal colony he was held in before, believed to be held in some hundred 50 miles east of Moscow. Now, there is concern around the conditions he may be facing in thispenal colony. We have this statement from the director of his Anti- Corruption Foundation, saying just a little while ago, Navalny's is in colony IK-3 in Kharp called Polar Wolf, one of the northernmost, almost remote colonies. The conditions there are harsh, with a special regime, in the permafrost zone. It is very difficult to get there, and there are no letter delivery systems. Now, his lawyer is said to have visited him today at the penal colony, confirming his presence there. Alexey Navalny, of course, a key critic of President Vladimir Putin. He was sentenced back in August of this year to 19 years in prison for charges related to extremism. He had already been serving 11-1/2 years in prison in a penal colony for other charges, including fraud. These are, of course, charges that Navalny has consistently denied. He, his lawyers, and his supporters have accused judges of handing out this charge, and prison sentence for politically motivated reasons. That is how his supporters have described it. Of course, Navalny has been one of the biggest critics of Vladimir Putin, and as pose perhaps one of the most serious threats to Vladimir Putin's legitimacy during his rule, and has faced continuous threats from the Kremlin. But, of course now, there will be serious concern over the situation he may be facing there. Particularly, of course, with little contact available between him and his team, his lawyers, and Alexey Navalny.",

We are talking about thousands of migrants who will be here at the U.S. southern border in the next few weeks. In addition to the ones that have already arrived here in Eagle Pass, Texas, at the border with Mexico. This is a community of U.S. less than 30,000 people that has to deal with thousands of immigrants arriving every week here. And what you see behind me is a holding area for those migrants to surrender to immigration officials either at points along the border, or at a port of entry, wait to be processed. Troy Miller, the interim director for Customs and Border Protection earlier said that the influx of migrants, they are currently seeing across the southwest border is presenting a serious challenge to CBP personnel. This new migrant surge, Kate, is also putting a lot of pressure on local law enforcement. This is what Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber had to say about this great challenge.

And then by Wednesday, this rain, wind, clouds, low cloud cover, that's all going to be over the big airports in the Northeast. There's your snow into Denver. Skiers are going to love that.

So I don't think you can pay with a broad brush, and look at 236 years of history. You have to look at, specifically, what you did, and what the consequences should be.

Before any single prosecutor can ask a court to sit in judgment of the president's conduct, Congress must have approved of it by impeaching and convicting the president.

Look, you know, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. And Trump, that applies to him to, but the issue is, I do not see any precedent, I don't see any legal authority, or anything else, which would suggest, that simply because there are impeachment proceedings, that that would operate as a bar to a federal prosecution.
