Calls for an independent investigation in Gaza after dozens of people were killed in an Israeli strike at a U.N. school where many Palestinians were seeking shelter. Remembering the bravery and sacrifice 80 years ago, world leaders warn that democracy is still at risk. And as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi works to form his new government, we'll look at the role one group in particular may have played denying him an outright majority. There are growing calls for an investigation into a deadly Israeli airstrike on a U.N. school in central Gaza, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had been seeking shelter. The attack killed dozens of people, including children and wounded many more. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza says 6,000 people were sheltering at the school at the time the bombs hit. The E.U.'s top diplomat is calling for an independent investigation into the incident. A CNN analysis found U.S.-made munitions were used to carry out Thursday's strike. Fragments of at least two American small-diameter bombs were identified at the scene. More on that in a moment. Well Israel says it has identified nine of the roughly 30 alleged Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, it says, were the targets of the strike, but has offered no evidence so far. The spokesman for the U.N. chief condemned the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANE DUJARRIC, SPOKESMAN, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL; It's just another horrific example of the price that civilians are paying, that Palestinian men, women and children who are just trying to survive, who are being forced to move around in sort of a death circle around Gaza, trying to find safety or pay.

And a warning, his report includes graphic content.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mohamed Farajala is still picking through the rubble of the airstrike that killed his brother. And alongside the blood-spattered walls, he is still finding pieces of flesh. He believes they are his brother's. May his soul rest in peace, he says. I wish I died instead. There is no hope in this life at all. Mahmoud is the second brother Mohamed has lost during the war. His third brother is in the hospital in critical condition, his skull fractured in the blast. Mohamed is not the only one sifting through the rubble. The Gaza health ministry says at least 40 people were killed when the Israeli military struck this building overnight. But this is no ordinary building. It's a U.N. school, converted, like so many others, into a shelter for thousands of Palestinians displaced from their homes. Blood-stained mattresses now filling the space where dozens were sleeping at the moment of impact. Fragments of an American-made GBU-39 bomb identified in the wreckage, according to munitions experts who reviewed this footage. Same type of munition used in the deadly strike in Rafah last month that killed 45 people. The Israeli military says it carried out a precision and intelligence- based strike, targeting 20 to 30 Palestinian militants, who it says were sheltering in the school and preparing attacks on Israeli troops. An Israeli military spokesman said the IDF was unaware of any civilian casualties. Hospital records tell a different story. Nine women and 14 children as young as four years old are among the dead delivered to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. [02:05:09] Those who survived also accuse Israel of targeting civilians. Netanyahu is killing the civilians. He is not killing militants, Shaber Abu Dahr says. It's innocent people asleep in an UNRWA facility. What did children and the elderly do? What did they do to him? The school is one of at least 180 UNRWA buildings to be hit since the beginning of the war, according to that U.N. agency. Attacking, targeting or using U.N. buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of international humanitarian law, wrote UNRWA chief Phillippe Lazzarini. But the devastation goes beyond U.N. facilities. Scenes like this have been playing out all week in central Gaza amid a clear uptick in Israeli airstrikes. Bloodied and covered in soot, survivors and victims alike have been arriving at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital at a rising clip. As one wounded child cries for her mother, another arrives at the morgue to say goodbye to his. Mama is going to visit grandpa, his father tells his son. Don't cry, you're a man, he says, but he is the one who breaks down. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, he later said he wasn't referring to Muslims, but he clearly made a very polarizing turn. So, in fact, he probably noticed that this was happening and he doubled down on religious appeals.

I mean, everyone had sort of heard these grumblings, and we knew that the grumblings exist. But let's keep in mind that the confidence that the BJP has had and the way that the country has become used to Modi as a serial winner. I mean, he's never not won a governing majority in his time in his 23 political career. And his cocktail of Hindu nationalism, of development, of the global standing, it has worked when it's a national election. It has worked. And so, I think it was a shock to everyone that the economic matters, the class and caste matters in this country really sort of made a larger mark than we had thought.
