It's great to be with you this morning. Over the weekend, former President Donald Trump won more than 60 percent of the vote in South Carolina, beating Nikki Haley in her home state. Still, that means nearly 40 percent of Republicans in that conservative Southern state did not vote for Trump. Haley made clear this weekend that she won't drop out of the race when so many voters on -- let's be honest, they're on both sides of the aisle -- they're not happy with their choices for president. Haley herself, even sounding at times like a third-party candidate.
