      "sentences": "Yes, as you say, this is the last chance for both the prosecution and Trump's lawyers to try to convince the jury to see the evidence their way.Now, Trump's lawyers are the ones up first. We expect that they will focus a lot of their attention on Michael Cohen, who is the only witness to directly tie Trump to the reimbursement scheme. And he is someone that they spent much of their defense case trying to undermine. And the expectation is that they will focus on his credibility, arguing to the jury that they can't convict Donald Trump on the word of a convicted liar. Now, the prosecution has already warned the jury in opening statements that Michael Cohen has a lot of baggage. But he is also someone that was close to Donald Trump at the time and that he did work for him. So, prosecutors will try to point the jury to other evidence that can corroborate Cohen's testimony, some of the text messages, phone call records, handwritten notes, as well as other witnesses' testimony, to try to convince the jury that they can believe Michael Cohen's testimony because he's not the only one to say that Donald Trump was involved in this. Now, there is no time limit on this. So the judge expects that the prosecution and Trump's attorneys will take the whole day tomorrow. He said that, if the jury -- it's possible they might have to stay late. If not, they can't finish, they will finish on Wednesday. But Wednesday is when the judge is expected to give the jury the jury instructions. That is the guide for the jurors to look at to see what the prosecution needs to prove in order for the jury to find Donald Trump guilty. Now, they will begin deliberating after that jury charge is given and deliberate as long as it takes for them to reach a verdict in what will be a historic verdict in this case -- Boris, Jessica.",

Let's discuss now with trial consultant Richard Gabriel and CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen. We should note that Norm investigated Trump as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee in the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump and litigated cases involving him previously. Thank you both for being with us on the holiday. Richard, so the -- these jurors have been on a break, away from the case since early last week. How does that kind of break impact closing arguments, the kind of arguments that we will hear? Do you think it might help either side?",

      "sentences": "It is, Boris.As you know, I have been there for every day of the trial, and it's clear that that is the strategy of Trump's defense team, to get at least one angry juror to try to hang this jury so there's no verdict, which the former president will claim as a victory. The problem is that these jurors, like all of the juries that I have encountered over my more than three decades practicing law, clearly take their responsibility seriously. And the prosecution has put in powerful evidence, powerful legal arguments, including at the charging conference that we had last week before recessing. I do think the prosecution has the upper hand. And the judge is going to tell them, you must decide this. You can, consistent with the facts and the law. That points away from a hung jury. As Richard will tell you, hung juries are very rare. Five or 6 percent of all juries hang.",

Isn't it going to be a challenge for them to do that, based on the fact that Trump actually hasn't been to this point convicted of that other crime?",

And I think, although Michael Cohen's credibility is going to be clearly focused on by the defense, I think they're going to spend a lot of time on these jury instructions, because there's a lot of nuance to them. There's a lot of complexity to them. And this is a fairly unique charge here. So, I think, a lot of times, the jurors are going to have to wrestle with -- and there's -- remember, there's two lawyers, there's two engineers, there's two financial people, all people with a great deal of sophistication in the areas that have been discussed during the trial. They're going to have to then connect the dots not only from the evidence standpoint, but, also, how do you then say this is actually a crime involving election interference? And so I think it is going to be challenging for the jurors to connect those dots in this fairly unique situation.",

      "sentences": "Boris, the prosecution knew that there would be questions raised by the defense, profound ones, about Michael Cohen.So what they did was build across the 20 days of trial a mosaic of corroborating and supporting evidence. So, for example, there's one part of Michael Cohen's testimony where his recollection on direct had to be refreshed on cross-examination. He didn't remember a part of the conversation. The defense says he lied, but the prosecution on redirect said, no, his recollection was refreshed. And there were 20 conversations. So, that kind of back-and-forth is I think what we're going to have in the jury room with this very sophisticated jury. And I do think the power -- the prosecution has put in a powerful case, but now it's going to be tested. This was no slam dunk. It was a tough case. And I do have faith in this jury -- they have been so attentive, so careful -- it's one of the most outstanding I have ever seen -- to get to the right answer.",

Emergency officials say seven people were killed here. Four of those victims were children. In fact, we spoke with the relative of one family that was just hit -- devastated by this. This is -- these cars and this debris that you see behind me, that is an area where a mother and two of her children were found dead by their -- the woman's brother-in-law. Their home was catapulted more than 100 yards, and it landed here just in the -- that's the remnants of what you see there. And those victims were found there just minutes after the storm blew through here. In all, some 100 people were injured as well. There was a convenience store along Interstate 35 where more than 100 people were scrambling to get out of the storm's path, only to find themselves directly hit by the storm. The building collapsed. Those people had to be rescued. But, right now, in what is becoming stifling heat, families are out here trying to clean up the pieces and what is left of this debris field, when families simply just -- in some cases, just kind of stunned as to where exactly you begin to clean up after this. We have seen people coming in with heavy equipment and just piling everything together, as you see behind me here. And, right now, the biggest need that families here need is temporary shelter, so that the work is being done to get these people housed while they rebuild, also clothing, because, as you can see, everyone's belongings have just been strewn all over the place. The Red Cross officials say that the storm system here in Texas kind of cut a path of 150 to 250 miles along -- throughout North Texas, so the damage and the devastation very intense in places like this, but also quite widespread as well -- back to you.
