The -- this is exactly what many were concerned about -- that given the fact there are near-daily attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria -- almost 160 since the Gaza war started -- there was a concern that there would be loss of life and then there would be more pressure on the U.S. President Joe Biden to do more.Now, there have been U.S. retaliatory strikes against some of the Iran proxies -- some of those Iranian-funded groups in both Iraq and Syria. But, of course, the pressure is now on for the U.S. president to do more, and the question is how much more will he feel the need to do. Now, the U.S. troops are in these areas, we understand, so that they can fight against ISIS. They were in this particular Tower 22 -- 350 U.S. personnel, according to Central Command -- so that they could assist with the U.S. ally, Jordan. And this is just on the border with Syria. Now, we have heard from one of the Iranian proxy groups. This is the Islamic Resistance in Iraq -- sort of an umbrella group of many other groups within Iraq. And they have said that they carried out attacks along that border on Sunday. But from the U.S.'s point of view, they are still saying that they want to find out exactly who carried this out -- which of the many groups. And there are many of these groups, which are funded, trained, and equipped by Iran that have been carrying out these attacks against U.S. personnel in the region -- Kasie.",

But look, once this gets announced there's a real question of whether or not it will have the votes to clear the Senate. Of course, there's that 60-vote threshold. You're going to need a swell of Republicans to support this thing. And as you mentioned, the politics have gotten extremely prickly in recent days, particularly with the former president and Speaker Mike Johnson getting involved -- both throwing cold water on it. The president said -- the former president saying that Republicans shouldn't accept a border deal unless it's perfect. Speaker Johnson saying that if the ultimate agreement is what's been rumored it would be dead on arrival in the House. So that bears the question of even if it does clear the Senate, if it's able to pass that threshold, will it even be brought to the floor for a vote in the House?

You have bipartisan senators working with the administration to strike a deal on border security. And at the same exact time, House Republicans are barreling towards impeachment of the secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas. So it's a fascinating split-screen right there.But the next thing in the process is on Tuesday, there's going to be a markup of two articles of impeachment against Alejandro Mayorkas. The first one that accuses him of willful and systemic refusal to comply with the last; the second that accuses him of breach of trust. Republicans unveiled those two articles this weekend. The expectations that those articles will advance out of the Homeland Security Committee and then it will head to the House floor and that's when we'll see that full House vote on actually impeaching Mayorkas. Speaker Johnson said that he will bring this to the floor as soon as possible, calling the impeachment of Mayorkas a necessary priority. Of course, as you mentioned, the border has emerged as a really salient issue. And then if that is able to clear the House, it will then go over to the Senate where the possibility of Mayorkas being removed is highly unlikely in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Of course, you need two- thirds for removal. The Senate is controlled by Democrats. Mayorkas may be impeached in the House but it's very likely he's still going to have his job.",

CATHERINE LUCEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, they're doing similar things although they obviously have different goals. Haley is now finally in a two-person race in the primary. She is really trying to make the argument that she's a real alternative to Trump. And she's trying out a number of these messages, right, Kasie? She's calling him unhinged, saying that -- pointed to his legal issues and saying that that's a distraction, which means he's not fighting for the American people. She's also making generational arguments about how -- I mean, is it time for a younger candidate compared to Trump or Biden? The challenge for her, obviously, is it appealing to any of the voters who are, so far, supporting Trump. Does this give her any path to winning any primary states?
