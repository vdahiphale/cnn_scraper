And allies of both men are convinced that their opponent is so fatally flawed that there is no way that they can possibly lose. And if you look at the evidence, it's not too far off. Trump, impeached twice, indicted four times, and likely to spend much of the next year inside of a courtroom, and Biden, according to new poll numbers tonight, is being weighed down by many weaknesses. At the heart of his vulnerability is, of course, his age. Nearly half of Democrats say it's their biggest concern, and 74 percent of voters don't think that he's sharp enough. And if you're liberal, perhaps most worrisome of all, an eye-opening 67 percent of Democrats prefer another candidate. Now, let me reiterate, two-thirds of his own party wants someone else to run. But the issue is not just his age. Nearly 60 percent of Americans believe that Biden has made the economy worse. In a moment, James Carville joins me to react to all of that. But, first, here's a little taste of how some Democrats are spinning today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I like to remind folks that the economy is, objectively speaking, improving.However, you look at the poll numbers, President Biden's approval ratings are not good on this front. 58 percent believe his policies have worsened economic conditions. That has gone up by eight points since last fall. The White House's argument is that if things continue to get better, this is going to be easier to message around. But the economy is getting better and the numbers are getting worse. So what now? CARVILLE:  Well, I'm going to say what the White House would say. The Clinton numbers and Reagan was like at 42 percent in August of 1983. He won re-election easily. Clinton was, I don't know, 44 percent, 45 or whatever in September of 1995, and he won re-election easily. So, the White House is saying pretty clearly that, as it takes hold, it will improve. It had improved. And I think part of the problem is while inflation is coming down, people feel it's still as high. And you can't win an argument if people don't feel. It's the hardest thing to do in all of politics is when you're incumbent and, objectively, you have the statistics to say it's clearly getting better, but people don't feel it.

A jury convicting former White House Aide Peter Navarro of contempt of Congress, he's joining another Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, after they both refused to cooperate with the January 6th investigation.Those two join all the allies who were charged in the Russia investigation, from Paul Manafort to Roger Stone, and don't forget, of course, Michael Cohen, or the CFO of Trump's empire, or the head of his inaugural committee, or the Mar-a-Lago aides in the document case, and, Of course, the 18 co-defendants who are currently charged alongside him in the state of Georgia. [22:10:05:] And speaking of Georgia, Trump's lawyers are now signaling that they may ask to move his case to federal court. Joining me now on all of this is Atlanta Trial Lawyer and RICO expert Joshua Schiffer. Joshua, Trump officially now has notified the court that he may -- emphasis on may -- try to move this case from the state level to the federal level. They're not going all the way at this point. But can you just tell us here what would be the advantages to him of moving this case out of Georgia? JOSHUA SCHIFFER, TRIAL LAWYER, J.D. LAW GROUP:  Out of Georgia, it is unlikely, but moving it from the state court to the federal court is something that we're actually already watching people like Mark Meadows do, with the assumption that a different jury pool, it would be a more broad jury pool, not limited to just Fulton County, but a ten-county area of kind of the North Metro Atlanta universe. That would be a more broad jury pool, theoretically more conservative. It would also be less politically spicy, you could say. A federal trial wouldn't have the press and media transparency that Fulton County indicates that it would. It would kind of turn down the temperature. And federal court, under the very honorable Steve Jones, a federal magistrate or federal judge appointed by President Obama, it's a little bit more austere and formal than a state court proceeding. And that's really going to be an advantage due to the defenses that we all expect the president and the other co-defendants to bring forth.",

It was this week and it's projected to go into next week, all while we're waiting for his ruling on the Meadows removal petition that was heard on the prior Monday. And that's a big issue because if it goes for Meadows, maybe it's going to go for some of the other co-defendants.Now, the court would have to look at those individuals one by one, but then there's the argument that what's good for one would be good for all of them and the difficulties in severing the various defendants. But we all also recognize that what Mark Meadows and possibly President Trump and others are going to ask Judge Jones to do isn't very likely. Traditionally, the federal courts and the federal system defers state criminal prosecutions to the state. The states are the ones that need to take care of criminal actions within their borders as sovereign states. And the federal government should only come in under very specific delineated situations. PHILLIP:  Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis is pushing back against efforts from House Republicans here in -- over in Washington who are trying to investigate how she's handled this Fulton County indictment. And in a letter, though, to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, a close Trump ally, by the way, Willis accuses Jordan of trying to, quote, interfere with an active criminal case. She argues that your job description as a legislator does not include criminal law enforcement nor does it include supervising a specific criminal trial because you believe that doing so will promote your partisan political objectives. And she goes on to say, it's clear that you lack a basic understanding of the law. These are real sharp words from Fani Willis, and she seems to be trying to say to Jim Jordan that she's not afraid to fight back here.",

It has been reported that this will be the first of two fundraisers, so there might be another chance to get at it.But to answer your question, it's a very serious problem. Rudy Giuliani cannot practice law. He's been disbarred in Washington, D.C. He's been suspended from the practice of law in New York. And so he doesn't have a lot of options for how to make money on his own and he's got these crushing legal bills, some of which are going to involve travel, some of which are going to involve retrieval of records, which requires paying not just your lawyers but other specialists to help put together your case. We've already seen Rudy fail to come up with records in a defamation case for lack of $15,000. You can't survive that way when the stakes are this high.
