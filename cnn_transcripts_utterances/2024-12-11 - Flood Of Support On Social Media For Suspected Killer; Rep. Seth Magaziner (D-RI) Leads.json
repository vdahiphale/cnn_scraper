Security firms that are paid top dollar to protect these CEOs -- they told me that their phones are ringing off the hook right now from worried corporate executives.And one official -- one security official told me corporate America is nervous. He said, \"Health care is the target now but who's next?\" And so companies -- yes, they are considering a range of steps to ramp up security. I mean, first, they are reevaluating their existing security protocol. They're considering increasing the number of security personnel and the amount of technology in offices and at the residences of executives. They're also urging CEOs to delete their digital footprints, including things like the floor plan to their residences or information on where their kids go to school. They're enhancing mail screening. And there's also this sense that this murder really showed that the security blanket that exists around the top security -- the top executives needs to be extended to their lieutenants because there's a lot of corporations that have division CEOs, like Brian Thompson was, who may not get that topnotch security that the big boss gets but perhaps they need to. And so the level of concern is high for a number of reasons. It's not just where this happened.",

And this reported cautioned that the positive online reaction may signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near term with the shooting itself having the capability to inspire a variety of extremists and grievance-driven malicious actors to violence.

They kind of created this fantasy if you will of a left-wing kind of hero, or Robinhood, as we heard in that clip, who they wanted to be their hero and who was doing more for them than anyone else had done. But even when his identity was revealed and we saw that he had gone to prestigious schools, and worked in Silicon Valley, and followed right- wing people, this community still embraced him. And as we said, we saw t-shirts with \"I love Mangione\" with his picture on this, and tote bags, and mugs. And there's fundraisers happening for him online.

      "sentences": "All right. This morning, President Biden is facing increasing pressure from within his own party to take action on immigration before leaving office and before President-elect Trump's promised mass deportations.Let's get right to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez for the latest on this. What are they calling for, and what power does President Biden have here? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Democrats essentially want the president and his administration to extend protections to immigrants already in the United States for fear of what President-elect Donald Trump's mass deportation plans may look like and who they may target because so far, the president-elect's team has been quite vague. But the conversations within the administration and within the White House, according to the sources that I have been speaking to, are quite complicated. They're wrestling with these demands from Democrats and their allies. But at the same time they're trying to avoid overreaching on an issue that strategists argue cost Democrats the White House. And on that front, a senior administration official telling me, \"The paradigm has shifted.\" Really, the reality of the electoral results is, in part, playing into these conversations. Now, all of this, John, is a reflection of the state of immigration policy. It has been made through the Executive Branch. So, yes, with a stroke of a pen Donald Trump can get rid of most of what the Biden administration has done. But what Democrats are urging the administration to do is at the very least try to extend protections. Just make it a little harder for Donald Trump to target some of these communities. Now, the Senators that are publicly calling for the White House and privately calling the White House on this include, for example, Sens. Alex Padilla, Dick Durbin, Catherine Cortez Masto, Tammy Duckworth, among others. And in a letter to the president this week they said the following. I'll read just part of it. \"We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the president-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families.\" That could include, for example, extending a form of humanitarian relief known as temporary protected status for certain countries, expediting DACA renewals, and processing pending asylum claims. Now, John, the administration is still doing some work. Just yesterday they announced that they were going to -- they finalized an automatic extension for certain people with work permits. But the argument here among Democrats and immigrant advocates is that there's so much more to be done. The challenge within the administration is what they can do, also taking into consideration that the American people have largely spoken on this issue and many of them disapproved of what the White House did on border security.",
