Tonight, Niger's military leaders are still inpower as ECOWAS calls for a second summit to discuss the coup and what happens next. We are learning about an alleged foiled assassination plot on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We have the details for you just ahead. And former U.S. President Donald Trump is staring down a deadline related to charges he tried to overturn the 2020 election. First, tonight though, the deadline has come and it has gone. And they defied an ultimatum to really relinquish power. Now, the coup leaders of Niger are bracing for possible military intervention by a West African regional bloc. The streets of Niger's capital were quiet this morning as residents stocked up on food and other necessities, fearing a possible attack. The ruling military Junta has closed the airspace and is bringing reinforcements to Niamey from across the country. It is unclear how ECOWAS will respond to the rejection of their demands that Niger's democratically-elected president be reinstated by Sunday. They are meeting again on Thursday for another emergency summit. I want to bring in Larry Madowo, he's following developments for us tonight from Nairobi, Kenya. So, Larry, the deadline come and gone. What happens next? How is the regional bloc going to respond here?",

That is why President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria, who chairs theECOWAS heads of state group has called for another emergency summit on Thursday to determine what they're going to do, because they were talking tough, promising to intervene militarily within one week if President Mohamed Bazoum is not reinstated. And the military was like, OK, you're going to have to make us because we are not going to do that. And ECOWAS has to prove that they were not just saber-rattling, that they intend to actually do something. That they have teeth. And that's something that would be unpopular within parts of the Nigerien population. The military Junta filled a big stadium in the capital, Niamey, to show that they have the public support. To show ECOWAS that this military intervention is unpopular. I've got to point out though, that any pro democracy voices, anybody who supports Mohamed Bazoum appears to have disappeared from the public discourse in Niger, partly because with the lack of independent media, the state television, state outlets control a lot of the narrative. But the military Junta itself has been talking in apocalyptic terms about an impending attack by this group of West African countries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMADOU ABDRAMANE, SPOKESMAN, NIGER MILITARY (through translator): Niger's armed forces and all our defense and security forces backed by the unfailing support of our people are ready to defend the integrity of our territory and the honor of our homeland. To this end, the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland launches a vibrant appeal to the youth, to the worthy daughters and sons of   our country, to stand ready to defend the homeland.

They reopened it to some neighboring countries, they suddenly closed it again last night leading to a lot of airlines scrambling to go around and re-route to return to base, because many of them were already airborne, and they had to do this at the last minute. So, on top of the ECOWAS sanctions that were announced, that no fly zone, the travel ban, the stopping of financial -- sanctions, and now this, Niger remains completely isolated, except the support they have from Burkina Faso and Mali, the two neighboring countries that are also ruled by military Juntas.

Many western governments say it is the presidential guard and the president in a dispute, and he, the head of the presidential guard was about to be fired as part of security changes, and he now has declared himself president. But one of the first stops that the military Junta has made since taking over power has been to Mali, to Bamako, where the Wagner group has already been active there, helping Malian forces fight the Jihadist insurgency. And the French Foreign Minister confirming that contact has been made between the Niger Junta and the Wagner group. It's not clear if there's a contract that's been signed, it's not clear if there are any Wagner troops already in Niger, but it will not be surprising the French and the Americans say, for the Wagner group to see this as an opportunity to extend their influence, to make some money in Niger as well.

I mean, we see, you know, many of the citizens that protest, and their claims, support, but the record of military rule is there for everyone to see. And this is why we decided to go with the way of democracy, where there will be peace, and there will be security for all. And so, I think the engagements, even with those who are in the civil society, will be the ones supporting this takeaway that they too can be subject to dialogue through our envoys.

Forty thousand people have been evacuated from one city, they're part of a massive wave of people being forced from their homes. Aid is being trucked in for more than a million people. Well, extreme weather and floods also impacting parts of Europe. In Slovenia, devastating floods have killed at least six people and caused more than $500 million in property damage. That's after a month's worth of rain falling just one day. Our Michael Holmes has the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dragged down by floodwaters, this house in Slovenia no match for days of torrential rain. Residents say they watched and waited as a nearby river swelled in the storms which began last week, but by Saturday, they were forced to evacuate after the river burst its banks leaving nothing to contain the rushing waters. This man says that eight people lived there, both young and old. He says it's a huge loss, but he's grateful they got out in time. Slovenia's Prime Minister says this is the worst natural disaster in the nation's history, affecting two-thirds of the country, with large parts of central and northern Slovenia deluged with floods. Emergency workers are making a public plea for rubber boats so that they can reach areas no longer reachable by road. This is what they're up against, dangerously fast waters, which have stranded people in some areas. Volunteers in this northern town risking their lives to save two tourists stuck in the rapids. One local mayor says he's just now getting a chance to inspect the damage. He says much of his town has been inundated since Friday, and what isn't covered in water is caked in mud. He says it's a huge financial loss, and estimates the damage in his town alone will run into the millions of dollars. The prime minister echoing that concern, saying the price tag to clean up and rebuild across the country could top half a billion dollars. But some residents are already starting that process, and local media says around 600 soldiers have been deployed to hard-hit areas to help with the efforts.",

We heard that in a statement from U.S. Northern Command. However, the military did take steps to deploy assets to monitor the ships and, of course, make sure that they didn't do anything overly provocative. They deployed four U.S. Navy destroyers as well as a reconnaissance aircraft, just to make sure that they were staying in international waters. But the U.S. senators from Alaska, Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, they sounded the alarm on Saturday about this. They said that these ships numbered roughly 11 -- were 11 Russian and Chinese ships that they were operating off of the Aleutian Islands in the Bering -- in the Bering Sea. And they said that this marks a new era of authoritarian aggression, according to Dan Sullivan, that is led by the dictators in Beijing and Moscow. So, clearly very strong words there. And they notably called this an incursion. Now, this is not the first time that the Russian and Chinese have done this kind of exercise in that area off the coast of Alaska. They did something very similar last summer and the response by the U.S. was, according to Sullivan, the U.S. senator, very \"tepid\" because it was a single U.S. Coast Guard ship that essentially encountered these ships on a routine patrol. But this time around, the U.S. military took steps to make a bigger show of force on their side as well. And Dan Sullivan, the senator, again, he appreciated that. And he issued a statement saying that he hopes that kind of robust response will become the norm in the future. Now, notably the Chinese embassy did say in a statement to CNN that these naval vessels have recently conducted joint maritime patrols in relevant waters in the Western and Northern Pacific. And they said this action is not targeted at a third party and has nothing to do with the current international tensions between the U.S., Russia, and China. But obviously, any kind of presence by the Russian and Chinese in this area of the world, so close to Alaska, is going to raise alarms, especially now among U.S. officials.",

That is where they hope to eventually be placed in the city's shelter system that is buckling under pressure when you hear from New York City officials. They have been able to establish roughly 200 so far. And they just announced the last hours show the addition of one more facility north of where we are. That is expected to accommodate at least 2,000 adult men asylum seekers. It is a facility that had been previously - - or location that had been previously opened late last fall, but there was a slow downturn in the numbers, so it wasn't necessary anymore, so they actually tore it down. Now, here we are months later, and they will now be tapping into funds to once again set up that facility. But this is what it means long term, Isa.

That's what we're hearing at some point between October and the end of December. And what we do know about Zuranolone, it's taken as a once-daily pill. You can take at home over the course of 14 days. And side effects include dizziness and drowsiness. And because of that, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved this drug, it did say it was going to issue a warning label that anyone taking the medication should not drive or operate heavy machinery at least 12 hours after taking the drug because of that drowsiness side effect. But overall, Isa, this is another treatment option for mothers out there with postpartum depression, and it could be made commercially available by the end of this year.",

Science and symptoms include having crying spells or feeling anger,hopeless, overly anxious or downing your ability to care for the baby, feeling withdrawn from others, not connecting with your child, and in severe cases, having thoughts of self-harm or harming the baby. But with that being said, while those are signs and symptoms, one important takeaway message -- I spoke with one doctor who said that she tells all of her patients as new mothers whenever they're feeling overwhelmed, whether they're having depressive symptoms or not, reach out for support, lean on your loved ones, reach out to your doctor at any point where you might be feeling overwhelmed as a new mom. That's most important, Isa.",

Meta's app appears to be struggling to hold on to users with engagement falling to new lows. That is according to a new report. But Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, isn't backing down announcing that major updates are coming soon. His attempt to dethrone Twitter owner Elon Musk has created rivalry as you know that can see the tech billionaires settling their differences in a cage fight later this month. Joining me now to unpack it all is CNN Technology Reporter Brian Fung in Washington, D.C. And Brian, we can talk about the cage fight in just a moment. Let's talk about Threads though, because I remember when the story broke, so many people, millions of people signed up for it. How successful has it been? Was it able to retain users? What have you been seeing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, it looks like even though Threads was able to get a lot of people signing up really quickly in a veryshort amount of time, it's having trouble keeping a hold of those users. And those users just aren't coming back as frequently or spending as much time there. According to new research from SensorTower, a third-party market research firm, Threads now is down to eight million users. That's an 82 percent drop from what it had at around the time of its launch just a month ago. That's a really big deal because it highlights, you know, just the amount of work that Threads is going to have to do to really stay relevant in relation to Twitter, which of course it's taking on as a new text-based microblogging tool. In addition, you know, people just aren't spending as much time on the app. So, where people were spending 19 minutes on average on the first day of the app's launch, you know, now people are down to spending less than three minutes a day on average according to Sensor Tower. So, that gives you just another sense of how Threads is now struggling to retain people as it's trying to compete with Twitter here, Isa.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Isa, it looks like, you know, some of the main features that you see on Twitter are kind of lacking. They're not available onThreads. So one of the main things that people have been clamoring for is the ability to access Threads from a desktop web browser that's currently not available on Threads. You can only access the app through the mobile app. And that's something that a lot of people say has inhibited its ability to grow because you can't access it from everywhere you are, you can only access it through one single channel. Another thing people have asked for is more comprehensive search features as well as a, you know, reverse chronological content feed. And Threads did actually, you know, show that it is working on some of these issues. It rolled out chronological feed that only shows people that you follow through the app. And that was, you know, very welcomed by many of its users, but it still has a lot of work to do to offer some of the same features that Twitter does, you know, on an everyday basis.",

So, earlier, Elon Musk over the weekend said that the cage match will be live-streamed on Threads to which, you know, Mark Zuckerberg said,you know, can't we use a more reliable platform in a jab against Elon Musk? And then, you know, he said, sorry, Musk said -- I'm sorry, Zuckerberg said, he suggested August 26th, but he hasn't heard back from Musk on, you know, whether or not that date works for him. And you know, even so -- even on Sunday, Musk was talking about needing potentially a neck or back surgery before the fight can proceed. So, at this point, Isa, it's anyone's guess as to when or if this fight is going to happen.",
