CNN is live on the Belarusian/Ukraine border where some wonder whether the next major Putin offensive will launch from.Plus, breaking news, the special counsel investigating Trump is locked in at least eight secret court battles right now, at least eight. And we're going to tell you everything we know about it and why tonight. And just in, a near collision on a U.S. airport runway. A 777 coming dangerously close to a cargo plane. This is the third close call in less than a month. What is going on? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, attacked. New video into OUTFRONT tonight showing Russian soldiers coming under fire. I warn you, as we always want to do here, it is graphic. I'll show you now. These are heavily armed Russian soldiers that you see on your screen hiding, trying to stay out of view of Ukraine's drones. They're spotted, though, and targeted. Now, according to Ukraine, two of the men were killed. And a Russian state television war correspondent, who is embedded with Russian troops, tonight posting, claiming that the private Russian army, the Wagner Group, is making progress in the ongoing fight for Bakhmut. But still can't declare victory months after the brutal and intense fighting began in this city. The Russian correspondent saying, and I quote him: The enemy, he's referring to Ukraine, is already plowing a new road for the fields in order to provide supplies to both Bakhmut and its outskirts. The Kyiv regime's artillery is constantly working both in the frontline and close to the rear. The Wagner PMC fighters do not have a large quantity of ammunition. And this of course is not good. Well, not good for Putin, but pretty incredible, right? This is Russian state TV, pro-Russian, right, with that very significant admission. They don't have enough ammo. Well, not good for Putin and neither is the morale of Russians, whose sons and husbands and loved ones are on those front lines right now without the ammo, without the training. Tonight, we have this new video. This is a group of mothers. They address Putin by name. They tell the Russian president they're doing this publicly that he is failing his people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOTHER OF A RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  It's not a secret that no proper clothing, weapons, or provisions were issued to them. Medical care leaves much to be desired. It has been over a year that our guys have been in service, and over all this period of time, they've been given either a leave of absence nor holiday. Combat assault requires special training, which they did not undergo. Prior to their dispatchment, they spent only two to three days on the military training range. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the Ukrainians really are worried that Putin could use Belarus once again as a launch pad for attacks on Ukrainian territory. So, of course, every chance we have, we need to try to get into that border area.Now, the access that we got today was part of a Belarusian government organized trip, with all the restrictions of that entailed. But we certainly get some pretty interesting insights. Here's what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over):  As Russian forces ramp up their assault at Eastern Ukraine, Kyiv believes the Kremlin's massive spring offensive may already be well underway. And Russian President Vladimir Putin could again use Belarus as a launching pad for attacks. On a visit organized by the Belarusian government, we saw the Ukrainians aren't taking any chances. The Belarusians say from their side, this border crossing is open, but you can see over there that's Ukrainian territory, and over there that crossing is definitely shut. There are several layers of barbed wire and earth mounds to make sure no one can get through. Russia launched its main thrust towards Kyiv through Belarus almost a year ago, penetrating all the way to the gates of Ukraine's capital before its forces were decimated and retreated. Today, the situation of the Belarusian/Ukrainian border remains tense. Although this crossing is usually calm, even here some trolling. The Ukrainians fly the white, red white flag, one of the many provocations the Belarusians say and they've beefed up their own forces here. ANTON BYCHKOVSKIY, SPOKESPERSON FOR BELARUS STATE BORDER COMMITTEE (through translator):  Mainly, border guard units have been expanded. If before it was two people, now it's three or five. The armament and equipment were also updated.",

And the fact that it is shown on state TV, the fact that it is being reported by Russian correspondents, the war correspondents, it's very important because what the government is now doing, what Putin is now doing is to say, look, we've never been in this position, we haven't done war since 1945 since World War II, and we understand it's difficult. We are trying to change it, we're trying to make it better. But they are not hiding it, and it's very important because that's how Putin thinks he's going to get ahead of the game, admitting mistakes, saying, yes, it is all horrible, but it is for the good of the nation and we are trying to fix it.

And the president formally donated many papers related to his time in the Senate to the university. The second search we are told focused on materials that he has sent to the university in recent years. We have learned that investigators did retrieve some documents from the university, but none of them appeared to have classified markings. But, Erin, they are still being reviewed, and that process takes some time. Now, a spokeswoman for the president's attorney declined to comment and referred all questions to the Justice Department.

And thanks to our team, Casey Gannon, who sits at the courthouse and Katelyn Polantz, we've been able to learn a little bit about what these things are about because a special counsel is trying to keep a lot of this under seal in secret.A lot of this has to do with the fact that we're dealing with a litigious person, this is Donald Trump. And he is fighting over a number of things. The one we learned just a couple days ago about Evan Corcoran, his lawyer who was brought before the grand jury. The special counsel is trying to get him to answer questions that have to do with his interactions with Donald Trump, his client, obviously. There's also another proceeding to try to get access to information from Scott Perry, Representative Scott Perry's cell phone, another thing that's also under seal. All of these things are now playing out, Erin, behind the scenes, under seal. The special counsel has actually argued that it is because of the public interest, the extensive public interest in these matters that some of this should be kept secret, which sort of takes transparency and turns it on its head. I would note that the Justice Department regulations do allow the special counsel to tell the public because of the extraordinary nature of this investigation and the fact that they're writing new law with every single one of these cases that they should be able to explain a lot of this to the public. But it looks like we're going to have to wait a lot more -- a lot longer for the judge who's overseeing the grand jury to reveal a lot more about this -- Erin.",

I don't think that's what's at issue here. I think that's a different thing. I think when Al Sharpton shows up in Tallahassee and is banging on the governor's steps, I think that's a political win for the governor in that case. Look, I don't like to see politics division.

This time Honolulu, Hawaii, where the FAA says a United Airlines 777, a jet that can carry more than 300 passengers crossed a runway where a cargo plane was landing. The two planes stopped just short of a collision.But this close call came just days after a similar incident at JFK where an American Airlines flight crossed in front of a Delta plane trying to take off. And in Austin, where that FedEx plane nearly landed on top of a Southwest flight. I mean, this is just terrifying to watch. This is the one that we've all seen. I mean, it's unbelievable. Gabe Cohen is OUTFRONT. And, Gabe, this is the third time here we've learned this month of something like this. What are you learning about this latest incident in Honolulu?",

So flight data from the tracking site Flight Radar 24 shows a United 777 flight land at the airport. That's the yellow line. That red line is a small cargo plane landing on the runway next to it.[19:45:03] Now, that data shows that 777 then turns left towards the next runway. And the FAA says that aircraft then crossed the runway despite being told to wait by air traffic control just ahead of where that cargo plane was landing. Now, the FAA says the two aircraft were a little more than a thousand feet apart. So, not nearly as close to colliding as in those other two incidents at JFK and Austin. In that JFK incident, as you mentioned, the planes came within a thousand feet of each other after air traffic control ordered one of those planes to abort takeoff. And then in Austin, a FedEx plane came just within a hundred feet of landing on top of a southwest flight earlier this month. So the NTSB now is investigating, Erin, what happened in Honolulu. And these are really just among this growing list of alarming incidents that's led the acting head of the FAA to announce a sweeping safety review of the agency. They are now planning a summit with industry partners next month they're going to go through steps to try to make the industry safer. And they're going to start digging through flight data to see if there's maybe a trend here, Erin, and maybe there are more of these incidents happening than we realize.",

It was the one that was improperly crossing the runway at Honolulu as a cargo plane was landing, and the distance there, as Gabe said, 1,200 feet.

That means collision, a disaster, probably the loss of aircraft and life was very narrowly averted. So these are the serious ones. And the problem for runway incursions or near-misses or near-collisions at the airport is from about 2011 to 2017 they were studied and they increased 83 percent. Then COVID came along and they decreased.But in 2022 they were back up to 1,732. And in just the first six weeks of this year, there have been 507. Now, not all of those are category A. In fact, every year, it's less than a dozen or so. But, you know, there's been many studies the errors are often over 60 percent. They say it's the pilot's fault, they say bad communication accounts for probably 60 percent of it. And there is something that helps, but it's communication, pilot error -- BURNETT:  And, Mary, you're saying ordinarily of this category A, fewer than a dozen in a year. We've had three in a month.

So they're blaming it on communication.And they're also just blaming it on the system ramping up. But also we have to look at equipment. And we have to look at the systems that are provided by the FAA to avoid this. One's called the airport surface detection equipment. And we have a new one, it's the taxiway arrival protections. And those equipment, when deployed, will be very useful across the board. But we don't have them everywhere. So it has to be a multifaceted approach to get this very alarming number back down.",
