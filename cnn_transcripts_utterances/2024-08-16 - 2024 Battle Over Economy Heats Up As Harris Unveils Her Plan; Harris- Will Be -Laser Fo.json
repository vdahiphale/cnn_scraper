We're breaking down her vision and the Trump campaign's response.Also this hour, President Biden says mediators are, in his words, closer than ever to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage agreement after a new round of talks. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to travel here to Israel amid urgent efforts to seal a deal. Plus, a major shakeup in the U.S. real estate industry, as new rules and how agents are paid, commissions are about to take effect. Stay right here to find out what that means for you if you're buying or selling your home. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv, and you're in the Situation Room. We begin with issue number one for voters in the U.S., the economy. Vice President Kamala Harris just laid out her proposals aimed at helping struggling Americans pay their bills, a pitch she made in the battleground state of North Carolina. CNN's Eva McKend is on the scene for us, joining us live from Raleigh right now. Eva, break down today's speech, what it means. EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, this speech was quite significant, because this is the first time that we heard the Vice President outline her concrete economic policy goals. A Harris administration would go after price gougers. A Harris administration would aggressively pursue increasing the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600, $6,000 for low income families, middle class families. Perhaps the loudest applause line came when she pledged to pursue $25,000 for first time home buyers. But Wolf, what was also significant is how she framed this conversation in deeply personal terms, talking about how significant it was in her own life when her mother could finally afford to buy a home. Talking about how she understood what it was like when you have to stretch those dollars in order to buy groceries. She also recalled working at McDonald's as a young person and seeing her then colleagues try to make that money work to raise families. Take a listen to how she is framing this conversation.

But this first policy was pretty far left. I think that was a notable shift. And also, you know, if you were kind of blacked out for last four years, you would think that she was the challenger. She was the incumbent vice president of United States. You know, there wasn't a lot of talk about, let's face it, a lot of the crises with inflation housing happened during the Biden-Harris administration. There's a little memory holding of that.

But those aren't necessarily the voters that matter the most. They're the independent voters in the middle, and now there definitely is a new presidential race upon us here, and she's walking a very fine line by trying to embrace some of the Biden-Harris record and also trying to draw a contrast with what the former President is proposing.So what independent voters are looking for is perhaps change. Almost every election, Wolf, is a change election, and suddenly change is also on the side of the Democrats. It certainly wasn't with the President Biden at the top of the ticket. So she owns the record of the administration, but she also has the unique ability to present something forward, present something new. So that is what voters are going to have to sort out here. But I think the contrast was very, very stark. And this is something we've not seen actually, in about 24 years or so. When Al Gore, of course, was running, he embraced some elements of the Clinton administration, but also tried to move on and pivot. Since then, we've not seen a vice president running while the president is still in office. So it's going to be a fascinating exercise to see how voters sort through all of this. But the specific things of a communism, I'm not sure those land very well with voters in the middle of this who simply want something to be done by Washington here.

Their goal is to make sure that he focuses on policy issues, particularly the policy issues that he pulls ahead of Kamala Harris. So they hope he will pull ahead of Kamala Harris on.Now, that seems to be very hard for Donald Trump, particularly when he goes off message. But whether or not this is going to affect him with his own voters? No, I don't think so. This is not the first time he says something like this. He often goes off script. He often has denigrated various groups of people in these kind of rifts or rants. It doesn't really phase the people who are going to vote for him. Maybe it would move some people in the middle, but I will say that from my conversations, even with them, most people seem to understand who Donald Trump is and some of the stuff he says. So, I'm not really sure that this would move the needle in any way. However, as they are trying to energize people to get them to the polls, to figure out how to stop the momentum around Kamala Harris, they do. They being, the people close to Donald Trump, have just expressed over and over again a desire for Donald Trump to focus on messaging and what exactly he is saying to the American public.",

We just spent about a good eight minutes talking about Kamala Harris's economic policy, and I think, I believe, they're justifiable criticisms of it. And so, this really takes a spotlight off that a little bit where you have the opportunity to go after her on some of those things, on some of those policies.

It sends a message to settlers that they could launch their attacks. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Mohammad Arram got beaten. His vehicle torched. It was 7:00 p.m. we were relaxing, he says. The settlers caught us by surprise. Started smashing the car. His security camera catching the moment the settlers arrived, chasing and attacking him and his brother. This was a planned attack, the most vicious we've seen with guns, he says. They tried to get into the house to the women and children. It could have been a massacre. Only one grave to mourn at, a mercy of sorts. The life lessons learned by these youngsters, though, herald another generation of bitterness and division. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera): And of course, this happening right at one of the most sensitive times of those talks in Doha. Hamas themselves called for the people of the West Bank to rise up against the Israelis, and this really just epitomizes, if you will, the desperate nature of the situation, what a Palestinian state might mean to people in those villages, who would believe out of that they would get better security, their lives would be safer.

But I will agree that more needs to be done, that more sanctions need to be provided, and more pressure needs to be put on the Israeli government to make them recognize that Israeli security is at risk. The security of the region is at risk. And they need to start making different choices, because if you don't get to a -- a pathway for a Palestinian state to some sort of hope for the Palestinian people, then you're not going to have the peace that Israel needs.Look, there -- there is a -- a deal on the table between Saudi Arabia on the table, but there is a deal to be made between Saudi Arabia, Israel, the U.S., the UAE, and others, security cooperation that could undermine the influence of Iran, which would be a very positive thing, but that deal is not going to get made if there is no future for the Palestinian people.

But I hope that Prime Minister Netanyahu also recognizes that this is the best chance to get to a peace deal in Gaza, as has been said by his own military leadership, there really isn't anything more militarily that Israel can achieve in Gaza if they want to get the hostages home, if they want to increase the possibility of a secure Israel, then Netanyahu government needs to do everything in their power as well to get this deal done and end the war in Gaza.
