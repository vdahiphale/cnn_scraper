The mayor tells me that they`re still waiting for some of this water to recede, so that officials get a better, a clearer picture of the kind of damage that they`re dealing with here. Jerry, if you can show them just up the street from where we are here along the coastline. You can see, one emergency crews out here on a pickup truck. They`ve been driving up and down a little bit further up the street out here were told some streets up there are pretty blocked off cars really can`t get in and out of that area. We are in Gulfport, again, a part of Pinellas County where we expected a lot of this storm search to take hold. It`s what -- it was the one thing really that emergency officials across the Tampa bay area and Pinellas County were really worried about. They didn`t want folks to be out here doing exactly what they`re doing at least earlier in the day, because we still were going to have all of this water coming in off -- off the coastline out here. We`ve had a little bit of rain, although much of that has since cleared. And so officials really were just telling folks really stay home, stay away from this part of town because we`re still dealing with some significant flooding. The mayor tells me that a lot of the damage again does seem to have been, more storm surge related than anything else. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

NASA media watch field of reports of loud booms and shaking in the area caused by shockwaves as the media disintegrated. They estimate the fireball hurdle through the sky at approximately 41,000 miles per hour, traveling 48 miles in four seconds before it crumbled above the Keystone forest. We get questions here all the time about comets asteroids and meteors, meteorites. What`s the difference? Well, let`s start in space and work our way all the way down to the surface. A comet is a snowball. It`s a piece of ice. Now, the ice is mainly frozen gas, not water. But there could be dust and rocks and things inside the comet. Halley`s Comet, now NASA knows of about 3,600 other comets than that one out there. Closer in, in the asteroid belt. These are rocks, not gas. They could be metal as well, but they are hard surfaces. And sometimes they come out of the asteroid belt, get closer to the surface of the earth, or at least our atmosphere. If one or a piece of a smaller one called a meteoroid, hits the surface of the atmosphere, it turns into a meteor. It gets bright because it hits our atmosphere and begins to burn up. If it doesn`t make its way all the way down to the surface, it turns into a shooting star. Now, if it does make its way all the way down to the surface of the earth and hits the ground, and you can pick it up, that is a meteorite. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you live in a big city, you know how hot it can get in the summer, especially with all thatheat radiating up off the concrete and asphalt, that`s called the urban heat island effect. And it was first documented way back in the 1800 by a meteorologist in London. Today, we have tools that can help us identify and map these islands, which can be 18 degrees hotter than the areas around them. And that`s important. So these hot spots can be cooled down. And that`s exactly what the architects in our next story are trying to do. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
