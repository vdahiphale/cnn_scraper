The election, for all intents and purposes, really was about Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, despite the fact that Joe Biden, of course, is the incumbent.

A new NPR poll shows him ahead of Donald Trump.On top of that, Joe Biden has had maybe two dozen campaign appearances in the past couple of weeks. He's shown himself to be a vigorous campaigner. No, he's not a 60-year-old, or a 50-year-old Joe Biden. He's an 81-year-old. Joe Biden. He's a lot slower than he was before. He's not as effective as a campaigner as he was before. But he clearly has a command of the issues. And Democrats need to stop this whining and start fighting against Donald Trump, who is a convicted criminal, who is behind or responsible for or going to implement Project 2025.

Unbelievable pressure. And I, frankly, think that we are putting too much importance on polls right now. I say this as someone who works in this industry.Joe Biden should decide if he can serve another four years as president. Can he do the job and executed it well? And he has come to that conclusion. I don't know if I agree with that conclusion. I don't feel as reassured, in setting aside everything about the election, just the fact that Joe Biden is still the president. I don't feel as reassured after yesterday's press conference. It really was a Rorschach test, right? If you like Joe Biden and you want him to stay in, you can say, look, he stood for 60 minutes and answered questions. I think that's kind of a low bar. But if you don't like Joe Biden, you can point to the many slipups, the calling Kamala Harris vice president Trump and so on and so forth and say, look, he has lost his fastball. Democrats are running out of time. They have no, no risk strategies. Stick with Biden, you have the risk that something is going to happen like that debate again over the course of the next four months, and do you have time to really recover? But there is also a risk of switching gears, going to another candidate. Now, in the polling, Kamala Harris actually does about as well as Joe Biden. That could, of course, change as more Americans get former - form stronger opinions about her. But this race is really static right now. And it is much less about, do I like Joe Biden or do I like Donald Trump, but it's more about, how much do I dislike the other candidate? And that is what has made this so that the polls, even with that disastrous debate performance, just don't move that much.",
