F/A-18 jets and a pair of U.S. destroyers hit what the U.S. says were facilities involved in attacks on international shipping.Now, strikes in Yemen come one day after U.S. Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.

Iran's foreign minister saying that what the U.S. is doing at this point is making it very difficult to be able to get some kind of peace deal to -- together. Also pointing out that the U.S. is showing an aggressive policy in the Middle East.But we've heard from the U.S. side, though, as officials say that this is not an escalation. The overnight strikes, local time, that we saw against Houthi rebels with the United Kingdom and also with a number of other countries showing their support. Now, they have said that it is necessary to keep the freedom of navigation in this particular area. And we heard from the U.K. defense minister saying that, it is not an escalation as we have already targeted many of these assets over recent weeks. It's the third time that the U.S. and the U.K. have carried out these joint attacks against Houthi rebels. And we have seen on previous occasions as well that it has not stopped the efforts by the Houthis to disrupt commercial shipping in the Red Sea. In fact, what they did say, a Houthi senior official, was that we will meet escalation with escalation following those targeted attacks from the U.S. and the U.K. We also saw an anti-ship missile being taken out, we understand, by the United States, saying that it was an imminent danger and was ready to be launched. So, at this point, we are hearing pushback, obviously, from the Houthis, from Iran as well. And we've also heard from Russia, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson saying that an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting was necessary. A diplomatic source telling CNN that that is expected to come on Monday. Russia is saying that this is not helping matters in the region. But of course, the U.N. Security Council is very much split with Russia and China on one side and U.S. and its allies on the other side. So, we're not expecting any kind of resolution to come out from that. But we are seeing from the U.S. side an insistence that this is not an escalation, at the same time, as making it clear that this is not the last strikes we are going to see. For example, what we saw Friday into Saturday overnight, local time, were striking targets in Iraq and Syria, the Iranian-backed militias, that they believe were responsible for that deadly drone attack which killed three U.S. servicemen at the end of January. We have heard from Washington, from the Pentagon that is -- this is just the start of those attacks. They specified they would be multi- tiered of response to the deadly drone attack. So, clearly, we have not seen the end of the U.S. response yet. Kim.",

Now, when they did happen, it happened when President Biden was at his campaign headquarters Saturday morning in a show of how the campaign trail and the ongoing situation in the Middle East are colliding this election year. Now, the president did not weigh in on the strikes, but U.S. Officials have consistently said that they will take these measures and attempt to deter the Houthis. Now, of course, this is separate from the retaliatory measures that were taken by the U.S. on Friday. Those were in response to the deaths of three service members in Jordan and targeted about 85 targets in Iraq and Syria. But again, all of this happening as President Biden arrived here in Los Angeles for fundraising events and heads to Nevada tomorrow for another campaign rally and a show of how the president is hitting the campaign trail while he's also grappling with the ongoing situation in the Middle East and trying to avoid engaging in a wider regional war or escalating any conflict that is occurring there.

There's the ongoing protests have been happening for weeks now, which are demanding that the Israeli government do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home. And then in an adjacent street, there are these protests now against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, calling on it to step down so that there can be fresh elections.And because of the geographical proximity of these protests and also because of their ultimate objectives in getting the hostages home, they tend to bleed into one another because many of those people protesting whose primary concern is getting the hostages home feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu is becoming an obstacle to doing a hostage deal. They will point to leaked recordings of a conversation between Netanyahu and families representing hostages still held in the Gaza Strip for some 120 days now. They say that it must have come from the government because their phones were taken. And in that recording, Netanyahu was heard to be criticizing the Qataris who are the main mediators. They will also point to Netanyahu's comments saying that Israel would not be releasing, in his words, thousands of terrorists in exchange for getting those hostages home. More than a hundred of them still held in captivity in the Gaza Strip. And also, to his national security minister, the right wing Itamar Ben-Gvir, who says that this week that a reckless deal with Hamas would lead to a dissolution of the government. Something, they say, Netanyahu doesn't want because ultimately that will lead to an investigation into how October the 7th happened on Netanyahu's watch. And as all the opinion polls suggest, Netanyahu, in an election, would quickly be ejected from office. Now, at the moment, there is no actual hostage deal on the table. What there is, is a so-called framework, which Hamas and Israel have agreed to, which seems to suggest there would be phases to some kind of pause, about a six week pause in fighting. A number of hostages would be released in exchange for three times the number of Palestinian prisoners. The next phase would see soldiers released in exchange for more, a higher ratio of Palestinian prisoners. And then ultimately the bodies that Hamas is holding would also be released. [04:10:00] But there is no deal on the table right now. Hamas insisting that not only does Israel need to pause fighting, it also needs to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. And as I say, Netanyahu saying that no deal will be done. That conflicts with Israel's objectives of destroying Hamas, preventing the Gaza Strip from threatening Israel's security. And of course, getting those hostages home. So, at the moment, the two sides seem quite far apart, but there is obviously hope that we are inching towards a situation where they can meet somewhere in the middle. Kim.",

Some Biden voters are enthusiastic about Biden, but in polling, including the CNN poll these past few days, most of them say they are voting to prevent Trump from imposing his vision of what America should be.And Biden has struggled with young voters from the outset, from the 2020 primaries. They were never enthusiastic about him. They are -- they have been hit hard in this economy, but Trump is anathema to everything that most of them profess to believe on issues like inclusion of LGBTQ people, abortion rights, democracy, climate. And so, Biden does need to do better among young people than he is doing today. The Gaza war, Israel war with Hamas is a particular problem with that cohort, younger voters. But he has a lot of ammunition to use ultimately in that many of these voters, particularly, younger women voters are deeply hostile to Trump and what he stands for. I will say it is likely that if Biden wins a second term, it is more likely to be because he improves among older voters where he is running relatively better than he did in 2020 than among younger voters where he faces the risk of something more like 2016, not necessarily a lot of them voting for Trump, but a significant percentage peeling off, splintering off to vote for various third- party options.

So, you really can't take these words lightly. Dangerous, life-threatening are really the words to describe what can unfold the next couple of days. There's the flood watch that's in effect from Sacramento down to San Diego for widespread three to six inches of rain for more than 40 million people. And you can see why there's that moisture plume that just sits over California over the next couple of days. That's part of the problem, is it's going to sit and it's going to stall, and it's also fueled by really warm ocean temperatures. Those ocean temperatures are one to three degrees above average right now and that can really pump that sponge even more. So, dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is really on the table.

Mud and debris flow could cause some landslides as well as, especially over previous burn scars, down trees and power lines can also be an issue, especially where you're saturated from all the rain that you have got the last couple of days.

In the statement from the joint coalition, they also specifically mention a January 27th attack when the Houthis successfully hit the Marshall Islands flagged oil tanker, the Marlin Luanda. This is worth pointing out because the ship had to issue a distress call because it was burning, forcing a U.S. destroyer to respond, as well as others. And that's the grave nature of what the U.S. sees here, and what the U.S., the U.K., and others see it as so important to respond to the Houthis and let them know that if the attacks continue on international shipping, so too will the U.S. And the U.K. strikes on Houthi targets.

So -- and these are the mothers and the girlfriends, spouses of people who are serving in this, as Putin calls it, the special military operation. So, they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. And the message is not, we -- you know, we hate the war. They don't even call it a war. So, the -- what they want is they want their husbands and sons, et cetera, back.

Polls in the country's presidential election are set to open in a few hours. Nayib Bukele won praise for his crackdown on the country's notorious gang violence, but critics say the price for that is the loss of many freedoms and abuse of human rights.Stefano Pozzebon reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Jacqueline Anaya (ph) breaks down in tears when she talks about her niece, Jocelyn, who was just 20 years old when she was murdered in the streets of San Salvador. JACQUELINE ZELAYA (PH) NIECE MURDERED IN SAN SALVADOR (through translator):  It was hard to take her to the hospital like that. Just like I saw he when she was young, I said her goodbye. POZZEBON (voice-over):  The pain still fresh seven years after she was killed. Back then, El Salvador was close to being a failed state with the highest murder rate in the world. It was gangs like the infamous Mara Salvatrucha or MS 13 who set the rules. To these days, Anaya (ph) doesn't know who killed Jocelyne. She is sure, however, on who turned the tide on crime. Nayib Bukele became president in 2019 and quickly tied his name to a security crackdown that sent tens of thousands to jail and effectively taking the gangs off the street. A state of emergency was declared in 2022, granting the government exceptional powers to deploy the army and allowing the police to detain any citizen without charge for up to 15 days. Besides curtailing civil rights, such as due process. The government claims El Salvador is finally safe, and Bukele is cruising to re-election this Sunday. But his critics, such as Human Rights Watch, accuse him of mass indiscriminate detentions and even torture.",
