The details of which were just released overnight. But if you are asking what is in this thing and what has been left out, and how are lawmakers expected to vote on something this big and consequential in just a matter of days?Well, if you're asking that, you are not alone. Manu Raju is on the Hill for us. He joins us now. A bit of a reality check on all this. Manu, it goes without saying this is not how the process is supposed to work but I guess it is what it is at this point. What are you learning about the spending deal?",

Sources are telling CNN that not only the Patriot air defense missiles that we've talked about so much but these new bomb kits. So, what are we talking about? Well, a so-called dumb bomb, basically is fired off an airplane, drops to the ground, and hits whatever it hits, no precision, no guidance on it if you will.These kits that they're going to send are fitted onto those bombs, and they turn them into precision weapons. They are aimed at a target, the weapon flies to that target and headset. That will give the Ukrainians an advantage on the battlefield if they are able to strike with more precision at Russian targets inside Ukraine. They will have -- these weapons will have about a 15-mile range, so that also will help keep Ukrainian fighter jets out of the direct line of fire of Russian anti- air weapons. That's been the big issue right now. The Ukrainians fly but not a lot because of the possibility of being shut down by the Russians. But if they get this capability, it may help. And especially as winter is coming, and the Russians get more dug in, Ukrainians are looking for those Russian targets to strike.",

The bio that he presented at various points during his campaign just not really seeming to add up, including his educational background, his employment history, even a charity that he says he founded. Let's tick through just some of this.Santos has said that he received degrees from Baruch College and NYU, New York University. CNN has reached out and neither school can find records of that. His campaign bio also mentions working at both Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Neither firm has a record of that. And he claims that he founded a nonprofit animal rescue called Friends of Pets United, but the operation is not found in the IRS's searchable database. And that's just some of it. Joining me right now is Grace Ashford. She's one of the reporters with the New York Times who broke this story. Grace, thanks for coming on. What got you asking these questions about his background, the kind of led you down this path?",

So, this all started shortly after the election, my colleague, Michael Gold, and I were assigned to write what we thought would be a, you know, pretty quick piece on this new congressman from Long Island who was drawing a lot of attention. You know, he not only flipped a -- what had been a pretty blue district red, but he was also sort of this new model of, you know, perhaps with the GOP could be in the future.You know, he's only 34 years old. You know, he's Latino, and he's gay, which was, you know, all very, very interesting. And so, you know, as we started to look into him, you know, we looked at his bio, and we've looked at, you know, all sorts of different things. Actually, the pet charity that you mentioned, is one of the things that caught my eye because I've done some reporting into some nonprofits in the past. And so, one of the first things I did was just sort of, you know, look for some of the filings because he was very specific about it being a 501(c)(3). And when we weren't able to find that with the IRS, you know, we started to have some bigger questions.",

And, you know, one of the kinds of easy things to do is sort of you know call around and talk to people who worked at a place at the same time as -- you know, someone so you can get a sense of them. And you know, what kind of a colleague they were -- an employee. But his -- you know, didn't have those kinds of things.And so initially, you know, when we were just asking for that kind of -- you know, those types of documents and details and even dates when he was at a place and when they couldn't -- and repeatedly, they couldn't provide that to us.
