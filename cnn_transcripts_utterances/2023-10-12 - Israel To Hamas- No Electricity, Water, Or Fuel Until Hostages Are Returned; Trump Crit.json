Many of the 300,000 reservists called up already deployed ahead of a highly anticipated ground offensive into Gaza. (on camera): These are exactly the same gun positions Israeli Defense Forces used in that last major confrontation with the Hamas back in 2021. The question now, will this confrontation be different? Will Israel actually be able to crush Hamas, as the Prime Minister says he wants to do? (voice-over): Military and fences have beaten them before and won't be easy now.

The stories and images are gut wrenching, but important to hear and important to see. Your CNN's Nada Bashir. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (voice-over): Gripped by grief and loss of unfathomable scale, Gaza's death toll and the number of civilians wounded is rising with each and every airstrike. In the shorter refugee camp, men dig with their bare hands, desperate to rescue loved ones from beneath the rubble of what once were their homes. Saad begins to list the names of the children killed in this latest strike. Among them his niece, she was just a few months old. Now she is one of more than 440 children Gaza's health ministry says has been killed by Israeli airstrikes so far. Israel says it is striking Hamas targets what authorities here say medical facilities, schools and residential areas have been impacted. Our neighbor said that the Israelis had called and told them to evacuate the area around our home. So we came to stay with relatives here in a shelter, Nabeel says. But the next morning when we woke up to pray at dawn, the airstrike happened, there was no warning. The densely populated Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli land, sea and air blockade since 2007, is home to more than 2 million people. Around 47 percent of them are children. So far, at least 340,000 people have been displaced within Gaza. Many are now forced to take shelter in U.N. run schools like this one. But civilians here are also now facing what the Israeli government has described as a complete siege on Gaza. There's no water for us to drink, no water for us to wash ourselves with so that we can pray, Maram says. They've bombed our schools, many people have been killed. It's not fair for children like us. Why is this happening to us? Live under a blockade is all that the children of Gaza have ever known. For some, like 13 year old Nadine, it is hard to imagine a future beyond this relentless conflict.",

One said, I do not think we are close to a floor vote unless Scalise wants a losing vote.And another one blamed Kevin McCarthy.

Today, a hospital in Tel Aviv moved four floors worth of patients and more than 300 beds to an underground parking garage in case of a missile strike. Erin Burnett is back with us from Tel Aviv. She was at a hospital in Ashkelon earlier which was hit by rocket fire yesterday. Erin, what is the situation on the ground, like right now in Tel Aviv?ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR, \"OUTFRONT\": Yes, so when -- you know, there was a warning today about long range missiles, which obviously would be something that would be seen here, Jake, as you know, as a threat to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. We actually were south along the Gaza border when that came in. But you've got these, you know, constant rocket attacks coming in on various southern towns and cities. And, you know, you talk about the impact on the hospitals. I mean, even here on the Israeli side, what they did in Tel Aviv, in Ashkelon, where we were, you know, yesterday, we were sort of caught in the midst of a massive rocket strike. I mean, there were dozens of them, dozens upon dozens coming in, some of them got through, and some of them got through to the city of Ashkelon near that Gaza border where we were. We went and found where one of the strikes was an apartment building and another was at this hospital, and the hospital had been hit. Now the hospital is still functioning, obviously, it is still a crucial place for people to go to, 70 people went to the hospital where I was today, just yesterday, from those strikes near Ashkelon along the Gaza border. So the Iron Dome, as successful as it is, you still had 70 injuries just yesterday. They had 650 people come to that hospital in Ashkelon, Jake, from the attacks on Saturday. And more than two dozen of them are still there. But this is what it is when you're standing in front of a door, emergency room and trauma. That is exactly what is happening. And that's just on the Israeli side. Because we're standing by that hospital today, Jake, and it's just a few miles from Gaza. And you hear the thud, thud, thud of the Israeli strikes on Gaza. And you can't help but just for a moment, pause and say as you hear it in the background. There are people being injured there. There are people being killed there. And the hospital situation there obviously, is incredibly dire.",

It's funerals. They're going to funerals. So on the festival, she -- her friend died, she went to her friend's funeral. She went to two funerals yesterday, going to funeral after funeral.And that is what you're hearing people say.

Roey was a great kid. You know, one of the things we always said about him is he always walked around with a smile on his face. He loved to play sport. He was a big football, American football and basketball and soccer fan. He had amazing group of friends. All about great kid. He was always an out of the box thinker. Always showed signs of leadership. We always knew he would do something great, not what we expected. But we always knew he would do something great. He always took care. He had a way of always taking care of the weaker kids in his class. These are stories the mothers have been sending me these, we remember your son from the third grade, when our son was having a hard time your son took care of him.
