It shows dozens of casualties near Shifa Hospital in Gaza. We're seeing at least a dozen bloodied bodies strewn across the ground near an ambulance. The escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, a main focus as America's top diplomat returns to the Middle East.The Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, today pressing Israel for a pause in the fighting with Hamas as the war now enters its fifth week and international condemnation grows.

      "sentences": "Now, while Blinken was speaking, the leader of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah praised Hamas for its October 7th terror attack. These were Hassan Nasrallah's first public speeches since the start of the war. He also stoked fears the conflict could widen if Israel does not stop its assault on Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rejecting any type of ceasefire, ceasefire in Gaza unless Hamas frees all of the hostages. And all of this happening as hundreds more foreign nationals are able to escape the war zone through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. And we have it all covered for you. At this hour, we go first to CNN's Ben Wedeman, who's in Beirut. And Ben, Hezbollah's leader spoke for more than an hour. Many people wanted to know if he'd call for an escalation of this war. What did he say? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, in fact, there were high expectations about this speech, one way or the other. But it really ended with a note of ambiguity. Basically, he said the possibility of a Lebanese front escalating into a broad battle is a realistic option. Israel should take this into account. But what we've seen since the 8th of October is that there has been a low level of exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel. Yesterday, we see -- saw a dramatic uptick. Today, it was actually relatively quiet. So, basically, Hezbollah and Iran and others are kind of leaving the option open of an escalation, but not actually escalating until this point. He did stress or claim that Hezbollah's attack on Israel on the 7th of October was 100% a Hamas decision, that not even the other militant factions in Gaza knew about it, let alone Hezbollah, Iran, and others. He did say, however, that as a result of Hezbollah's actions on the border with Israel, that about a third, in his words, a third of the Israeli army has been tied down in the north and not free to join the Israeli ground invasion in Gaza.

It is a command and control, and out of it is a whole spider web of tunnels connecting Hamas's subterranean military terror machine. If you take pictures above ground, you see civilian buildings and you see a hospital. Below them, Hamas has placed its most vital military infrastructure. And this, of course, is a war crime, because Hamas is using the hospital as a shield, as a civilian shield for its war machine, and they have to be condemned for that.",

You have to be very careful with whatever Hamas propaganda is saying. We remember that previous incident at a hospital where Hamas accused Israel of attacking, and in the end it was a terrorist missile that malfunctioned and fell short. And as Hamas's military situation becomes more precarious as Israeli forces advance and as we take on and defeat the terrorists, I can expect them to lie even more and more.",

We cannot live with this brutal terrorist organization that committed the atrocities that it did on October 7th. We refuse to live any longer with this terrorist enclave as our southern neighbor. I don't think any country would stand for that. And Israel, least of all, we won't stand for it. And there will be a new reality in Gaza.We also agree that we have to differentiate as much as possible between the terrorists in Gaza, who are our enemy and the target of our operation, and the civilian population. We also agree that a maximum effort has to be made for humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, the civilian population, and we're working together with the Americans on that. But as to the issue you raise about the humanitarian pause, our position is clear. Any humanitarian pause has to be connected to a release of hostages. That is the number 1 humanitarian issue. They have abducted more than 240 of our people. They refuse Red Cross visits to those people. If anyone wants to talk about a humanitarian crisis, what about the Israeli hostages?",

One is to reiterate what your correspondent, Ben Wedeman, said there in Beirut, that the sad reality is that this Iranian proxy, this terrorist group, has the ability to launch a war that will encompass all of Lebanon. Not the Lebanese government, not the Lebanese people, but this Iranian proxy terrorist group.And it must be remembered, it's not just Israel and the United States and the West that considers Hezbollah a terrorist group. The Arab League itself, that organization that contains all the Arab countries, the Arab League has declared Hezbollah a terrorist organization. And that organization can drag Lebanon into a war. It's a terrible situation. But as to the speech, I think I'd be correct in saying we're not so worried about Nasrallah's words. We're watching his actions. And we are following his actions closely. And if he launches a war, he will find an Israeli response that he will regret the day that he launched the war. We don't want a war. We're not interested in an escalation in the north. But if he forces us to fight, we will fight and we will win decisively.",

What I think what we're doing today is we're focusing on winning the war against Hezbollah, against Hamas. I apologize. Against Hamas in Gaza. That's the effort. That'll be a difficult struggle. We're taking casualties, but we must win that war. We have to dismantle Hamas. We have to disarm Hamas. We have to end Hamas rule in Gaza.When that war is over, after we are victorious, then there'll be plenty of time for politics, more than enough time. We Israelis, we love to passionately debate all the issues under the sun. And when the war is over, there'll be time for that. At the moment, it's a time for national unity. It's a time for commitment. It's a time for struggle. It's a time to achieve victory against this brutal terrorist organization that murdered our people. And Boris, they didn't ask Israelis how they voted when they when they when they butchered us. They didn't ask Israelis if they're of the left or of the right, the secular or religious, if they're for Netanyahu, against Netanyahu. They killed us all. They killed us all.

He stood by them.And Eric Trump was saying that he was assured by accountants and lawyers about these financial statements, saying that when he had comfort from them, that they were, quote, perfect, he had no problem signing them. He also said that he would not sign something that is not accurate. So again, doubling down on these financial statements at the center of this case. Now, he's finished with his testimony and his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., testified yesterday and the day before. So next up is former President Donald Trump. He is expected to testify on Monday. That will likely be a tension-filled day. Donald Trump has sat through numerous depositions, dozens of them, that this time he will be under oath, live testimony before a judge he has criticized, and across the room from the New York attorney general, who has attended the trial when he is there, likely sitting across the room from her, with the tensions expected to be very high. And Donald Trump having to answer questions about these financial statements, his involvement in them, the accuracy of them under oath was so much at stake for his company's business in New York. And once his testimony is finished, which is expected to go the whole day, his daughter Ivanka Trump is expected to testify on Wednesday. She has tried to block this testimony. But so far, it looks like it, it's a go and it will happen on Wednesday. After that, the New York attorney general's office is expected to rest their case. Jessica.",

So, in addition to that, you know, I think that it kind of is a prelude of what we might see on Monday when Trump testifies. Again, like you said, you know, he has been saying this is a witch hunt over and over again.

So, you know, if you had nothing, if you had no knowledge at all, then yeah, to some extent, ignorance can be a defense. But reckless disregard is still something that is relevant. So it's -- even then, it's going to be a little bit difficult for them to show that they had no knowledge whatsoever of this.And, and I also would mention something else that Kara didn't mention about what happened in court today that I found to be quite interesting is that there was another dispute here, again, about the judge's clerk, Chris Kise, Trump's attorney, raised this issue or these allegations that, as I understand it, are baseless about, you know, the Trump, --  the clerk being a partisan, biased person who's advising the judge. I think that it's going to be very interesting next week when Trump testifies because, of course, there's a gag order on the case. He's already violated that gag order twice by talking about the judge's clerk. The judge, the last time that this happened, put Trump on the stand and found his testimony not to be credible. So, Trump already has this history with the judge, a history with the clerk. And so, I'm very interested to see how that plays out, especially in light of what happened today where Eric Trump's testimony was kind of overshadowed by this dispute about the clerk and the allegations that Trump's team was making about her, again, as I understand it, without any sort of a basis to that claim.",
