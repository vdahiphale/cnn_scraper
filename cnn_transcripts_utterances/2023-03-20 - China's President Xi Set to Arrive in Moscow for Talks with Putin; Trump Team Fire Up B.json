Good Monday morning to you. In just 90 minutes, China's leader Xi Jinping arrives in Moscow for a state visit, including a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Overnight, the two leaders published articles written for audiences in each other's countries. The pieces highlight their growing mutual trust and cooperation, and credit China for promoting peace in Ukraine. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz following the story live from London for us. And Salma, what's the purpose of Xi's visit? And what is Putin looking for from China?",

For President Putin, his role is going to be to woo President Xi to get him on-side and get him even closer.Remember they're already very close allies, and to make President Xi see the world the way President Putin sees the world. Ahead of this visit, President Putin seemed to be preparing, by making this visit to Mariupol, the first visit to that war-torn region since the conflict began. He could be seen touring the damage there, demonstrating his strength in leadership, despite the fact that there's been arrest warrant issued for him by the ICC. He laid out his vision in a Chinese state paper. I want to read you one quote that really shows you just how close the global view here is aligned between these two world leaders. The crisis in Ukraine, he writes, which is -- \"was provoked and is being diligently fueled by the West is the most striking, yet not the only manifestation of its desire to retain its international dominance. It is crystal clear that NATO is striving for a global reach of activities and seeking to penetrate the Asia Pacific.\" Look, for D.C., this is going to be a concerning meeting, two global leaders who seem to hold anti-American views, who seem to want to counter American hegemony. Meeting at a critical moment in a conflict, and the big question here is, will there be an announcement coming out of this? Will there be some sort of agreement out of this? The United States has already preempted that with a great deal of skepticism, and said anything coming from Beijing and Moscow on the back of this meeting, that will be one-sided.",

Law enforcement agencies, everyone from the NYPD to the Secret Service to federal agents, as well as court officers which are responsible for safety inside the courtroom have all been coordinating in recent days ahead of this potential indictment. Now, Donald Trump, taking to his social media channel, to say that he would be arrested on Tuesday, and calling on his supporters to protest. That is creating another layer of logistical challenges for authorities here in New York City. Because should protests happen here in the area, it would complicate the security and the logistics. We expect former President Donald Trump to turn himself in, if he is in fact charged with a crime, arrested and indicted. He would have to show up here to Manhattan Criminal Court here behind me, just as anybody else who is accused of a crime. He would have to go before a judge. He would be finger-printed, his mugshot would be taken, and he would go through the criminal justice process, like anyone else facing a crime. The one big and obvious difference here, of course, is that we are talking about the former president of the United States, not only that, but also a current candidate for the presidency, adding a whole layer of history to this potential event, and also adding to the complications around safety and security that local enforcement has to provide for him. So local authorities preparing for the possibility of that indictment. Former President Donald Trump saying that he expects to be arrested on Tuesday, but of course, all of it remains to be seen.

And It's a system whereby essentially the Fed can swap dollars with foreign currency issued by other central banks. This is really designed to give dollar liquidity to these other central banks so that they can in turn funnel it into their financial systems at a time when their banks might be having trouble for accessing funding in a normal way, like on the open markets.So, it turns to happen at a time of strain in the financial system, we saw it during COVID. So that's what that is. It was not changed on Sunday, it was just made more frequent. The facility will now be available daily, instead of weekly, until at least the end of April, say these central banks. So it's sort of a temporary measure designed to shore up liquidity and in turn, confidence in the banking system. As we know, confidence is key. But as you say, that came -- that announcement came just hours after we learned that UBS would be essentially acquiring its rival Credit Suisse in a deal backed by the Swiss government. That move, along with the move of the central banks, both designed to prevent contagion. No one wants to see this banking crisis spread. But the interesting thing about the move by the central banks, was that, that's not just about financial contagion, that's about economic contagion. They either want to see banks tighten lending, and that spread into the economy, which is a very fast way, as you know, to slow down an economy if banks pull back on credit. But in terms of the reaction in the markets, Christine, let's take a look at the European markets, they have opened lower. We're seeing that any kind of relief rally that you might have got after back of this move by the Swiss authorities to have UBS acquire Credit Suisse has not materialized. Credit Suisse's stock has dropped by about two- thirds. That is sort of a material at this point, given that the bank will cease to exist. But UBS, which has taken it over also down very sharply. They have said they don't expect not to turn a profit until 2027.",

You see Vladimir Putin arriving by helicopter into occupied territory into Mariupol. The image, I think he's trying to project, is that things are getting back to normal ahead of the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping.Of course, they're not normal. Many people have evacuated those areas. Large parts of that city still lie in ruin. The Ukrainians, at least, one official saying, Putin acted like a thief, coming in the night. Both for his safety, they say, and also, it indicates they didn't want to show the devastation in that city. In general, this would be viewed very harshly by Ukrainians, of course. Another official saying it was a cynical move. And I think it is the timing is important. I think the Russian president is trying to say things are getting back to normal, even though they're not. Right as we expect, the Chinese president in the coming hours to arrive in Moscow and have these very important meetings with the Russian president. Earlier today, there was an article published in the name of X Jinping in Russia. That is also quite unusual. Many people have been wondering how China will end up standing on this conflict . They have to a certain extent, stood on the sideline though, doing brisk trade for Russia, particularly for its oil. There could be some meeting -- or there certainly be meetings, but some agreements, and it will be very interesting and significant to watch how China actually plays us, and whether they make a more explicit support of Putin in the last 24 hours.

KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST &amp; SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR, MILITARY TIMES:  Well, it really is the combined forces of two authoritarians, saying this is going to be the new world order from here on out. Xi thinks many decades ahead. And he is planning to supplant the United States as the global first world superpower. And part of positioning himself for that is showing that he can make peace deals, be a power broker, and Russia needs Beijing so badly at this point, that basically, this is laying the groundwork for how it's going to work from here on out, the longer this war in Ukraine goes on, the more Moscow is going to be reliant on Beijing.",
