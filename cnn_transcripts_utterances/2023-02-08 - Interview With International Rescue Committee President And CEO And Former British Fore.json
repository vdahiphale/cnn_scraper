And the critical thing to understand is that any earthquake is a crisis. But this earthquake is a crisis piled upon a crisis. On Sunday, the day before the earthquake struck, 15 million people across Syria were in humanitarian need. They needed humanitarian agencies, like the International Rescue Committee to survive, to get health care, to get education. They were not being served by the government in Damascus because the northwest of Syria is under the control of a range of different rebel organizations. And when your correspondent says that survival is victory, that is undoubtedly the case at the moment. Especially with the damage to the crossing point from Turkey into Syria. Because there is no access for humanitarian aid workers from other parts of Syria into the northwest. We depend on that passage from Turkey. And I'm afraid there used to be two crossing points there, but a Russian veto in the security council cut it down to one. And now, that has been impeded by the earthquake.

But in other villages in Syria, and probably in Turkey, too, they're having a really hard time. Now, Syrian government is saying that that's -- you know, they can't help people because of the sanctions. Surely, sanctions are exempt in humanitarian crises. Tell me what the law is.

They've got one thing in common and one thing that's very different. In both situations, you have the bombing of civilians on an indiscriminate basis. That's happened in Syria. And the pummeling that the east of Ukraine is taking from Russian missile and other attacks shows a similar trend. A complete abuse of international humanitarian law which is meant to protect civilians. Now, the big difference between Syria and Ukraine, and a difference that I think explains the extraordinary decision of the Ukraine government to reach out on a humanitarian basis with its own people, is that while the Ukraine humanitarian response is very well organized and very well-funded, the Syria humanitarian response has been significantly underfunded. And if you look at the figures on U.N. appeals, for example, 80, 85, 90 percent of the U.N. appeal for Ukraine has been funded. In Syria, it's less than half.",

And I guess just to raise the fact again that this is especially egregious since Russia itself, along with your country and the United States agreed to protect Ukraine's sovereignty in return for it giving up its nuclear weapons back in 1994. So, there's just so much that doesn't make sense from Russia's perspective today. So, what do you make then of the president of Ukraine coming to Britain?

Look, I think that President Zelenskyy's visit, which follows this extraordinary international effort that he's made at communicating to the world as well as communicating to his own people speaks to the fact that this Ukraine war is going to be a long haul and it is global in its consequences. The side of this war that is about support, that is about legitimacy, that it's about credibility is obviously very, very important alongside the battlefield that President Zelenskyy is marshaling. I lead a humanitarian organization. So, we are dealing with the civilian victims inside Ukraine and in the neighboring countries who have been driven from their homes. So, I'm not going to be able to comment on the military balance of power. But what is obviously significant from both a political point of view and a humanitarian point of view is that this crisis is deepening and its broadening.

For many years, Farhad has been a very active member of our civil society.

And his demands are the demands of the majority of Iranians. Farhad has called for an end to executions of protesters, an end to forced hijab harassment and also, the release of six political prisoners, Bahareh Hedayat, Nahidashi Bashi (ph), Niloofar Hamedi, Mohammad Habibi, Mustafa Nili and Reza Shahabi.

If you look at trend growth and so forth, its debt problems and all the rest of it. If you consider -- remember that it's still a very poor country, a very substantially poorer, properly measured than all the high-income countries. That's a quarter of the living standards of the U.S., will it close that gap? I think that's becoming, at least, increasingly questionable. And the issue certainly is, can Mr. Xi exercise the, sort of, top-down control he has done. Imposing these restraints on businesses, done without consequences? Certainly, many of the business people I meet, including Chinese business people, are clearly pretty frightened of what he is doing. So, I think it's a really big question. I would never predict the political future of China. But it seems to me also a rush (ph) to assume that this autocracy will last forever. I can still remember -- not that I'm making comparisons, but I can remember very well that in 1980 nobody imagined, certainly in 1970, that within 20 years the Soviet Union would simply disappear. I think we cannot assume that autocracies, and autocracy like China, will win the great battle between freedom, both political and economic, and autocracy.

My motherleft Holland in May 1940 with her immediate family, her parents and her siblings. Unfortunately, in both cases, their wider families were left behind and, essentially, they were all killed. The reason this matters to me, of course, is that I became aware because of their story and, of course, the story of so many people like them, of the extreme fragility of a civilized state, of the collapse that is possible in political and moral standards if things get bad enough and people are desperate enough and the wrong, sort of, leaders come along. Not -- I'm not comparing anyone, anyone who is now around with the sort of leadership we saw, particularly in Germany in the inter war period. Of course, I'm not. But we are seeing a lot of countries being led by authoritarian leaders who use the rage in the public, the anger in the public against elites who establish autocratic power, the ride rough shot over the rule of law, deprive minorities of their rights. And this has happened in parts of central and eastern Europe. It's happened in emerging countries. And there are politicians rooted in the old fascism who are really in very powerful positions now in Europe. And then of course, things, you know, obviously, we had all the difficulties about your last presidential election. And the widespread myth, as far as I can see, that they were stolen by Biden. This is all very frightening for me. The fear is not that we're going back to fascism. It's a very different time. But the democracy, the liberal societies that we have enjoyed in the post-war period as a result of the victory in the second world war could be replaced with backsliding. One scholar calls it a prolonged democratic recession. And that's what we've been seeing. And we've been seeing it even in core western countries like, of course, your own.",

We haven't seen that for a long time. It would be wonderful if it did. Yet another and much more controversial issue is corporate governance. If you run corporate -- corporations, essentially, solely for the interest of shareholders which basically is determined by the management who represents them, then there is a very big argument about whether to the returns to the company. The rewards of the company are appropriately shared between shareholders and management and control the whole business. On the one hand, not all the people who work in the business is on the other. And that explains in the fact that this is into some extent extract and explains is simply staggering increases in the pay of top executives vis-a-vis the rest of the people working in their companies. So, that's another example of essentially extractive process is. And I think there are -- another one again and perhaps the most important is using the money. Individual (INAUDIBLE) of corporate money to influence the political system to grant extremely favorable terms above all for taxation, international taxation, and so forth which allows an enormous amount of tax avoidance and evasion in all sorts of ways. And I've present lots of examples of that.

They -- the -- it's legitimate for them to complain because actually if you look at the performance of our economies and the benefits that many people have achieved from the progress we've made, it has been extremely, unequally shared. And it hasn't been a very well managed. That's why I emphasized the impact of financial crisis. One of the many figures I have in my book to show how huge the losses of income have been across our countries since the financial crisis. And so, that really does indicate quite a profound failure. So, I think that this sense that the elite are remote from us, the completely different lives, basically hold all the power in our society, they basically determine how things are done in regulation, in taxation, in how market competition works. That they buy the politicians. This is a perfectly understandable view. You can see the same phenomenon in the Brexit campaign here, and the sense of alienation of ordinary people. Particularly people who didn't go to college from all this. It seems to me to have become very, very profound. And that's linked, of course, with really profound social changes which are also discussed about -- which are to do with a fact that one of the biggest changes over the last half century is the way our economies have moved against people who are not college educated and in favor of people who are college educated and particularly a subset of the latter.
