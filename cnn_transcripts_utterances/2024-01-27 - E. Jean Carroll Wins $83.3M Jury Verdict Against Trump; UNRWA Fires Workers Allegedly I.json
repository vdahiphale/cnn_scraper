Donald Trump and his main rival for the GOP nomination react to a stunning verdict in his civil defamation suit.The Governor of Texas makes a stand when it comes to handling control of the U.S.-Mexico border back to the federal authorities. Plus, a United Nations Agency working in Gaza responds to allegations that some of its workers may have helped Hamas carry out the deadly October 7th terror attack. Well, Donald Trump says the verdict in his latest legal loss is, quote, \"absolutely ridiculous\" and he is looking to appeal. A jury says the embattled former U.S. president should pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation. In 2019, Trump made disparaging public comments about Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault. Carroll's attorney tells CNN's Anderson Cooper that her client is overjoyed with the verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTA KAPLAN, E. JEAN CARROLL'S ATTORNEY: She cried. She showed more emotion, and I've known her for a long time now that I've ever seen her show. She feels that she got justice from the jury today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's a significant win for Carroll, who has been pursuing Trump for years in this defamation case for statements he made in 2019 when he was president. The way the jury broke down this verdict, they were awarding Carroll$7.3 million for emotional harm, $11 million to repair her reputation, and $65 million in punitive damages. That is the punishment phase for Trump, which they send a clear message to Trump and agreeing with Carroll's attorneys closing arguments in their closings. They said that the only way to hold Donald Trump accountable was to hit him in his pocketbook to make him stop repeating the defamatory statements that a previous jury had already found to be defamatory. They argued to the jury that Donald Trump had disregarded that verdict, didn't respect it, and has repeated those defamatory statements ever since. It was at that moment in closing arguments that Donald Trump stood up, walked out of the courtroom. Now, he did later return for his lawyers closing arguments. They made the case that Donald Trump couldn't be held accountable for mean tweets, and that E. Jean Carroll had asked for some of this attention. Obviously, the jury of seven men and two women disregarding Donald Trump's argument and awarding Carol this significant amount of money. She had asked initially for more than $10 million, this verdict sending a message to Donald Trump. Now, he responded by calling it ridiculous. His attorney said it was a witch hunt. Take a listen. ALINA HABBA, TRUMP'S LAWYER: So many Americans are so proud that he is running again and so excited to run to the ballot box, but don't get it twisted. We are seeing a violation of our justice system. This is wrong, but we are in the State of New York. We are in a New York jury, and that is why we are seeing these witch hunts, these hoaxes, as he calls them.",

But what we understand at the moment is that, an Israeli authorities told UNRWA that they were aware that a number of their workers have been involved in Hamas' brutal October 7th attacks.UNRWA said that they investigated this. The U.N. Secretary General was made aware in a statement he said that this was horrendous, that he said that there would be a thorough investigation. He also spoke, the U.N. Secretary General also spoke with the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who said that he was pleased to see that the U.N. was going to have a complete and independent review of what happened, of an investigation into the events around this. We've heard also from the defense minister here saying this is vital to have clarity on international funding for humanitarian aid in Gaza in the future so that this sort of thing can't happen again. The Foreign Minister in Israel has also said that this mustn't happen again, that it's important for it to be investigated thoroughly. We don't know from UNRWA themselves how many people were involved, but both the U.S. State Department and the defense minister here have said that 12 people were involved. Now, UNRWA in its totality has about 30,000 employees across the region. It has 13,000 people working inside of Gaza. So as far as we understand at the moment, this involved 12 people who have now been terminated. But it is triggering now a big review and investigation, and it has triggered the U.S. State Department to put a temporary pause on additional funding at the moment. We don't know what impact this will have on the humanitarian aid, when it might have, but I think the indications are there will be no immediate effect, but of course a great concern going forward.

The final one could take years to actually litigate, but what this is, is a temporary injunction, you can call it, or a ruling on whether or not the allegations leveled by South Africa of genocide are plausible enough to warrant these measures. And in six of the nine requests made by the South Africans, the court granted that. So this is broadly being welcomed by Arab states.[04:10:12] And when it comes to the Israelis and the Palestinians, while the Palestinians, obviously we're hoping that the court went further, they are also hailing this as a victory. The Israelis, they don't think that this should have been in court in the first place, but they are also praising this ruling. So the Palestinian authorities, foreign minister said that this was a ruling in favor of humanity and international law.

He says that they are out of food. They are out of painkillers. There are still some 150 staff there, though many of the doctors have left the area. There are hundreds of patients there. And of course, there are people who are taking shelter inside that area as well. And many people have left that entire neighborhood as this siege by the Israelis continues. They have been told to take the main route elsewhere. But we have videos showing an Israeli tank watching over this steady stream of people. We also have some reports from Palestinians who say that, look, the Israelis are not discriminating between or distinguishing between actual fighters and civilians. Some people say that when they're trying to move around, they're being shot at. We have put those claims to the IDF. We don't have a specific response to that just yet. But the situation inside the hospitals as this siege continues, Anna, as MSF or Doctors Without Borders describes it, they say that medical services have absolutely collapsed. The WHO says that it is extremely challenging to get supplies into the area. All the while, the IDF continues to insist that this operation is being very precise. They are using snipers.

The watch of the internal pressure from the public, who some of it doesn't see the -- or doesn't understand why this war continues, why more and more soldiers are being killed, the international pressure about the civilians being killed in Gaza. And of course, the lack of ammunition because Israel needs to save a lot in case there's another front in the north. I think those watches will become crucial much earlier than two years.

This is CNN Newsroom.Updating you on our top story, a jury is ordering the front runner for the Republican presidential nomination to pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defamation. The courtroom drama stems from 2019 when Donald Trump was president and made disparaging public comments about Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault. Well, CNN's Kristen Holmes has more from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump was not in the courtroom when that verdict was read, just his attorneys, where he instead was sitting on an airplane -- in an airplane on a tarmac, getting ready to leave New York and go to a political event where he's going to speak later Saturday. And that's when he fired off a series of posts on \"True Social,\" one of them, not surprisingly, immediately linking this to the political, saying, absolutely ridiculous, I fully disagree with both verdicts and will be appealing this whole Biden-directed witch hunt focused on me and the Republican Party. Our legal system is out of control and being used as a political weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment rights. This is not America. He went on to post again, \"There is no longer justice in America. Our judicial system is broken and unfair.\" A couple of things to note here, of course, there has been no evidence of any link in this case to President Biden, but this is something that he routinely does. He links all of these legal cases together. And then says that they are election interference. And I will tell you from going to various campaign events, this is a strategy that works among his supporters. The other thing to point out in the statement is there is absolutely no mention of E. Jean Carroll. This comes after weeks and especially days of him posting routinely about E. Jean Carroll. So perhaps the message that the jury sent him, that $83.3 million message is getting through. We also heard E. Jean Carroll's lawyer saying, if you continue to lash out at her, we will continue to sue. One thing about Donald Trump, he cares deeply about his finances and his money, and he does not want to part with his money. Now, of course, as we've noted, they are going to appeal this, but I can tell you from sources that he has been absolutely livid. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Also saying his majesty would like to thank all of those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and that the king is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness. What he is referring to there is that the palace didn't necessarilyneed to reveal that he had an enlarged prostate because it didn't have a huge public interest as head of state. But the king wanted to release that information to encourage other men to go and get themselves checked and it did have that effect because there was a large increase in inquiries to the National Health Service about enlarged prostates off the back of the king's announcement. A source has told me that the king has gone to visit the Princess of Wales who is in hospital for abdominal surgery. She's in recovery at the moment. The king went to see her before his own surgery. We believe they're in the same hospital. I don't think we're going to get any more information. A source saying they're not going to reveal any more details about the treatment that the king is receiving. Whilst they accept they need to reveal some medical details they do think there's a line there and at some point they start invading their privacy. Max Foster, CNN London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
