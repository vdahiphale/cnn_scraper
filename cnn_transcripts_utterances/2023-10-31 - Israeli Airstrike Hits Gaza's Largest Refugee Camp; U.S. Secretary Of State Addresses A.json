Very, very densely populated area. Perhaps one of the most densely populated parts of the Gaza Strip. The biggest refugee camp of the 8 different refugee camps inside of Gaza. And this gets to the IDF's point here, Wolf. They describe this as a very complicated battle space. The spokesman there telling you they'll get back with more data points. One of those potential data points will be the possibility of tunnels in that area. The images show multiple impacts within this area that the local Hamas-controlled officials say destroyed 20 different homes in that area. But the image of devastation and the impact on the civilians in that area is huge. And this is bound to continue to escalate. The international calls for Israel to get to a ceasefire, which we know the Prime Minister has said as recently as yesterday, is not going to happen. But for the IDF at the moment, this really does seem to be a situation, as they say, they've taken ownership of it and now its -- now more explanation is required and they're working on it, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "It is. Israel's position on this is that they are trying to avoid civilian casualties, that Hamas, who they say hide behind the civilians, are responsible for the safety of civilians. This is why the IDF has been dropping leaflets in the area, in the north of Gaza and the center of Gaza, saying that this is now a battlefield and that people should leave. A journalist from Al Jazeera who lives in Gaza City, very close to the Jabalia refugee camp, yesterday on air spoke about her husband in the house, in the family home where she was receiving a phone call from the IDF saying that you need to move south, you need to get out of the area, it's unsafe. And he asked the person on the phone, well, where do I go to do that?How do we do it? And I think this is the question that many Palestinians are facing at the moment. This is what we hear from others. They don't know the safe roads to get out of Gaza. And when this reporter's husband, she says, asked the IDF, well, how do we do it? The answer was, well, that's going to come from the local authorities. We can't tell you that. So, while there are these warnings, the warnings are not apparently doing a lot to provide the Gaza citizens with roadmaps, if you will, safe roadmaps. They're told that there is a humanitarian safe zone in the south of the Gaza Strip. But what they're looking for is information that will get them there safely, times that they can get there safely, roads that they can use safely. And that's information that we're not aware that the IDF is able to communicate them or is trying to communicate to them. And that's what makes the situation in Gaza so desperate. The civilians are hugely afraid of these huge strikes that are happening around them and that they're getting caught up in. But they don't know how to get physically to these safe places, for many of them, at least.",

Two 1st sergeants, both 20 years old, were killed as part of these operations. It's very hard to understand in a detailed way what's happening on the ground. But from where we are here in Starot, and we've been further south along the border with Gaza today, and it's the same there, you hear the sounds of artillery here being fired into Gaza at the moment. We were hearing, particularly at dusk, multiple artillery rounds being fired into Gaza where we were further south along the border. And that seems to be the nature of the fight at the moment.The troops on the ground calling in strikes against what they describe as Hamas strongholds. The air force here, the artillery, bringing firepower to bear on that. And the civilians clearly, as we've seen today, sometimes getting caught, -- sometimes feeling the brunt of that and getting caught up in it. But how, what type of progress the troops on the ground are making? How they're making that progress? How many troops are in there? How many tanks are in there? How many armored fighting vehicles? Very hard to know. What I can say is what we saw this evening, not far from the border with Gaza as night was falling, was another column of armored vehicles forming up. We don't know where they were going to go, but for all intents and purposes, they looked like they were forming up to provide reinforcements for the troops already inside Gaza, Wolf.",

Joining us now, retired U.S. Army Major General Dana Pitard. General, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, what's your take on this Israeli airstrike hitting Gaza's largest refugee camp earlier today?MAJ. GEN DANA PITTARD, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, good evening, Wolf. Very, very difficult and complex. I've been in a strike cell making that kind of a call against a high-value target in a populated area. You know, Israeli forces are extremely good, but in something like this, sometimes it may call for tactical and operational patience. Once you have a target, then you track that target. You track them with your manned and unmanned aerial equipment and all sorts of different systems and sensors. And maybe that was the only shot they had, and they had to take it. So, it's a difficult call to do. But I've seen it where once we have that high-value target, we're able to then track that target to a location away from a populated area, because they'll make a mistake at some point. But let's remember, Hamas has put the Palestinian people in jeopardy by having leaders hide behind innocent civilians.",

Would the U.S. do what the Israelis clearly did now? They've confirmed it. The IDF spokesperson confirmed it to us just a little while ago that this was an Israeli operation targeting this Hamas commander. But would the U.S. go and bomb a situation like that with a lot of civilians in the area, even if there was a high-value target there?",

But there's a difference also when you have U.S. aircraft with precision bombing who are very, very good in getting precision targets. But again, you try as hard as you can not to have any civilian casualties. So, most likely that decision would be no, but it still depends on that target. If that's the only shot you have, you've got to make a decision.",

But having said that, we also don't know whether this commander was alone or was in a command center.

It's for the same reason Hamas is keeping civilians around its headquarters in Jabalia refugee camp. They're human shields. So, Hamas realizes that having American citizens in Gaza is a great human shield. And what Hamas wants is for the United States to declare a ceasefire, try to impose a ceasefire, because a ceasefire simply means the Hamas wins the war and basically Israel dies.We won't be able to restore our security in any way. So, they're the -- they're in many ways, the ultimate human shields. The hostages are human shields as well. So, it'd be the best, I think the best route that the United States to do it, I think it's probably above my pay grade to give advice at this stage to Secretary of State Blinken, would be to put immense pressure on Qatar and say, you know, Qatar is, you know, a funder and backer of Hamas. Many Hamas senior commanders live in Qatar. The United States has influence over Qatar, has a huge naval base there and great educational and business interests.

One of them during my time was knocked out, Kissufim. Another border crossing, Erez, has been knocked out by Hamas during this fighting. And the biggest border crossing is the ironically named Vineyard of Peace, Kerem Shalom, which was shelled and taken over by Hamas terrorists.So even physically, I don't know how this could be done on our side of the border. Obviously, the only place it could be done would be on the Egyptian crossing at Rafah. And I think the Egyptians, I can't understand why the Egyptians would not want to coordinate with the United States on this. They're very sensitive about letting Palestinians, even 1 Palestinian into Sinai, but certainly the United States has leverage over Egypt as well. With us, it's not a matter of leverage. With us, it's a matter of simply, there's no place to cross and you can't ask Israelis to go down and risk their lives under fire to try to reopen one of those border crossings.",
