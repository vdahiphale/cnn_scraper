I mean, this has a potential nexus to terrorism. And why is that?The definition of terrorism is violence or intimidation in order to coerce a government or in order to infect and change public policy. You know, this has all the stylings of like a 1940s, 1950s Cold War era film noir assassination, even down to the type of pistol that it's now being speculated the gunman used. There's been a lot of conversations and reports that this might have been a very rare pistol. It's a Swiss made VPN, which is a veterinary pistol. And it's designed for this type of use dating back to World War II, an assassination in broad daylight, essentially, it was early in the morning, but on a crowded street in Midtown Manhattan. You laid it out perfectly. Latent fingerprints, DNA evidence, which we have now, which is probative evidence. The fact that New York City is blanketed, the island of Manhattan, 13 miles by two miles wide, it is blanketed by about 40,000 surveillance cameras. All these things and the information that's being pushed out right now by the NYPD is going to lead to the capture of this man.",

We do not believe that he exited from there.Port Authority that has buses that have a connection across the country. So they do not believe he may still be in the tri state area.

      "sentences": "So let's talk about government background checks, a process that's been in place since the Eisenhower era. Donald Trump considered sidelining the traditional FBI vetting process for his nominees, calling it too slow and problematic. Alas, he came around this week, his transition team signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice, paving the way for FBI background checks on his nominees. Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth's lawyer confirmed to CNN that his client is starting that process.So what's the goal of these checks? It's to protect classified information and reveal potential red flags like misconduct, foreign ties, financial vulnerabilities. If you've got red flags, they're going to be found. The process for national security positions is rigorous. I took a look at the 136 page SF86 form this week. It triggers background investigations once it's filled out. And the SF86, it leaves no stone unturned in one's past. Check out, say, section 18 for relatives, you've got to give information on all the family members that apply, place of birth, citizenship status, current address, just to name a few. So, even family skeletons potentially come into play. And just by looking at that one page, you might be reconsidering if you even want to go through this process and put your friends and family under the microscope. Here to help us understand what's at stake, the guy you call to navigate this process, former CIA intelligence officer Andrew Bakaj. He's currently a founding and managing partner at the Compass Rose Legal Group, a law firm that specializes in security clearance, federal employment, and national security law. He's also affiliated with the legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, an organization that provides pro bono legal services. Andrew, where are we? Pete Hegseth and those at his level get all the attention. But what's the general state of affairs right now in terms of are the incoming administration members going through the usual process? Is your phone ringing off the hook as it normally would? ANDREW P. BAKAJ, FORMER CIA OFFICER: I would say that things are moving as normal now. With respect to the senior appointees that the Trump administration is putting in, obviously now they're working with the FBI to have those investigators conduct deep background investigations on the nominees. But when it comes to regular federal employees, government contractors, who I typically represent, I don't see any changes for them.",

      "sentences": "Correct. What typically happens is that you have bits and pieces of the individual's background being investigated by different individuals. So, for example, you'll have a team looking at somebody's financial background to ensure that they don't have any outstanding, significant debts. You'll have individuals initially contacting your points of contact, who you list out on your SF86 to vet and determine who you are as an individual to see whether or not you have any sexual misconduct allegations against you, among other things. But they'll go one step further. They'll develop sources beyond that and talk to people who you didn't list on that form to determine who you really are and what your background is like and what your liabilities are.",

The question goes into their judgment, their reliability, their candor. So absolutely everybody may have some blemish in their background or have a family member who may have had their own indiscretions, but at the end of the day, what the investigators are trying to determine is who are you, what type of character you have, are you trustworthy? Because, for example, you can have an individual who may have a financial debt that's rather significant, but they want to know what got them into it.Is it because of excessive gambling, or is it because of perhaps outstanding health care debts?

It's now spread to sports, the move on the soccer pitch to the football field, all over the place. The YMCA resurgence is here. And the song's writer and lead singer of the Village People, Victor Willis, took notice, writing on Facebook, quote, \"YMCA has benefited greatly from use by the president-elect. The song finally made it to number one on the Billboard chart after over 45 years and held on to number one for two weeks due to the president-elect's use.
