I think if the election were a day or two or even a week after New Hampshire, maybe, but she's picking up - she's picking up steam.And the thing about Donald Trump is, he gets worse as time goes by. I think people forgot a lot of the dumb stuff that Donald Trump says, whether or not it's foreign policy, whether or not it's on issues of race, whether or not it's just on talking about other people, like Michael Haley, and the way he talks about our military. And so the fact that she's fighting back, it actually bodes well for Democrats in the long run, maybe not Nikki Haley, because it shows true fissures in the Republican Party.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): He told the story about how he used leverage to get people to step up to the plate and - and become more active in NATO. He's not the first American president -- in fact, virtually every American president at some point, in some way, has complained about other countries in NATO not doing enough.

And we've seen this play out over many months now, this - this talking point that many GOP members on The Hill continue to promulgate. It's that America is paying everybody else's bill, America is doing more than its fair share. Where's everybody else?So, if you're looking at really, again, that MAGA stronghold of the party, which I submit to you is not as strong as it's always been, it is the messaging entirely. And that's what these members of Congress are afraid about. They don't want to talk about history. They don't want to talk about fact. They don't want to talk about the very notion that this is reckless from the former president. They just want to say, well, this is how our constituents feel. And this is how direct Donald Trump is. So, I'm not surprised that Senator Rubio would take this line. It's intellectually lazy, of course, on the one hand, but that is where you've seen much of the Republican electorate say that we are a country that is selling itself to other parts of the world, and we do it because we pay everybody else's bills. So, I'm not surprised Trump is also, again, taking that bait. We've got to remember, we're still in primary season, and that's what these members want to show is that they're somehow reflecting the will of the Republican electorate.",

We did get that statement last night which said his prognosis is good. He is expected to recover, as well as from his diagnosis and his surgery to treat prostate cancer here. Now, it is worth noting that on Thursday the Pentagon announced that Austin was supposed to be going to Europe and to Brussels for meetings with the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and for a NATO defense ministerial. At this point it's unclear if that trip will be able to happen or if it will have to be canceled. So, that's an update here we'll expect very soon, especially since that trip was supposed to start tomorrow morning here. So, you can see the impact this has had on the secretary. He did transfer his authorities essentially shortly before kickoff last night for the - for the Super Bowl here.
