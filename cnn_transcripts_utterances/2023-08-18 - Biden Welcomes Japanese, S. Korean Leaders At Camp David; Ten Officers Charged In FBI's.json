      "sentences": "Well, I think these are very positive dynamics, something that would have been very hard to imagine even a couple of years ago because of the long history of conflict between South Korea and their former colonial masters in Japan. So, to overcome all those historical differences certainly requires a major commitment and a courageous commitment by President Yoon of South Korea and Prime Minister Kishida of Japan. But I think it's also very much to the credit of Joe Biden that he has made this a priority.And you know, one of the striking things is that of course, Donald Trump also got involved in Korean negotiations. But he really swung for the fences of this unrealistic goal of getting North Korea to denuclearize, whereas President Biden has been much more realistic because he has much more experience in the field of diplomacy, and he knows what is achievable. And this is something that is achievable. And it is in fact, a significant achievement to bring two of our closest allies in Asia closer together to confront the threats from North Korea, to confront the threats from China, and to deal with a destabilized world in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",

And China recently this year warned North -- warned Korea -- South Korea about this. And I'm going to show you what they said.They said I can assure you those who bet on China's defeat will definitely regret it. That was the Chinese ambassador talking to the opposition leader of the Democratic Party of Korea. It is very clear that China must be worried about this, correct when they see that this is the first time this has happened ever, this summit bringing together these two nations with the United States?",

      "speaker": "BOOT",
      "sentences": "That's absolutely correct. That's why it's such a huge achievement for the U.S. and for President Biden because this is the last thing that China wants to see. They want him to vide America's allies in Asia, not to see them coming together.And I think a lot of this is really due to China's own behavior because you've seen the bullying from China, which is greatly worrying U.S. allies and other countries in the region. And so not long ago, you had President Yoon, actually saying that he wants to see a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Taiwan Strait, which was an issue where previous South Korean presidents didn't even engage. And that's something that enraged China because he's basically saying that South Korea is opposed to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. That's a -- that's a big statement, but it's indicative of how much China has alienated Korean public opinion. And also I would add Japanese public opinion as well as American public opinion. And so, you know, it's really -- it's not just North Korea, it's also China that's driving these countries into a closer alliance.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think you're right, John. And this is kind of edging towards Article Five-type of relationship. Certainly not there yet. We may never get there.But this is, I think it's a very important statement for South Korea and Japan to say that their security is mutually interlinked, that they are not independent here that they -- that the security of one affects the security of the other because there's a lot they can do if they're working in closer cooperation. For example, if they would just integrate their ballistic missile defense systems directly with one another, they would have a much more effective defense against missiles from North Korea, for example. And that's something that's been very hard to do because of the nationalist feelings in South Korea, in particular, the anti-Japanese sentiment. So, you know, President Yoon deserves a lot of credit for trying to move beyond that as Prime Minister Kishida. And I think you know, what President Biden is trying to do with this summit is to institutionalize this cooperation so that in the future, no matter what happens in the politics of South Korea, Japan, or the United States, that these countries will continue to draw closer together and to consult regularly on mutual threats.",

But it appears at least according to this criminal complaint that these officers do their job is to inflict punishment on members of the public. Three officers in particular who were arrested yesterday in this massive FBI takedown included Morteza Amiri, Eric Rombough, and Devon Wenger. They've been charged with conspiracy against violating civil rights.I'll read you some of these texts just to give you a sense of what prosecutors are alleging. In one, an unidentified officer says I'm on my way in. What do you guys, up to? Rombough allegedly replies violating civil rights. And this just scratches the surface. And another, Amiri's alleged to have said to an officer after an incident, lol putting a pistol in someone's mouth and telling them to stop stealing isn't illegal. It's an act of public service to prevent further victims of crimes. Now, one officer in particular, Amiri, was a canine handler. Dogs obviously very important tools for police in resolving violent situations, but it appeared and it's alleged that this officer had a scoreboard of sorts regarding the number of times his dog was deployed to bite people. He also shared allegedly gruesome images among other officers. In one text, he allegedly writes I'm going to take more gory pics. Gory pics are for personal stuff. Cleaned up pics for the case. And just to give you a sense of how they viewed their role allegedly, in another incident, an unidentified officer said it's good that even though the laws don't keep them in jail, talking about criminals, they still get effed up by the dog. Amiri allegedly replies, I know right. I feel like this is the real punishment compared to the soft district attorneys. Very serious charges here. These officers now in federal custody, Sarah.",
