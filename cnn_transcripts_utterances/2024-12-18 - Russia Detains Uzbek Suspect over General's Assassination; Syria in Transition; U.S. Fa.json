Russian state media airing a video that appears to show the man's confession, though it is unclear whether that confession was made under duress. Russian investigators claim the Uzbek suspect was recruited by Ukraine to help kill Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who died in a bomb blast outside his Moscow apartment early Tuesday. Ukraine has not commented on the detention of this alleged suspect. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow with more on both the suspect and the accusations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now the Russian authorities are saying that he is suspected in connection with the assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who, of course, was killed when leaving his apartment yesterday by a bomb blast. And the Russian investigators are saying that they believe that Kurbanov was recruited by Ukraine's intelligence service, the SBU. They say that he was told to get a electric scooter and then was given a homemade bomb and parked the scooter with the bomb in front of the door that later the general, together with an aide, would come out of. Now as part of this plot, the Russians say that Kurbanov also got a car- sharing car -- rented a car-sharing car and parked it outside of the door of that building as well. They say that that car was outfitted with a camera that had a live feed that went straight to the city of Dnipro in Central Ukraine where it was monitored by Ukrainian security services. And when the general left his building, that is when the bomb was detonated. Obviously, General Kirillov was killed yesterday when he left his apartment building. That blast seemed to be massive. When we were on the scene, we saw that even in the houses adjacent to where this blast took place, that windows had been shattered there. Russian politicians obviously irate about all this. The Kremlin came out and commented on all of this for the first time today. The Kremlin spokesman saying that all of this shows that Kyiv, as he put it, does not shy away from terrorist methods.

Again, demonstrating that the core interest right now for Julani, the core priority is going to be domestic. But that said, there is also a concern. Damascus has always billed itself as the beating heart of Arab nationalism. It's the heir to the Umayyad dynasty, the much famed Islamic and Arab dynasty based in Damascus. And right now, you look at the Syrian tapestry, it's being dominated by Turkiye but also Israel, that has pushed further into Southern Syria, only 20 kilometers or so now from the Syrian capital. Those are very concerning facts for the Arab countries surrounding Syria. And I think in the days and weeks ahead, we're going to see some Arab demonstration of power and influence, both to put Julani on notice in terms of his jihadi background but also to try and some to reassert some Arab influence in Damascus.

Now we are told that this report is expected to be made public once this session of Congress ends and lawmakers leave Washington to return home for the holidays. But I think the timing of this is very notable. We know that, when the committee first voted last month not to release this report, Matt Gaetz was still Donald Trump's pick to be his attorney general. Since then, he has withdrawn his name from consideration. He has also made clear that he has no plans to return to Congress next year and has also said that he is planning to join One America News Network to be an anchor for them in January. Now just to get a little bit into this report, the Ethics Committee has been working on this report and investigating Gaetz's alleged conduct for about a year now. Here is some of what they've been investigating:  whether he engaged in sexual misconduct, whether he used illicit drugs. And also whether he shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, accepted a bribe, use -- had improper gratuity or impermissible gifts.

He has only three weeks left in office until there's a change of power in Ghana. But whoever is president on January the 7th, this problem will not go away for them. But here's the complication. The reason why I call it a problem is the finance minister has warned that, if this goes ahead, Ghana risks losing out on $3.8 billion from the World Bank, another $3 billion from the IMF that they badly need to get out of an economic crisis. But they might be in better luck with the incoming Trump administration that is not likely to be as strongly pro supporting these values around the world, promoting these values like the Biden administration has been, as we saw, for instance, with similar pressure on the Ugandan government.

Officials say hundreds, possibly thousands, could be dead in Mayotte, which took a massive hit from the Cyclone Chido. Located in the Indian Ocean off the East Coast of Africa, it is one of France's poorest overseas territories. Many parts of it remain inaccessible at this point days after the storm. A former Mayotte senator is now assessing the damage where he comes from and had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THANI MOHAMED-SOIBHI, FORMER MAYOTTE SENATOR (through translator):  I arrived in Mayotte yesterday. I saw my family again for the first time since the cyclone. I hadn't had news of my family for two days. We were very scared. We were very lucky. Many have still not had news from their families; 80 percent of the island doesn't have cell service. Here I see a desolate landscape. The island has been pulverized. The world needs to see what I'm seeing. Many houses in Mayotte are constructed with sheet metal. They've been wiped from the map. Here, this was a solid house. You can see there's nothing left. The damage is heavy. The president of the republic has decreed a national day of mourning. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

GOULD-DAVIES:  It's not the first such action of this kind. In the past, certainly the early actions of this kind tended to target senior Russian propagandists and ideologists, if you will. And more recently, there's been a move toward targeting Russian figures directly responsible for the attacks on Ukraine, including, in this case, the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine. I think, again, what's most significant about this was that it takes place at an unprecedented level of seniority. And this will deeply disconcert other senior elite, including military figures, that they can, in the capital itself, be killed like this.",

Just how significant do you think this looming threat from Russia is? GOULD-DAVIES:  It's very significant. Europe's ability to respond depends partly, of course, on the decisions taken by the incoming Trump administration. So the sense in which Europe is looking west as much as it is looking east. At the moment, slowly on the ground, Russia is making, at great cost to itself gains. It is, you know, has a larger economy and just more troops than Ukraine, that it's also, of course, subjected to nearly all of the destruction of the war. So Ukraine finds itself in a difficult position now. And Europe understands that, if there were to be some fundamental strategic failure now, if, despite all the endless promises that Russia must fail, all the photo ops with President Zelenskyy and so on. If, nonetheless, having stacked up all those rhetorical chips on the board, Russia were nonetheless to prevail, then Europe would find itself in a profoundly difficult situation not only strategically on the ground but with respect to its underlying credibility and authority as well. So Europe is urgently aware of the need to commit a greater share of its own very large economy to supporting Ukraine and defending itself. And Secretary General Rutte has been leading the call for that.",
