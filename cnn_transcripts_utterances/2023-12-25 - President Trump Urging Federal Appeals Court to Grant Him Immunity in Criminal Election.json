I'm Danny Freeman.Former President Trump is urging a federal appeals court to grant him immunity in his criminal election subversion case. Right now, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing Trump's request Saturday to overturn a lower court ruling rejecting his argument that he was working as president to ensure election integrity when he allegedly undermined the 2020 results. For more on this, let's bring in CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, please break it down for us. What happens next?",

So this is one of those issues that has to be worked out through appeals before Donald Trump can sit for trial. He has some rights as a criminal defendant, and one of them is to try and see if the courts will grant him immunity from prosecution. That's the question on the table as he awaits his trial set for March in this federal case against him related to the 2020 election and January 6th.But Danny, what is happening here and what happened over the weekend is that Donald Trump's team is prepared to argue and is arguing already in written briefs to the D.C. circuit court of appeals, this intermediary court. And they're arguing that he can't be prosecuted for any official duties that he had while he was president, and also, he can't sit for trial because he was already tried once during his impeachment in Congress, and he was not convicted by the Senate, even though he was impeached by the House. And so he's arguing that, no, he should not have to face trial. That was what was said in the briefs. There was a lot of language in the briefs from Trump's team over the weekend, too, about how damaging it is to the country to have a former president on trial. But that is going to be determined by the court of appeals first, and then very likely, the Supreme Court. Oral arguments are the first or second week of January, January 9th.",

And I'll say first and foremost, that super cut, I can't believe that all happened in a year, but I really feel like what Sarah is saying. It seems like a lot of scene setting in 2023. And when you look forward to 2024, the House looks different. They're going to have a much slimmer majority. So some of these more competitive congressional races in swing seats, including in New York, where there are about six competitive seats, could go either way, same for California. That's really going to be where the money is spent, where the attention is directed. But take a look also at the legal calendar that Donald Trump has versus the primary calendar, and I just really wish I could see what that Google set-up looks like, the colors, because you have the Iowa caucuses, but then he has the jury deciding what the damages are in the defamation case. You have New Hampshire, and then another civil trial begins. And then you have South Carolina, and that's the start of this big criminal trial into whether he interfered in the 2020 elections. It is going to be back-to-back and it's going to be nonstop. As much as 2023 felt like nonstop, 2024 is really when the foot hits the gas pedal.",

They were the essential workers who kept the economy running when we were all, presumably, some of us were at home.And also, they at the same time watched their companies -- Kaiser Permanente, General Motors, UPS -- make record profits. They were also at the same time dealing with the high inflation that all of us were dealing with. So they had really strong economic grounds to stand on. And then we just played for you the three leaders of the UAW, UPS and the actors union. Those were all new leaders of these three unions. It was fresh blood, they would not take no for an answer on these contract deals. And in the end, all three -- UPS, the UAW, and SAG got a lot of what they wanted at the end of the day, because they pointed back to those three reasons of why they really felt like their workers deserved so much more in these next contracts.",

In terms of these negotiations with the actors and the writers and the studios, this was the sticking point.For the actors and the writers, they said that this was an existential threat to their livelihoods. In many ways, it was. ChatGPT could write scripts. A lot of the studios could use artificial intelligence to recreate actors in the background and the actors and the writers fought tooth and nail to get protections in their contracts. They did at the end of the day. But remember just how fast artificial intelligence is moving? Every day it is changing, growing, evolving, learning more. So I don't doubt that in the next couple of years, we're going to see artificial intelligence talked about in contracts with health care, manufacturing, hospitality, e-commerce. This is just the beginning. And when the actors and the writers negotiate again in a couple of years, I guarantee you that they're going to be trying to get more protections in place to protect their jobs. So this will be a key issue going forward in union negotiations,",
