CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts now. The polls are open, my friends, across the United States for the last major Election Day, if you will, until the start of the presidential primaries in January. Just getting even more exciting. Just a few key races may provide some pretty crucial insight into the political climate that we are in today and the issues that Americans care about the most. Abortion rights have been a winning issue from Democrat -- for Democrats since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. But does that hold still today? Today, Ohio will decide whether to enshrine abortion access in the state's constitution, abortion rights also a campaign issue in Virginia, though not on the ballot, where every seat in the state's General Assembly is in play. Democrats are hoping reproductive rights help them there. But the Republican governor hopes that his approach on the issue can serve as a model for Republicans in Virginia and far beyond. Let's go there. CNN's Jessica Dean standing by for us in Richmond, Virginia. Jessica, what are you seeing there today?",

And, look, this is an interesting proxy battle as we look ahead to 2024. Oftentimes, what happens here in Virginia in these off- year elections correlates with what we see and the trends that we see in the following year when we see these federal elections. And so, to that point here, Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is not on the ballot himself, he's in the middle of his term, but he is pushing ahead. He wants Republicans to have complete control of the state legislature here. To give everyone the current state of play, Democrats currently hold the Senate, while Republicans hold the House. And Youngkin has tried to push forward with his agenda, which includes -- you mentioned reproductive rights. It includes a 15-week ban on abortion. Currently, in Virginia, the law is 26 weeks. That was stopped by Senate Democrats. And it's things like that he says he wants to be able to move forward with if Republicans had full control of the legislature. So, you can see how this is a bit of a proxy battle that's playing out here. Here's Governor Youngkin just a little bit ago at one of his final stops as he's going across the state trying to get out of the vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA):  And I have listened to Virginians all over the commonwealth. And I hear over and over again, the number one issue they're concerned about is the impact that the Biden economy is having on their lives, where it's cost them $700 more a month to buy the exact same things that they were buying two years ago, groceries and clothing for their children. This is what's the top issue in people's minds. And this is why I think that Virginians can trust us, can trust us to continue to deliver, to do the job. I promise to get it done. Just send me folks into Richmond who will work with me and not against me.",

And, again, it will be interesting to see kind of how this all shakes out tonight and what it can mean going into 2024. [11:05:04] Glenn Youngkin himself, a rising star in the Republican Party, worth noting that he kind of has a particular take on the Republican -- on his Republican brand of politics, which is certainly conservative, but not full MAGA. So, if he is able to win here in Virginia, where there are so many suburban voters or swing voters, Kate, what does that mean going into 2024? That's what we're keeping an eye on -- Kate and John.",

Cameron would be the first African-American elected governor in the country if he wins.Kentucky is a very red state. How red? In 2020, you can see Donald Trump trounced Joe Biden. Biden only won two counties, Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, and Fayette County, which includes Lexington. So, Andy Beshear, when he first ran for governor and won in 2019, you can see it was a very close race. Beshear won by just 5,000 votes, but look how many blue counties there were here. He was able to win a lot of these coal counties, some of the college towns like Bowling Green, up around Cincinnati, you can see here in Kenton County, here which is just outside Cincinnati, Ohio, yes, very close. But this is a result that Beshear will need to replicate. He will have to overperform severely what Joe Biden did, who only won these two counties. That's what to watch for tonight. It is tough for a Democrat there, but the Beshear family has done very well. Eva McKend is in Louisville, Kentucky, for us today. Eva, what are you seeing from the candidates today?",

But, listen, Cameron told us this morning when he was here that he was satisfied with the strategy that he has employed. And that is tying Governor Beshear to President Biden. He also has knocked Governor Beshear for his pandemic response, arguing that you really need someone in Frankfort, in the state capital, to work in concert with the Republican-controlled legislature on this issue of learning loss. Let's listen to his final argument. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL CAMERON (R), KENTUCKY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  If you want leadership in this state that is going to reflect your values, going to eliminate Kentucky's income tax, going to get violent crime under control, make sure we never shut down our schools, our small businesses or our churches again, I hope you will vote Daniel Cameron today.

The IDF says they successfully targeted them. And you do, though, have virtually every day some of that fire getting through. You also have Israel firing back, and, sometimes, it appears not striking their target. Lebanese officials say that it has rarely target in the last -- or Israeli strike, rather, in the last several days hit a vehicle that had three children and an older woman in it. I believe we have pictures of that. So you have what I would describe as a slow-burn conflict on the northern border. It has not broken out into open war, which has been the concern and remains a concern that, at some point, Hezbollah might order its forces into Northern Israel or attempt to cross into Northern Israel or attack in numbers or fire more missiles, not just into Northern Israel, but here in Tel Aviv. They have many thousands of missiles with a range that could hit Tel Aviv. That hasn't happened yet, but I will tell you this as well, Kate, that when you look forward to whenever Israeli military operations either tail off or stop in Gaza, there is also broad support in this country among Israelis for military action in Southern Lebanon to follow. You speak to Israelis, they don't feel safe in the south or in the north, and many will say, we have to solve that problem as a country, push Hezbollah further back. And that, of course, would require another military operation, perhaps a lengthy one, a costly one. And there's an enormous amount of support in this country for that.",

Eric Trump had testified he wasn't aware of them until this investigation, and then he was confronted with some e-mails that showed that he was aware of them. So, for Ivanka Trump, very much, she was involved in a couple of these development deals, the old post office building. She helped introduce the Trump Organization to Deutsche Bank, their lender on this, which came through Jared Kushner, her husband.

Now, the debates have changed the sort of structure of this race, at least below the Trump level, if you will. The first debate had eight candidates. The second one had seven. Tomorrow's has five candidates. And Nikki Haley, without question, has benefited from this -- these debates more than any other candidate. So she is coming into this debate tomorrow night here with the momentum, but also more of a target on her back. The highest stakes, without a doubt, are for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He will be flying here later today from Iowa, where he picked up that key endorsement from Iowa's Republican Governor Kim Reynolds. She will also be traveling to Iowa with him. But the question is, how does he stand up on that debate stage? Of course, Chris Christie also on stage, as is South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, as is Ohio entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. So, these five candidates clearly are campaigning, but the question is, will they be going after Donald Trump or will they be going after one another? There is no doubt that Trump's decision to not attend these debates has been validated. He will be holding a rally in Hialeah, not far from here, skipping all of it.
