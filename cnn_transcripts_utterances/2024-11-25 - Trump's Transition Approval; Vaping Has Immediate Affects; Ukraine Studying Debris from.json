They don't have to go to war with the U.S. Instead, they can knock us off our posture and our position so that we can't rise to the challenge to go support Taiwan, and the war is effectively over before it starts. So that, again, is the real challenge here politically in Congress and in the White House. Can we secure ourselves so that they can't take us down?",

The bottom line is this, if eight years ago Americans were lukewarm on Donald Trump, at this particular point they're giving him much more of the benefit of the doubt. A lot more Americans are in love with this transition. This much more meets the historical norms, where normally presidents get that boost coming out of their victory.

A select amount. Clearly Kyiv trying to show the world exactly what technology was used against them. And there is, of course, going to be a lot of forensic attention as to exactly what those missile parts indeed show. There appears to be a consensus this was a hypersonic missile and it was one with multiple warheads, non-nuclear indeed. Vladimir Putin suggested that it can potentially get through all western air defenses, and I'm sure that the parts on display will be pored over to see if indeed that provides any clues as to whether this is a technological leap by Russia or not.
