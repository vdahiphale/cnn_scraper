During the last Trump administration, there was a drawdown in those troops. Could you see something like that? All of these things mean that the Europeans have to take more responsibility for their own defense on themselves, and they're worried about that.",

Yet the same poll finds 62 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaning voters in this poll said that he should step aside, 54 percent of self-proclaimed Biden supporters say that Biden should step aside. And as -- this is also as the first sitting Democratic senator, Senator Peter Welch, says publicly in a new op-ed that he also thinks Joe Biden should end his run. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us. Another day, another round of headlines and more handwringing and real concerns being voiced amongst Democrats.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden is facing a key test today as he is set to hold that first solo news conference while he's looking to keep his candidacy alive. Now, these solo press conferences have become a rarity in the Biden White House. This will be only the 15th time that he has taken questions by himself at a press conference before reporters, and the first time that he is doing so this year.It comes as his allies have really encouraged Biden to engage in press conferences, town halls, to try to show voters that he can engage in these impromptu, unscripted sessions following last month's debate. But it's also coming as the president is facing significant heat from within his own party about his decision to remain in this race. So far, there have been 10 Democratic lawmakers up on Capitol Hill who have publicly called for Biden to step aside. Many are expressing concerns privately, even as there are some very visible of public backers of Biden's candidacy at this moment. Of course, yesterday, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to leave the door open to the possibility that Biden could reconsider his decision to stay in the race, even though he and his team have been adamant that he will see this through until November. There are also concerns about how Biden's debate performance and the path forward could impact fundraising for the campaign going forward. One source of familiar with the situation told me that it has been a rough go with donors as there have been a number of defections from the donor class. Another Democratic strategist saying, quote, \"Everything is frozen because no one knows what's going to happen. Everyone is in wait and see mode.\" So these are all some of the challenges facing President Biden in this moment. This afternoon, some key members of his campaign team and his team here at the White House, Jen O'Malley Dillon, Steve Ricchetti, Mike Donilon, will actually be briefing Senate Democrats up on Capitol Hill today. Sources told CNN that Senator Chuck Schumer invited the campaign officials. They are to talk to senators so they could hear out their concerns personally. But it's been very clear in the last 24 hours that even as the president has been adamant about remaining in this race, there are still some serious concerns within certain pockets of the Democratic Party. [08:05:05] And for President Biden, his main goals today are essentially to show voters that he is up for a second term, but also trying to keep any further Democratic dissent in check.",

It is a big number, and particularly I think 67 percent of Americans are saying in this new ABC News-\"Washington Post\" poll that President Biden should step aside. But look at the number of Democrats. That is about 55 percent, 54 percent there. So that is perhaps significant as well.But I think the numbers that really have the attention of the Biden campaign and the White House, as well as, of course, Democrats on Capitol Hill are what down-ballot races are seeing. And if there's any numbers that will sort of drive a decision here -- and again, this isn't a decision only reached by numbers, it's built on so many things -- but it will be the damage that it could be causing to races for the House, races for the Senate. So that is what some of this worry is coming from here. But of course, the Biden campaign and the White House will point to the fact that he's still essentially in a margin of error race, essentially tied with former President Donald Trump. But that's in a national poll. If you look battleground by battleground, and those battlegrounds had been expanding over the last couple weeks since the debate, that is causing worry for so many Democrats, Sara.",

But Sara, the question is, if this moves along in a different direction, is she waiting in the wings? Of course she is. She's the vice president. It's what the role is for. But as time sort of moves along here, it does become more difficult to replace the Democratic ticket. But she, of course, is first among those who would be at the ticket. Again, it's the Biden- Harris campaign. So she would own the infrastructure, she would own the fundraising as well.

Overall, 1.3 million customers still without power, about almost 1.1million of those customers in the Houston area and really the frustration has been geared toward the lack of communication that residents feel and community leaders feel from the power utility companies as to why the progress being made on the power restoration. And so people resorting to all sorts of tactics to kind of get themselves cooled off. One family had found an AC unit that they connected to a generator and sealed off with plastic tarps, filled themselves off into one small room in their home to keep cool. There's also been concern among animals. Folks in the Houston area concerned about the dogs out in the heat so people resorting to sitting in a car with their dogs to making sure that they're okay. So those are the kinds of things that many people are dealing with in the Houston area, John, as the heat continues to intensify and the CenterPoint company is saying that this is the largest power outage they've ever had to deal with, defending their actions, saying that they've got one million people back online within 48 hours and they say that another 700,000 or so will be back online by the end of this weekend -- John.",

Heat advisories in place for the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area, even though there's a slight onshore component to the wind keeping the metro area of Houston slightly cooler than the past day or so, it really doesn't make much of a difference considering that there is very little electricity across this area because of what was Hurricane Beryl that barreled through the region earlier this week leaving in the destruction behind in its wake. So authorities are warning people to be familiar with the signs of heat-related illnesses -- dizziness, headaches, confusion, muscle cramps. That is when you start to see the warning signs and you need to take note, you have to cool that individual down, immediately call 911. Even now, just a few hours after sunrise, we are starting to feel the impacts of the humidity and the mercury in the thermometer, it is going to be downright brutal going forward. So the days -- over the next couple of days, the race is on to get that power turned back on to the people, cool them down as successfully as possible. It is not only Texas, but it is the Western US under the heat, extreme heat for Las Vegas. We know we've had five consecutive days where the temperature has reached 115 or greater, all-time record high temperatures set in Las Vegas earlier this week, really contextualizes what is happening over the western parts of the country.
