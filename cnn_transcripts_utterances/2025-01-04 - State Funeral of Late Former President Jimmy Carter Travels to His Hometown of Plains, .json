The first of six days of tributes and observances has been underway in Georgia for the past several hours. And as the nation and the world honor the life and legacy of Americas 39th president, who passed away on Sunday at the age of 100, one of the highlights from today's events, this emotional moment this morning when former and current U.S. Secret Service agents who protected Carter during his lifetime carried his casket into the hearse there in Americus, Georgia. And then there was this ceremony at Carter's boyhood home and farm in Archery, Georgia, where the two longest serving National Park staffers rang the farm bell 39 times. Carter's motorcade also driving through nearby Plains, Georgia, where he was born and died. People lining the streets to pay their respects. The motorcade is now slowly making its way to Atlanta. In the next hour, it will stop at the Georgia capital, where Carter served one term as governor and as state senator. And after a moment of silence honoring his service, the motorcade will then head to the Carter Center, where a service will be held later on today. Carter will then lie in repose before heading to the nation's capital for another round of ceremonies. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is at the Carter Center for us. Jeff, walk us through what we expect to happen later on.",

I remember the fact that after he left the presidency, he chose to build houses for people. How many people have houses today that President Carter and Mrs. Carter directly helped to build? I remember him traveling around the world to observe elections and ensure that democracy was protected and preserved.

One that strikes me earlier today was a woman who told our Eva McKend how he came over and saw a broken chair, and removed the broken chair at the age of 90, fixed it, and returned it the next day. So it's not just that people were eyewitness to seeing the former president in their small towns, but to be a witness to his good deeds, and just being accessible to folks.

And it was the love of people, the love of humanity. And this, this man was, as I say, I believe one of the greatest persons, and even presidents. I think we have to continue to evaluate that.

And they released this with the intention of maybe helping the public understand a little more context of his state of mind, what led up to the moment where he killed himself and exploded the cyber truck on New Year's Day, injuring seven other people, who, by the way, thankfully have been treated and released from hospitals.So this -- one of the letters that was released to us yesterday is a call for action, where Livelsberger is saying that we should get Democrats out of government and military, including the possibility of occupying roads and federal buildings, not ruling out the use of force. Now, another letter that investigators released shows grievances about politics, about societal and cultural issues, expressed support for President Trump and Elon Musk. Let's read just a few excerpts from that letter there. One excerpt says \"It's time to wake up. We are being led by weak and feckless leadership who only serve to enrich themselves.\" Another excerpt says, \"Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\" And finally, another excerpt says, \"We are the United States of America, the best country people to ever exist! But right now, we are terminally ill and headed toward collapse.\" Now, just a day before this explosion, he had sent an email to some online media outlets saying that he was in possession of a massive VBIED, or vehicle borne improvised explosive device, and that he was armed. We do know from U.S. officials who have told our colleagues that he had visited the behavioral health program multiple times in recent months and was diagnosed with depression last year but had not been assessed to be a risk to himself or to others in any violent means. And so there was no official red flag in that respect. What investigators are now doing is just combing through all the data on his devices, and they are seeing a log of activity for the 10 days leading up to this, trying to work out how this happened, Fred.",

We have seen the growing pains over the last two years where Republicans had a narrow, narrow majority, but not as narrow as they will have in the next upcoming months. They have a three-seat majority, and two members we know are going to be part of Trump's administration. So by the end of the month, literally Johnson is going to be in the same predicament that we saw yesterday. He's going to need basically all Republicans, literally all Republicans left, to be able to move forward with policy. A lot of the discussions that Johnson had with those two Republicansthat ended up flipping was around making sure that members of the House Freedom Caucus, in particular members of the far right, were more part of negotiations moving forward. And it is going to be a pretty hefty agenda. Trump wants to get done a number of things, but also get them done quickly. He has obviously said, and Johnson reiterated in his reelection speech yesterday, that American voters have given them a mandate, so Republicans need to stay united. But as we know, that is an incredibly difficult. And they frankly don't have all that much time to spend negotiating, wheeling and dealing behind closed doors to be able to get a number of things done, particularly the debt ceiling, which actually needs to be lifted, likely by the end of this month.

We know that ISIS has been promoting these kind of lone wolf attacks. So this may have been an instance in which he has a lot going on, as we know. He then looks for a meaning, which is, OK, I'm going to have a greater cause here. He's radicalized, and then sort of attaches to ISIS.We have to be super careful about ISIS-affiliated, because it can mean a range of activities, and each of them is sort of different depending on how close, how directed. Is it just motivated? None are good, but it does -- it would get to sort of how safe and secure the United States is now, and also whether the investigation continues.

This is just south of Atlanta on Interstate 75. You see the firetruck there with the flag. And on the opposite end of the highway, the interstate there, you can see traffic at a stop, paying homage and honor to the 39th president one week, now, after his passing. Soon they'll be heading into the metro Atlanta area where that procession will then lead the hearse to the state capital in Atlanta, and then to the Carter Center for later ceremonies taking place later on today. We'll continue to watch the motorcade there.Meantime, a huge swath of the United States is bracing for extreme winter weather -- 62 million people from the central plains to the mid-Atlantic are in the path of this January blast, with some areas of the country possibly receiving their heaviest snowfall in over a decade. Across the south, 21 million people are expected to be hit by possible damaging wind gusts, tornadoes, and large hail. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is here with more details on all of this. This is going to be a humdinger.",

They stretch from Kansas all the way to the east coast. We're talking D.C. and Philadelphia. In the pink, that's where you have the winter storm warning in effect. A lot of that's in effect for heavy blowing snow that will create difficult travel.We have a unique ice storm warning in effect for south central Missouri, parts of southern Illinois and Kentucky, where we're talking about significant ice accumulations that will take down trees and power lines and could cause long lasting power outages. Again, all of this stretching more than 1,300 miles. So we'll really start to find this storm blowing up overnight tonight. By tomorrow morning, we're starting with the heavy snow, the significant ice across parts of the central plains. You can see where that cold air, again, squeezing into all of that moisture. Look at all the pink. That is the problem when it comes to the ice. All of this will create a messy Monday morning commute for major cities in the mid-Atlantic, again like Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Snow totals. We're looking at a hefty six to 12 inch swath, could be looking at some totals over a foot. Ice could be up to a half an inch, or even three quarters of an inch. That would cause significant problems with power outages. Plus, you have the severe storms across the south. We have a level three out of five now, actually, for severe weather, a line of damaging winds and several tornadoes. Fred, this area still recovering from last weekend's tornado outbreak.",
