Right now, in the nation's capital, the former president is addressing members of the Teamsters Union, which represents an estimated 1.3 million workers.It is Trump's latest attempt to drive a wedge between President Biden and organized labor, one of the president's most loyal constituencies. Union households, a traditionally Democratic voting bloc, backed Biden by a wide margin in the last election, according to CNN exit polling. That included the endorsement of the Teamsters Union who also backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. CNN's Kristen Holmes is closely following the Trump campaign for us. Kristen, is Trump confident he can win over organized labor or at least enough workers to put a dent in Biden's support?",

His tenure in the White House showed he was not a pro-labor president.But this is about picking up those rank-and-file workers and those working-class voters, something that Donald Trump has shown he can do. When I talked to a senior adviser, they said, look, we don't want to cede any ground in any demographic to Joe Biden and that's why we are going after Teamsters as well as union workers. Here's what Donald Trump said about his meeting with the Teamsters today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, we do not have the breakdown of Teamsters versus other unions.But again, this is an attempt to drive a wedge between Joe Biden and the voting bloc. He also mentioned a bunch of other topics, Brianna, that I want to quickly note. He talked about the border. He said any Senate Republicans considering voting for the border deal should not do that. Then he tried to backpedal and say it was not about politics, that he just wanted a good deal at the border. He also said that if he was in office, that he would not allow Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, something he hasn't said before. One thing that he notably did not answer, actually, two things he notably didn't answer. One, he was asked specifically about conversations about a 60 percent tariff on Mexico, something that we have heard. He did not answer that. The other thing he did not answer is what he would have done in retaliation for the three soldiers, three troops that were killed. He kept saying over and over again it would not have happened if he was in office. Again, a lot of this ended up turning into a general election speech, talking about what he intends to hit on, which is crime, the economy, talking about inflation and immigration. But overarching, it's part of a larger strategy, not just of Donald Trump but of his campaign, to reach into several districts that Joe Biden won, several different voting factions and try to siphon off voters. And one of those factions, one of those voting blocs those union workers -- Brianna? KEILAR: Yes. Just a fact check, Iranian proxies did kill U.S. servicemembers during his term. In fact, after he took out Soleimani. And that is actually part of the important facts that have to be considered as the Biden administration is figuring out what they're going to do here.

There was a member of the executive board that was furious that the leadership met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and sent a letter calling Trump a scab. But he is not going to give up one vote in one of these battleground states, so called Blue Wall, where labor is really important, like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. Those are key.

We have seen a number of these attacks, nearly 40 at this point, if I'm not mistaking, attacking international shipping lanes and that includes attacks directed at U.S. warships.In this case, the \"USS Gravely,\" an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, that was operating in the Red Sea. We knew from U.S. Central Command that it intercepted a cruise missile on Tuesday. We now know, having spoken to four U.S. officials that the missile closed to within one mile of the \"Gravely\" before it was shot down. That is the closest a Houthi attack, be it a ballistic missile or cruise missile or drone, has come to a U.S. warship since attacks began late last year. The system that was used to shoot it down the cruise missile is known as the CIWS (ph), the close-in weapons system. It is one of the last layers of defense on a destroyer. In previous instances, these launches, these attacks are intercepted at a range of eight miles or more using interceptor missiles. The fact that it got this close is an indication of the fact that it got through somehow other layers of defense that failed to intercept this cruise missile. And then was shot down with a close-in weapon system, which, I should point out, is an automated machine gun that was able to track and shoot it down still out of range of one mile. This underscores, of course, how fraught the situation is as the Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes continues. This is what the U.S., the U.K. and others have warned about in these ongoing attacks. And again, it underscores the threat, not only to U.S. warships, which the Houthis have said are now a target, but also to other vessels operating in that region, one of the world's most critical waterways.",

These are known as the more dynamic strikes. These are when there is a target that poses a threat at the last second or in that final window, the U.S. will take the shot essentially and strike these. In this case, it was a surface-to-air missile. We have seen some of these in the past, in addition to larger attacks the U.S. has carried out against Houthi targets in Yemen.
