Video shows what appears to be a strike outside the main hospital, Al-Shifa Hospital. The cause is unclear. Take a look at some of the video just in to us. CNN has geolocated the videos to the area around that hospital. This is from outside the Al-Shifa hospital, showing crowds and journalists gathering at the scene. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza who is at that hospital said that Israel was responsible for an attack. We don't know if that's accurate at this stage. We are waiting for a response from the IDF. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us now from London. So, we are just getting this information into us, Salma, good to have you with us. So, this was -- this is the main hospital in Gaza. It appears there may have been some sort of strike outside that hospital. What can you tell us?",

The beating heart of the city, because in addition to it being that medical center, it is also now housing tens of thousands of displaced people. People, families, moms, dads, kids who believe that the only safe place they can find right now is inside a hospital. If you don't mind, we're going to play those pictures one more time that you had, because you can begin to see the chaos, the panic in that scene. We understand that there could potentially be dozens of casualties. We're still working to find out more. But you see the blood on the ground, the indication just of what may have happened, what may have taken place there. Now, the other reason why Al- Shifa Hospital is on edge is because it's very much in the war zone, Lynda. Israeli troops have encircled Gaza city, that was the announcement made by the IDF today. And Al-Shifa Hospital has been in the headlines because the Israeli military has made accusations against it, saying that it is potentially a Hamas command and control center, and that there are underground tunnels. Now, the Israeli military provided very little evidence for these claims, Palestinian officials, those on the ground, doctors who have worked in the hospital deny these accusations, but it's the reason why families inside are so terrified. They fear they could be the next target. And again, you have to think about that intensifying Israeli offensive around the gates of Gaza city. Relentless bombardment, ground forces moving in with tanks, with artillery, with shelling, that is adding of course, to the sense of chaos inside Gaza city. Al-Shifa Hospital has also been experiencing blackouts recently. They've run out of fuel, they're running out of the ability to care, not only for the sick, but again for the tens of thousands of people trying to shelter in that hospital, but it's just another example, Lynda, of what we keep hearing over and over again from Gazans, over and over again from rights groups, which is, there is no safe place in Gaza.",

It is also essentially a refugee camp, a displacement camp for tens of thousands of people who truly believe that the only place they can go, even knowing that the hospital isn't safe, it's about as safe as they can get. That's going to, of course, shake them to see this. And you have to remember, the medical facility itself, Al-Shifa Hospital is running out of fuel, it's running out of medical supplies, it's struggling to treat the many wounded that it receives on a daily basis.

But even before Antony Blinken had left Israel this afternoon, Benjamin Netanyahu was saying that he opposes any kind of ceasefire, unless all of the hostages are released.

He essentially laid out that there is very much a possibility that the Lebanese front, the border between Israel and Lebanon could flare up. But it's already a slow burn down there. Yesterday, Hezbollah claimed 19 strikes on Israeli positions. That's really the highest number we've seen so far today. But he is maintaining the conflict on the border within what's known as the rules of engagement. Unwritten understanding between Israel and Hezbollah that as long as these exchanges of fire are limited to the border area, are limited to military targets, that neither side will escalate beyond that. And it's important that he pointed out, as you mentioned, that he said that this was a 100 percent -- the 7th of October was 100 percent a Hamas- Palestinian operation. He stressed that not even other factions in Gaza were aware of the attack being planned. And among those that didn't know was Hezbollah and Iran. Iran being the main backer of Hamas Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah here in Iran. He said that Hezbollah's primary desire or goal at the moment was a ceasefire in Gaza, but another goal was victory by Hamas and the other militant factions in Gaza.

In an essay in the Economist, he likened Kyiv's stalemate to the First World War. Well, large parts of Europe are recovering from a major storm. In Italy, at least six people have died due to intense floods and several are missing. In France, more than 500,000 households in the northern region still don't have power after the storm swept through the country Thursday into Friday. At least two people were killed there and more than 40 others injured. Let's take a closer look at the storm right now. CNN's Chad Meyers is joining us.

They say a 49- year-old woman was charged with three counts of murder, as well as five counts of attempted murder after being arrested in connection with the case on Thursday. Police say the woman served the meal to her former parents-in-law, her mother-in-law's sister, and ex-husband who were guests at her home. Local media have identified the woman as Erin Patterson, but police declined to comment on the woman's identity. Patterson has previously said that she was unaware that the mushrooms were poisonous. Still to come tonight, the U.S. president and the first lady are heading to Maine. They're there to support a family and grieve with a family reeling from last week's mass shooting.
