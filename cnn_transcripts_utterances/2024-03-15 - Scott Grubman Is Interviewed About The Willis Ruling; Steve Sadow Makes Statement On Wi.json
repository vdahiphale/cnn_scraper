The defendants, it appears, will be, or intend to, file for permission to appeal now, because ordinarily if you appeal as a defendant you have to wait until after your trial's over. But in certain rare circumstances you can get permission to file interlocutory, meaning now, meaning before trial. It sounds like the defendants will do that. If they are granted permission to file that appeal now that will certainly further postpone this.And the lawyer made an important point. The reason they might be given -- one of the reasons they might be given permission to file an appeal now is the worst-case scenario for everybody, for our justice system, for the prosecutors, for the defendants is, this case goes forward, it results in convictions and then a year from now, two years from now, a court of appeal says, that was an error.

So, he may be thinking, well, you know, let's - let's make sure we've got everything cleaned up and spit shined off before we get too far, you know, along in the case. The appellate court will look at these issues and satisfy everybody so we can move ahead. So, you may not be totally opposed to it. I will tell you, typically this would not be the kind of issue that would go up on an interlocutory appeal. It's not dispositive of the case. These are not things that are outside the purview of the trial judge that is he's to determine credibility of witnesses, whose tell the truth about the version of events and that type of thing. And so you usually wouldn't see that. But in a case of this magnitude, he may be inclined to, I guess, err on the side of caution, if you will, or lean on the side of caution and let a reviewing court look at it just to make sure that everything lines up and sort of put the issue to bed once and -- once and for all.",

And then he's handled this incredibly high stakes case. And then before the case even gets underway, he has to handle this massive decision about whether to disqualify the district attorney.And there has been a lot of praise for how the judge has conducted himself throughout these hearings. These are televised, so people can see, you know, every comment, every gesture. And for someone who has so little experience on the bench, folks roundly have said he's done a pretty good job. Now, in terms of this opinion, a lot of folks are going to have things to say about how he handled this final decision. But in speaking with one source who has worked on the defensive side of this case, this source said, quote, \"it's a very well-reasoned order. McAfee continues to impress as a judge.\" And they said that he has \"managed to navigate the many nuanced issues here and arrive at what is probably the right result.\" Now, you're probably not likely to see many Trump-aligned lawyers say that on camera, but it speaks to the high stakes here. The lack of this individual's experience has not prevented him from navigating this in a way that at least some people close to the defense team says, look, this was the right result. So, he, again, the fact that he has a case like this after being on the bench for less than a year, what a daunting task. And today it's interesting because we were wondering what he was going to say because over the past few days he's given interviews, highly unusual for a judge overseeing a case of this nature to give press interviews, and I was wondering when he kept saying, I make my decisions regardless of politics, I wondered, OK, he's clearly trying to get out in front of whatever he's going to decide. What is it that he's trying to say. But he is an elected judge. He will have to run for the seat. He will have a challenger. So, it appears that he's just trying to tell the voters, like, look, politics had nothing to do with the conclusion that I arrived at here. But he is definitely a key player. I know we've talked about the district attorney, about former President Trump. Well, let's not forget about the judge, arguably the biggest decision he's had to make so far in his career.",
