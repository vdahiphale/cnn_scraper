And we begin with extreme heat gripping much of the world and the U.S. Right now more than 85 million Americans are under heat alerts from Florida to California. In the west, a suffocating heat dome is intensifying, leading to record-breaking hot temperatures in so many areas. Phoenix topped 110 degrees for the 15th consecutive day on Friday, and it's forecast to continue that streak through at least Wednesday. And this is a live earth cam shot of Sedona, Arizona. It's beautiful, but the temperatures are already over 100 degrees, and a high of 106 is expected later on today. Meanwhile, Death Valley, California, already one of the hottest places on earth, could see temperatures reach a scorching 130 degrees this weekend. CNN's Mike Valerio is in Valencia, California, and CNN's Rafael Romo is in Las Vegas. Rafael, let's begin with you. How does it feel right now. RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR: Let me tell you, Fred, we started out here at about 5:00 in the morning, it was 86 degrees, and the last hour we crossed the 100 degree threshold. And as soon as that happened, we started seeing a lot of people coming this direction, from the street and into the shops. We're here in front of the fashion show Las Vegas. This is the largest mall in the state of Nevada, and that's the option that people are taking right now, because, honestly, the heat right now is feeling very oppressive. And let me tell you, the National Weather Service says that they expect -- it's a possibility, not for sure, but a possibility that in the next three days or so, they may tie the all-time record at 117 degrees. Let me tell you, being here, I feel like that's already happened. But we've been talking to people here, somebody told us that they don't mind because they go -- as soon as they get a little hot, they go inside like a lot of these people are doing. And then we found the gentleman who, believe it or not, he was doing a power walk in the middle of this heat. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Mike Valerio, Rafael Romo, thank you so much.Let's bring in CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. What do you think, Brandon? Power walking to the water park or perhaps to the shopping mall, that's how people are coping. BRANDON MILLER, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, absolutely. And there in California, unless you are extremely close to the coast, you are under one of these heat advisories, heat alerts, and they're very widespread. One in four Americans, 85 million of us, are under these heat alerts. And if you're in California on the west coast, anywhere in the southwest, it's more like three and four or even more. And the reason is because of this heat dome. We've been talking about it for weeks because it's not going anywhere. It's just meandering back and forth, sort of between Arizona and Texas, and that dome of high pressure is what it is, and it just prevents storms from forming. It prevents clouds from forming and it causes sinking air. And that's what really builds up that heat. And people have been asking me, heat dome, I keep hearing about the heat dome. Where did that term come from? It's not a new term, but it is just another name for a high pressure or a ridge. And actually, the heat wave that's going on in Europe right now, they actually give them names, and really crazy awesome names. I think the current one is Cerberus, which is named after the three-headed Greek mythology monster that guards hell. Maybe if we named our heat waves something like that, people would take it a little more serious, because it is. It's 100 possible records this weekend through Monday alone. We're talking Texas all the way to California. A couple down here in Florida, we don't want to forget them. They are boiling down there. The water is extremely hot, as we saw in the piece just last hour affecting the coral down there. And, again, this is record hot water, and then the sun baking the land, and the Gulf of Mexico is wide open. So these are feels-like temperatures here in Texas -- 107, 102, 106 on Monday in Dallas. And it's going to heat up as we go into next week. This isn't just a weekend thing, because that high pressure, that heat dome -- maybe we'll give it an interesting name -- is going to come back to Texas, and this heat wave is just really unrelenting, and it's going to go on at least through next week. And these watches and warnings from Texas to Arizona, we've had them 35 consecutive days, Fredricka.",

They were confident that Rex Heuermann was closely monitoring for headlines, for developments in this investigation, and they feared that if any information would actually leak that he could try to get away.

But I think there was a decision amongst the allies to say if we let Ukraine in right now then we are automatically at war with Russia, unless, of course, we suspend or alter the Article Five, an attack against one is an attack against all.
