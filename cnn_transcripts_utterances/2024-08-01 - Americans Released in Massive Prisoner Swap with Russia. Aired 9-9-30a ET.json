      "sentences": "And we are following this major breaking news. A massive prisoner swap between the United States and Russia. The large-scale swap, as it is described, is right now underway. It is expected to include \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich, and American Marine Paul Whelan, among multiple other American we are told.A lot not known. A lot of questions and a lot of very stressful, very delicate minutes and hours ahead. They are expected to be in U.S. custody soon. This is according to a senior administration official. This swap ending a monthslong negotiation that was kept very quiet and was understandably very complicated. It ends a year's long nightmare for so many. Both Paul Whelan, who had been in Russian custody for more than five years, and Evan, as you see on the right side of your screen, Evan there, in custody for just doing his job as a journalist, wrongfully detained for more - for the better part of a year now. CNN is learning more minute by minute. We've got our team coverage here in the United States and around the globe. Let's start this hour, once again, with Alex Marquardt, who first brought us this breaking news. What's the very latest, Alex.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, Omar, we may be at the beginning of what is truly a historic and very emotional they, not just for the families of the people coming home, but, of course, for this entire country that has been wrapped (ph) with this saga of these wrongfully detained Americans in Russia for several years.We are learning more from the Biden administration. They said just moments ago that a - that a prisoner exchange is underway and they have confirmed that at least two of the people being released by Russian authorities are former Marine Paul Whelan and \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich. These are two of the highest profile political prisoners being held by Russia, who American officials have been trying to negotiate their released for a very long time. Today would be the culmination of years of hard work to try to get not just these two men home, but many others as well. We are trying to understand the contours of what could be a historic deal. And when I say historic, it's not just in terms of the size, the number of prisoners who could be exchanged by these countries, but also the number of countries involved. We believe that this is an extraordinarily complex swap that is now underway. We don't know what stage it is at right now. We don't know where, for example, Gershkovich and Whelan are right now. But the senior administration official who we spoke with said that they are expected to soon be in U.S. custody. But that could take all day. This is a highly logistical and complex operation to undertake. Again, we believe involving multiple countries. Some of the others who we believe may be involved in this swap. Vadim Krasikov would be the biggest name who the Russians want. This is a colonel in the FSB, which is the successor to the KGB, has been held for years by Germany after carrying out a killing in a Berlin park. And so as the U.S. has tried to negotiate the release of Gershkovich and Whelan, the Russians have been asking for Krasikov. And so the U.S. has been putting pressure on Germany to try to get them to release him. So, at the very least we believe that the countries involved in today's exchange are - are the U.S., who would release several Russian prisoners. There aren't very many high profile Russian prisoners. There are people, for example, who have been committed - or who have been convicted of cybercrimes. That's the kind of prisoner who the U.S. would release. Germany would be expected to release Krasikov as the - as the Russians release Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich. One name I also want to highlight, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a Russian-British national. He is an award winning reporter, seen by the Russians to be an opposition activist. He has also been held by the Russians and Germany, Britain, the U.S. and other countries have been trying to get him out. So, we believe we are at the beginning of this historic day. A large swap involving multiple countries. But tremendous news right now that we can report from the Biden administration that Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich are expected to be among those released today and would be returning home soon to the United States.",

How long it will take before we see video, get confirmation, we're going to stand by together on all of this.And as Kayla was talking about Paul Whelan, he's been in - he's been behind bars in Russia since his arrest in 2018. And during that time, CNN reporter and producer Jennifer Hansler has had the opportunity that she has - that she has received calls, she's been able to speak to Paul on the phone from time to time, expressing his frustrations, hearing his voice from a Russian prison on what it has been like for him as he's been enduring this for now five years. I want to play for you some - just one bit of their conversations over the years. This, Paul Whelan talking about Evan Gershkovich. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, just to put a fine point quickly on Paul Whelan, to give viewers an understanding of how long he has been detained in Russia, he's been there as multiple Americans have been detained, deemed wrongfully detained, and then released, all the while he has been waiting for the moment where he is included in a prisoner swap. And of course we're learning that that is coming to fruition as we speak. It has been a tremendous number of years, more than five years behind bars for him. So, it's been incredibly challenging. Those conversations with Jennifer Hansler have shown a light on thelows that he has been through, the moments where he has felt there might be breakthroughs. One of the questions, as you said, is if there are other Americans who are detained in Russia who might be included in what we understand is going to be a massive prisoner swap that's underway right now. We know, of course, that Evan Gershkovich is involved according to the Biden administration. But there are other Americans. Alex mentioned Vladimir Kara-Murza. He's a prominent critic of the Kremlin. He was detained in 2022, actually after he spoke on CNN. And he said that the Kremlin, that President Putin's regime is regime of murderers. So, that is one we'll be watching to see if there's any movement there. There's also Alsu Kurmasheva. She is a journalist. She was working for Radio Free Europe. She traveled back into Russia last spring, last summer, to visit her mother. And then she was detained. Both of her passports taken away from her, including, of course, her American passport. She has not gone through a trial, but her family has encouraged the State Department to pay close attention to her case, specifically because they say there are so many similarities between her work and the work of Evan Gershkovich, who is that \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who was deemed wrongfully detained by the State Department. There's also Marc Fogel. He is an American teacher who had been teaching in Moscow for many years. Diplomats here at the State Department actually know Marc Fogel pretty well because he is someone who taught their children while they were serving in Russia. Now, the school that he was working at has since closed. And when he was returning to Russia in 2021, he was going there for his final year of teaching, and he was arrested. He was charged with smuggling of drugs. The same charge that we saw against Brittney Griner, who was then, of course, released in a following prisoner swap. He hasn't been deemed wrongfully detained, but he's someone who's family we've been talking to, has been worried about him, has been worried about his health. So, there are many individuals that we have been keeping an eye on. We'll watch to see if they are included. And then, of course, as you guys have been discussing, who else from around the globe U.S. officials have been able to secure as part of this overall deal because we just know that the United States didn't have many high value targets that the Russians were wanting as part of a swap.",

Matthew Chance, I want to bring you in here because, look, as you've spoken about before, you've done extensive reporting inside Russia. At points, again, trying to get into the legal proceedings against Evan Gershkovich there as well.

They've trolled us a little bit, but I can live with that, in the same sense that, you know, there was controversy on this trade, apparently includes Mr. Krasikov. I am not at all worried about that. Mr. Krasikov is effectively confined to Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and maybe China for the rest of his life. So, there's not a lot of chance that he would do harm to an American or any of our allies.

So, we should begin with that caveat.But my understanding from this person close to the families, who is in fact with them right now, is that there is a great deal of elation, a great deal of relief, anticipation, but also some understandable remaining nervousness because they, of course, Kate and Omar, they want to see this deal done and they're not going to be confident, fully confident that the deal is done until they see their loved ones free and clear. But you can imagine, in this moment, with so much uncertainty, so many false starts, you think particularly of the Whelan family, right, where they thought they were going to be parts of other swaps that did happen and he was not involved. So, they've been burned before. So, you understand, as they go into this, they will always enter with that - with that - that sense of nervousness.
