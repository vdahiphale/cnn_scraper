But when it comes to being a defendant in a criminal case, it does not infringe on those rights to say there are certain other compelling reasons why we don't want this case as the Department of Justice said, tried in the court of public opinion. Why we don't want the former president and his legal team to share certain information.

There's a political utility for him if it actually is implemented, because then he can give speeches and he can say, I would tell you so much more.

Remember, at the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. tried to evacuate him and he said, no, I don't need a ride. I need ammo. And he is of course traveling around the country more and more, which of course increases the risk.I think it's interesting to look at the timing of this, though, and why we've had the amount of detail that we've had from the Ukrainian Security Services. This is of course, a critical point in the conflict, things are moving very slowly along the front lines. And the security services say that in addition to trying to find information on President Zelenskyy's itinerary during his recent trip to Mykolaiv, the suspected Russian informant was also looking for information on electronic warfare systems, Ukrainian ammunition stores, and things like that. All of that could have a major impact on the frontlines for the Ukrainian. So perhaps by doing this in this way, by releasing that image of what they say the suspect that blurred image, they also release screenshots they say of text messages between the alleged informants and, you know, presumably her Russian handlers also threatening her with 12 years in prison. Perhaps all of that is to create a deterrent, more of a deterrent at this critical time in the conflict. I think as well, you noted that Ukraine is making increasing threats as being more bold in terms of its attacks on the Black Sea bridges linking Crimea, with mainland Ukraine. Attacks with inside Russian territory, perhaps that does put President Zelenskyy a greater risk of retaliation and perhaps that's why we see the security services coming out so openly with it -- with this information at this point.
