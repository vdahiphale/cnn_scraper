One shot down over Lake Huron yesterday, one over northern Canada Saturday, and then, of course, that third in Alaska on Friday afternoon.

Specifically because they shot these down fairly quickly once they entered U.S. air space. They were only monitored for a short time before they were shot down, which means they haven't been able to get a better grip on what these are. They are still calling them objects. And because of the remote locations and because of the weather, they haven't recovered them yet.But here's what we know so far, according to multiple U.S. officials who have been briefed on what we know so far, essentially, at this point. That first object, the one shot down on Friday, that is the first of these most recent three, was a metallic object at 40,000 feet. When it was shot down and fell from the 40,000 down to the sea ice below, it broke into several pieces, suggesting it may have had a structure to it or a more rigid body. Unfortunately, at this point, we don't know more that that. Twenty-four hours later, the second object, the one that was shot down over Yukon, according to U.S. officials, that was a balloon carrying some sort of metal payload. Once again, at 40,000 feet. But that's in the remote Yukon Territory, so, that too hasn't been recovered. And then to the object shot down on Sunday that was tracked perhaps from Wisconsin or Montana, over Lake Huron where it was shot down, that was much lower, at 20,000 feet, that was described as an octagonal object, a small object. All three of these far smaller than the earlier Chinese surveillance balloon. At this point, that's all we know as we wait for more answers on what this was. It is worth noting that John Kirby from the National Security Council says from what they know, they have not observed any maneuverability, any propulsion or surveillance technology so far.",

White House National Security Council from the National Security Council John Kirby was asked this question during the White House briefing, that being cognizant of the Chinese having different definition of what their territory is, is there any surveillance aircraft over Taiwan or the South China Sea, that could fit into that? Kirby's response was, there is no U.S. surveillance aircraft in Chinese air space.So, Jake, what we're seeing is China present a completely different narrative, an alternate set of facts that the U.S. flat out rejects. In addition to doubling down on the claim that the Chinese balloon in U.S. airspace was just civilian balloon, blown off course, China now turning the tables here in trying to direct attention back to the U.S. Beijing's repeatedly accusing the U.S. of being the world's largest surveillance empire, said it's common for U.S. balloons to illegally into other countries airspace, and the ministry of foreign apparel spokesperson accused the U.S. of frequently sending more warplanes, warships and planes to carry out close range reconnaissance against China, which he claimed amounted to a total of 657 times last year and 64 times this January in the South China Sea. Meanwhile, on Sunday, state media said that they spotted their own UFO above waters near the eastern port city of Rizhao and were preparing to shoot it down. Local authorities even told fishermen in the area to stay safe, and to help salvage any debris if it falls near their boat. But as of now, we've got to know further detail about the object and it's still unclear if it's been taken down. But, Jake, look, I spoke to a defense expert, Drew Thompson in Singapore, who said China's messaging may lack credibility and it's contradictory.

Police say the suspect was neutralized after he drove his car apparently deliberately into a bus stop in Jerusalem Friday. This attack follows weeks of heightened tension between Palestinians and Israelis.Earlier today, Palestinian authorities said and Israeli military raid left one Palestinian man dead and at least 13 others injured. Meanwhile, there is also unrest happening within Israel's own parliament, the Knesset. It's spilling into the streets of Jerusalem where tens of thousands of flag waving Israelis were protesting against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judiciary reform plan that would weaken the Israeli Supreme Court. As CNN's Hadas Gold reports for us now, Israel's president is now warning that the nation is on the brink of constitutional and social collapse. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  By the tens of thousands, protesters streamed into Jerusalem, with drums, flags, signs, chanting and singing songs. One of the largest demonstrations for Jerusalem in years, is these protesters skipped work, school to stand against Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government's sweeping judicial reform plans, fundamentally altering the balance of power by allowing parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. Now, for weeks, tens of thousands of Israelis have been coming out to the streets of Tel Aviv to protest. But on Monday, on the day these judicial reforms or first formally introduced in the Israeli parliament, they decided to come here to Jerusalem, so that the shouts of the tens of thousands could be heard in the halls of the parliament.",

Hadas Gold in Jerusalem for us, thank you so much.Back in the United States in our national lead, a new report out today from the American Jewish Committee shows that antisemitism, specifically anti-Jewish hate in the U.S., is growing and creeping into all facets of American society. Let's bring in Ted Deutch, former Florida Democratic congressman and the CEO of the American Jewish Committee to talk about this report. So, Ted, thanks for joining us. The new state of antisemitism in the America report shows that in 2022, 89 percent of American Jews said that antisemitism is a serious problem. That's up from 73 percent at just one year before. There is also a ten-point jump in Jews, American Jews reporting that they feel less secure about their status in the United States. So your organization is a call to action to combat antisemitism. How do you even begin to tackle such a huge accelerating problem?",

It's a 10 percent increase from last year.So, AJC's call to action against antisemitism recognizes that this requires a whole of society approach that ultimately, it's not just the Jews who are at a risk when antisemitism is allowed to fester, and that we are all in this together fighting this Jew hatred. So, whether it's advocacy before government or advocacy with businesses, interacting with universities, law enforcement, social media, perhaps most importantly, everyone has a role to play here. Most people in the Jewish committee saw antisemitism online, 85 percent of young people saw antisemitism or experience antisemitism online, and people are changing their behavior as a result even frayed to show that they're Jewish.",

So, there has to be a real focus. We need the resources to help secure the community and the institutions. We need the resources, as you point, out in law enforcement, to make sure that these cases are being investigated and being prosecuted, people are being held accountable.
