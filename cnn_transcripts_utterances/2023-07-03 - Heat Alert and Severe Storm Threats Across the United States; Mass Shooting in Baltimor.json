Tens of millions of Americans face sweltering heat as they prepare for their 4th of July festivities.A new Israeli military operation in the West Bank leaves multiple people dead and dozens injured. We are live in Tel Aviv. And extending the olive branch, another U.S. cabinet member will travel to Beijing hoping to repair tattered relations with China. But recent comments from her boss may complicate things. We will have more in a live report from Hong Kong. Good to have you with us. And we begin in the U.S. where more than 30 million Americans are under heat warnings as they prepare for the Independence Day holiday. Forecasters say close to 30 daily high temperatures could be tied or broken this week and millions of Americans could see temperatures climb to more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In the southeast, those states include North Carolina and Virginia with cities such as Raleigh and Virginia Beach potentially logging temperatures of more than 105 degrees. Southwestern states are under more excessive alerts with California's Death Valley set to top 125 degrees Fahrenheit, and Phoenix 115. Meantime, conditions are improving in Chicago after heavy rain triggered flash flooding on Sunday. The rising waters stranded people in their cars and temporarily shut down major highways. The National Weather Service says it was Chicago's heaviest rain event in more than 40 years. And millions of people are under severe storm threats throughout the eastern U.S. on Monday, from Mississippi to Massachusetts. Gusty winds and damaging hail are the main concerns. Well, tragically, gun violence is once again overshadowing another holiday weekend here in the United States. Police in Baltimore are investigating a mass shooting that erupted Saturday night at a block party. At least two people were killed, 28 others injured. Most of the victims were teenagers, some as young as 13. Police believe there are multiple shooters. The city's mayor says it's a cowardly act of violence and is asking the community for help in finding those responsible. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel saying that it wasn't just a command and control center, it was also an observation center and also used as a kind of refuge for militants after carrying out attacks. They would flee to back -- to Jenin and take refuge in this building as well.Israel saying that it belongs to the Jenin Brigade which is affiliated with Islamic jihad. Now, you mentioned the casualty figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel saying that it has actually killed seven militants, both with drones and also in exchanges of fire as well. And Israel referring to this refugee camp in Jenin as a hornet's nest and saying that one of its other intentions, as well as destroying this command center, as well as seizing weapons and munitions and to prevent future attacks is also, in its words, to remove the safe haven mentality that Jenin had in the minds of militants so that they don't feel that it is a safe place or secure place to run back to after carrying out attacks or to use as a base from which to carry out attacks. Israel saying there were 50 shooting attacks against Israelis last year that emanated from Jenin and that 25 Israelis were killed last year from militants in Jenin, adding that 19 of those militants fled back to Jenin after carrying out attacks. As I said, this is an ongoing operation. Israel saying that it's using a battalion's worth of troops, that's around about 500 troops in Israel, as well as I said, UAVs and drone air strikes. There are no signs of helicopter gunships that we know of so far that have been used to scale (ph) the week for the first time in something like two decades. So, this very extensive operation, much bigger than ones that we have seen in the past and is still ongoing. Rosemary?",

But it comes just two weeks after Antony Blinken's successful visit there where he helped to reestablish, you know, dialogue at a time when relations were at an all-time low. Janet Yellen, as you say, Rosemary, will be heading to Beijing laterthis week. We don't know her exact itinerary, but we understand she plans to meet with her Chinese counterpart and other high-ranking officials for what we hear will be constructive and frank conversations. But like what Blinken's trip last month, officials say they are not expecting any significant breakthroughs. She is also not expected to meet with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yellen has long signaled the Biden administration's desire to improve communications with the Chinese and really, you know, lower the temperature between the world's two largest economies, which as we know, are deeply entwined. Back in April while giving testimony before Congress, she stressed the importance of maintaining ties with China and said that decoupling would be a big mistake. And then last month, at the Paris Finance Summit, on stage with the Chinese premier Li Keqiang, she said, and let me read to you what she said. \"As the world's two largest economies, we also have a responsibility to work together on global issues. It is something the world expects of us.\" Now, Yellen's trip comes at a time of also heightened uncertainty for the global economy. China is struggling to reboot its economy post COVID, following a slew of poor economic data, while the U.S. is trying to contain inflation and avoid going into recession. You know, global challenges in mutual areas of concern will no doubt be on the agenda, but so too will be the airing of grievances. So, lots to discuss, Rosemary, on her three-day trip to Beijing.",

The Svatove-Kreminna line in the Luhansk region has been the sight of heavy fighting. This is an area that Russia took control over in the early months of the war, and Ukraine has been trying to take back with, as yet, no real success. So, Russia has been making some small advances there, but Ukraine says it continues to make smaller advances, as you say, around the flanks of Bakhmut. It hasn't gotten into the city itself yet. And of course, in the south, around those key ports, you say of Melitopol and Berdiansk.

And someone who kind of -- is more of an institutionalist. I think there will be more discussion of that among Democrats as the years go by. But I think what's actually more likely than expanding the court is serious discussion about term limits on the court.Eighteen-year term limits. Once they were fully -- once that idea was put in place, once it was fully implemented, every president would get two appointments in their -- in their four years, at least. They we guarantee that. And it's an idea that started among conservatives. I mean, originally, it was conservative law professors who began talking about it. I think you're going to hear more discussion of that in the years ahead. I think on the court expansion, there's a -- there's a fear that it would just set off in an endless cycle of escalation. All of that, though, either, you know, any of those alternative is still years away. And what we are seeing now is consistently this court ruling in a way that reflects the priorities and grievances as I said, of that Republican coalition, and often ruling against not only the preferences but the intrinsic identity of younger generations who are more likely than any generation in American history to be racially diverse, to be secular to identify as LGBTQ. They are systematically seeing their priorities rolled over by this court majority.",

His approval rating among them is quite low, many significant majority of them will say in polls, I think he is too old to be president. And I think that this decision by the court which I think as -- will be the most politically consequential of those that they lay down over the past week, is very much as I said, a dual-edged sword for Biden.On the one hand, he can point to it and say, look, I tried to do this for you. And Republicans blocked it. On the other hand, he's already facing a kind of skepticism among younger people about whether he's really making enough progress on the things they care about. And this becomes another potentially promise that he could not deliver. They are trying to find a fallback position of using the Higher Education Act of 1965 to forgive debt. There were Democrats like Elizabeth Warren who from the beginning thought that was a better option than the authority that he used. It takes a while on a regulatory manner, but I'm -- I suspect that before the election in 2024, they will be back with another plan to relieve debt, and that you will see Republicans again go to court and this will be something the Supreme Court will decide in 2025 if the -- if the Democrats still hold the White House.",

And this is what they said.They said, conservatives understand that we need to protect our kids, preserve women's sports, safeguard women's spaces and strengthen parental rights. But Ron DeSantis' extreme rhetoric has just ventured into homophobic territory. They also said that this was divisive. And so, it's interesting to see this group, this huge group stepping forward here when they haven't in the past, when you've heard so many of these candidates coming out, they're talking about woke ideology, trying to campaign against teaching gender ideology.
