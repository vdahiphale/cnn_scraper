This time around, look at this, the vast majority of Republicans in the United States Senate endorsed Trump during the primary season. The bottom line is this. They tolerated him last time.

You just heard right there, Donald Trump has the support of Republicans in Congress. He will have control likely of all three branches of government. So, my simple question to you is, what you going to do? REP. GREG CASAR (D-TX): Well, even if Donald Trump may be popular right now with many of those voters, if you remember, during the beginning of his first term, his agenda was deeply unpopular with working people. He tried to undo congressional ethics because he's so corrupt. He tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act time and time again, and quickly his numbers plummeted. And so it is the job of Democrats to remind the American people what they want from their government. And I don't think they're going to see that from Donald Trump. They're just going to see grift and attempts at tax cuts for billionaires as the beginning of his agenda. That's not what working people actually want.",

For example, Trump saying he was trying to help the middle class actually mostly gave tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. And although Democrats fought and lost that fight, it destroyed Trump's numbers and favorability. That's what we will attempt to do again here.But I think we have to do it not just with facts and figures, but by showing working people that we are ready to stand up to the real bullies, not just to Donald Trump, but when they see their credit card fees go up because Trump tries to get rid of some of the Biden-era protections. We should be calling out Visa and Mastercard. When people start to see, oh, why are my bank withdrawal fees going up?

Your worsening health care, that's also on immigrants. It was the answer to basically every single question. And Democrats have to lay out the alternative case much more clearly. Your house prices are going up, not because of immigrants, but because of hedge funds. Your health care is worsening, not because, of immigrants, but because of big pharma. We have to make that clear and show once again that Donald Trump is going to try to divert resources to separating families, to undoing civil liberties. Resources that should be going to lowering costs, to improving your child care, to improving your health care.

And I think that there needs to be a new set of people coming up, new people running for office, just like the new members we saw, that come in that mold. And I think that he really showed the path of how it is that we can regain majorities. And I hope that our current House Democratic leadership learns from those lessons.
