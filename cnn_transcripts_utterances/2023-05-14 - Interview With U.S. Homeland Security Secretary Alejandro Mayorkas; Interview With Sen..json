But, this month, two simmering problems pose big, big challenges to his reelection efforts, the potential for a catastrophic debt default and the crisis at the Southern border. This weekend, the flow of migrants into the U.S. is lower than expected after the end of the COVID era Title 42 border rule, but the administration is still faced with overcrowded facilities, legal challenges from the left and the right, and deadlock in Congress. House Republicans did pass a bill to bring back Trump era policies like construction of the border wall and the authority to quickly expel migrants. But it's dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate, which leaves the country still without a real plan to fix a persistent problem that is only growing. So far in 2023, 1.3 million migrants have been apprehended along the Southern border. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The cartels, the smuggling organizations, control the land. And so we have not only a security imperative, but a humanitarian responsibility to cut those smugglers out. And that's precisely what we, as an administration, has done. We have attacked the smuggling organizations with our law enforcement authorities. We have arrested more than 10,000 smugglers. But President Biden has led the greatest expansion of lawful pathways ever through family reunification programs, through expedited refugee processing, through the regional processing centers that we're now building.

The purpose of a party is to beat the Democrats, the Republican Party in this case. And we don't -- Trump doesn't have a plan to beat the Democrats. He has a plan to dominate the Republican Party. DeSantis wants the party to be an electoral function, and Trump wants the party to be a bludgeoning tool against the people that Republicans hate, whether that's CNN or the media or whoever, what other institutions.
