Each has been indicted on a single felony charge of burning an object with the intent to intimidate, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.The 2017 rally ultimately led to violent clashes with counter protesters and 32-year-old Heather Heyer lost her life.

      "sentences": "Well, John, the hearing is slightly delayed because there's another unrelated hearing going on in this court behind me. But in a few minutes, we do expect this hearing to take place where two of the three defendants in this case are expected to appear. To set the scene for our viewers we have to kind of differentiate.This --these defendants are charged in a case that's related to that Friday evening rally on August 11th, 2017. That is when a group of white nationalists and white supremacists marched on the campus of the University of Virginia wielding torches. They menaced several people on the campus that evening, and they are charged and we're going to go over the charges in a second. But that of course is different from what happened the day after that. That was the Unite the Right rally on that Saturday of August 12th, 2017 when there was so much violence in the streets here in Charlottesville. Now the two events are related of course, but they are separate. And this case has only to do with the events on that Friday evening we should point out. Now the charges involved, two of the three men charged are going to appear at this hearing. They are Will Zachary Smith from Texas and Tyler Bradley Dykes from South Carolina for Smith. This is a bond hearing for Tyler Bradley Dykes. This is an initial court appearance. A third defendant named Dallas Medina is we believe not going to appear in court, at least for this hearing. But the three men are charged with burning an object with the intent to intimidate. Also Will Zachary Smith is charged with violating a statute which makes it illegal to maliciously release a chemical irritant such as tear gas that also relates to that torch march on that Friday evening. And again, these people were again marching through the campus of the University of Virginia that night, wielding torches, chanting horrible racist slogans like, quote, Jews will not replace us, and blood and soil which is a Nazi reference. That was kind of a prelude to what happened the next day when there was so much pitched violence in the streets of Charlottesville, actually, right near where I'm standing right now. And it was only about two blocks away from here when 32-year-old Heather Heyer was struck by a vehicle that rammed into a crowd and killed several people hurt that day. And also, we can tell you that this is kind of a continuation of a years' long effort to bring some of these people to justice, because just about a year and a half ago, several of the organizers of the Unite the Right march were successfully sued by some victims of the violence of that march for damages totaling about $26 million.

And it didn't take much. He needed to sign an ATF form, basically go through an FBI records check to show he wasn't a convicted felon, then he was able to get this weapon. And we know from the family that he had been dealing with some mental health issues, though they even say they never thought that things would get to where we have seen things get to.",

We definitely see in the life histories of mass shooters, and we've studied them going all the way back to 1966 to the present day, that people who perpetrate mass shootings are not mentally well, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are mentally ill.And that's an important distinction, which is to say that there is often a lot going on in the lives of a mass shooter that overwhelms their usual coping mechanism. These individuals who are in crisis, it can often be a suicidal crisis. And it's often observable because there is a change in behavior from baseline where people around that person recognize something's not quite right. But it doesn't necessarily mean they have a diagnosed mental illness. And also, we have to avoid the stigma attached to the idea that mental illness is the primary driver of mass shooters. It's a much more complicated and messy picture than that.",

So if you get to that point where you no longer care if you live or die, you're asking that question of why do I feel that way?You Google it and you find out that there are other people who felt the same way you have. And you kind of go tumbling down the rabbit hole and get radicalized into this type of violence by being inspired by others that have done it too. So what we often see is when mass shooters leave behind this trail of breadcrumbs. For some people, it becomes inspirational, and that they can draw sort of copycat from this and follow suit in the footsteps of those other mass shooters too.",

      "sentences": "This was a huge aha moment for us when we were doing the research, looking at these life histories of the mass shooters. We even interviewed perpetrators of mass shooters who were incarcerated. We interviewed their families, friends, and others. This is all documented in the book.And we found this overlap between suicide and homicide, a mass shooter intends for their shooting to be a final act. And it can at times be driven by despair and suicidal ideation. The difference being that there's also a grievance there that you're trying to share with the world. So there's a lot of learning we can use from suicide prevention, to be thinking about how do we look for the warning signs when someone's on that pathway to violence? And how do we divert them off of it? It's really on all of us to look out for the people in our lives who are struggling, and to get them the help that they need, not because they might be a mass shooter, but because that's just the right thing to do. And doing it this way enables us to become part of the solution because the frustration is we're all waiting for Congress to act and it never comes. But we also can have some skin in the game here or be part of that solution by just taking care of one in each other and being nice.",

Nobody was hurt, and Pelham (ph) was later arrested.

But when was that discovered, because the DA who was handling it before was adamant. There was no way the gun could have gone off without the trigger being pulled. So very starkly different narrative here, and has a true impact on the case, as we can see from this surprising withdraw of charges by prosecutors.",

But yes, I think that in this particular case, it's surprising that the special prosecutors didn't say let's go to the preliminary hearing, and let the judge make the determination about whether or not there was probable cause. That means whatever they have was so conclusive that they couldn't move forward with the charges.Remember, prosecutors do have an ethical obligation. They're not out to get somebody or to win. They have to assess a case based on whether or not they believe the case can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. So in this case, if there was a modification, and Alec Baldwin was not aware of it, there really is not a case against him. And now to your point, Sara, whether or not the trigger was pulled, that's an issue because this modification could mean that it was a malfunction, the gun was less safe, right from the jump without his knowledge. So I think that they made the right choice by dropping the charges under the circumstances. But keep in mind, it's without prejudice. So an evolving investigation could lead to more.",
