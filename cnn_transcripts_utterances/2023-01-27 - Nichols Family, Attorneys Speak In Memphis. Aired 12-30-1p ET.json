He calls out three times for his mother. His last words on this earth is, mom, mom, mom. I mean, he's screaming for and when you think about that kidnapping charge, he said, I just want to go home. I mean, it's a traffic stop for God's sake. A traffic stop. A simple traffic stop. He's kidnapped for a simple traffic stop.",

And I continue to think about people like Terence Crutcher, people who for simple things, having car trouble, and they end up dead when they encounter the police. Corey Jones having car trouble when black people have simple encounters with police, they end up dead. We don't hear about these things with our white brothers and sisters.We don't see the videos of the police doing the most with white citizens when they're routine simple matters. And that's where we got to continue to speak to this police coach in America. It does get emotional, because I know what you're all about to see, America. And as much as those five officers killed Tyre Nichols, it was the police coach in America that killed Tyre Nichols. [12:50:00] So you're going to hear from our civil rights leader here in Memphis. He's standing with many other great civil rights leaders that SCLC. And I know the National Urban League is also a great presence here in Memphis, but we want to introduce to you one of our co-counsels, who is a great civil rights leader here, our NAACP president for the Memphis chapter Attorney Van Turner.",

We know the video would be horrific. We know that this happened at Ross and Raines. I just found out that this was in an area that I represented as a county commissioner. And part of what we did on the commission was put sky cop cameras up in their community to help combat crime. Little that we know we will be combating this type of criminal behavior as well. Isn't that something?We put sky cop cameras up to assist the police in fighting crime in our community, and yet they come and commit the very same crimes that we're trying to fight against. But glory be the God that a sky cop camera was there to catch what happened. And so we want to again stand with this family. I'm here with my cohort, Vickie Terry. She's the executive director. We fight together on the -- for the cause of the NAACP. Know that President Derrick Johnson has sent his regards. He has sent his soldiers down from the national office of NAACP to stand next to this family. Know that the NAACP National Organization is standing with this family. And we will fight to the end. We will fight with Attorney Ben Crump. We will fight with this family. We will fight with push. We will fight with all those who are seeking justice for Tyre. We want to thank Pastor Thomas for opening this church up again. You all thank Pastor Thomas. Give him a hand. We want to thank all those who are here fighting for justice for Tyre. I was at the candlelight vigil last night, and it was such a beautiful look. All of Memphis came together. Folks who you wouldn't think could come together, came together in support of this family. And that's what we're going to do. We're going to stand united. We're going to peacefully protest, but we're going to protest. We're going to make sure that policy is put forth and implemented correctly. And we're going to make sure that Tyre Nichols did not die in vain. We're going to make sure that he not die in vain. We're going to keep fighting for him. We're going to keep fighting for this family. You all pray for this family. You all pray for our city. Tonight would be one of the toughest nights that we've ever experienced in this city. But we will get through it. We will get through it. Let's stick together. Let's fight together.

And when you see the video tonight, you will understand that if this was your child, you will want first degree murder too. But they are respectful and accepting of those charges that the district attorney bought and they will thank them in their own way. Now you will hear from Tyre's daddy. He's his stepfather, but as his mom and his brothers say, that's his daddy. Let's give a big round of applause for the man standing strong for his family, Mr. Rodney Wells. RODNEY WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS STEPFATHER: Thank you, everybody for showing up. I just wanted to say that, as Mr. Crump just stated, I did push for murder one from the beginning. That was my main goal. But as the charges were told to us and they explained to us what the difference between murder one and murder two was, we're very satisfied with the charges. More importantly, we want peace. We do not want any type of uproar. We do not want any type of disturbance. We want peaceful protests. That's what the family wants. That's what the community wants. They're all kind of -- I got a text today from one of my supervisors about an alert telling her, don't be in crowds tonight. We shouldn't have that. We need to do this peacefully. The family is very satisfied with the process, with the police chief, the DA. They acted very, very quickly in this case. We are very, very pleased with that. Other cases drag on, but this is a special case. We had a special son that prompted the quickness of these results. So as of the Tyre Nichols family, please, please protest, but protest safely. Thank you.",
