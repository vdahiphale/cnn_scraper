They are calling it a limited ground operation. And Israel insists there will be no long-term occupation. But it has not provided a timeline for its offensive.The last time Israel forces entered Lebanon was back in 2006. Some 1,100 people died in that 34-day war. Israel's ground offensive defies pressure from the U.S. to reach a ceasefire. Just yesterday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart. Hours earlier, President Biden told reporters, we should have a ceasefire now. The White House is reaffirming Israel's right to defend itself but is warning of the real risk of mission creek (ph). This is all playing out, of course, as Israeli forces also targeted Syria's capital with drones and planes. CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson is in Northern Israel for us this morning. What have you been seeing and what else are you learning now that Israel has also struck Syria along with Lebanon and, of course, the war in Gaza is still ongoing?",

Why this could have such a big impact is there's really no practical alternative to the East and Gulf Coast ports for moving goods out of these ports to like basically the eastern half of the country.

These are empty. No one, though, is going to be picking them up and loading them because of the members on strike behind me right here. You have a couple hundred of them out here since early this morning. Then if you take a look over my left hand shoulder, those are the ports. Those are the docks. Those they are essentially closed, nothing going in, nothing going out. Now, Kate, this all comes down to money, wages, and job security. Many of the members behind me are holding signs saying just that. They want to make sure that they're getting paid appropriately, and they want to make sure their jobs are secure. Listen to the president of the ILA union just last month talking about what they're fighting for. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HAROLD J. DAGGETT, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL LONGSHOREMEN'S ASSOCIATION:  You got to draw the line. These companies that work in the maritime business come from overseas. Not one of them belongs to America. They want to come into America and build fully automated terminals and get rid of American jobs, good paying jobs that support families with medical, pensions, annuities, and pay taxes. They want to get rid of them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also going out, you have auto parts that are being shipped across seas, none of that happening right now. As for the Biden administration, they are monitoring this very, very closely. They say they are in touch with both sides. One thing that business leaders around the country and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is calling for is for President Biden to invoke the Taft Hartley Act. That is a way that he could -- that the president could potentially stop this strike. However, President Biden says he is not looking to do that right now. Kate?",

Vance, and that ultimately it's about tying Vance to former President Donald Trump and casting him as just as much of a risk.Now, the Vice President, she was in Las Vegas on Sunday where she said that she'd be cheering on Governor Walz.

They're collapsed, including his own store has collapsed. He's saying that it's 100 percent destroyed. Family members can't reach loved ones. Self-service is nonexistent.
