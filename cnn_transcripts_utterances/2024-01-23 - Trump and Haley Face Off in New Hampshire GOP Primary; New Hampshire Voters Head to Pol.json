Most likely, they will be breaking for Nikki Haley. And one of the things that that signals is that while Donald Trump has the base of the Republican Party locked up and that Trumpism is the ideology of the base of the Republican Party, it's not something that the rest of the country wants or is interested in.

And so we're going to be looking for that.And if Nikki Haley wins, we were just talking about this earlier, it will be a tectonic shift. Does that mean she has a path to the nomination? Probably not, because as we move into Super Tuesday, all of those states become winner-take-all and it'll be very tough mathematically to catch up to Donald Trump. But -- so what Democrats will be looking at is the margin. What does that mean? If the margin is large in terms of Donald Trump's victory, then, clearly, I think he has it -- you know, he's going to put it away. But if Haley is close and you look at how many independent voters, how many unaffiliated voters there are, it is going to point to a deficit and I think a weakness in Donald Trump's electorate or his supporters that we really aren't talking a whole lot about today. And if you go back to look at what happened in Iowa, you know, yes, he won overwhelmingly, percentage-wise, but almost half of Iowa voters who voted in the caucuses did not vote for him and the turnout was also really awful. And so I think all of those things point to perhaps weaknesses within Trump's support that we're going to be looking at.",

Think Ronald Reagan, right? Think Joe Biden, think Donald Trump. So, I don't necessarily know if the age argument is one that is going to stick. It's certainly not sticking within the Republican party. Where it is sticking, I think, for Nikki Haley, as part of this larger argument that she makes about stability in the midst of chaos and what I think works amongst independents is this argument about eight more years, right?Trump can only be president for four more years.
