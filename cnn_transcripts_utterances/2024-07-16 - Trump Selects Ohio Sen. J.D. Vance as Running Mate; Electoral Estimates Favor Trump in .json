There's no sort of -- people aren't saying, well, he was clearly this or he was clearly that there's we're getting a better understanding of him. But it is not -- it is not at all clear cut. It may be, like you said, that we never quite know what was going on in his head that would have tied whatever it was he was thinking to assassinating or trying to assassinate Donald Trump.And it may be only he knew. Right. And that is that is the challenge right now. I think what's clear is he was not part of any large network that was planning to bring down the former president. He wasn't radicalized into a group. This was what we, you know, a loner, someone who didn't have a community, someone who clearly didn't have support, who then use that status, use that those characteristics to, for whatever reason, try to kill Donald Trump.",

Vance is on record for in these sort of fever swamps you're talking about, that's not a campaigning choice, it's a governing choice. Except in one possible area, which is that he does have this tech bro background, and people like Peter Thiel, people have mentioned Elon Musk, there is -- I don't know if you'll understand, there's something that's happening in Silicon Valley where there is this sort of right- wing libertarian backlash to the so-called woke agenda, and those folks have been bubbling and bubbling trying to find a champion and a horse to ride. If they see J.D. Vance as that horse, there could be money behind it.

The Ohio senator has been a vocal opponent of sending aid to Ukraine and has said previously that Israel needs to, quote, finish the job in its war with Hamas. To discuss how a Trump-Vance ticket could impact foreign relations, let's turn now to CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. He joins us now live from London. So, Nic, what has -- what's being said, if anything, at this juncture about a Trump-Vance ticket and the impact on foreign policy? And what's been the overall reaction to that first day of the RNC?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we're not seeing too much reaction yet to the pick of J.D. Vance, but I think it's probably becoming absolutely clear to leaders here, whether it's the U.K., whether it's European Union leaders who gather in Brussels on occasion, that Donald Trump's pick here telegraphs perhaps the worst of scenarios that they might have imagined from a new Republican president at the beginning of next year because he reinforces those isolationist views and would not appear to want to hold Donald Trump back.You know, Europeans heard J.D. Vance when he was among them at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, February this year, and he was speaking very clearly. And he said, look, I'm telling you, you Europeans here because we're friends, not because, you know, I'm against you, but I'm saying this very, very clearly, we're not intending to pull out of NATO per se, we're not intending to abandon friends in Europe, but we are saying very clearly that we're going to pivot away towards Asia. And I think in context of everything else that he's had to say about Ukraine and the views on Russia, that this is looking much more like a scenario that is a worry for NATO and a worry for European leaders who really got all their support behind Ukraine and can see that dropping away. Vance has spoken about, you know, the amount of arms and ammunition that's needed to be manufactured to compete with Russia and Ukraine. Europe and the U.S. just isn't there. He's talked about throwing money into Ukraine, implying that it's essentially lost money. So that's the warning. When President Zelenskyy spoke about a Donald Trump presidency yesterday, he said, obviously, you know, this is all up to the people of the United States to choose. He said, it's something that we're not afraid of. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I think that if Mr. Donald Trump becomes president, we will work. I'm not afraid of this. Ukraine, we are in a war, we are emotional. And when there is uncertainty, and indeed, the Republican Party is different. I want to tell you that the majority of the Republican Party supports Ukraine and the people of Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's referred to as the election interference case in federal court. It has four accounts that include conspiracy and three others. In that particular instance Judge Chutkan has already entered an order denying this same motion. I don't see her changing her mind. Judge Cannon's opinion and her ruling holds no precedential value whatsoever to any other court. It doesn't have to be obeyed by anybody even within the Southern District of Florida. It's her opinion and her opinion alone. There have been circuit opinions, those are appellate court opinions, that have in fact upheld the appointment of special prosecutor and in fact the Supreme Court has allowed the special prosecutor to appear several times in front of them. Resultantly they have basically approved of the appointment and the standing and jurisdiction of Mr. Smith to represent the United States of America in this litigation. So it really doesn't mean anything for any other case. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
