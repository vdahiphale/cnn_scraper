Here's what's coming up. A conversation with premier television naturalists, David Attenborough, who's documented profound changes in our environment for seven decades. Also ahead, the American politician who put climate change at the top of the agenda. Walter Isaacson speaks to former U.S. vice president, Al gore. Plus, filmmaker Dan Edge documents the making of the climate cover-up in his frontline series, \"The Power of Big Oil.\" And, finally, how musical artist, Carole King, went from natural woman to natural activist. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The year 2022 will be remembered for a relentless torrent of climate mega disaster. In Pakistan, intense rain and unusually high heat led to devastating floods, killing more than 1500 people. In China, a one-two punch prolonged drought, followed by historic flooding leading hundreds of thousands displaced. And in the United States, Hurricane Ian decimated the Florida Coast with losses estimated at more than $50 billion. But in the face of these compounding challenges, today we celebrate those who refused to stand idly by. And we begin with Sir David Attenborough. The great naturalist and conservationist who has inspired generations to love the earth as he does. More than half a century after his production, the 96-year-old is still enlightening us, most recently with the BBC series \"Frozen Plant II\". Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, I've got enough video documentation of how it looked to me when I was in my early 30s and it was a different world altogether. I could see things that nobody else had filmed before, certainly. I could travel into places where hardly anybody had ever been before. It was a marvelous, pristine world and it was rich. And yet, of course, it was still being depreciated. Had I been there 50 years before that, I would have seen even a greater thing.

But the skies are so blue. The bird song is so loud and I can hear it over because there are no airplanes. I mean, I live quite close to London Airport. And normally I wouldn't be able to talk for longer than 90 seconds or so before a drone of an airplane came by. Now, it's an event to see an airplane in the sky and I can hear the bird song. So, it's -- and -- but also, the air is purer. And when you hear reports of fish coming back into Venice canals and so on, you realize the world is actually changing.

And when the government says, or whoever it is says, that threat has disappeared, will we have the strength of the mind then to say, OK, well, we won't use the highways as much as we did? We will stay at home if we can. I think that one of the changes that may well happen in the coming years is that actually people have discovered that you can work in this day and age with all our various devices. You can work very well from home. And there is no need to have to endure that dreadful journey packed into like sardines in tins into the -- going into the middle of the city. May be there will be a shift in the way we work. Now, if there is -- if that happened, that's because people prefer it that way. But do they -- when they prefer to say, oh, well, we don't -- we'll give up our overseas holidays. We don't need to travel as much as we want because we want to reduce the amount of noise in the atmosphere and in the skies or indeed, the carbon dioxide that we are wasting on traffic, on transport that we don't need.

When you started your first \"Blue Planet\" in the late '90s, wilderness was down to 47 percent. And now, it is 25 percent, barely 25 percent of our world. So, in your lifetime, it's gone from 66 percent wilderness to 25 percent. And it's gone from, I don't know, at that time, it must have been about 2 billion on the planet.

So - - but there were dense cities. Certainly, London was a city in which was -- there were over density of population was huge and people were dying in great numbers. So, it's not new. And anybody who knows anything about keeping animals, farmers know perfectly well and anybody else who looks after living creatures, if you keep them in great densities, the transmission of disease once it starts goes like wildfire and very difficult to control. Well, we are living in huge densities. You know, homo sapiens has increased in numbers, as you've just said, over three times as many as when I was making my first programs. It's extraordinary. So, it is not surprising that, in fact, we are getting the comeuppance from that point of view. But it's not nature having revenge or anything like that.

There is a coalition of 10 independent artificial intelligencegroups, data researchers, universities, NGOs, that have come together to use artificial intelligence and machine learning and sensor based on air, land and sea. And internet data streams to accurately identify all of the point source significant emissions of greenhouse gas pollution all over the planet. That has not been possible in the past because even though you can use satellites to look down at methane emissions, you can't see the whole Earth with the kinds of satellites that measure methane but you can't see it. With CO2, you're looking down through a column of air that's so enriched with CO2 that the so-called signal to noise ratio makes it impossible to just see it chemically. But if you use all the wavelengths and measure the infrared, heat signature, the smoke plumes, the ripples of water in the cooling pond, how many fan blades in the cooling fans are operating, the internet data streams, or the off take of electricity, and other sources of information. You can fit those together into a machine learning algorithm that are incredibly accurate in pinpointing where the pollution is actually coming from, exactly how much is coming from which, and what the trend is overtime. We get them from all the wavelengths from 300 existing satellites, from the U.S., Europe, Brazil, China, India, Germany, and Canada. We see the entire surface multiple times every day. And we can use all of that -- those different sources of information to really identify and track the emissions. But now, we can apportion it correctly. We found, for example, that the oil and gas industry has under reported their emissions. Their emissions are actually three times higher than what they have reported to the U.N. And the old saying, you can only manage what you can measure, applies here because most of the emissions come from countries that have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. Here's how they can do it. We can identify those sites precisely. And for companies that have pledged to get to net zero, we can show them how they can buy the same steel and the same amounts from a supplier that has one tenth of the global warming pollution of a supplier that they might be using now.

We've been deluge with incredible amounts of new data. And in the nature of machine learning, the more data, the more accurate it becomes. One other point, you can't -- they can't cheat with this.

And our story, over three films, tells really the story of what happened next and how the fossil fuel industry, chief amongst them, Exxon, managed to stave off any concerted action to tackle climate change over a 40-year period. So it really is the story of how we got to where we are today and the spectacular success that big oil had, particularly in the 1990s, in crafting a narrative, the consequences of which we're very much living today. That narrative is that -- was that the science of climate change was uncertain. And that narrative was that any attempt to tackle climate change would be prohibitively expensive. Now, there's lots wrong with both of those arguments, but they were enormously powerful. And we are living the consequences of those arguments right now in 2022.",

And Paul Bernstein, who we saw talking there, what he goes on to say is, of course, what we weren't taking into account -- and even then he knew he should be taking into account as an economist. What we weren't taking into account was the potential costs of not tackling climate change. And this is very much what we're living now in 2022, with a climate crisis all over the world, all over the United States. Costing billions and billions and billions of dollars.

And lots of the scientists like James Hansen who was the, sort of, godfather of climate science almost, or the grandfather of climate science. He told us how, sort of, naive he was, really, that he really believed, OK. Now, we found out a set of scientific facts and now public policy will follow. And it's been a sort of lifelong education in the reality of politics for him. But it really isn't that simple. I think we are in a different era now, though, and that's the fundamental fact that we are living through climate crises in a way that we weren't 15 years ago, and that's all over the world not just the United States. So, the reality of the science is really quite plain to see and the reality of the costs of not acting on climate change is really quite plain to see.
