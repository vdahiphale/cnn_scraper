With us now first, Nick Valencia, who I believe is outside the courtroom in Georgia, also our senior legal analyst, Elie Honig. And, Nick, we saw this play out.

And Sidney Powell, the piece that she was facing the most accusations in was related to Coffee County, relatively narrow part of this larger racketeering case. So there was really a situation there where, how would this trial go for the prosecutors? And now, clearly, there was enough reason for Sidney Powell to be motivated to take this deal, to agree to cooperate, and they will be able to use her guilty plea on these six charges of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with the performance of election duties. That's what the charge is called, but they also will be able to ask her about all of the other things, this entire racketeering conspiracy that she's accused of taking part in as she testifies very likely at this trial in the future against Donald Trump and others.",

First of all, she has to admit what she did. Second of all, she has to plead guilty, as we're seeing today. And, third of all, she has to be willing to testify. And it's so important to understand there's no such thing as halfway cooperation. If you're a prosecutor, you would not enter this deal into Sidney Powell unless you had been thoroughly convinced that, A, she is telling the truth, B, she is going to be able to testify for you credibly in a way you can put in front of a jury and justify, and, C, she's not going to be splitting hairs. And so if she's going to admit her involvement in the Coffee County scheme, as Katelyn laid out, she's also going to have to admit -- let's remember, she's also charged in the racketeering charge here, along with Donald Trump. So she's also going to have to admit that, yes, what we were doing was trying to steal this election. Yes, I knew it was illegal. Yes, it was, in fact a crime. All of that is in play for her testimony against all of the 17 other co-defendants here, including Donald Trump.",

There are six of them in Jack Smith's indictments. Rudy -- Sidney Powell, along with Rudy Giuliani, are two of the six. So, in Jack Smith's view, Sidney Powell was part of this conspiracy. And now we don't know whether there was any coordination between Fani Willis and Jack Smith here, but, if I'm Jack Smith, I'm picking up the phone, calling the DA down in Georgia, and I'm saying:  Hey, I see you guys have flipped Sidney Powell. We'd like to talk to her too, because if you believe that she's come clean and she's someone you could put on the stand, we, DOJ, Jack Smith, would absolutely be very interested in putting her on the stand in our case as well. She may have to work out a separate agreement with Jack Smith. She may have to plead guilty to something separately with Jack Smith.

But, even more importantly, strategically, Donald Trump and the other co-defendants in that Georgia case are going to get to see it all play out. That's going to be a real strategic advantage for them. And let's remember the DA here has said, my evidence as to any one of these 19 defendants, two of whom have now pled guilty, Sidney Powell and, previously, Scott Hall, but she said, my evidence as to any one of them is going to be essentially the same as my evidence as to all of them or any other of the defendants, meaning, when she tries Kenneth Chesebro starting in a couple of weeks, she's going to put on her entire case. Now, on the one hand, we will get to see that. That will be fascinating. We will learn a lot about what happened and what happened behind the scenes with Donald Trump. And he could well take on some damage in that respect. On the other hand, tactically, Donald Trump and the other co- defendants, they get to sit back and watch and take notes and prepare for their own defense somewhere -- somewhere on down the line.",

He was going to lose a third ballot.Now he's got at least a pause, an off-ramp, empowering Patrick McHenry to serve as some kind of temporary speaker pro tem until January, Lauren. I know there's a lot of Latin there, and it sounds complicated, but what exactly does that mean the House will and won't be able to do for the next two months? FOX:  Yes, I mean, just remember, right now, because McHenry is in an interim role that he was appointed to, the belief is that he did not have the power to bring any legislation to the floor of the House, not even a simple resolution saying that the House of Representatives supported Israel. In a bigger expanded role, he would be able to bring legislation to the floor of the House, essentially acting as any other speaker would. And that, again, is so essential, because that government funding deadline is coming November 17. That gives lawmakers less than a month to figure out what they're going to do. And even if they want to move forward with another short-term resolution, at some point, there will need to be a bigger conversation about how to fund the government for a longer period of time. And I will just note that Patrick McHenry was the architect of that deal that was cut between McCarthy and President Biden to increase the debt ceiling and set caps numbers, spending numbers, for a full year spending deal. And for the last several months, McHenry has been warning that, as the Republican Conference was having these internal squabbles over how they were going to fund the government, that his prediction was always they were going to end up back in that place of what was included in the debt ceiling deal. So, one of the big questions I have right now is, what are Democrats going to do? Are they going to support this resolution? They have openly signaled that they could be supportive, but, obviously, they want some assurances from McHenry that they are going to make sure the government remains open, that there's going to be some kind of promise on Ukraine aid and Israel aid. Obviously, given McHenry's ties to that debt deal back in May, Democrats have a lot of faith in him. But I think that that is one of the outstanding questions we still have right now, John.",

Obviously, a lot of new things developing here. As you just reported, Lauren, I want to make clear, Jim Jordan is still suggesting that he wants to be speaker and might give it another try in January.
