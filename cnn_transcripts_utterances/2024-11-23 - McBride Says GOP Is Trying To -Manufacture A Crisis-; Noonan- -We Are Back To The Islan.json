      "sentences": "LGBQ. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.The T was missing this week. We seem to have consensus on lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer or questioning rights in America. In 2015, the Supreme Court upheld same sex marriage in the Obergefell case, notwithstanding the occasional baker who refuses to bake a wedding cake for a same sex couple. I'd say by and large we've moved on from the debate surrounding same sex marriage. But the T in LGBTQ, as in transgender, has become the new cultural and political divide. As noted by the \"New York Times,\" the Trump campaign spent more than 37 million on television ads that invoke transgender issues, nearly 20 percent of its overall ad budget. That, according to data provided by Ad Impact, an organization that tracks political ad placement and spending. They would never have spent that kind of money without some confirmation that the message was resonating. In one of the election's most notable ads, the Trump campaign highlighted Kamala Harris embrace of transgender inmate access to taxpayer funded transitions. You'll remember the tagline Kamala is for they them. Trump is for you. It was the Willie Horton ad of the 2024 cycle. An analysis indicated that the Kamala is for they them ad shifted the race by 2.7 percentage points in favor of Trump after viewers watched it. The shift was particularly pronounced among suburban women and young male voters. But at the same time this cudgel was helping elect Donald Trump, something interesting was happening in Delaware. There, voters elected Sarah McBride, who'd become the nation's first trans candidate elected to a state Senate. Now as the nation's first transgender member of Congress. Enter Republican Nancy Mace, who we invited, by the way, to be on the program this week, she declined, but what she did do was introduce legislation to restrict capital restroom use to a person's biological sex. House Speaker Mike Johnson agreed. McBride stayed above the fray, saying she didn't run for Congress to fight about bathrooms. She also tweeted, \"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different from their own and engage with them respectfully. I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness.\" In Contrast to that grace, Nancy Mace went on the offensive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so the question is, do I have rights as a woman or not? And I'm not going to allow the media or Congress to strip away women's rights for 1/2 of 1 percent of people out there. That more than likely he's got a mental illness, and this is why he's doing this. He should not be forcing his private parts into women's private spaces. I'm absolutely a no hard pass on this. I'm going to fight it every step of the way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That moving speech delivered by President Ronald Reagan on the 40th anniversary of D Day, artfully written by his newest speechwriter at the time, Peggy Noonan. And just as Noonan masterfully captured the true essence of that moment, she's doing that with today's headlines in her columns at the Wall Street Journal. Which brings us to President Trump's transition picks. Pam Bondi replaced Matt Gaetz as Trump's attorney general nominee, the longtime Trump ally joining the ranks of some of his other and some controversial choices, all of them certainly offering our next guest with a wealth of content.Pointing out in the Wall Street Journal that some of these choices could backfire, she wrote this, \"We are back to the island of Misfit toys. What a mistake. Mr. Trump often confuses his own antic malice for daring, his own unseriousness for boldness. How amazing that in the rosy glow of election he will spend so much political capital and goodwill on confirmation fights he may well and certainly deserves to lose.\" Joining me now is Peggy Noonan, the Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the Journal, former speechwriter for Reagan, author of 10 books on American politics, history and culture. The very latest, an idea of America, a Collection of some of her columns. A idea, \"A Certain Idea of America.\" Third time's the charm. Peggy, it's great to have you back. The Pointe du Hoc speech you delivered, a commencement address at Notre Dame. And one of my favorite columns that you reprint in the book is a reference to that. What was the connection between the commencement address and the boys of Pointe du Hoc? PEGGY NOONAN, PULITZER PRICE WINNING COLUMNIST. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Oh, gosh. Well, I was thinking -- I met these fabulous young graduates at Notre Dame when I was there. I spent three days with all of them. And I thought, you know, they are entering life now. And we all, as we enter life and professional life and making whatever success we're trying for. In a way, you're like one of the kids, one of the Army Rangers at Pointe du Hoc, climbing up the cliff. You are part of something corporate. You are united with your unit, and yet you are on your individual climb, you know? So you're part of something larger, but you're competing with yourself and trying to do your very best.

And that same man is the only one who does not have the tools for successful governance. So I found it to be ironic, and we sort of had a little wrestling match about that.

Support what I think constructive, oppose what I think destructive, call it straight as I can, and take whatever follows.As someone once said, the real story of American life is where you stand and the price you'll pay to stand there.\" Beautifully written. I love that. I have a final question for Peggy Noonan. I most wanted to ask you this. What happened to the reverence for Ronald Reagan among Republicans? I thought of this during the convention. Everybody used to invoke his name. Everyone used to have him on a pedestal. He was the gold standard. I don't hear today's conservatives other than Peggy Noonan, you know, yearn for the Reagan of our time. Why? NOONAN: I think Republicans respect Reagan as much as they ever did. I think he's still a lodestar in their minds. I said Republicans, I really mean more and more simply Americans. Reagan is there as a significant and somehow deeply moving and impressive figure. But I think some, I would say some great fans and supporters of Donald Trump feel that it might help his rise a little bit to diminish the previous great man, so maybe don't mention the previous great man so much.
