CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: Well, well, first off, I'd like to respond to what the campaign said. It's not a campaign memo. There is no DeSantis campaign, the entire DeSantis campaign is being run by the never backed down super PAC. They've gotten all the people at the campaign fired that they didn't like, and now they're writing strategy memos and putting them on the internet where everybody can see them. Look, this just shows you. It's not easy to run for president, everybody. And if you can't run for president in a way that doesn't create embarrassing process stories, you know, multiple times a week, you certainly can't run the White House and run the federal government or be trusted to sit across from President Xi, or Vladimir Putin, or Kim Jong-Un.

Bill Barr said that yesterday that that's what he was told, not only by Bill Barr, his attorney general and other members of the Justice Department. But he was told that by his White House counsel as well, Pat Cipollone, he should have listened to those words, and maybe he wouldn't be under indictment in four jurisdictions today. And he wouldn't be putting the country through this. He's not doing this for us. He is doing this because he can't help himself.

Let me say this, Poppy, out of that beating Joe Biden, I don't want Joe Biden and Kamala Harris back in office; I think they've been a disaster. And so, we got to have someone who can beat them, and Donald Trump cannot beat him on the person. By the way, when I ran for re-election in New Jersey, I won with 61 percent of the vote in one of the blue states in America, and did so by winning 51 percent Hispanic vote, 29 percent of the African American vote, and over 70 percent of the independent vote.

And all of us knew that when Joe Biden went crazy with his spending, even Larry Summers said that it was going to create big inflation.And it did, and it left the fed with no choice but to raise interest rates in order to bring that inflation back under control. Because inflation is the hidden tax that kills every family in this country, when they go to the gas station, to the supermarket, to pay for their educational costs, to pay for clothing for their kids, that's the pain Americans are still feeling now. And poppy, you know, we've seen gas prices go up 30 cents in the last 10 days a gallon, while people are trying to get in their last bit of maybe a little bit of a vacation before school starts. This is a tax that really hurts those folks and may make it unaffordable. That's Bionomics. And, you know, 7 percent mortgage interest rates where the mortgages are now $1,300 a month more than they were when a month than when Joe Biden became president. If that's Bionomics, he can keep it. And so, I think Jerome Powell has done exactly what he needed to do, in terms of trying to bring inflation back under control, which is hurting the American people.

So with COVID specifically, if you test then isolation is zero to five days. So really five days after a positive test, that's how long you have to isolate. Now, one quick caveat there, I think we can put this up, if you will. One quick caveat is that if you have symptoms, and then you test like a couple of days into your symptoms, your isolation actually begins on the first day of your symptoms. OK, that makes sense.",

If you're under the age of 60, before Halloween, you should get your flu shot. Late September for COVID, that's when that new booster is expected to come out. It is not an exact match for what is currently circulating dominantly circulating in the country, but it's still good protection, especially for people who are vulnerable. You don't need to worry about RSV if you're under the age of 60, same guidance for those over the age of 60.

After a police officer admitted to withholding evidence, a detective under oath on the stand had a videotaped interrogation, a witness statement with that victim that never turned over to the defense or the prosecution.Now, the judge granting that motion for a mistrial that came from a defense attorney for the defendants Brandon and Gregory Case, the white father and son who are charged with attempted murder. They were accused of chasing and shooting at Gibson, a black FedEx driver who was making deliveries on a dead end road one evening in January 2022. Gibson says he was wearing the FedEx uniform, but he was in a Hertz Rental van when a white pickup truck came behind him blowing the horn. Gibson said he tried to get out of the way that's when he saw a man with a gun and the pickup truck trying to block him in. He says that he heard several shots and then felt shots on the van there that he was driving and the pickup truck chased him out of the neighborhood to the interstate. Gibson spoke to CNN and said that even though this happened a year and a half ago, it feels like it's been a lifetime of waiting. And now he has to start all over again. He says he feels like this was intentional. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D'MONTERRIO GIBSON, FEDEX DRIVER WHO SAYS DEFENDATS SHOT AT HIM: Is definitely a screw up. He's not the first one to do hey, and then with my case, in other cases, it's just like due to negligence on the part. I feel like I'm not going to say everything was purposely done, but just like a lot of incompetence in a police department, you know, for them to not turn off a certain piece of it.
