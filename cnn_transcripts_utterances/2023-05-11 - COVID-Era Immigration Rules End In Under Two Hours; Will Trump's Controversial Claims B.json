Welcome to CNN TONIGHT. In less than two hours, the Trump-era policy that quickly turned away many migrants at the southern border will expire and thousands of desperate men, women and children who have already made a dangerous journey over hundreds of miles will attempt to enter the U.S. Border Patrol are bracing for a surge. And the effects are spreading to cities as far away as Denver and New York. CNN is live at the southern border in just a moment. Plus, the things Donald Trump said to Kaitlan Collins last night and to the CNN town hall audience. Some could get him into some legal trouble and why E. Jean Carroll may sue him again. Our panel has thoughts on this. And the man who put Jordan Neely in a failed chokehold on a New York City subway is expected to be charged with manslaughter tomorrow. We'll tell you what's next in that case. But let's begin with what's happening on the southern border tonight. You're about to look at El Paso, Texas. That's where about 1,500 migrants have been processed in the last 48 hours. The chief of Border Patrol says roughly 1,000 people, including families, are still waiting. The mayor of El Paso says, quote, we can't continue to do this for eternity. Let's bring in my panel. We have Caitlin Dickerson from The Atlantic, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the Trump family separation policy, also L.Z. Granderson is back from the Los Angeles Times, we have the former Senate Candidate Joe Pinion back with us and attorney Raul Reyes, who writes with CNN Opinion. Also joining us from El Paso is CNN's Ed Lavandera. Let's start there, Ed. So, we're less than two hours away from this policy ending. What are you seeing on the ground at this hour?",

And they're essentially waiting in that space between the Rio Grande and the border fence. And that is where they have been kept for several days now. And those people are being processed by Border Patrol officials here on the ground. We heard from the chief of the Border Patrol today saying that number was about 2,500. So far, they've processed about 1,500. So, there're still about 1,000 left to go that are in there. But there are still a number of people and it is very hard to quantify just how many are on the other side of the border trying to get here. And that's the question, the real question about how this will look like in the coming days.",

So, this is different and it sounds like something that, you know, President Trump might have wanted to try. So, it presumes that migrants are ineligible for asylum in the U.S. if they did not first seek lm in a country they passed through like Mexico, if found ineligible, they could be removed through expedited removal and barred from re-entering the U.S. for five years.

The Biden administration likes to say that this policy, that their policy is different because it does contain certain exceptions and loop holes, but those are very small. Those are small. It's not a huge difference.Why that policy is so problematic is because he's basically -- the administration is basically trying to outsource our asylum problem, our problem at the border, to Mexico and other countries in Central America. And if we can't handle this large influx of people at the border, what makes anyone think that, say, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, any of these countries along the way can do it and it is also very legally problematic. Because a president can set immigration policy but no policy can change immigration law and asylum is written into the laws established by Congress, and it requires physical presence in the United States just to make the application. So, he's trying to outsource the problem to Central America. That is sort of an executive overreach into something that needs to be settled by Congress.",

I think irrespective of your political sensibilities, this is an administration that came in and said that they wanted to get rid of the remaining Mexico policy. They said that they wanted to see Title 42 overturned. And they said that the border was completely under control. They had a DOJ that sued the state of Arizona for erecting those temporary barriers with shipping containers to try to stem this tide of immigration.And now what do we have? We have the mayor of New York City declaring a state of emergency for the migrant crisis, the mayor of Chicago declaring a state of emergency. Those are not Republican bastions. That is a direct result of a Biden administration that went out of their way to contravene Trump policies without actually having a plan that recognized the human lives that would be destroyed if they didn't actually implement a sound blueprint for how to actually keep people on the road to their American dreams or in the safety as they flee oppression abroad.",

And I think to Raul's point, replacing it with another band-aid isn't going to make a difference.I've seen this time and time and time again, literally stemming back to 9/11. And here's the latest example. Prior the Title 42, actually, illegal crossings were very low. Most people crossing the border were turning themselves over to agents, requesting asylum. Title 42 took asylum off the table. Now, you see illegal crossings increasing. Why is that? In part it's because of a massive demand for labor in the United States that we're not acknowledging. And so to your point, I just want to add a little bit additional context. In New York City, where I live, where a lot of us live, very busy now, very overwhelmed, certainly. At the same time, sources of mine who are running these shelters where people are living say every single one of them are employed. They're going to work every single day in jobs in New York. So, these band-aid solutions are not going to be more powerful than the forces that are pushing people to the United States, instability abroad, climate change, conflict, lack of safety, nor are these band-aids going to change the powerful, powerful draws and the vast number of jobs that are unfilled and that these migrants are very eager to fill.",

I've asked members of Congress. So, the moment when family separation was the biggest, really, story globally on immigration in the United States, was one where Republicans and Democrats in Congress, for once, were saying the exact same thing. The House Freedom Caucus and Nancy Pelosi, everybody in between was saying that family separation needs to be outlawed.And yet what I've reported since then on why family separation hasn't been outlawed, what I've heard is, well, no president would ever bring that back. Someone actually just asked me that in the hallway moments ago. There's no way family separation would come back, is there? Former President Trump just said on national television that he would be willing to bring family separations back. And if you call any of his top White House aides from when he was in office, they'll tell you the exact same thing. So, the threat of family separations returning is very real and it has not been taken seriously for some reason. And people ask about whether the Biden administration would turn to family separations. I don't think so based on the language that you've heard from the Biden administration, both during family separation prior to Biden taking office and then now. But almost all the restrictions that the Trump administration imposed short of family separation are either in place now or have been debated under President Biden. So, we're a very, very far cry from the summer of 2018 when Biden, who wasn't president at the time, talked about this as a crime against humanity. They've really come a long way here.",

And I think when we see these pictures of people at the border, so much suffering, it did not have to be this way for a couple reasons. One is DHS has continually asked Congress for additional resources and funding and Congress has said no. And, second of all, the Biden plan, when Title 42 was phased out in December, they wanted to do a gradual phase, sort of wind it down maybe by sectors or across the span of a few months. The GOP, Arizona, Texas, and several Republican attorneys general, they got a federal judge to agree to prevent any type of gradual phasing out of this and got him to insist that it happen all at once, therefore, causing more chaos, more confusion.
