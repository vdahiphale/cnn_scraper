Including racial adversity, and that is something that colleges and universities can take into account.The president reaffirming at the end there saying this three times that discrimination still exists in America and that this ruling certainly does not change this, nor should efforts to try and combat discrimination, including in colleges and universities.

In the courtroom, it was just the opposite.Chief Justice John Roberts speaks first. He says this as the opinion of the court. He had a bit of a defiant tone. This has been something he's been long seeking. He has long argued against any kind of race-conscious screening of students for colleges and universities. He's actually been against any kind of racial remedies across the board. And what he said was that history precedents, all say that time is done for these programs. And even what he allowed is either, OK, students may speak of race in you know -- for example, admissions essays. But he said, what we're saying directly should not be -- should not be fought indirectly. The regimes we are reversing and -- I mean, that was the clear message. Even if they don't want to say it out loud in the written opinion, this is over. They don't want anything going on in the shadows, as he said. And then after he spoke, Clarence Thomas, who started by saying that he rarely reads anything from the bench, went on about how stigmatizing, how dangerous racial preferences, as he called them have been, even to Blacks and Hispanics, and he highlighted the Asian American students who this case was brought on behalf of. And said this is a zero-sum game. Finally, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the nation's first Latina justice talked about how troubling the majority's ruling was. She said it was profoundly wrong. She spoke on behalf of herself. Justice Elena Kagan, and the court's first African American female, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who, during all these 50 minutes of high drama just stared straight out at the spectators and just -- you know, just seemed to be quite tense and stone-faced in the face of what was happening here.",

But he created this group, Students for Fair Admissions, after failing with a young white woman, Abigail Fisher, who had brought a case against the University of Texas at Austin. That case had gone on from essentially 2012 to 2016 when the Supreme Court upheld the University of Texas at Austin's program.And an earlier set of conservatives had tried with, again, white students suing, and those cases had been rejected but the timing of this challenge to this newly conservative court and using Asian Americans. Asian American students were not named in the lawsuit. They did not testify publicly at all. But this group was able to bring a suit on behalf of Asian Americans who felt that programs that traditionally had favored blacks and Hispanics squeezed them out. So, essentially, we're pitting minority group against minority group. And as I said, that had much more salient for the justices. In fact, Clarence Thomas, when he started his dissent from -- his concurrence from the bench, talked about Asian Americans as if they had been as hurt by these programs as blacks and Hispanics. And actually, he always thought that blacks and Hispanics were hurt not benefited from these programs.",

Because it's not an accident when parties before the Supreme Court or when groups litigating before the Supreme Court choose their plaintiffs or choose the folks bringing suits very deliberately. And I think that was the case here and setting up a -- whether you want to call it tension or opposition, whatever term you wish to use, between Asian students and black students was I think, quite deliberate and powerful to see. Because there's still a person of color, a person of a minority group, however, you want -- you want to define it.One other point I would make about today, and I think that the term or the expression, elections have consequences is a little bit of a platitude. But the simple fact is you are seeing the greatest success by all means of Donald Trump in his presidency and working with the Senate leadership, particularly Mitch McConnell over the period of those years. This was sort of both between the affirmative action decision today in a series of abortion decisions recently. You will feel the reverberations for decades. And regardless of whatever happens, the former president and the legal issues you and I have talked about many times on this program, regardless of what happens there, his imprint as a president, as the nominator of judges, is set.

David, thank you so much for being with us.Interpreting the inner workings of the Kremlin, the intrigue, and the power struggles, it's almost sort of an art form. I'm wondering beyond all the rumors and speculation. What do you imagine is happening right now? Should we anticipate another purge? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Victor, good to see you. And, you know, they call it Kremlinology for a reason because it was hard in the Soviet era, and it's hard in the Putin Russia era. We know a couple of things. You know, a week ago, we would have said that Putin's control over his own military was, you know, complete and total. We now know that there is suspicion about one very senior general, as we've just discussed, and it would be hard to imagine that he would be the only one. Putin is also going to be worried about the fact that when the -- when the uprising began, the Wagner forces made it down to 150 -- 125 miles from Moscow without any real significant opposition from the Russian military. Now, we don't know if that's because they were cooperating, because they were ignorant, because they are all decided to take a lunch break at that convenient time, but that's what happened. We also know that when he did take over the military operation center close to Ukraine, there were pictures of him having coffee with the Russian commanders there. So, it's not entirely clear that the Russian military was completely on Putin's side until it became evident that this wasn't going to work. And that Prigozhin was not going to go all the way to Moscow.",

But then suddenly, Putin in his speech yesterday was talking about how much money the Russians had actually given to the Wagner group for catering, for other work, and suggested that there may be investigations into whether there was corruption or fraud and all of that. Some people hear and you know read that as an indication that maybe they were looking to get them on other charges that wouldn't be covered by the deal that was put together over the weekend.",
