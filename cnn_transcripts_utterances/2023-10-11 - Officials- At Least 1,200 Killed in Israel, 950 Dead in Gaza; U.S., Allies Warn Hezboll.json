CNN got a first-hand look at an Israeli community center near the Gaza border, where Hamas butchered innocent civilians, including women, toddlers and babies.

And these are some of those Israeli forces that you just heard about massing. What we see here are armored tanks. We see armored personnel carriers. And we counted just along this one ridge about 15 bulldozers. And heavy bulldozers, obviously. Military bulldozers. And obviously, that's significant in the context of where we are: three miles from the Gaza border. An ominous sign of what a ground invasion would look like and what it would really entail, when you talk about 2 million people so densely packed on the other side of that border. And as we were here, you know, an air strike that we heard, one where we literally ducked for cover as we heard it. As we're standing here pausing within a few seconds, up to 20 people in Gaza were killed in that air strike. So that's what's literally going on at this moment. Very active. And of course, just a few miles from here in Sderot (ph) where Nic Robertson has been; obviously very active there, too, as well, with a lot of sirens and rockets incoming.",

The IDF announcing just hours ago that it struck what it called a Hamas advanced detection system for aircraft, as well as bank branches Hamas has allegedly used to fund terrorism and other sites. All of this happening while, as Erin was just reporting, Israeli troops amass during the Gaza border. Joining us now is CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, we've seen, over the course of the last several days, I think, the ramping up of these air strikes. Obviously, the building up of Israeli troops on the border. What does this mean in terms of preparations for what could be an incursion that does not have any precedent, based on this conflict? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Phil. This is actually going to be quite -- quite something, because the type of incursion that we're looking at here is one that could conceivably affect everything right in here. And what I mean by that is this. Let's take a look and put some troops out, out in this area right here. This is really what you're going to be seeing in these areas. And when you -- when you see some of these areas right here in Gaza, you're going to be finding a very difficult area for them to get into. And as Erin was talking about, you've got a lot of different -- different areas in which the Israelis are going to be responding to each of these -- these areas. And you've got, really, a response that is calculated to, I think, eliminate a lot of what Hamas' fighting capability is. When we see that, we'll know it.

Here's what Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said about this just yesterday.

It wasn't the most impassioned speech that President Biden has ever given, maybe on any subject. It was certainly the most impassioned speech that any president has given in history about the relationship between the United States and Israel. I was actually shocked. I've known Biden for many years. And I know that he's deeply concerned about the state of Israel. He loves the state of Israel. He comes here and describes himself as a Zionist, but that's far beyond it. He connected Israel's pain to his personal pain of the loss of family members. He went far further than I thought was possible in the American political context and say, We're going to use American force. That's really quite extraordinary. And to say he was going to work with a largely dysfunctional Congress to get aid for Israel. It was point after point after point that I really have never heard anything like it. But to get to Kim's point, there were also some messages behind -- behind the text. And one of them was, we expect -- you have a green light to go ahead and enter Gaza in a ground invasion, but we expect you -- you, the Israelis -- to act according to international law, to the degree that you can.
