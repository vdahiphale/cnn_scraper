Here is what we know. Two people were killed in that blast. It's unclear where the missile was fired from and why it fell on Poland. But officials say it was Russian-made. Russia has denied responsibility and says it had no targets in the area. An investigation is already underway. Poland has raised its military alert status and summon the Russian ambassador for an explanation. It's also considering invoking NATO's Article 4, which would trigger talks with the alliance's decision making body. CHURCH (on camera): The deadly blast in Poland also set off a storm of diplomatic activity. In the coming hours, NATO will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels. CHURCH (voice over): U.S. President Joe Biden met with G7 and NATO leaders before he left the G20 summit in Indonesia. The group released a statement offering their full support to Poland, and promising to stay in close touch regarding next steps. Mr. Biden strike a cautious tone while speaking with reporters.

      "sentences": "Right. And Nina, Russia is denying it fired this missile into Poland, or what is the latest on Russia's reaction?NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, Rosemary, the latest comes from the Russian Federation's representative to the United Nations that essentially has reiterated Moscow's earlier denial of having any involvement in this missile incident on Polish territory. DOS SANTOS (voice over): The Russian representative to the U.N. said earlier in a statement that this was an attempt to provoke a direct military clash between NATO and Russia. And they've also made it clear that this issue is likely to dominate and certainly be brought up by Russia as well at the U.N. Security Council meeting that will be taking place in New York later on today. But, of course, before that U.N. Security Council meeting that will take place in a few hours from now, we're going to have the meeting that will take place in Brussels with those members of NATO that Kevin was talking about collectively meeting to discuss where to proceed from here, given the gravity -- DOS SANTOS (on camera): The potential hypothetical gravity of this situation, but also the fact that, as the Dutch prime minister pointed out earlier on, none of this would have happened if there wasn't an invasion of Ukraine in the first place. So, the confusion, as Kevin was saying arises, largely because obviously, as post-Soviet states, both Ukraine and Russia use Russian made missiles, in particular, an S-300 missile and missile defense system. And the question is whether or not this might have been a missile that might have drifted over the border into NATO territory. That will be the type of thing that they'll be discussing. What might help to firm up exactly where this missile came from, and, by the way, you heard, obviously, the U.S. president address reporters saying that early indications appear, it may have come not from Russia, but indeed from Ukraine. Although he was cautious in his language, there is a caveat that is that NATO appears to have been monitoring all of these missiles, because, of course, Ukraine was being hit by a barrage of Russian missiles yesterday. So, they have apparently some intelligence on where this missile came from. But, as yet, they haven't been clear on exactly what they know, just now. Rosemary?",

Why are we talking about this two years before presidential election? It's simply exhausting. But I do imagine that Donald Trump will inspire what he inspired in 2020, which is historic voter turnout. It was the highest turnout this century, the highest turnout since the 1960s. Nearly two thirds of voters turned out to vote. And that's about a 10-point bump over typical presidential elections. And people were not voting for Joe Biden, he was just fine. He doesn't really inspire Democrats. If you look at polls. People were turning out to vote against Donald Trump. So, if Trump is the nominee, I expect really high turnout. And if he's not the nominee, I expect that DeSantis will be pretty bloody by the end of the primary battle.",

But it clearly appears that Mitch McConnell has more than enough votes to be the Republican leader in the Senate.And I know some of them are trying to say that some of his challenges are trying to suggest that somehow the problem was that Republicans in the Senate didn't have an agenda to run on. Well, the truth is these midterm elections are always about the party in power, and the president of the party in power. It's really not so much about the agenda of the party out of power. And so, I think some of the folks who are challenging McConnell right now, are trying to deflect blame from cells, because they were too close to the, you know, to the election denial movement, you know, just too close to too much of the excesses of Donald Trump, and frankly, too supportive of too many of these candidates who the American people rejected, because they were seen as too extreme. Republicans lost the election, not because of Mitch McConnell, but because of the Dobbs' decision. Donald Trump's unhelpful interventions into these primary contests that nominated these unfit candidates. And also, again, the election denial -- the election denialism, and you're looking back at 2020. So, it's a bunch of reasons why Republicans lost. I would say, those are the biggest reasons and probably most, especially the Dobbs' decision on abortion.",

And we should expect to see like a lot of, you know, investigations of Hunter Biden, and these sorts of partisan investigations, which Republicans are fond of doing. And sometimes Democrats will see a lot of that. But what you'll also see is Kevin McCarthy, having to capitulate to the extremists in his party, the Freedom Caucus and others, simply because he has so little leeway, because he won't have much of a majority. And he also has to pitch to the center. He has to keep everyone happy. That is an impossible job. And it is one that he may not hold in January because he actually needs to garner 218 -- sorry, yes, 218 votes, not the 188 he has now. Once they get back in session, he needs everyone together. And that means something along the lines of what he's already done, which has gone with his, you know, head in his -- in his hat and his hand and going and apologizing to folks who he was critical of post-January 6th.

So, that's number one. Number two, I would like to stress as well that some time ago, in August, when there was a real threat that Russians would attack or cause some provocation on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Some U.K., as well as U.S., politicians and congressmen have said back then, that if Russia conducted an attack on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, this could be interpreted by the NATO, even though it would be in Ukraine, but because of the contamination, because of this threat of the radiation -- possible spread of the radiation to the European countries, this could be interpreted as an Article 5 of NATO, as a trigger for that article.

The team had to address critical radar issues and a hydrogen fuel leak shortly before the launch window opened. It was a third attempt to launch this rocket, the most powerful one NASA has ever built.The first phase of the Artemis mission is an un-manned test flight. And the ultimate goal is to return astronauts to the moon and someday send humans to mars. And I'm joined now by CNN's space and defense correspondent, Kristin Fisher, who is at the Kennedy Space Center. Great to see you, Kristin. And you are not far from where the Artemis launched last hour. We actually video of the moment it launched and your reaction is priceless. So, we want to just bring that up for a moment.",

And, of course, you know, we have sent probes and rovers and uncrewed spacecrafts to the moon since the Apollo days. But what is different is, you know, this spacecraft is designed to carry humans.

So, that is going to be a six-month one-way trip. So, you know, we have a lot to were along the way and we'll do it one step at a time.
