Germany reverses course and promises 14 tanks to Ukraine. In any moment now, President Biden will pledge to add American battle tanks too, that prompts a dramatic warning from Russia. Well, red lines are a thing of the past.Plus, he did it too. The president's allies see a classified discovery at Mike Pence's house as a political gift to defuse a three-week long White House crisis. And retribution on Capitol Hill. The House Speaker Kevin McCarthy refuses to seat a pair of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. Next up, an attempt to remove another democratic lightning rod from the panel that oversees foreign policy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Eric Swalwell be in the private sector and can't get a security clearance there. We are not going to provide him with the secrets to America.

The president made a very important announcement today that will change the battlefield in Ukraine, announcing the United States prepared to send 31 of its most sophisticated tanks, the M1 Abrams tank to Ukraine. That will take months.The president also saying though, this is being done in conjunction with a quicker delivery. German tanks will make their way to the Ukrainian battlefield as well. And with the muscle came a message from the president of United States. He said, Vladimir Putin's calculation all along, has been that the Western Allies would quote, crumble in time, the president saying (audio blip) Germany, the other allies will stay in this fight, as long as it takes. let's get some discussion here. With our experts beginning at the White House, CNN's Jeremy Diamond is there. Jeremy on the way out, the president was asked if the Germans changed his mind. This was a diplomatic, difficult diplomatic situation for the president, is that the German tanks can get there sooner, but the Germans wanted American tanks on the ground as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. And while the president, his response there was to say that we want to make sure that we're all together. He repeatedly stressed this idea of unity. The subtext, of course of this discussion of unity is the fact that Germany made very clear to the United States that it didn't want to send their own tanks to Ukraine, unless the U.S. also sent its tanks. They wanted - Germany wanted to make sure that the United States had some skin in the game here as well.And so ultimately, it's very clear that the U.S. decision to send these 31 M1 Abrams tanks was in effect designed to ensure that Germany would send its tanks, which will arrive there much sooner. And also, so that Germany would authorize the export of German tanks owned by other countries to Ukraine as well. And so that's why we're hearing the president. And we've also heard a number of senior administration officials, talking about this idea of unity, making sure that the alliances stayed together. And that's what they did here. We also heard President Biden talk about the fact that this is going to help improve Ukrainian capabilities. We know that there have been so many stalemates in recent weeks and months there, and these tanks will help them with their maneuverability. And that's also key here as you look at the decision to send these tanks and the German tanks as well.",

Sam, President Zelenskyy for some time has said, I need tanks on the battlefield. Tanks by their very nature or more an offensive weapon. Yes, you can use them to defend territory, but they are meant to maneuver to reclaim or to take territory. Is that the next chapter in this war once the tanks arrive?",

      "sentences": "Well, the Ukrainians have made no secret of their strategic agenda, which is to drive the Russians out of their territory in their entirety. And that'll include the Crimean Peninsula. Now that at the moment is something, not quite a pipe dream, but definitely a distant dream.What they're really trying to fixate on at the moment is making sure that they still have the sort of momentum that they showed over the summer with those lightning advances, recapturing large amounts of territory around Kharkiv. And then in the autumn we saw, in the fall we saw the capture of Kherson, the recapture of Kherson. Since then, the battlefield is somewhat stalled, winter has come. And most importantly, they have begun to run out of the heavy armor that is so important in prosecuting a war of maneuver. Where they have the edge over the Russians is in terms of their motivation and battle skills. A lot of that comes from NATO, where they've changed the doctrine for the Ukrainians, putting to use these heavy pieces of weaponry that the Russians like to dig in and use as almost artillery. Whereas you see a much more kind of swashbuckling approach coming from the Ukrainians, which is consistent with their NATO training. Now they are experts at driving tanks and using the tank. So, it won't take them that long, particularly with the Leopard tanks to get up to speed and get them used on the battlefield. These are not going to be driven by soldiers who need to learn how to use tanks in war, they just need to learn how to drive those Leopards, and later on the Abrams and the Challenger. But the other very important thing indeed is it technologically that way in advance of anything that the Russians can field. And although, the Ukrainians are saying they need 300, by our internal estimates, we're guessing at around 90 have been pledged so far. There is about still a two-thirds to be made up, which they're hoping to be fulfilled later on.",

And that's on top of all the new systems, you already need to train them on the U.K. Challenger tanks, the German Leopard tanks, U.S. Paladin howitzer is the Patriot missile system.So, it's not a rush to get these to the front of the other systems, and Germany's Leopard tanks are their priority. But Biden did say they would begin training Ukrainian forces on the Abrams to make sure that when they're ready to go, Ukrainians can use them immediately when they arrive in country. John?",

You wrote a fantastic piece about the strategic implications of this for CNN, that's on the internet. I urge everybody to go to cnn.com and read it.You say this, among other things. It is a momentous decision, partly because these are not defensive weapons. They are intended to hit Russia's troops hard in a ground offensive. They are unequivocally about Ukraine retaking territory. This is a new and fierce and it portrays a NATO unafraid. This is it's helped for Zelenskyy that his long asked for, but this is as the president United States just said, a message to Vladimir Putin, you thought we would blank, you thought we would crumble, just the contrary.",

And both are saying that this is - what this is about.Now with Ilhan Omar, the representative from Minnesota, that's a little different, that does have to go through a House vote situation. The question now is, does McCarthy have those votes of Republicans? There are a handful of Republicans who are saying, they were not comfortable voting on that, to kick her off of that committee. There was also one Republican who is - he is in Florida right now going through, I guess, rehabilitation from an injury, and he may not be on the House floor to vote. So, there is a question right now of if that will be successful, but of course, it's just a lot of politics.",
