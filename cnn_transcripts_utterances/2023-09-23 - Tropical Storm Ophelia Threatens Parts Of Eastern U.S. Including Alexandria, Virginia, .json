      "sentences": "So we just got the latest update in from the National Hurricane Center. Winds are now down to 45 miles per hour, still tropical storm strength. Those wind gusts still up around 60 to 65 miles per hour. But notice the scope of this storm. You talk about the center of the storm is still over areas in North Carolina but those rain bands extend well off to the north. It's raining right now across portions of New York, New Jersey, even Massachusetts from some of these outer bands.With that said, the heaviest rain is still mainly focused across portions of Virginia and North Carolina. You have got some pretty heavy bands making their way across portions of Raleigh right now. But you're also starting to see them spread farther north into places like New Jersey, Delaware. And that is going to be the general trend as we go through the next 24 hours. You have got flood watches in effect for several states here, and also that red color indicating flash flood warnings. That does include the city of Raleigh and then communities off to the east. Basically, the concern there is they have already had two or three inches of rainfall. They're still and anticipating an additional one or two inches on top of what they've already have, so there is the concern for continued flooding in that region. By the time we get to tonight, the bulk of the rain really is going to be focused more over the mid-Atlantic region. And then by the time we get into early Sunday morning, now the bulk of the rain is really positioned over portions of the northeast. So if you live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, it is going to be several more hours before you really start to see an end to that rain. So flooding potential both days, today and tomorrow, just two separate areas. Today the focus is really going to be mainly across Virginia and North Carolina. Overnight tonight and into tomorrow that transitions and focuses more across the northeast, specifically Pennsylvania, New Jersey, portions of New York as well as Connecticut. So again, rainfall there, most of these areas likely to pick up about two to four inches, but some spots could pick up five or even six inches total before this system finally exits. And it will exit, and it's going to also continue to weaken as it moves off to the north and then eventually out towards the east as it pushes out into the open Atlantic. But that is still going to be about 24 to 36 hours from now. So you will continue to see those wind beginning to calm down every few hours that we go past, but they peaked at pretty impressive amounts. Cape Lookout, North Carolina, topping out at 73 miles per hour. But even other states, it's not just there. Seattle, New Jersey, topping out at 68 miles per hour, and other states and locations still having pretty significant high wind reports up around those 50 and 60 mile per hour ranges. Storm surge, we're starting to see some of those have already peaked for the day, especially across North Carolina. But as you go farther north, we have got high tide coming for some of these area either imminently in the next hour or some of them in the next two or three hours. So you're going to still continue to see, Fred, some of those water levels begin to rise as we approach that high tide, especially for areas of Maryland, Delaware, as well as New Jersey.",

What's telling is behind me, you see some of those decorative palm trees flailing in the wind. But perhaps what's the most telling is if you look just off Jersey Shore you can see those wind whipped waves. And it really speaks to that potential for deadly rip currents, which is why officials here have actually locked up the gates for beach access. We have seen one determined individual on the other side of those gates.But for the large part, most folks here in New Jersey are choosing to ride out the storm indoors. In fact, most of the businesses here on the boardwalk are closed. There's one pizza joint right in front of me that said they've actually been serving pizza since 1950, so this storm isn't going to stop them. So they're still open for business. But again, just saw one individual behind me, very few folks. For the most part people have decided to stay in. I will say that in terms of flooding, we have not seen any significant flooding yet. But again, it's all about the wind. We have been in worse conditions, but it doesn't take much to topple some of those power lines, and then you end up with a potentially deadly situation of course with power outages. So that is really what we are monitoring here in New Jersey as the conditions will continue into today, and potentially, as you just heard from Allison, into tomorrow as well.

The government is saying, it is railing against the Biden administration, saying border communities are overwhelmed and overrun by the large number of migrants arriving there and calling the situation a crisis. Governor Abbott announced he has directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to deploy additional buses to the border cities of Eagle Pass and El Paso. The purpose is transporting immigrants to what Abbott calls self-declared sanctuary cities, which are municipalities mostly run by Democrats. Abbott said last year Texas has bussed nearly 12,000 migrants to our nation's capital, nearly 15,000 to New York, and an additional 8,700 to Chicago.In a statement Abbott said the following, \"Until President Biden upholds his constitutional duty to secure America's southern border, Texas will continue to deploy as many buses as needed to relieve the strain caused by the surge of illegal crossings.\" Meanwhile, the Biden administration has announced several steps being taken to address the situation, including the deployment of 800 active-duty military personnel, adding capacity to border facilities, and continuing to conduct deportation fights. The problem, Fred, goes beyond migrants who have made it to the U.S. southern border. On Tuesday, Mexico largest railroad operators suspended service of several northbound train lines after reporting half-a-dozen injuries and deaths of migrants. Homeland Security Secretary, as you said, Alejandro Mayorkas is expected to meet at the border this afternoon with Honduran President Xiomara Castro. [14:10:06] So it will be happening in the next few hours.

Those are the factors that push migrants to leave their countries of origin because they have no future there.But on the American side of the border, the bigger problem is not just the numbers of people at the border. It's that our broader immigration system is so dysfunctional, it is outdated and out of touch with reality of the 21st century. We have not updated our systems, immigration system since 1986. We have 10 million undocumented people here. And some of the measures that we have seen in recent years like DACA or temporary protected status, those are just band-aids on a bigger problem. So until as the country, and I'm talking about Congress specifically here, we stop focusing so much on the ebb and flow of the border numbers and tackle this much larger problem of our outdated immigration system, unfortunately will keep coming back to this same status quo of human suffering and overwhelmed border cities.",

They are pursuing asylum claims. Once they come to this country, we have a backlog of 1.6 million asylum cases. The average asylum case text four-and-a-half years to process start to finish. So a good way to address this would be to send more resources intoimmigration courts to support personnel, and to processing all of these large numbers of people so we don't have huge crowds of people at the border, and also a tremendous population within our borders waiting for an asylum case that may be five years or more. And again, bigger picture. It's Congress that got us into the problem. And the only we can get out of it is by Congress taking action on immigration. Whatever measures different presidents have done such as President Obama with DACA, President Trump with some of his immigration bands, and now President Biden, those are just temporary. The solution must come from Congress if we're going to address this in a meaningful way. And so far Congress has not shown any propensity to cooperate and to compromise and get us past this situation. In the meantime, again, we just see so much suffering. And these pictures, they're quite disturbing. But politically, they are one reasons why President Biden has, I believe, a 31 percent approval rating on immigration, because people see this, and whatever they know about immigration or our system, they know it's not right. It's upsetting people. And the only way we will get beyond this is if we just look beyond the border and look at our broader system, and hopefully update it, fix it, and provide more resources.",

It really is sort of a domino effect to many industries and Los Angeles as a whole because it really has had an economic impact here and really everywhere.But keep in mind, the writers still do not have a deal, the actors don't have a deal.

      "sentences": "So sorry about that, Priscilla. Let's now go to Capitol Hill, Congressman Garret Graves.REP. GARRET GRAVES, (R-LA): We just finished A Republican conference telephone call where we were talking about the path forward, and certainly on a path right now to begin moving appropriations bills. We're going to be moving Department of Defense, Homeland Security, department of Agriculture appropriations as well as state and foreign operations. We are trying to get this process on a path where we can truly reduce spending and address a lot of the fundamental problems that this administration is causing, particularly at the border, in areas like energy, inflation, and just the inability of Americans to make ends meet. Obviously, with the end of the fiscal year, I think an important part of this strategy is going to be ensuring that we do everything we can to avoid a government shutdown. We should not be in a situation where we are asking our troops to go out there and put their lives on the line and yet not be paid. We shouldn't be in situation to where we are fighting to close the southern border but not have our Border Patrol paid. I think this is an unreasonable situation, and I think it would be a failure on our part if we actually reached that point. I think that Republicans are aligned on the strategy, at least 95 percent of them, and we're going to continue working to do this. The last one I want to make. I want to remind everyone that the appropriations bills that we are moving forward are the appropriations bills that the appropriations committee reported or voted or passed out as far back as May of this year. There have been aggressive efforts by the members standing here as well as scores of other Republican members of Congress to try to get these bills to the floor for a vote as soon as possible. And those efforts have been thwarted despite much effort by the entire leadership team, the speaker of the House, the majority leader, the whip and others. With that, I want to turn Congresswoman Erin Houchin, I'll say it again, a member of the Rules Committee that just finished voting a little while ago on reporting the rollout for the four bills that determines the conditions under which these bills will be considered. REP. ERIN HOUCHIN, (R-IN): Thank you, Garret. We've just came out of the Rules Committee. We're going to have maybe the largest rule we've ever passed out of the Rules Committee that contains four appropriations bills with hundreds of amendments that are allowed to be offered for the process. Again, I want to reiterate what Congressman Graves said in that many of these appropriations bills have been noticed, they have been out of committee for months. We have been trying to get these bills to the floor. A handful of people have sort of been standing in the way of that. We are going to keep moving forward. We're going to keep trying every single day to get these bills through, because every single day we are fighting against what the Biden administration is doing or not doing on the border. And this rules package in particular contains some strong border provisions that we hope the Senate and the president will take seriously. REP. BRYAN STEIL, (R-WI): Thanks. I think what I walk away with from the call we just had is actually how unified the Republican Conference is on two things. One, to address the runaway spending and the reckless spending of the Biden administration, and two, to get serious about securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The conversation we are having here in the final days is the tactics to get us there. But I think the strategy we are unified behind. Hopefully over the next few days we will be up to move these bills forward and ultimately make sure we are not shutting down the federal government. There will be a stopgap period of time that would be needed to complete the appropriations bill, but the work we can do this week I think will really build the momentum in the appropriations process but also give us that opportunity to get the stopgap funding bill across the line so we can complete the work of the appropriations.",

So those are the two things that we are bringing to the forefront in our appropriations package. I'm excited to see these bills come to the fore, get a rule through, and continue to do the work. Again, the congressman stated the stopgap measure that we're working on. Yes, we are working on a stopgap measure, but we're also at the same time collectively working together to try to move our appropriations.",

We're aware of timelines, of getting something back and forth between the Senate.

And even if they did, some of them would be dead on arrival in the Senate. Now, another thing that they were talking about there was a stopgap measure to at least buy them some time. The reality for the White House in scenarios like this is that they have to prepare either way for a potential shutdown. That's what the Office of Management and Budget was doing just yesterday when they essentially told federal agencies to dust off their plans and start to prepare for this possibility. That includes, for example, how many people are going to get furloughed, who is considered essentially and working without pay, and what comes to a halt, what federal activities come to a halt? What the White House wants to see is that the services that Americans use every day aren't disrupted in a significant way, and there are some services that continue. Border protection, federal law enforcement, air traffic control, all of that would continue. But again, these are federal employees that would go without pay. And that is not an ideal scenario either. And so the White House is monitoring all of this very closely. But from the administration standpoint, what they have to do either way is prepare for what happens if this shutdown does go through a week from now. And even though those Republicans were trying to project confidence, the reality is again that time is of the essence on this, and they still do not have everyone behind these bills.",
