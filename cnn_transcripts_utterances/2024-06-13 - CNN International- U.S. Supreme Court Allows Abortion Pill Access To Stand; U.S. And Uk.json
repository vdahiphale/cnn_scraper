      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our viewers from around the world. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.I want to get straight to our breaking news this hour, a major setback for the anti-abortion movement. Moments ago, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that they are rejecting a bid by doctors and anti-abortion groups to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone. So, this means that the pills can remain on the market and be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor's visit. And this moment marks the first major ruling on reproductive rights since the court's conservative majority overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Let's bring in CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider to help us understand the rule and break it down for us. Jessica.",

      "sentences": "Rahel, this is one of the big rulings we've been anticipating from the court, as we approach the end of the term here. And it really did, like you said, thrust the nine justices back into the center of this abortion debate two years after they overruled Roe v. Wade. But, this time, they are actually giving a somewhat inadvertent win to supporters of abortion rights.So, the Supreme Court in this unanimous opinion, they're dismissing a lawsuit that was brought by anti-abortion doctors, that if the doctors had it their way, it would have severely restricted the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone. And of course, this is a drug that is used in more than half of all abortions nationwide. It's a drug that's become increasingly more widely used in the two years since abortion rights have really been restricted in many states around the country. So, what the Supreme Court is saying in this decision, they're saying that this group of doctors that brought this lawsuit doesn't have the necessary legal standing. That means the legal right or the injury to bring this case. And the Supreme Court saying that's because the doctors themselves don't prescribe mifepristone and they don't use mifepristone. So, they just don't have the legal right to challenge the use of this pill. Now, these doctors, they had brought this lawsuit on the basis that, in their view, the Federal Drug Administration did not have the ability to even approve this drug and didn't have the ability to make changes to the drug in recent years that made it more widely available, like via mail, via telehealth, and then also the fact that the rules were changed to allow women to use it up to 10 weeks of pregnancy instead of the previous seven. So, Rahel, this is really a major win for abortion rights groups. But, what it doesn't do is close the door to future lawsuits against the FDA or against this pill. So, other groups who may be have the legal standing in this case, they may decide at some point in the future to bring a challenge, challenging or questioning the legality of mifepristone. But, for now, it will remain status quo for the pill, meaning it will remain widely available nationwide. So, that was a big case today. Rahel, interestingly, we're still waiting for two dozen cases to be released in what we expect to be the next two weeks, before the end of June. That includes another case dealing with abortion rights and what emergency room doctors are able to do when it comes to women's health, and whether they can perform abortions without facing any legal consequences. Then, of course, there is the big one, whether or not former presidents, notably in this particular case, Donald Trump, whether they're immune from criminal prosecution for any action taken while in office, and that decision could really potentially upend the criminal case against Donald Trump here in Washington, or it could let it move forward as normal. So, we're waiting for that one as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, the thing that struck me, and Jessica just talked about it a little bit with you, Rahel, is that this was a technical opinion. It never got to the crux of the issue. They never got to women's rights. They never got to who could advocate on behalf of them. What they said was, the group that brought this lawsuit, they couldn't get into the courthouse because they had no right to object to this, and that's significant. And so, to me, there were a couple of things I draw out of this. It is a victory for women and their right to control what they do with their bodies, as well as what they choose to do medically. So, that is a victory. But, again, it was one of those technical issues.What I did pull out of this is what Justice Kavanaugh wrote at the end of the opinion. What he said was, these people didn't have the standing, the legal right to come into court to challenge this. But, that won't prevent groups like this who have the right to object to this kind of an issue, to go talk to the legislature, to the FDA themselves, to the President, and seek their assistance in getting the regulation they want to get. So, that's one of the things I drew from this. The other thing I drew from this, they relied a lot on precedent, and what prior courts had said about standing, and they went through three different ways that the people here who brought the original lawsuit could have achieved standing and they rejected all three, and chapter and verse cited back to why they didn't and what prior courts had decided. And Justice Thomas, in his concurring opinion, went on to say there was this alternative approach to standing. He wasn't so sure that that got them into court as well. So, what that makes me think is, how will these justices, who just unanimously upheld precedent, prior decisions, standing issues, addressed the one remaining big case that's on their docket, and that's presidential immunity. Are they going to rely on standing? Are they going to carve out some new exception? So, those are the two things that stood out of today's decision (ph).",

But, the fact that Justice Kavanaugh relied on precedent and standing and addressed a chapter and verse could give some insight as to how they might be struggling with this issue about presidential immunity. Because, remember, it's a narrow question. It relies on a lot of history in our Constitution on prior decisions. If they stick with that history and those prior decisions, they may be unwilling to expand presidential immunity as much as the former President had asked for.On the other hand, we've seen them discard precedent and prior decisions. That's what happened when they overturned Roe v. Wade. So, this is an opinion issue today that reflects what the court is thinking today.

The NATO feels that that would be a massive loss. The European Union would feel that sort of transatlantic weakening of the ties there as well.So, the European Union, the other members of NATO, would be on the stump, really, to support Ukraine and help it get through the war with Russia as best they can. So, everyone at this meeting is worried. So, complex legal arrangements, the sort of things that are going into place around this loan are the best that they can hope for, as they have faced the uncertainty of the U.S. presidential election. I think you have to add to that as well. There were five other leaders around that table today, who also have somewhat uncertain political futures at the moment. The British Prime Minister expected to lose in his election, June 4. Power and political influence of President Macron could be curtailed if elections go against his party and the elections that he has called in France coming up, and so on and so forth.

Their gathering comes as the UN reports that last month marked the highest number of Ukrainian civilian casualties in nearly a year. The UN saying that over half of those numbers occurred in the Kharkiv region. Now, despite those figures, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that he does not expect Russia's offensive in Kharkiv to make major gains. Two weeks ago, the White House gave Ukraine permission to strike inside Russian territory with American weapons.

President Biden granted them permission to do that. And so, our policy in using long-range strike to -- capabilities to conduct strikes deep into Russia, that's not changed.

But, it's clear that the backdrop here is the same as what they're grappling with at the G7, right, the concern over what political change potentially in Washington in November will mean for Ukraine aid going forward, and of course, concerns over what happened earlier this year, that six-month delay that was so damaging to Ukraine's fortunes on the frontline. That delay in terms of Congress agreeing to new U.S. aid.So, to that end, NATO is discussing taking on a lead role when it comes to coordinating Ukrainian security assistance and training, potentially taking some of that responsibility away from the U.S.-led so-called Ramstein Contact Group, which has been leading that so far. That effort will come, says the NATO's Secretary General, with a financial commitment as well. So, we may get more details on the contours of that. They're also getting into the finer details of what Ukraine needs. Air defenses are a key priority. No commitment yet from the U.S. on whether it could provide more Patriot batteries, which have proved so critical to Ukraine's defense, but are so sorely lacking at the moment. And of course, F-16s was also a big talking point. Those are on the horizon. The NATO Secretary General says that they are trying to fast track the training for that. But, crucially, given that we've been talking about using Western weapons to hit targets across the border in Russia, he was asked about this, and he said, look, Ukraine has the right to self-defense. If we don't allow them to do this, we're essentially asking them to defend themselves with one hand tied behind their back. So, he is not ruling out that F-16s could be used for the same purpose.

His family says the Hamas guards told them for months, the sounds of war they were hearing were Israel trying to target them because they were causing trouble for the state. His brother Dmitry tells me he didn't understand why the IDF came. He was afraid they came to kill him. It took some time to realize they had come to rescue him. Psychological abuse coupled with frequent punishments marked Kozlov's captivity, according to his family. They were trying not to leave marks, his brother says, because eventually, it is their reputation, but they would still punish him this way or the other. He has told us there were some moments he will never share with us, his father says. But, what he did share is that at the hottest time of the day, they would cover him in blankets. It's a difficult ordeal to be dehydrated through heat. Kozlov, 27-years- old, is a Russian citizen who moved to Israel almost two years ago. He was working as a security guard at the Nova Music Festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. His parents flew from Russia Sunday for an emotional reunion, one they hadn't dared to hope for after eight long months. This is the best scenario we could have hoped for, his father says. To see him alive, to feel his presence and to hug him, it is outstanding. His mother says we are infinitely happy to see him. He laughs. He jokes. He enjoys communicating with all of us, with his family, with doctors, with the people who surround him. His family says Kozlov was shocked when Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to visit him and the three other hostages rescued while in hospital. As for those hostages still in Gaza, his father says a deal or a rescue, whatever it takes to get them out. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We did speak to the heads -- doctor of his medical treatment, in fact all of the hostages, those rescued last weekend and also those released last year, and he said that the journey back to recovery for these four will be particularly long, he said, when you compare it to those who were released back in November. They have been in captivity so much longer. So, he says the psychological damage that they will have to try and recover from is more significant. Rahel.",

I believe that is President Joe Biden. This is a global infrastructure and investment event. So, we expect to hear from the President shortly. We'll wait to hear from that. But, of course, this is expected to be a pretty significant day, both in terms of announcements about Ukraine, the loan, the $50 billion roughly loan that is expected to be announced, and the contours of what that could look like as well as the security pact. We'll keep an eye on that.In the meantime, for the first time since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee as well as a convicted felon, Donald Trump, meantime, is back in Washington, D.C. Right now, the U.S. President -- the former U.S. President is meeting with House Republicans and will later speak with Senate Republicans. Now, these are closed meetings. But, we do expect to hear from Trump in just a couple of hours, around 1:30 p.m. Eastern. I'm going to show you really quickly the scene earlier this morning. This is when he arrived at the Capitol Hill Club. While Trump is not expected to go inside the U.S. Capitol building, his appearance back on the Hill is happening, more than three years since the January 6 insurrection. While Trump meets with Republican lawmakers in Washington, his Republican and political rivals are seizing on this visit. Take a look at the latest attack ad from the Biden campaign, which spotlights Trump's role in the Capitol insurrection. Look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He only spoke for a few minutes. But, he talked about the $33 billion mobilized for clean energy projects. He talked about all the infrastructure investments, some, of course, within the continent of Africa, the impact to trade, farming, food security. He said that we've mobilized more than $60 billion, double last year.And Kevin Liptak, let me bring you back into the conversation. And after sort of outlining some of those measures, this is the part that got my attention, Kevin. It shows that democracies can deliver. This is an important moment to do that.

He created it earlier in his term. Back then, it was called Build Back Better World. They changed the name around. But, the real goal of it at the end of the day is to counter China, is to counter China's own infrastructure investments in the developing world through its Belt and Road Initiative. The United States sees those projects as saddling developing countries with Chinese debt that they oftentimes aren't able to dig themselves out of.And what President Biden is trying to do with his own initiative is to provide a better partner, in his view, better terms on these loans, bringing in the private sector. And you saw him there with the CEOs of BlackRock and Microsoft, trying to emphasize that America can be a better partner on some of these projects. The U.S. has gotten some of them off the ground. For example, in Kenya, they are trying to build a major rail corridor from the Middle East, through up into Europe. And so, the U.S. really trying to show that it can be a partner for the developing world at a moment when Beijing is making very, very heavy investments in these places, and the President trying to emphasize that the U.S., through its private sector partnerships, can do that as well.",

I think the other thing that was important that he said was, as you mentioned, democracy can deliver. He is saying that at a very critical moment. He along with so many other leaders at the G7 facing their own political vulnerabilities.
