And obviously, depending on how that impacts different kinds of voters that can get out, that could impact some of the results. We are looking at how strong will the former president be? He has had a commanding lead in the polls coming out of Iowa. Will he be able to really clinch that commanding lead tonight?What does the race for second place look like, especially for Governor Ron DeSantis, who has staked so much here in the state of Iowa to really launch him forward to the next stage of the primary? Or somebody like former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who's had a lot of momentum as we are heading into the first voting. So let me let you listen to DeSantis and Haley. Here's what they were saying to their supporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, PRESIDENTAL CANDIDATE (R): There's only two possible nominees, Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis were the only ones that have strong support amongst bedrock Republican conservative voters. And like to win a Republican nomination, you have got to be able to do that.",

And Kaitlan, this really gets at one more thing that the DeSantis campaign specifically is really looking to make a difference for them tonight. And that's their ground game and organization.We've talked about this in covering them for the last several months. The super PAC that's aligned with them never back down has poured millions of dollars into the state of Iowa. They have knocked on over 900000 doors. They have touch points with hundreds of thousands of people all across the state. Now they're hoping that that's going to make a difference no matter what. But especially when you have this weather to consider when it may be a little bit harder or more challenging to get people to these caucus sites. But in talking with some people, again, they just don't know what's going to happen tonight. They think that's going to make a difference. They're hopeful it's going to make a difference. But we have to see how it all comes together, especially as the sun goes down here. Right now, you can get around around the area of Des Moines. But I will tell you, the wind is what is a killer. And when it gets really dark, it is those conditions outside are absolutely punishing, Kaitlan.

We've got wind chill warnings in effect for most of the state because those frostbite times are so small. We could find hypothermia symptoms of confusion, difficulty speaking, stiff muscles in temperatures and wind chills this cold.This evening, as some of those caucuses are going on, we're looking at temperatures as much as 10 degrees below zero. Those wind chills as cold as 30 to 35 degrees below zero. Frostbite can happen in 20 minutes or less. When you look at all the past caucuses, yes, Iowa is cold, but temperatures in the 30s and 40s are nothing compared to that zero degree temperature that we have out there today for this year, 2024. The past coldest caucus was 16 degrees. That was back in 2004. And I want to mention that this cold snap is happening in the midst of their warmest winter on record. Iowa hasn't really had a cold snap so far this season. So this is really the first time that Iowans are really feeling coldest extreme.

      "sentences": "Let me show you three different counties, Anderson, really east, west, and center that tell the story of tonight. Let's start with Dubuque in the eastern part of this state. I'm pointing this out because Dubuque, it's always close. In the presidential race in 2020, Donald Trump won, but by just a few points. In 2016, in the presidential race, Donald Trump won, but by only one point. In the 2016 Republican caucuses, you can see it was Donald Trump who won there, but by less than a point. It's sort of this knife's edge county, or at least it has been.And tonight, as you watch this, see if Donald Trump is able to build up a substantial lead in this county that's always close. If he is, that'll tell a story maybe of where the night is going. Keeping the 2016 map up here, I'm going to go to the far western part of the state. I pointed this out before. This is Ted Cruz country, or was in 2016, an evangelical part of the state. Sioux County, it's a small county, only 1% of the state's population. Ted Cruz won this with 33% of the vote. But what's so interesting to me about this county is Donald Trump wasn't in the top three in this county with a heavy evangelical vote. Tonight, again, I would not expect that to happen. You will likely see Donald Trump's name somewhere in this mix. The question is, is he able to blow it out in this county where he didn't even show up last time? The biggest county in the state is Polk County, which is where the capital is of Des Moines. This is a county where in 2016, in the Republican caucuses, Marco Rubio won. 26% of the vote, Ted Cruz at 25%. This is a county that Joe Biden, also won in the presidential election. More Democrats here. This is a county where Nikki Haley has to do very well. Independents and Democrats can vote tonight. Again, in the Des Moines Register poll, 70% of caucus goers identified as Republicans tonight. But Democrats and Independents, which make up about 28%, if they register as Republicans, they can vote tonight. There are a lot of them in Polk County, Anderson. And if they show up and change their parties, they can make a difference.",

And it's pretty vast. I mean, our reporter, Jess Bidgood, met a woman who was organizing, met a caucus, a precinct captain, who was organizing rides for people to get to caucus. And I think you'll probably see the same thing with Ron DeSantis, who also has quite the organization there.Haley, of course, in the last Des Moines Register poll, was polling above Ron DeSantis. But her organization on the ground, she hasn't been there as long as the other two campaigns. So that will be an X factor here, because you have to really love a candidate to come out in this kind of conditions. I don't care what they say. This is different even for Iowa. It is cold.

And he wants to quell that as quickly as possible. He wants to see as big a win in Iowa tonight to just put the perception that this primary is over, that these are all stragglers, and that there is no chance at all of any kind of real surge of anyone but him in this primary going forward.",

We saw what we thought would be the birth of the next wave of the GOP field and how 14 months later, here we are. All the chips are in the basket for Ron DeSantis. As you were saying, if he does not finish in the top two here, this is going to be really, really scary stuff for the DeSantis campaign.I don't even know if he makes any of those events. We're going to find out in the next seven to 10 days what the DeSantis camp will look like. But a strong second place is a must. Anybody in the DeSantis camp that you talk to after the re-election and as he started the presidential run will tell you, Iowa was always the focus. Don't let them lie to you.

But listen, he's trying to say he took a very traditional route to becoming the nominee in Iowa. He courted evangelicals. He did the tech. He has a lot of Ted Cruz people on his team or did.And the difference is the X factor here is, is that Trump evangelicals really like Trump, particularly in Iowa. They like Trump.

There's just no question about it. In 2016, they made up roughly 65%, 65% of Republican caucus goers. And Ted Cruz, seen as the candidate of evangelicals, he won. In 2012, they made up 57% of the Republican caucus goers. And Rick Santorum, seen as the candidate of evangelical voters, he won. And if you go back to 2008, a very similar story. They made up 60% of Republican caucus goers. And Mike Huckabee was the winner. He was seen as the candidate of evangelical voters.I want to go back to 2016 because that tells more of the story about where we are right now. As we said, Ted Cruz, he won the caucuses back in 2016. If we look at where the evangelical voters are in this state, again, in the far northwest corner, the darker the color here, the more densely populated among evangelical voters. You can see these areas are where the evangelical voters are. And if I switch to the counties that Ted Cruz won. Yellow is Ted Cruz. You can see he did very well in all of these counties. This was Cruz County. Tonight, Donald Trump wants to do well in all these counties and the same counties he did well in in 2016 himself. In a way, he wants to double where he was. And there are signs that he's on the way of doing that because the latest Des Moines Registered Poll support among evangelicals. I drew an extra line there. But you can see Donald Trump is at 51% among support among evangelicals. Ron DeSantis running. Ron DeSantis running second at 22%.
