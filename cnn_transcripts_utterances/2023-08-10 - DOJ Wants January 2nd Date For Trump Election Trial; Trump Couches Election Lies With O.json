      "sentences": "Busy, indeed, Kaitlan. There was so much to cover and still so much ahead. So nice to see you.And good evening, everyone, I'm Laura Coates. Thank you so much for joining me. We've got some notable guests joining me tonight, including Bob McDonnell, the Virginia governor who Jack Smith once prosecuted. I'm eager to hear what he has to say about all of these matters. Bill Weir is standing by in Hawaii as we unpack that devastation. Also, a top American pastor who says the teachings of Jesus are apparently too woke, yes, you heard me say that, for Trump supporting evangelicals. And the riverboat captain in that Alabama brawl, he is speaking out for the first time right here tonight. And, by the way, if you haven't noticed, it is the summer of women, from the Beehive to Barbie and the Swifties. But, first, everyone, look, Jack Smith has already made his New Year's plans. It's not going to be singing Sweet Caroline, I can tell you that. He'll be getting ready for trial. His office is now declaring that they want to see the election interference case against the former president. They want to go to trial on January 2nd. That date, by the way, if you're looking at the calendar, might seem glaringly obvious and has some significance. It's just a few days, by the way, before the third anniversary of the attack on the Capitol and, yes, less than two weeks before the Iowa caucus, and also, of course, the day after New Year's Day. So, he obviously came to play. It sets up some very legal and public clashes as well as right at the beginning of the 2024 presidential race year and it also means that the case that some people consider the most consequential test of our democracy might be the first one to go to trial, even if that was the last criminal case to actually be indicted. More on all that in just a moment. But tonight, have you seen this interesting, I'll call it, new trend? Now, you'll recall, one of Team Trump's defenses so far has been Jack Smith can't get into his head, he's not a mind reader. He can't prove mindset. In other words, they can't really prove that Trump didn't really believe his own lies. And someone must have actually maybe had a conversation with Trump, maybe explaining a little bit more about what mens rea really means, the idea of the criminal intent and the mental intent to actually perform the crime, not necessarily what you believe. But listen to why this conversation is likely to have happened, because Trump is now sort of couching his normal language and his normal misstatements and lies. Now, we added captions so you can follow along with these phrases. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm telling them that, in my opinion, the election was rigged. And they're saying that I did something incorrect. I didn't do anything wrong. I believe I won that election by many, many votes, many, many hundreds of thousands of votes. That's what I think. And I expressed that on the phone call, and I said, I don't know what the number was, like 11,000 or something. I said, what I need is 11,000 votes. I won this thing by hundreds of thousands of votes. That's my opinion. And it's a strong opinion, and I think it's borne out by the facts, and we'll see that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Donald Trump and his team, they are quite clearly going to be asking not for that date, much later than that. Trump is out there already saying it should be held after the election. They asked for after the election in their Florida federal case related to documents.

Thank you so much for your reporting, as always. Everyone, I want to bring in former Republican Governor of Virginia Bob McDonnell. McDonnell was prosecuted, actually by Jack Smith back in 2014 on federal corruption charges. I have to tell you, there's only to have that conviction, by the way, vacated in a unanimous decision from the Supreme Court back in 2016. Governor, thank you for being here today. I have to tell you, I had been thinking about you and your case as there has been a lot of criticism of one Jack Smith. And your name frequently comes up in the long list of people that Jack Smith has prosecuted. And I've been wondering, given the fact that there is all this talk about the weaponization of the government and the idea of him being a partisan prosecutor, that's the accusation being leveled against him, what did you think, what did you make of it when Jack Smith was named the special counsel overseeing this investigation? FMR. GOV. BOB MCDONNELL (R-VA):  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on. I appreciate it. It's a very important topic for the public to think about. Jack Smith is a smart guy, Harvard educated, prosecuted complicated war crimes, former U.S. attorney. What I walked away in my own case, Laura, is I thought he was overzealous in stretching the bounds of the law. That's what John Roberts said in the final opinion. I think he didn't use good judgment and that's why it was unanimously vacated. When Clarence Thomas and Ruth Ginsburg agreed, you got to admit there's something that's unanimously wrong. So, I guess I was surprised --",

I think in the Florida case, if he can actually prove and has evidence that is believable on the allegations leading to these charges in Florida, I think the president has got serious criminal culpability if he's got the evidence. I think differently, though, in the January 6th cases because he doesn't charge an insurrection offense per se. It's these conspiracies theories that I think are rather novel, that even if he can prove the underlying facts in the indictment, I'm not sure a jury will convict the president on these conspiracy charges.

He knows the consequences of this. What do you make of the timing here? Because I don't know if you realize this, but the special counsel team actually cited your case in their briefing in support of their trial date of January 2nd, because they say, look, that was a rocket docket sort of case.

And I think some people look at that, especially Republicans, and say that that doesn't seem quite fair. Is he going to be able to mount a defense and campaign at the same time or are the charges being brought just to stop him from winning an election?

It looks like a World War II disaster film, almost, as if a bomb went off in the center of town. It came through so fast. I'm hearing tales of folks who were just pinned. They had nowhere to go. They got into their car and got onto the highway. It was bumper to bumper traffic with fire, wall of fire on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other side. One woman stood in the ocean for 8 hours before she came out, before the flames had passed for her to come out of the ocean. Others now, you have to think about while this is happening, it's 60, 70 miles an hour winds, the surf is pounding. If you could get to your boat, you couldn't get it out of the harbor in this kind of weather. So, people who are trying to swim, there's also you got to think about all of the chemicals in the water, the fuel spills in that harbor for people, poor people trying to escape.
