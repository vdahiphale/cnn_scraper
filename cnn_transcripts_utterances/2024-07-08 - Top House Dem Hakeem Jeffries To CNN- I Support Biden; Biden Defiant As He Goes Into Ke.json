But I think a part of the reason that we are seeing this heightened sense of frustration and exasperation within the White House press corps is because ever since debate, the White House is really share no additional information that would help us have a fuller picture of the president's medical records or his health, but not to mention, it has really declined to make Dr. O'Connor, the president's doctor available for additional questioning. And remember, Erin, Biden himself was asked over the weekend about whether he has ever had any neurological or cognitive examinations and he was essentially dismissive. He said being president is the same thing as taking a full neurological test every single day.

On Saturday, Donald Trump has a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that looks like a good time according to those who sort of know his rhythms and his thinking. Now, tomorrow in Doral, in the Miami area, where Rubio lives and where Trump has a golf course and club, he's going to have a rally as well. And there's some speculation and really announced Rubio. Some people are saying, well, probably not. He probably wouldn't want to do with this early. The reason was, Joe Biden, Democrats are in a death spiral right now, at least from a press perspective, that is they're sort of killing each other. Joe Biden keeps saying, look, I'm staying in the race, I'm staying in the race, and then all of these different Democrats are coming out saying, well, he shouldn't stay in the race. They're whispering that he should resign. Donald Trump doesn't want to get the middle of that. Like if his enemy, his opponent is making a mistake, or letting himself or themselves on fire. He's happy to stand back right now and watch them go up in flames.",

And if elected, if chosen, if elected, Vance would be the third youngest VP ever in U.S. history to serve. That as he would be 40, I think number two was Nixon who was 40 day, 40 years and 11 days old. Vance will be a little older. He turns 40 next month, so that's an issue for Vance.

It was a fully operational hospital, children being operated on, children suffering from cancer inside, the shocking aerial assault on population centers far from the frontlines happening is civilians were out in morning rush hour. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT tonight with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A massive attack in broad daylight. The social media video purporting to show the moment a Russian missile hit Kyiv's main children's hospital. The building flat, desperate first responders, but also hospital staff trying to find survivors under the debris. There are people under the rubble, Kyiv's mayor says. There may be children among them. This woman in tears. He came here five minutes before it all happened, she says. We managed to get to the pediatric ward. It's a nightmare. Just days before Vladimir Putin's military bombed Ukraine civilian infrastructure, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, currently holding the European Union presidency, was in Moscow, a trip that other EU leaders have rejected and criticize. Putin using the platform to attack the U.S. and its allies. The sponsors of Ukraine continue to try to use this country and its people as a battering ram, Putin said, a victim in the confrontation with Russia. Orban is not only arguably Vladimir Putin's staunchest ally Europe, he's also a major supporter of former President Donald Trump, celebrating a March visit to Mar-a-Lago on his Instagram page, and telling German outlet \"Bild\", he supports Trump's presidential bid in an exclusive interview.",

The Ukrainians say, rather for proposals for their de-facto surrender, they need more air defense systems to help prevent strikes, like the one that destroyed the children's hospitals.
