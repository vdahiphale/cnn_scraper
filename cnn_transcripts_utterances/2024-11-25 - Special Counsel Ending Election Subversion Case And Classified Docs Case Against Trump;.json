      "sentences": "So I've learned that the Special Counsel, Jack Smith, he is asked to dismiss both of his federal cases against President Elect Trump. So this morning, the first word that we got was that he was moving to dismiss the election subversion case here in Washington, D.C. but then we're waiting to see what he was going to do with the classified documents case.It's a little bit different because of course, Trump has two co- defendants. That case is also currently on appeal after the Trump appointed Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed it. She sided with defense attorneys saying that the Special Counsel had been improperly appointed, something that really shocked most legal experts. So what Smith said is that he is going to dismiss that case as it pertains to Trump, but he will let it proceed as it pertains to those two co-defendants. So they will continue to appeal that case. And it's going to be really interesting to see how the Trump team handles the fact that you have these two sort of Trump allies who are currently on trial still on that case. Because if they want to continue with that litigation, they could try to shore up potentially the appointments of special counsels if they want to use them. But if they dismiss the case or they pardon those two co-defendants could be problematic because you will have that precedent hanging out there from Judge Aileen Cannon. So it sounds like a law exam question, which it is. But that's going to be one of the first things --",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, one of the interesting things that we were watching behind the scenes was whether the Justice Department, whether Jack Smith would go to the Office of Legal Counsel, which is, you know, the law firm essentially within the Justice Department that tells the government what is and isn't constitutional.And what we see here from the filing is that they did consult the OLC. They didn't get a new opinion, but there is apparently, you know, what they did is they read, they talked to the Office of Legal Counsel, and they determined that because Donald Trump is now President Elect that he is -- that he enjoys all of the privileges of a sitting president, which means that they can't be prosecuted. And in the case of the Justice Department, they're saying they can't even, you know, pursue a case that's already in existence. And it's telling also that if you look at the filings, you'll see Jack Smith points out that this doesn't -- this isn't a reflection on the strength of these cases against Donald Trump, right? Remember, the thing that -- that should hang over all of this is that Donald Trump, according to the special counsel, according to the Justice Department, resorted to crimes after he lost the 2020 election. And then, of course, in the case of the classified documents case, he left the White House and took hundreds of documents that were classified that he didn't have a right to anymore. And those are the reasons for those two separate cases. Those things will live, I guess, in infamy for, you know, for the sake of history. But these cases will not.",

And I seriously doubt that the government would spend the time and the money to reopen this old case at that point. But I do think that while the Judge Cannon decision is an outlier and other courts have indicated that the Special Counsel Appointment process is legal and valid, it does hang out there as a possible barrier to, again, this upcoming Trump administration or any future one from bringing cases similar to this one.You know, again, it just though politically and pragmatically, it calls into mind, does it not? the 2016 situation where Donald Trump is caught on a hot mic saying something very terrible about what he could do to women, he gets elected president. But, you know, the interviewer, was it Billy Bush? What happened to his career? You know, and now you've got these two underlings who could conceivably go to trial and or be convicted and be sentenced to prison. For final say about that, though, Donald Trump appoints the United States attorneys in all of the federal districts. Is he really going to want to go forward with a case against those two men when all of the evidence that would come in, or much of the evidence would point to Trump -- Trump's alleged behavior? I don't think so. I suspect all these cases are going away. But that's just my prediction, for what it's worth.",

Again, this is an internal investigation. This is not a criminal investigation. In one instance, though, the investigators looking into this learned that Boris Epshteyn requested as much as $100,000 per month in exchange for his services in one of these instances. And I want to tell you what Boris Epshteyn said in response to this reporting. He said, I am honored to work for President Trump and his team. These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again. Now, Epshteyn has served as a Senior Adviser to Donald Trump. At times, he served as an Attorney for Donald Trump. He's rubbed plenty of people the wrong way. But this investigation is an indication to how seriously some around Trump took these allegations that Boris Epshteyn was trying to charge people essentially for access to Trump and those in his orbit.

The Trump transition is saying this was a broad review of consulting contracts around the former President and that everyone is moving together as a team. And you know, Boris, Epshteyn has been in Donald Trump's orbit for a very long time. He's very used to the kind of knife fighting that goes on around now the President Elect. You know, he's rubbed people the wrong way in part because he talks about his closeness to the President Elect and also because of the access he gets to Donald Trump.

      "sentences": "Well, here's the latest that we are hearing because they can't even take their electronics into the courtroom, but they can come out to give us some notes. But the last word we had is that this hearing has not started yet. In fact, the parties are not in the courtroom.The judge is not there, defense prosecutor is not there. Now traditionally, what that can mean is that they are meeting in the chambers with the judge. However, we have no definitive word that that is happening. But they are not in the courtroom. And one interesting point to remember is George Gascon is still the District Attorney of Los Angeles. And he really focused and made it his emotional plea before the election to stand out and say that these two brothers, Lyle and Erik Menendez, even though they were sentenced with life without the possibility of parole, that they should be released. So you have the prosecution led by Gascon that is for their release. You have the defense that is for their release. So there really is not an issue between the parties here. And I think the judge, if in fact he is meeting with them, has to decide is he going to allow the brand new District Attorney to weigh in or will something happen today? Now, this is just supposed to be a status hearing. It's based on a habeas corpus motion that was filed last year, which habeas corpus means that you are being unlawfully held and detained. And they're saying that this is the case because there are two pieces of new evidence that a jury didn't get to see. And if a jury did get to see them, they very likely would have been found not guilty. One is a letter that Erik Menendez wrote, according to the defense, months before their parents were murdered, where Erik is writing, writing to his cousin. I am so in fear of my father. I never know when he's going to come in during the night. I want to talk to my mother, but I'm concerned she's going to tell him. And I'm very afraid. The second piece of what the defense says is new evidence is one of the former members of Menudo because remember, they recorded for RCA and Jose Menendez, the father of Erik and Lyle, was an executive at RCA. And that man is alleging that when he was in his teens that Jose Menendez sexually abused him, which adds credence to what Lyle and Erik were saying at the time of trial. So that's what the habeas is, which is before the judge today in a status hearing. But we will see when this begins what actually happens and will it be more of a status hearing than what we believed it to be.",

It usually kind of goes extreme or the other.Yes, we know so much more about it now. It's been 30 years. We know these things happen within families. You know, we have a better understanding and their behavior, you know, there's no predicting what victims of incestuous sexual abuse might do under those circumstances. The other camp is in the other extreme. I don't care how rehabilitated they look in prison. They're sociopaths, they're psychopaths. They have been proved to lie and lie a lot and confabulate and make up stories. Why didn't they tell anybody that this was going on at the time? There seems to be almost no middle ground. People either believe that they were abused or think that they are completely psychopathic. Charming. Want to get over on the system manipulating the DA using celebrities to curry favor. The real question that people in the middle want to ask is if they are indeed sociopathic, even psychopathic, how did they get that way? Could the reason be from abuse, which they really can't prove because there is no physical proof? It's really just circumstantial evidence at this point. I don't think what they're doing in prison with getting married and leaving good lives is going to make a difference. Because if you believe that they're psychopaths, that is just an act that they're putting on to secure their early release. It just depends on whether you believe the abuse story is real.",
