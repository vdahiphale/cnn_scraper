In minutes, we're going to speak with the director of the National Hurricane Center to get the very latest on the track and the timing and the intensity.

So we are along the water where they are expecting here a potentially record breaking storm surge of 10 to 15 feet. Keep in mind the storm surge for Helene was about seven feet, so they are quite concerned.If you just look at this dock here behind me, you can see that boat. That boat is potentially going to be taken out by that storm surge and possibly by the winds. There could be 140 mile per hour winds here along the shore. And then across the way there, if you can see there are a bunch of homes along the water. Many of them have their hurricane shutters up, certainly boarded up. A lot of people have left town because of what they experienced with Helene. We've been driving around Sarasota. It's really like a ghost town. They seem to be heeding those warnings, and after officials said to get out or you will die, in some cases, those people have and left town. We did see a lot of debris all over the area here from Helene that was left behind. People have been emptying out the contents of their homes. We've seen China cabinets and dressers and mattresses and refrigerators all along these neighborhoods. So it's certainly a concern. We did speak to one woman just yesterday who told me that her husband rode out the storm, hurricane Helene, in Siesta Key, which is a barrier island off Sarasota, which is now closed. They've closed the bridge. So anybody who is still on those barrier islands is now stuck there through the storm. But her husband rode out the storm there, and he was up to five feet of water. Water was up to his chest. Here's what she told me about what they're plan is for Milton. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Back during Helene the storm surge got so bad that it actually reached the walls of the Tampa general hospital, which is the region's only level one trauma center. So I am keeping my eye on the water levels here, especially in the worst scenario we could be seeing double the storm surge here in the Tampa Bay region. Of course, that is very dependent on lung landfall for that.Obviously, the messaging from officials right now is very much go. Evacuate if you can. This is the 11th hour.

Those very worst conditions are going to first reach the west coast of Florida with the tropical storm conditions beginning this afternoon, hurricane conditions tonight. That devastating storm surge is going to hit right around the time of landfall. Even the waters are going to start to rise this afternoon.

Now, one way that the White House is trying to combat this is by launching a Reddit account. So, they are hoping that they can post information there to get directly in the hands of those in the communities about the resources that are available for them. This all comes as the response to Hurricane Helene has really become a flashpoint on the campaign trail with former President Donald Trump, among those who has been promoting some false narratives about the federal government's response. Vice President Kamala Harris has said that that is simply irresponsible and she had this message last night for those in impacted communities about the misinformation that's been spreading.
