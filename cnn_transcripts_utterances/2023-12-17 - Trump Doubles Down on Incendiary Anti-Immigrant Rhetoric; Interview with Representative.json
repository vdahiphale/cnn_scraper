And the reason for them, when you talk to officials, is because there is unprecedented migration across the western hemisphere fueled in part by the coronavirus pandemic and how conditions deteriorated across the hemisphere. And that's what's landing at the U.S. southern border. And this has been a big issue for the Biden administration for the last three years.

What's your reaction to Trump echoing Hitler in this campaign speech over the weekend saying immigrants are, quote, \"poisoning the blood of the United States?\" What's your response to that? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Well, first, Jim, thanks for having me. I mean, President Trump said he wants to be a dictator on day one, as all the great dictators of course said, right? They only want to do it for just one day, and now he's literally quoting them using their language, and in fact he's actually quoting Vladimir Putin in order to take shots at a U.S. president. You know, my fear is that unfortunately Trump is flooding the zone and has flooded the zone with so much nonsense that people tune it out and they say to themselves, oh, he's just kidding, he doesn't really mean it.

He did separate parents from their children in a horrible policy that didn't stop immigration.And so this is really more Trump just -- more bluster and more using talking points from the internet, trying to get people foaming out of the mouth with anger, trying to blame obviously minority groups, trying to get obviously, you know, non-educated white Americans mad at the fact that America is becoming more of a melting pot. What would Democrats do? Democrats would respond, obviously, with the same fervor as we did the first time.

And as a result which, you know, the Israel aid didn't go anywhere, and the speaker knew that that was going to happen. He was told that by the Senate.On Ukraine, obviously, it's imperative that we continue to help our friends and ally, Ukraine, against Vladimir Putin, who invaded a sovereign country. We cannot let Vladimir Putin win. If we do China is going to look at what happened there. It's going to have massive repercussions in Taiwan. And let's not forget the rest of Europe. If he can just go in and take a country or take half a country he won't stop there. Again, that's not what dictators do. They don't just stop. They continue, especially if they think they are successful. And on the border, look, there are issues at the border. I think we need more border agents. I think we need more technology. I think we can refine some of our policies. So I hope we get a grand deal in the new year. To me, I always thought that they were going to punt this into the new year, with the holidays coming up. That just seemed to be where the 118th Congress is. I mean, look what happened in the House. They voted for the impeachment inquiry and then they ran out of town for three weeks because they wanted to show the American people how important that was. They literally just ran out of town for three weeks. Again, the House also left without doing Israel-Ukraine and the border, they punted that to the Senate.

The secretary is expected to push Israeli officials to define clear goals in the country's ongoing war. President Biden has warned Israel that it is losing support due to its relentless bombardment of Gaza and the mounting civilian death toll.The Palestinian Ministry of Health says more than 18,000 people have died in Gaza since the war began. This comes as the Israeli Defense Forces claimed to have uncovered what it says is the biggest Hamas tunnel inside Gaza stretching nearly three miles in length and fully equipped with electricity, ventilation and communication systems. And joining me now to discuss all of this is CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Army commanding general, Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General Hertling, great to see you as always. Always appreciate the insights. I guess, first of all, I mean, the images of this tunnel are just kind of mind-boggling. What is your take in all this? What was your reaction to that when you saw that? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jim, my reaction is this is what Israel has been talking about since the beginning of this conflict. They knew that these kinds of tunnels existed. I mean, we've been showing on CNN the single file tunnels that you almost have to squeeze through, but you can't conduct an operation of literally thousands of terrorists when you are squeezing them all through. So you're talking about a tunnel in this case, it's 50 meters, about 200 feet or so underground that has the capability to hold weapons, have large meeting spaces, travel around and even bring vehicles in. It's just part of the network that's subterranean under the Gaza that Hamas has been building for the last several years, in fact, close to a decade. And how they have been shifting the money away from the Palestinian citizens to build these kinds of things, to construct their military apparatus. And it's just mind-boggling, it is, but it also shows the difficulty of fighting in this kind of subterranean environment.",

I've said from the beginning I don't think that's going to happen given the size and strength of the Hamas terrorist groups that are in the subterranean tunnels. And we're seeing in each section of Gaza that there are more and more underground headquarters, and Hamas has been very diligent in terms of setting traps for the Israeli forces as they go through. So anyone that says, hey, we ought to shift from using air power to ground and special operation forces, that's easy to say on the outside. But truthfully with some of the constructs that we've seen Hamas is using, these underground networks and some of the uses of civilian buildings have to be struck. I think it will continue on.

And they are attempting to conduct their operations according to rules of engagement, but truthfully as you just said, the conditions on this battlefield are extremely complex and complicated. You don't know who the enemy is. When people pop out of buildings, especially buildings as the Israelis have been showing contain a vast amount of ammunition and they contain ambush sites, it's very difficult to differentiate.

James' lawyer says they were convicted almost solely on witness testimony, which was later retracted.And joining me now is the man in that video, James Soto. James, thanks very much for joining us. I don't know if the right word is congratulations, but I am very happy for you that you are now freed after this terrible ordeal that you've been through. What was going through your mind as you walked out of prison?

In that clip who you were just listening to was Elaine Welteroth, she is the former editor-in-chief of \"Teen Vogue.\" She's a host of \"Project Runway.\" She chose a home birth despite having access to really potentially the best doctors in Los Angeles.And part of it was because she felt like she could get more patient- centered care in that setting from midwives, including the woman who was sitting there explaining that. That was her midwife Kimberly Durdin. And look, Jim, this is becoming extremely popular, broadly in the United States going from 1 percent of births at home in the '80s to 2020 where it's now 12 percent of births, but really the story I think right now is what's happening with black women. And black women, in 2019, there was a 36 percent increase in black women choosing home births, that went up another 21 percent in 2020. So there is definitely a movement here, not just to give birth at home without any sort of, you know, just doing -- nobody is doing it on their own, but they are doing it with the help of care providers who are specifically trained in providing patient-centered support to black women who are very concerned that they don't get that kind of support in a hospital setting. So that's one of the things that we will explore in this documentary is why is this happening and what does it mean and what does it look like both at home and in a hospital.",
