With just three days to go. more than 34 million ballots have been cast in 47 states. And now it's time for the final push. These are live pictures from Philadelphia where Democrats are bringing out their heavy hitters as they try to hang on to slim majorities in the House and the Senate. President Biden and former President Barack Obama will make their closing arguments with their party's candidates just a short time from now. Both have warned that democracy is on the line this Tuesday, denouncing Republican election deniers who are on the ballot. Also in Pennsylvania tonight, former President Donald Trump who is on a campaign blitz that has much to do with his own political future as the Republicans running on Tuesday. Sources tell CNN his aides are eyeing the third week of November, a very short time from now, as an ideal launch for his next run for president. CNN is tracking key races and issues across the country. Let's begin with CNN's Phil Mattingly live in Philadelphia for us. We just mentioned where you are just a few moments ago. An eager crowd is awaiting President Biden and former President Barack Obama. They are trying to pull out the big guns, Phil, here in this home stretch.",

There are some major House races that are up for grab. There's obviously a governor's race. But the most important of all is the Senate race where Democrats are trying to flip a seat, give themselves some cushion given the other races they have that are very much coming down to the wire here.This is a different vibe than any President Biden event that I have been to up to this point. There's a deejay just a few feet away from me, not the norm for a President Biden event. But something that underscores the very clear effort here. You saw President Biden in Pittsburgh earlier today. President Biden and President Obama here in Philadelphia in about two hours trying to really juice turnout in blue strongholds knowing that that is the critical element of winning this state. The messages, they're somewhat similar. Styles are very different. But, Jim, the message is similar as we heard from the former president earlier today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Democrats may not be perfect. I'm the first one to admit it. I'm not perfect. No politician is. We're just like all of you. We can make mistakes. But right now with a few notable exceptions, most Republican politicians aren't even pretending that the rules apply to them. They just make stuff up. We've seen -- throughout history, we have seen around the world what happens when you give up on democracy. We can see it in other countries where government tells you what books you can read and what books you can't. Countries that own all the media and just pump up propaganda and put dissidents and reporters in jail. Countries where it really doesn't matter who you vote for because the fix really is in. And people in power do whatever they want. And where corruption is rampant because there's no accountability. When that happens, people get hurt. That has real-life consequences. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They want to repeal that. That's part of the Inflation Reduction Act. $35 insulin for seniors. They want to repeal that. That will just hurt people. They have -- other than that, I don't know what they want to do about inflation. I haven't heard. They just talk that game. So I think economics are important. They have to be. And they of course also will want to cut taxes on people, upper income people. That's what they always want to do. And that again will, you know, take that away. You see Johnson, Ron Johnson has talked about voting on Medicare and Social Security every year. Rick Scott, who headed up the Senate campaign committee for the Republicans has talked about that. That it has to come up for renewal every five years. This should be very, very alarming. And, look, I won my first term in the Senate -- I won by 312 votes. Every vote counts.

They understated this problem of the health issue. They should have replaced him back in the summer when they had the chance.And it was -- I mean, it was appalling and sad that they put him out there under those conditions because many people watch that and they just don't think he's able to do the job, notwithstanding whatever mistakes Oz made, although he was very crisp and clear in his answers. And Fetterman was not. And that's what's driving a lot of the election right now. The polls -- I think the average right now has Oz up by .1 percent. So it's dead even. So this thing can go any way and I think Oz has been pretty effective at trying to keep distance from Mastriano, except for today, which is a mistake, as Mastriano was a disastrous candidate for Republicans for a whole host of reasons I don't need to get into.

Yes, you want to spike up your base a bit. I mean, the only good thing about Trump being in Pennsylvania, he is not in the Philadelphia media market if you're Mehmet Oz. And that's the only good thing. But he should not be here because all this does is remind people, hopefully intervenes in these races. He's done it in the primary helping to nominate some very challenging candidates or exotic candidates to be polite. And he's really complicated this election cycle for Republicans where they should be walking away with this midterm right now. Even though the Roe decision certainly, you know, has given Democrats some energy. They should still be walking away with this and Trump is not helping.

Which is $78 million more than Herschel Walker. And yet this poll show the race is tied despite, I mean, just an avalanche of bad news on the campaign trail for Herschel Walker and yet it's so close. Why is that? PATRICIA MURPHY, POLITICAL REPORTER, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: It's been incredible to watch. One reason is because Herschel Walker was so well-known in Georgia and really beloved as a local hero way before this Senate race started. So a lot like Donald Trump, Georgians' impressions of Herschel Walker were really baked in before he ever ran for the Senate, and they were very, very positive. Now obviously a lot of really bad information, very dangerous accusations about Herschel Walker have come out, a lot of evidence even about from his ex-wife that he had held a gun to her head, held a razor to her throat, that has not budged a lot of Republican support. A big piece of that is control of the Senate. We are people going to want to be in control of the Senate with Joe Biden in the White House still. We talked to a lot of Republican voters, either some don't believe the accusations against him so they're not factoring those in, or they do believe the accusations and they don't care because they don't want Joe Biden to be able to continue to push his agenda forward.

So they just didn't go out and vote.They also didn't think that the two Republicans up were loyal enough to Donald Trump so Raphael Warnock won that race and it was a huge surprise even here in Georgia. I think the Donald Trump factor is really important and I think control of the Senate is really important. If control of the Senate is decided without this race, and this race goes into a runoff, it's already baked in, either the Democrats or the Republicans have it, no problem, I think that's going to probably help Herschel Walker. But if it comes down to this race and Republicans could control the U.S. Senate with Herschel Walker in the Senate, we hear from a lot of Republicans who don't feel great about Herschel Walker that they're going to vote for him anyway if it means controlling the U.S. Senate for the next two years.",

About 5 percent of Brian Kemp's voters are also voting for Herschel -- I mean, for Raphael Warnock right now, so there's this split ticket. Those are two incumbents. Those are two people who voters feel pretty good about it and they voted for them the last time. Again, both of those gentlemen have won here in Georgia before so voters are comfortable enough with them right now.If Donald Trump becomes a big piece of this, that would really scramble the dynamic. Georgia Republicans don't want him here. Donald Trump has not been to Georgia throughout Herschel Walker's entire candidacy. That's not an accident. Brian Kemp doesn't want him here, obviously. And Herschel Walker's camp I think also feels like that would really upset their momentum as well. So if this goes to runoff and Donald Trump is tempted to come into the state, that will have a lot of Republicans not sleeping a whole lot at night.",
