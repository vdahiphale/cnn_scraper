Apparently according to a temporary restraining order, he tried to suffocate and threatened to murder another former co-worker at another job.Now this all happened in 2013. Zhao was subjected to a temporary restraining order after a former co-worker and a former roommate accused him of attacking him and threatening him, and that restraining order actually at the time forbid him from not only being near that roommate, that he apparently threatened to murder, but also it banned him and barred him from owning or being able to buy a gun. But that temporary restraining order went away in July of 2013. Zhao here expected in court at 1:30 Pacific Time. It will be his first court appearance since being accused of murdering seven people and critically injuring another person at two separate locations in Half Moon Bay, one of those locations where he lived and worked, the Mountain Mushroom Farm in Half Moon Bay. Yesterday Governor Gavin Newsom spent time in the community meeting with victims, meeting with the community members who've been deeply impacted by this. And to be quite honest with you, Jim and Erica, he was tired, exhausted, and incredibly emotional from my conversation with him, but --",

They want to see these five officers indicted. They want to see them held accountable.We have not been able to look at the video camera, although we know that the lawyers representing the family have said that what's on those body cams is horrific. They say it's worse than what we saw in the 1992 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers. So I think the U.S. attorney felt a need to say something to this community because there has been so much attention paid to this case by folks on the ground who want answers.",

It is the fact that the victim in this case is African-American, and we know all too often African-American men in particular, unarmed, die from routine police stops. And this is what this appears to be, some kind of routine traffic stop that happened very close to Mr. Nichols' home where apparently he tried to run from police and his family said he had a good reason for running, and five officers.That's the big question, Jim. Why five officers? Why did this man end up lying in a bed with a bloody face and a swollen eye after what should have been a routine encounter with police officers. So I think we have to stay focused on the fact that young, black, unarmed men often find themselves either brutalized or murdered by simple encounters with police officers.",

And I asked Mr. Crump, you know, if the family -- you know, what's their focus right now, and he said their focus is justice, but they also are really adamant that they want this video released within the next two weeks.They were told and assured by the district attorney that this video would be released, and they believe that this will have a significant impact on the community there in Memphis. I did ask him, you know, it sounds like the U.S. attorney and other officials are bracing for this to be a really, you know, awful video. They're worried, it seems like, of the reaction of the public. Mr. Crump did not want to speak to that, he just did say, though, that the family, the Nichols family's focus is getting justice for Tyre Nichols. They've characterized this video as violent, as savaged, and we heard the family attorney say that he was used as a human pinata for these three minutes that they say they saw officers beat him. In fact they said, you know, they don't want to release too many details about what they say in this video because of the active investigation. But they did say at some point you could hear Nichols say, what did I do? So again, you know, the family is really focused on trying to get justice for Nichols, but they are adamant again, Jim and Erica, that they want this video released within the next two weeks. We are, you know, leaning on the district attorney's office and asking them what's the holdup here, guys? You know, the family has seen the video. We're waiting for it to be released, so as Shimon said, this could be any day now, but we don't have a specific time when will it be released.",

It seems that the D.A. is waiting on the decision about charges, whether or not these officers are going to face charges before he releases this video. And I think part of that is because they want to show, before they release this video, that they have taken some kind of significant action.There is a lot of concern, and I've covered several of these stories, but I have not seen concern like this over how a community will react in quite some time. And it seems that everything that the authorities are doing, they're trying to tell the community, we are taking action, we are doing things, so just be prepared and know that we are going to take action. And I think that's what we're waiting for here, is for the D.A. to certainly make that decision. In listening to Ben Crump talk and the family talk, they certainly expect charges that Crump met with the D.A. just a few days ago, so all of this points to some significant action perhaps here from the D.A. in the coming days.",

If they're named in the report, but not indicted, they have no way of protecting their reputation.And we just want to make sure that this case proceeds without any possibility of interference by the early release of a report when there's really no need, Jim.
