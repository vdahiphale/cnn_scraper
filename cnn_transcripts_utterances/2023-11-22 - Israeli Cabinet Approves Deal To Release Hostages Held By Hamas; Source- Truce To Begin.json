They've been captive since October 7, when Hamas terrorists stormed the border with Israel and brutally murdered 1200 people.Now the first hostages to be released are expected to be women and children. In exchange, Israel agrees to pause its assault on Gaza for four days, release 150 Palestinians from Israeli prisons and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza that could include hundreds of trucks carrying fuel and supplies. Now for families of the missing in the past 46 days have been unbearable. And these next few hours will be just as intense as they wait to find out whether their relative will be among those freed.

And then shortly after that, we expect the transfer of Israeli hostages to begin, women and children. It'll be a small number each day, over the course of four days somewhere in the range of 10 to 12.We don't know if they'll all come out at once. We don't even know yet frankly, how they'll come out. It will be as the other Israeli hostage just came out way at the beginning of this war, or if there's a new plan to bring them through one of the other border crossings. Crucially, at this point and speaking with the families, it seems they haven't heard who's coming out yet. And that's what part of that makes this so nerve wracking for them. They want to know if their loved ones are part of the 50 that will come out in this first tranche but that as of right now is unclear. Meanwhile, on the flip side of that, in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, there will be the release of Palestinian prisoners, also women and children. 150 of them for the first 50 Israeli hostages released. It's unclear who on that list comes out from Israeli prisons. We have looked at that list of 300. It is largely for what are considered smaller offenses, such as throwing stones or connections to a terror organization. So not any of the major offenses. Most of those Palestinians, if not all of them are from the occupied West Bank or Jerusalem. So, we'll see how that process plays out. We are also at the same time seeing ongoing fighting in Gaza, large scale Israeli airstrikes from the video we have seen coming out of there, red alerts indicating possible rocket fire from Gaza. It's important to note though that that does not mean the agreement is off. It simply means the pause in fighting hasn't started yet. We still have every expectation that it will take effect at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. So, nerve racking moments for the families as we wait to see this agreement take effect here. And what the world hopes, frankly, will be a much larger possibility for a ceasefire. But as of right now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising the war is still on when this pause is over.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Audie, we know that there were weeks and weeks of painstaking negotiations that ultimately got us to this point. What we have learned is that shortly after October 7, there was a top-secret channel of communication that was established, including just a small number of White House, Israeli and Qatari officials to essentially negotiate with Hamas about the hostage situation.And of course, what we saw last month was the release of those two American citizen women from Gaza. And when that was successfully executed, it essentially signaled to U.S. officials that they had a bit of a blueprint in place to effectively negotiate with Hamas over these hostages as slow going, that communication was at times. But there were many, many challenges that U.S. officials and their Israeli counterparts and their Qatari officials as well confronted when trying to negotiate with Hamas, we learned that Hamas was refusing for a period of time to offer any identifying information about the hostages. This turned out to be a major sticking point. We also learned that in recent days, Hamas for a period of time went dark, just was unresponsive when messages were sent to them. And when they finally resurfaced, they raised issues about Israel's IDF raid on the Al-Shifa Hospital. And so all of this made for sort of a painfully slow and touching go process throughout the weeks that the negotiations were going on. Of course, there were many, many phone calls and conversations that took place between President Biden and other top aides here and their counterparts in the Middle East region as well. Some of these conversations we were told were so sensitive at the time that they weren't even read out in real time, which is pretty unusual. And now Audie, what the White House is hoping for is that three American hostages at least could be among the 50 that are released. Here's Jon Finer earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

How does this complicate things for your military strategy going forward? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: Just let me give a brief comment on the last report that we're hearing what you just broadcast. The 240 people that have been held by Hamas, the emotional roller coaster that has been reflected in the reports that you just broadcast it. And indeed, the emotional rollercoaster of entire country being torn to pieces. By the actions of Hamas office terrorist organization, just exemplifies specifically why Hamas need to go. I would say that the reality on the ground is one where we will receive our instructions from the government. We will hold fire. We will take up defensive positions in order to be prepared for any attempt of Hamas to try and take advantage of the situation.

As the Israeli military indicates very clearly that it will continue to carry out its military operations to take out Hamas forces and infrastructure inside Gaza up until that truce actually goes into place. In the meantime, though, what we are witnessing and hearing across Israel is the anxiety the extra anticipation of so many of these families in particular of the children and women being held hostage inside of Gaza, as they wait to see whether or not their family members will be part of that initial release of 50, women and children hostages released over the next four days. Many of those families -- some of whom, I've spoken with today are still in the dark about whether or not their families will be part of this round.
