      "sentences": "It's Monday, February 26th, right now, on CNN this morning, Donald Trump closer to clinching the Republican nomination, cruising into Michigan with momentum and a message of unity ahead of Tuesday's primary.Nikki Haley trounced on her home turf, then finding out one of her biggest financial backers is cutting her off. And a critical test for President Biden, will Michigan voters punish him for his handling of the war in Gaza? All right, it is 5:00 a.m. here in Washington. You are looking live at Capitol Hill on this Monday morning. Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to be with you. On the eve of the Michigan primary, Donald Trump is dominating and Nikki Haley is soldiering on as her future in the nomination fight becomes increasingly grim. Trump, riding a wave of momentum after trouncing Haley by 20 points in her home state of South Carolina. His Republican Party continuing to fall in line, the number two Senate Republican John Thune of South Dakota endorsing him over the weekend. Nikki Haley's campaign meanwhile says that they raised a million dollars after her Saturday night's speech. But the big money starting to dry up, one of her biggest backers, the Koch Brothers announcing they're cutting off funding for her campaign. Haley says she's staying in at least until Super Tuesday, warning that Trump is divisive and a loser in the general election. The former president, of course, does not see it that way.

And Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has been calling on voters to cast their ballots as uncommitted in the Democratic Primary to protest the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. All right, let's bring in Sophia Cai, she's national politics reporter for \"Axios\", and she joins us now. Sophia, good morning, it's wonderful to have you here. Look, I want to start with where things stand with Nikki Haley and Donald Trump in the wake of that really bruising loss. Now, she does though, keep talking about 40 percent, right? Forty percent of Republicans who backed her in her home state -- Donald Trump trying to say, hey, the Republican Party is unified. He stood up on that stage with most of, you know, South Carolina's elected officials behind him, certainly that's the image that it painted. But the reality here also highlights some of the struggles that Trump is going to have in the suburbs in particular, when we get to the general election.

That could be what we're beginning to see here. Why does it matter? Why is it important? Well, the Prime Minister who's just resigned, Mohammad Shtayyeh has said that it's important for the Palestinians to form a government of national unity, a government that is made up, not of different factions, but of competencies of people that are competent to fill the roles. And all of this is important because the United States has been championing the cause and the path forward for an independent Palestinian state. And one of the prerequisites for that is to find a Palestinian governing body authority that can actually take on not just the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority is right now, but Gaza, as well. And it comes as well at a significant week when Russia has invited all the Palestinian factions from Gaza, from the West Bank, from all around the region to meet in Moscow. So, this will give them an opportunity to hammer out that national unity position. Is this going to mean massive fundamental change in the short term? No. But it also underscores how unpopular the Palestinian Authority president is right now in the West Bank. A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to a very well trusted and respected pollster in the West Bank, who said the Palestinian Authority president has a disapproval rating of 92 percent, and that reflects across the whole Palestinian Authority.",
