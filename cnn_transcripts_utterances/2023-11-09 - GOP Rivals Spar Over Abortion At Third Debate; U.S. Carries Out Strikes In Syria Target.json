Two American fighter jets conducting an airstrike on a weapons warehouse in eastern Syria used by Iranian-backed militias. That, according to the Pentagon.Now, it comes the same day an unmanned American Reaper drone was shot down off the coast of Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Now, you're seeing it right here. This is the video. It was released by the Houthi military media. The U.S. strike, a response to a growing number of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria. Since October 17, U.S. and coalition forces have been targeted at least 41 times by one-way attack drones or rocket attacks. And since Hamas' attack on Israel last month, the U.S. has sent significant firepower to the Middle East as a deterrent to a widening conflict, at least according to administration officials, and to show support for forces in the region. Joining us now is the Iranian ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani. Sir, we appreciate your time. Thank you for being here. And I want to start with the strike that the Pentagon talked about last night. They said it was at a warehouse that contained weapons utilized to attack U.S. forces and that warehouse was affiliated with the Iran Revolutionary Guard. What is your response to that? AMIR SAEID IRAVANI, IRANIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS (via Webex by Cisco:  Hello. Thank you for having me on this program. As I may say that any attacks U.S. forces in the region (INAUDIBLE) Syria, I think we can divide it in two parts. One is the part before the 7th October operation, and the second after that. Before the 7th of October, I think that the Syrian resistance movement -- they are seeing that there are some parts of the country have been occupied by the United States and they are supporting the separatist group inside Syria and they are squandering their natural resources. So it is a natural reaction by the resistance group against (INAUDIBLE). But after the 7th October, I think that it is action that the resistance group -- they will show the same the same party and supporting the allies in Palestine, which is facing a very criminal attack by the Israeli regime. So we have said very clearly that Iran is not involved in any attack against the United States forces in the region. It is a natural reaction by the resistance group. It is their own decision and by their own direction. MATTINGLY:  To that point, we have seen attacks from Hezbollah in Lebanon toward Israel with Houthis in Yemen, including shooting down the U.S. drone last. Shiite militias in Syria, as we discussed, against Israel and U.S. forces, not to mention what we saw on October 7. The connective thread from all of those groups is Iranian support. You say there is no direct connection to Iran. Do these groups operate unilaterally? You don't believe Iran has any say over what they do or what attacks they launch?",

But it has two sides. One side, we are giving -- going -- we are telling our other allies in the region that keep calm.

And then they would subscribe to a monthly service. Now, gathering some of that information is a way to possibly protect some of these women, but it also means they have a lot of your personal information and it opened some of these clients up to possible vulnerabilities. Now, I certainly wondered what makes this high-end. Why do they keep describing this as a high-end brothel? And according to prosecutors, they're describing it that way because of the type of apartment that they were using. Apparently, these apartments rented for over $5,000 a month in some cases.
