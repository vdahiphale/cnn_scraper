Authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, are moving from recovery to a salvage operation after Tuesday's deadly bridge collapse. Officials have yet to provide a timeline for replacing the bridge and reopening the port. Federal investigators say they've obtained about six hours of voyage data from the container ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Four construction workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The bodies of two others were recovered Wednesday. Search teams are contending with debris and dangerous conditions both above and below the water, as well as the ship's cargo itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER HOMENDY, US. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD CHAIR: We did bring in one of NTSB's senior hazmat investigators today to begin to look at the cargo and the cargo manifest. He was able to identify 56 containers of hazardous materials. That's 764 tons of hazardous materials, mostly corrosives, flammables, and some miscellaneous hazardous materials, class 9 hazardous materials, which would include lithium ion batteries.
