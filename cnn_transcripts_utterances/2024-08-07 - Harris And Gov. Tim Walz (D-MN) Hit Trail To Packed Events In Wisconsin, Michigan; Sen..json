Welcome to a special edition of NewsNight, State of the Race.Good evening, I'm Sara Sidner in New York. Abby Phillip is off tonight. Let's get to what America's talking about right now, the trail getting hot. On their first full day of campaigning, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz hitting packed rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan, and their opponents are working hard to define her new running mate, including the serious accusation of stolen valor. Here's one clip the Trump campaign is highlighting tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states. And we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.He said, we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this -- what was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. (END VIDEO CLIP) SIDNER:  All right, it's fact check time. After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Walz retired in May of 2005 and started his first political campaign. It wasn't until two months after he retired his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq. In September that year, the unit goes to Camp Shelby in Mississippi to prepare for deployment. And in March, the following year, the unit deployed to Iraq for 22 months. Walz filed paperwork with the FEC as a candidate for Congress in February 2005, three months before he officially retired. It is true that Walz was never deployed to a combat zone as part of his service. But let's discuss. And I want to start with our veteran at the table who is also known Kamala Harris for a very long time, Montel Williams. Thank you for being here.",

Neither one of them were in major combat. SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATORI also think when you enter the arena of politics, your public statements and your record are subject to scrutiny. And I do think there's some evidence that Walz has at least embellished at times his record, to some degree. One thing on the fact check we're not talking about tonight is that when his campaign started for Congress, he did issue a press release acknowledging that he'd already been notified they may be going to Iraq. We're not talking about that much, but he knew it. He did get out and he did choose to go into politics. That's a fact you can say it's not bad or it's good or it's indifferent but that is a fact. And so I think the Trump campaign Is going to pick over his record just the same way the Harris campaign is picking over J.D. Vance's record, which I don't know if you guys pick up the paper lately, but it's been a pretty substantial vetting and I think Walz is going to get his time as well.",

Vance for spending four years in the military. I'm not going to demean him because he was a press officer in Iraq. He went, he served, good for him.But I think what it reflects more than anything else is there is a kind of -- there is a flailing going on right now on the part of the Trump campaign to try and figure out how to deal with Walz because he made I think a strong impression last night. He's, by all measures, kind of the all American guy. He was a from a small town, school teacher, coach, and years and years of service to this country. And, you know, I kind of think Americans are tired of this and this kind of politics. And -- MARC LOTTER, FORMER TRUMP 2020 STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  But the one thing I would say, I mean, David, I would disagree that they're flailing on how to define him. It's very easy. His record is even more radical and liberal than Kamala Harris hopes to be. So, it's a very easy record to attack. In this case, though, I think what we're finding out is there's been a long history. There were attacks on George W. Bush's military career. There was obviously a lot of tax on John Kerry's military career by Chris LaCivita, who now runs Donald Trump's campaign. When you embellish that record -- and it's little things, not just whether you were carrying the weapon of war into war, but saying that you retired as a command sergeant major when you never achieved that rank because you didn't complete the school. You were promoted to it. But you had to complete the school, you retired, you go back down to E.H., you go back down to sergeant major, yet his biography still lists him as the Command Sergeant Major. Little things like that though, start to add up over time, and I think when you're -- as we're --",

This did not happen. I know it's an article of faith on the BlueAnon, fever swamps of the left. This did not happen. He was specifically talking about -- he was specifically talking about the automotive industry and the policies that he has versus the policies of the Democrats. Everybody knows it.And for the president of the United States to go out, in my opinion, and try to convince half the country that we're going to effectively, what he's saying is we'll have a civil war if one side wins or one side loses is the height of irresponsibility, in my opinion. So I don't agree with the way President Biden handled this tonight. Also, I have great confidence in the constitution and in the diffused system of elections that we have. The guardians of our elections is the diffusion among the county clerks, the volunteers, the secretaries of state, the people at the local level. That's why this works.

Kamala Harris' itinerary this week gives us a window in what I think is the most important strategic question facing her campaign, which is can she reopen more pathways to 270 by competing not only in the swing states of the Rust Belt, which are these -- that she has done in the early part of the trip. But where she'll also be later this week in the Sun Belt in theSouthwest and what would have been in North Carolina and Georgia if not for the weather. Now, if you go back to 2020, the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt were both close. The Rust Belt was close. The Sun Belt was really close. Biden won Georgia by 12,000 votes, Arizona by about 10,000 votes, Nevada by 34,000 votes. This time, Biden had largely fallen out of contention in those Sun Belt states. If you look at the difference in his vote between 2020 and 2024, the biggest change is that his vote has eroded among younger -- and younger people, and people of color. And because the Rust Belt states are older and whiter, paradoxically, they have held up better for Biden than the Sun Belt states that are younger and more diverse. I mean, look at the difference here. We're talking about this is the share of the voting age population by race. Pennsylvania, Michigan, about three quarters white, Wisconsin over 80 percent white. The actual electorate is even more white than that. And Georgia, Arizona, Nevada are younger and more diverse. And because Biden had eroded specifically among those kinds of voters, they looked more difficult for him this time than last time. But look at this. This is the poll that came out today from the Marquette Law School poll in Wisconsin, which is, I think, indicative of what is happening throughout the Rust Belt states. And what it tells us is that Harris is at this point meeting a critical test. She is largely holding Biden's vote among white voters, which means that even if she can't put the Sun Belt states back into play and there is that risk that she will get closer but not get over the top in any of them, that the pathway through the Rust Belt of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin may still be available to her. That's an inside straight. If she wins those three plus Omaha, the congressional district, she gets exactly to 270. And here you see the pathway, her margins among both college and non-college white voters almost exactly the same as Biden's four years ago when he won all three of those states.",
