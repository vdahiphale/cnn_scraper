The court's conservative majority delivering that historic decision over the federal charges, which accuse Donald Trump of trying to overturn the 2020 election.

There is some hope among Democrats that this ruling will, in fact, light a fire under voters, or at the very least distract them from last week's debate.

This is a truly terrifying moment that we have seen. We're seeing inAmerica that a president of the United States can effectively have immunity on a number of fronts. We are seeing the Supreme Court, which Donald Trump put three conservative justices on the court, which are ruling on a lot of these decisions, in a favor that is not congruent with where the American people stand. We're constantly seeing 6-3 rulings on this court. And it's important to note, Erica, that the next president of the United States could pick two more Supreme Court justices on this court. So, there's a lot at stake. And when you're looking at the contrast in this election, you saw President Biden from the White House tonight really laying out there -- or last night laying out to the American people what's at stake, what this ruling could mean, how dangerous it is, especially if Donald Trump comes back into the White House, what he could do with this type of immunity. It's truly terrifying. And, again, this is a reason why President Biden is running for reelection. He's the only person who beat Donald Trump. He has -- he's built a broad coalition that is necessary to beat him again. And it's critically important that the American people understand what the contrast is and what's at stake.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL):  We have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn't just a horrible night. But I won't go beyond that out of my respect and understanding of President Joe Biden, a very proud person who has served us extraordinarily well for 50 years. But it's his decision.

We're going to continue to get him out there, to go to battleground states, to really make it clear what's at stake in this election. He's going to continue to go to these states, talk to voters, have these conversations. And, Erica, I want to just think -- sometimes, I think we lose sight of this, when we're talking about the day-to-day machinations on a campaign. President Biden has accomplished more as president of the United States in the first three-and-a-half years of his presidency than the previous presidents in 50, 60 years, four major economic bills, the first black woman on the Supreme Court, student loan debt relief. I mean, we -- the list goes on and on. You only get that stuff done if you know what you're doing, if you know how to work with lawmakers, if you know how to work in a bipartisan manner.

      "sentences": "So the Manhattan district attorney's office has just weighed in, and they say that they don't oppose postponing the sentencing in order to allow Trump's legal team to brief this issue following the Supreme Court's decision.So, what the DA's office is saying is that they still think Trump's legal team's position is without merit, but they said they don't oppose the briefing. So they are saying they would agree to a briefing schedule where Trump's team would file their briefs first. And their -- the DA's office briefs would be due on July 24. Now, Trump's team is asking for oral arguments. So, if the judge agrees to any of this, then the oral argument could follow. So we're looking at Trump's sentencing potentially being postponed into August. But, ultimately, this is up for the judge, Juan Merchan, to decide. He has not weighed in on this, but since the DA's office is not objecting to it, it is possible and likely that he would postpone the sentencing. Now, we also obtained the letter that Trump's legal team sent to the judge, who are saying that they wanted to brief this issue following the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity. And what they're highlighting are specific parts of testimony and evidence that came into the trial. Among them, they said Oval Office conversations. One piece of testimony that the jury heard was Michael Cohen saying that he met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office and that's where they discussed the reimbursement scheme. So they're arguing that that sort of evidence should not have come in and should not have come before the jury -- the jury in this case. Now, they had initially raised this question of whether evidence should come in over presidential immunity, because they had already knew they were challenging it. But the judge in the case said they had done it too close to trial. So he didn't even consider that ahead of time. Now the question is before him now that the Supreme Court has ruled, and we will see what he does. But the next step here is going to come from the judge to see if he does adopt the schedule that the prosecutors are OK with and if he does then postpone Trump's sentencing to some time in the future -- Erica.",

He was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, deeply well respected by the bar there, clearly someone who had great influence over prosecutions when he was there. Now, in recent years on the defense side, he had picked up what Donald Trump wanted to do and took it into court. And in this opinion that is now being issued by the New York Supreme Court, they're saying that all of these charges are about Rudy Giuliani pushing false and misleading statements as an attorney for Donald Trump and his campaign after the 2020 election to courts, to lawmakers, and to the public at large, and that nothing that Giuliani has said in these proceedings that he has faced in the attorney discipline system have made it seem as if he were acting in good faith or that he had the knowledge that these things were actually true.
