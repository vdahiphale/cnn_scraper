If you are just joining us, let me get you up to date on the latest stories.With just three weeks to go until election day, U.S. midterm races are heating up. Debates held across -- or were held across Monday night in two key Senate contests in Ohio and Utah. Both races could help determine the balance of power in the U.S. Congress this fall. In Ukraine officials are reporting more Russian strikes across the country this morning including three strikes on an energy facility in the capital of Kyiv as well as explosions in Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. We are just hours away from the opening bell on Wall Street. And here's a look at where U.S. stock futures stand right now. They're all up. As you can see, on Monday investors saw stocks rally and the Dow saw soared about 30,000. So, they're hoping for another good day there. Trading is already underway across Europe and also very positive news up more than 1 percent, as you can see, across the main indices. Markets have also been loving the major U-turn by Britain's new finance minister, Jeremy Hunt. Nixed most of the previous fiscal plan including those tax cuts that rattled investors and sent the pound plunging. He says the U.K. must show it can and always will pay its way in the world. The move has dealt a serious blow to the Prime Minister's credibility. During an interview with the BBC Liz Truss apologized for going too far too fast with the rollout of the economic reforms. Despite a possible revolt from within her own party, she's vowing to stick around and lead Conservatives into the next general election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, you have this party that is pretty divided. Of course, Liz Truss got into office in the first place because she really appealed to the base of her party, people who wanted all of these conservative things. They wanted tax cuts. They wanted more growth. She was sort of reading from that song book. Rishi Sunak obviously tried to be a lot more realistic about the situation and he knew what the situation was given the fact that he was the Chancellor. He represents, obviously, a different section of the party. Penny Mordaunt is probably more aligned with Rishi Sunak on a lot of these but perhaps more of an unifier. But obviously it was Rishi Sunak who gathered the most votes amongst his parliamentary colleagues.So, it's not like there's a definite obvious answer to who would step in if Liz Truss were to be forced out. Of course, remember she has one year under the party's own rules before she can face any kind of leadership challenge. Though course, the same thing happened to Boris Johnson, is the committee that makes the rules, would just threatened to change them and then that would force her out anyway.",

Another crisis is unfolding in China's all important property sector. Giant developers have defaulted. Home sales are dropping. Homebuyers across the country are boycotting mortgage payments on unfinished homes, fearful that their properties will never get built. These protesters chant, evil developer, give back my property. KERRY BROWN, LAU CHINA INSTITUTE DIRECTOR, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: The Chinese property market is probably the world's greatest economic asset, single economic asset. If it does collapse, then we have a full blown recession, maybe even depression. WANG (voice-over): Xi Jinping is preparing to be ruler for life, claiming that his brand of authoritarianism will realize the China dream of strength and prosperity.
