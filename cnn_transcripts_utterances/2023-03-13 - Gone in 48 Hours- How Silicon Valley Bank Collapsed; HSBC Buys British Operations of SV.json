This hour, we explore the ripple effects of the Silicon ValleyBank collapse and what it means for the rest of the world, including this region of the Gulf and Middle East. Up first, the heavy losses mount in Baton Rouge is the war of attrition there between Russia and Ukraine grinds on. Ukraine says fighting continues around the clock bark maintains that the situation is under control. Half a million Israelis took to the streets in the 10th consecutive week of anti-government protests the largest it seems so far. Critics accuse Benjamin Netanyahu of enacting policies that will crush Israel's democracy. Chaos at the BBC subsides at least for now the network's Highest Paid Presenter Gary Lineker will resume his duties on its flagship football show after a recent impartiality storm. The former professional football player criticized the UK government's asylum policy, prompting the BBC to ask him to step back from his presenting. CNN film Navalny has won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature Sunday's Academy Awards. Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is currently serving a nine year sentence in a Moscow prison. His family at the ceremony dedicated the win to him. Right you're back with us for the second hour of 'Connect the World' and you are more than welcome in the last few hours U.S. President Joe Biden, reassuring the American public that the banking sector there is safe. It comes after the biggest failure of a U.S. Bank since 2008. Silicon Valley Bank the victim of an old fashioned bank run of after a fire sale of securities at a loss spooked customers, or despite shoring up any contagion effects today, the U.S. and indeed now the UK scrambling to prevent this from ballooning into a wider financial meltdown. So tonight we ask, is this the start of a bigger banking crisis or joining me to unpack this complex myriad of interest rates macro-economics and banking systems is Mohamed A. El-Erian, Chief Economic Adviser Allianz. And Ryan Lemand, who are Co-Founder and CEO of New Vision Wealth Management based here in Abu Dhabi? Let me start with you, Mohamed, simply do you believe? Or what do you make of the action; firstly taken to avert what looked like a ballooning crisis. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER ALLIANZ SE: So I think it makes total sense that both in the U.S. and the UK, the authorities move to protect the deposits, and not protect the shareholders or the bondholders. So I think that was appropriate, I think the way in which it was done if you compare and contrast the UK to the U.S. I think the UK was cleaner. But it would then it was easier for the UK because it was a smaller SVB entity, they're more generally, what we are seeing are the consequences of a prolonged period of very loose monetary policies followed by the Fed hitting the brakes. And we should just be aware that the probability of financial accidents has have gone up.",

The understanding is that inflation would have gotten further out of control.And we are staring down the barrel of a very hard lending as far as a recession is concerned. Your point is it seems that they didn't raise rates quickly enough. And now, the problem is, are they in a position to keep rates high enough given that there is some, it seems real systemic issues in the banking sector? Is the Fed in a position to keep rates high enough to avoid a further risk of inflation? And a very hard landing, what's your perception at this point? EL-ERIAN: So your analysis is absolutely right. Remember, for most of 2021, the Fed kept on assuring everybody inflation is transitory. Transitory Becky is a very dangerous word, because it means temporary, it means reversible, it means don't pay attention; this thing is going to go away. So people didn't adjust to what turned out to be not transitory inflation. And a number of us were warning, look, be careful, this is different. And then when it finally retired that word from its vocabulary, if you remember, at the end of November, it didn't do anything. And it is not so much that it started raising interest rates. So it was very vague. It says if you're driving down a freeway and motorway, and you should be slowing down, but you're not your foot is pedal to the metal. And then suddenly you realize that you are on this insulation fog, and then you slam on the brakes. What will that do? It will tend to cause an accident. And that's exactly what has happened.",

And you say there is a possibility or the risk of a real accident here? How depositors feel at this point? You know, we know that depositors around the world were really concerned about what would happen to their bank accounts this Monday morning, and then Fed rate hikes take that on? EL-ERIAN: So first, let's start with the deposits, because that's important. Deposits are safe. People in the U.S. in the UK, where there has been policy announcements should not want to the banks to move their deposits, your deposits of fine, there's no need to worry. The second issue is I'm more worried about what Becky you and I called the non-banks, the financial institutions that are outside the banking system that are even less well regulated, less well supervised, that are where the imbalances can occur in a systemic sense. And finally, what you point out is what I call the dilemma. How does the Fed in this environment now that is so late balance, controlling inflation, financial stability, and third and foremost, minimizing the damage to the economy and drops. It has become much harder to meet all these objectives?",

OK, so it's not only about SPV. Second, let's look at the region here. What we know is that there are roughly 500 startups in the MENA region Middle East and North Africa that are clients of SVB. Over the weekend, there was a lot of angst among many of these startups. I know a few here in the UAE, they were very afraid. And what's even worse is that vultures were surrounding them and telling them sells us your deposit for 60 cents on the dollar, because on Monday, you won't have anything. Now thankfully, all of them have waited until Monday. And here we are deposits are guaranteed for these startups. As Mohamed has said these deposits are safe.

Gary Lineker was well known as a former England football captain. But for the last couple of decades, he has been perhaps the most well-known sports presenter on the BBC. The nation's national broadcaster hosting match of the day, the iconic weekly, Saturday Night Football show that you and I grew up watching on a Saturday night with our families. There has been an apology and admission from the BBC that perhaps their social media guidelines which were reviewed and rewritten in 2020 left a grey area, particularly when it came to the likes of Gary Lineker, non-political or news journalists and broadcasters on the channels. Those who are freelance and appear to discuss other topics than politics the BBC as the national broadcaster upholds impartiality as one of its great cornerstones. And that is what they said was broken when Gary Lineker tweeted as he did last week, reacting to the changes to the UK government's asylum policy saying they were using language not dissimilar to Germany in the 1930s. The thing is when they took Gary Lineker off air; so many other big name football hosts and pundits followed his lead and said they would not be coming back to their broadcasting duties whilst this was ongoing. And from there football clubs said their players would not be talking to the BBC. There were changes in the scheduling in the networking and really, the BBC was left with no other option than to admit there had been some wrongdoing. And now this independent review has been put into place. Its interesting Tim Davie said that until the review is seen through Gary Lineker will abide by the impartiality, social media guidelines. But very quickly, he responded, yes, as part of his thanks to the BBC, he brought the issue back to what he had been hoping to highlight last week. He said this, a final thought, however difficult the last few days have been it simply doesn't compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war, to seek refuge in a land far away. It's heart-warming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you; he is not going to be silenced. And there is an argument; he is not the political editor of the BBC. Do people really think that what Gary Lineker, the football host tweets on his platforms is a reflection of the political views of the BBC. What we do know with 8.8 million followers, he is certainly very, very influential. And how these impacts these guidelines, these policies moving forward will be fascinating to see.",

The diplomatic breakthroughwas mediated by China and it was announced in Beijing on Friday. Now many are hopeful that it can usher in a new era of reduced hostility in some of the region's most complex areas of conflict such as, for example, Yemen, and Iraq. But they go on one country that has been silent on the agreement is Israel. Of course, a major foreign policy goal for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been to create a regional alliance to counter Iran. But we have heard from former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid who tweeted saying that while he was in power, Israel and Saudi Arabia signed an aviation agreement and \"all this came to a screeching halt when the most extreme government in the country's history was established here. And it became clear to the Saudis that Netanyahu was weak, and the Americans stopped listening to him\". Well, joining me now is the former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk. Martin, I have to ask you on the widest story, before we sort of hone in on Israel. What do you make of or what did you make of that announcement on Friday, a Chinese brokered coming together of two massive regional rivals Saudi and Iran. And it's that rivalry which is created so much of the crisis and conflict that we see in this part of the world, the Middle East and, and Gulf? MARTIN INDYK, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Well, I think that it's a papering over those deep-seated rivalries that you refer to, between the leader of the Sunni Arab world and Sunni Muslim world or Saudi Arabian leader, the sheer world, which is the Iranians. And we've seen the manifestation of that rivalry all across the region for a long time now. So, to imagine that these, this reconciliation, which has been underway for some time, promoted by the Iraqis, and the Omanis, before the Chinese came in, showing some diplomatic agility in pulling off this agreement. But nevertheless, I don't think it has dealt with the fundamental rivalry between these two countries and neighbors. But it reflects a kind of tactical move on both sides to calm things down for the moment, because the Saudis want the Iranians to help stop the Houthis from attacking them from Yemen and the Iranians, I think, want the Saudis to stop backing the dissident movements in Iran and minorities in Iran.",

There's no doubt that Israel has benefited from the fact that the Saudis and the Emiratis and the other Gulf states as well have seen acommon interest and a sense of common threat from Iran. And that has driven the normalization process; we saw the Emiratis take the lead on and resulted in the Abraham Accords. But also, significant steps that Saudi Arabia has taken towards Israel, short of full normalization. Netanyahu coming to power, again, thought very much that he could drive this to full normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. He thought he could taste it, he thought it was real. And he was excited by this prospect. And so now that instead, the Saudis have gone off and normalized relations with Iran, Israel's great adversary, this has struck a blow to Netanyahu's hubs. And because everything is so political now in Israel, given the broader context here of, of what's going on, with the judicial reform, and the people out in the streets opposing it. So, the opposition has used this as an opportunity to show that Netanyahu's dream of, of peace for peace has been deflated. And he, of course, is turning around and blaming them. So, it's become a bit of a political catfight here. But I have to tell you, Becky, that it's really not the primary issue by any means. In Israel today, it's all about judicial reform all the time.",

It will be hard for them for the emirates Bahrainis Moroccans, to maintain a warm embrace of Israel, in circumstances where, you know, Arabs across the region as seeing on their screens every day, clashes between the Israeli army and Palestinian youth, militants and so on.

The movie, the story of the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the investigative journalists who trace the plot back to Russia.

He has crippling stomach aches. His lawyers say that he's been prescribed very strong antibiotics that are inappropriate that are making his stomach cramps even worse, he has no access to his family. But at the same time, I think everyone understands that the more this film is in the limelight, the more people pay attention and the more engaged they are with the work of Alexei Navalny. And the current plight of Alexei Navalny, the more it becomes difficult for the Kremlin to punish him potentially by, you know, in the worst-case scenario killing him. So the hope from his family and friends and of those filmmakers is that this Oscar will only go to afford him an added measure of protection.",
