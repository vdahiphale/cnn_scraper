These cases were junk.But actually, what the department is doing here is they're setting out the course of how this would look like if something like this ever happens in the future. And those words, \"dismissal without prejudice,\" that's about highlighting that it's only temporary where a president can't be charged with a crime. So Judge Tanya Chutkan in the January 6 case, she wrote, \"Dismissal without prejudice is also consistent with the government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\" So all of this is about acknowledging you just can't have a sitting president facing a court proceeding like this. The other thing they did was dismiss an appeal that's ongoing against Donald Trump in the 11th circuit federal court related to the classified documents case -- bringing that back. But the Justice Department wants to continue that appeal related to his two co- defendants there.",

PETE SEAT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON IN GEORGE W. BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION, VICE PRESIDENT, BOSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS GROUP (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, welcome to a four season reboot of words versus actions where Donald Trump says something but doesn't necessarily follow through on what he says. There are plenty of examples of that during his first term. There are plenty of examples also, John, of his verbal threats forcing and compelling action on the part of other parties, particularly when it comes to foreign countries. They hear these threats, and they genuflect to the bully pulpit and do as Trump says. So I think the real question is what will happen in these next two months? What will Mexico and Canada do to try and stem the flow across the border? And what will China try to do to stop the trafficking of fentanyl?

You have thousands that have been killed and over a million displaced in this conflict. Now, again, this Israeli security cabinet meeting -- where this Israeli cabinet meeting will take place later today, so we'll have a final answer at that point. But if we go through what's in the deal just to give people an idea it's potentially a 60-day ceasefire. So guns would fall silent and no fighting between Hezbollah and Israel for a period of 60 days. Diplomats are hoping that will allow them to lay the groundwork -- this period of quiet would allow them to lay the groundwork for a lasting truce. That would be based on actually what is an 18-year-old U.N. resolution -- U.N. Resolution 1701, which ended the conflict back in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. And so, U.S. diplomats believe that reviving that resolution -- Resolution 1701 and using it as a blueprint during potentially, a 60- day ceasefire -- that could bring the much needed quiet on that border and bring this conflict to a close.

William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign and one of the country's most persistent advocates for poor and working class Americans. It's good to see you. Thank you for coming back in. This blueprint -- in this blueprint you say the winning equation is what you call fusion politics. How is that different from what other Democrats, like Kamala Harris, have already tried to do? REV. WILLIAM BARBER, CO-CHAIR, POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN, PRESIDENT, REPAIRERS OF THE BREACH (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I don't frame it so much of what Kamala Harris has tried to do or has not tried to do. Actually, she had a tremendous campaign and had points of this. I think in our whole political system we're missing something. It's a theological framework that also has political significance. It's called the stones that the builders rejected can be the chief cornerstones in building a new reality. Who are the rejected? Moral fusion says you look at what unites people regardless -- not left and right, Democrat-Republican, but what unites us. And one thing that we find is that in this country right now we have 87 million poor and low-wage people who have not -- who do not -- who are potential voters. Thirty million of them did not vote. We did a study and asked why, and the number one reason was no one talks to us. No one talks to us. And what connects them. For instance, the issue of living wages. There is not a state in this country, particularly all the battleground states where poor and low- wage voters don't make up at least 40 percent of the electorate. And yet, many of them do not vote because they say nobody talks directly to us. If we were to have a campaign around living wages, we're talking about over 40 million people who would be raised up out of poverty and low wages. We've not had a conversation and not moved the minimum wage since 2009. The minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and $2.13 an hour for people working as waiters and waitresses. That is immoral and we need to talk about it in that sense. We have over 800 people that are dying a day from poverty and low wages. We need to have this conversation in our public discourse and speak to the people who feel like they are being rejected. And oftentimes, lastly, our debates and our conversations -- you think about it. We have debate after debate after debate and you don't have nobody running for president gets asked this question. If you get elected, how will you address the 140 million poor and low-wage people in this country? And what will you do specifically -- not as a Democrat or as a Republican, but as a moral agent to make their lives better? And how will you raise the living wages? How will you make sure people have health care -- but framing it on a moral perspective. Three hundred fifty thousand people died during COVID from the lack of health care. It's COVID. The essential workers. How are we talking to those people who make up 40 percent of the electorate in battleground states?",
