Also coming up, a top Russian general killed in Moscow. New details on who may be behind that attack just ahead. Plus, the drone mystery continues with U.S. National Security experts batting down conspiracy theories. And back in custody, a woman who stowed away on a flight from New York to Paris is caught again trying to flee to Canada. Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. Indices somewhat searching for direction this Tuesday, traders waiting for news on the central bank's next rate cut that decision at the back end of the Fed's two-day meeting, which starts today. More on those markets when they open at 09:30 New York time. First up though, we begin with a top Russian general assassinated in Moscow. Igor Kirillov was killed early on Tuesday by remote control bomb which exploded outside an apartment building not far from the Kremlin. Kirillov's assistant was also killed, and the blast left considerable damage. Now, a source tells CNN, Ukraine was behind the attack. Considering him a legitimate target because of his alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. Well, Russia calling this a terrorist act. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow, and he spoke to my colleague Max Foster a little earlier from the scene.",

And you already mentioned that the entrance to that building where all this happens, the second entrance down from here, was badly damaged in that explosion. The Russians are indeed saying that they believe that the explosive device was hidden in an electric scooter park right outside that building, and that there were about 300 grams of TNT inside that explosive device. They have already said that they found remnants of that explosive device. And one of the other things that they said as well is that they believe that it was detonated remotely. Now we do know at this point in time, Max, that the Ukrainian security services have claimed responsibility for this. A source saying that to CNN that Ukrainian security services were behind this. The explosion, despite the fact that 300 grams of TNT might not sound like very much, seems to have been substantial. We can see that there's a lot of workers here on the ground. Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the ground. Some others have cordoned off the area. But one of the other things that we're seeing as well, Max, if we pan over to the other side, is that the explosion was so strong that it damaged the building on the other side of the road. You can see there that windows have been smashed by this explosion that took place. There was an eye witness report that we have seen some of them on Russian media saying that they thought that maybe some sort of cement truck had unloaded a lot of cement, or what, something very heavy had fallen down on the ground. So clearly, the people who live in this area very much heard this explosion as it took place. Of course, at the beginning, not exactly clear of what it might have been. The Russians have launched a criminal investigation into all this. You can see the investigators, and we've seen the investigators on the ground here, not just civilian investigators are from the police authorities, but also military investigators as well. Of course, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, very important for the Russian military, very high up in the Russian military. He was the head of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical defense forces, and the Ukrainians had actually indicted him in absentia. Just yesterday, the Ukrainian Security Services accusing the Russians of using weaponized chemicals in the war in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov, for his part in the past, had accused the Ukrainians of doing the exact same thing. So certainly, someone who was on the forefront as far as that conflict between Ukraine and Russia is concerned, and someone who the Russians, of course, for their military, was extremely important.",

      "sentences": "Becky, it's pretty rare, and I'll get to that in a second, but we have seen recently a bit of an uptick. Butfirst I want to bring you a video that CNN has obtained from a source with knowledge of the operation. This shows the moments just before the blast. You can see two people emerging from that building. The source has told us that one of those was Kirillov. Now we're not showing the moment of the explosion. You can simply see the dashboard here, but I don't know if we can play that again. And you can see, just by the lamp post, just next to that doorway, is something that looks like a scooter. We know from Russian media reports that there was a bomb, they say, hidden in a scooter, which was responsible for this attack. So, I think what this video shows us is a real sense of this being a targeted killing someone obviously watching, monitoring. We have heard reports from Russian state media that this was a remotely detonated device. So that speaks to the sophistication and, of course, the ambition here, of targeting someone at such a high level. But as I mentioned, we have seen recently an increase in this. There has been, in fact, we believe four. This is the fourth incident in two months where Ukraine has directly or indirectly admitted responsibility for the assassination of a military figure in Russia or in Crimea. In the case of one of them, there was a pilot with the 52nd heavy bomber regiment in Bryansk in late October, then a senior official with the Black Sea Fleet in November. And just last week, a top designer with a Russian sort of military industrial company believed by Ukrainian source with the security services to be responsible for upgrading cruise missiles used on Ukraine. So, this the fourth such incident. This is the highest-ranking military official that we've seen targeted, and I think look clearly in the context of this war, as the clock ticks down to Donald Trump taking up the U.S. presidency for the second time, questions around military aid. And Russia still inching forward on the Eastern Front, it speaks to Ukraine's rush here to use any means they can to seize the initiative.",

Just to be clear, here we're talking in various incidents CNN's reported CS gas, riot agents like that on the front lines. He's also been sanctioned by the U.K. for the use of these sort of riot agents, these choking substances. The U.S. has also sanctioned Russia for the use of these. So, they are credible.

All the while, Syria's new leaders continue their push for international legitimacy.

There are foreign terrorist designation sanctions that are imposed on the new leaders in Damascus. So, it really depends on which sanctions we're talking about, but what we're seeing now is parallel conversations on what conditions can be put forward in order to assess if and when these sanctions could be lifted. So, the U.S. is considering lifting the terrorist designation sanctions on Abu Mohammed Jolani himself, but on his group, Hayat Tahrir Al Sham. But they're also rightfully so, thinking about what conditions need to be met by the group in order for the U.S. to consider lifting these sanctions. And I think that's incredibly important, because rushing to remove these sanctions without putting forward clear benchmarks to what needs to happen in the transition, I think might backfire. So, it is key that the West and the U.S. in particular, clarify what is it that they expect to see in these upcoming months. And it's also key that the Biden Administration coordinates with the Trump Administration on these conditions.

Well, new details are emerging about America's latest school shooting that has left two people dead and six others wounded in Madison, Wisconsin.

Law enforcement has not been able to identify or make any contact with that person. Moving forward, Becky, the big questions are, how did this 15-year-old obtain the handgun she used to kill two other people and sent several others to the hospital. Law enforcement does not yet have an answer on that. They say that they are working to figure out who the gun belongs to and how she got it. What we do know is that there is a pretty specific time line that was outlined yesterday. This started at 10:57, when crushingly, Becky, a second grader in another classroom called 911, to report the shooting. Law enforcement says this was confined to one room. It was confined to a study hall where a mix of students had gathered. They say that a full-time teacher was killed. As you mentioned, a teenage student was killed. What we know is that a substitute teacher was also injured. Sadly, there were several children, again, including that second grader who called 911 who heard this shooting unfold.
