For the first time, we are hearing from a Michigan State University professor, Marco Diaz-Munoz, who was teaching his literature class, when a gunman burst in. and attacked his classroom. And the professor says the gunman fired 15 shots. In all, three students were killed, five others injured. And throughout this hour, you will hear what he saw that night and, how he and his students are now dealing with the horror, they have lived, and the loss they are suffering. It comes as we're learning new details, tonight, about the shooter. According to Police, he had a note, listing more potential targets, including two schools, in New Jersey. He had a disturbing amount of ammunition, and weapons, on his body, and in his backpack, including two nine-millimeter handguns, nine loaded magazines, and a pouch with 50 rounds of ammunition. Now, I want to bring in Miguel Marquez, who spoke to the professor, in this gripping interview that we are going to share with you, in full. And Miguel, as we begin, tonight, with this special coverage, have, Police found any connection yet between the shooter and the school?",

Now, Miguel Marquez spoke to him, conducting this heartbreaking interview. He's back with me now. And Miguel, the terrifying thing is that a mass shooting happens just way too often, these days. There was another one after that this week, right, in the mall, in El Paso? And I'm sure that many of these students had grown up doing drills, right? But they were drills. But yet, the professor just described to you the reaction in the classroom, when the shooting began. And it's incredible what he described already. Did the training help?",

I remember, as you were driving there, Adrienne, you joined us on the phone, when we had no idea, what was happening, and there was just a shooter on the loose. John Miller, also with me, our Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst. So, John, let me start with you. The professor, telling Miguel, the gunman walked into the back door, of the classroom. He said, at least 15 shots were fired. And then, the gunman left. And then, now we know eight loaded magazines, in the backpack, right? 50 more rounds of loose ammunition. And all of this, he - you know, I think one of the most - I mean, he said so many powerful things, here, to Miguel. But \"It felt like an eternity even though it was about a minute.\"",

He got pretty far away. He wasn't aware that they were looking for his exact description. Was he going to continue shooting, at other places, on his target list, the next day?

But then, in the reality, of the moment, as Professor Munoz said to you, it is so very different. And there is this question of why, not just in the macro, but in the micro, John talking about the note, found in the shooter's wallet. And that's really all we know.

Or they're standing there, just looking at the memorial, and in tears. Or they walk up to the memorial, and they break into tears. It is just it is incredibly hard to understand how something like this could happen. This guy seems to have no connection to the school at all. And the only thing Police are saying, right now, is that he feels - he seems to have felt slighted, because certain businesses, in the area, over the past several months, or years, threw him out, or had asked him to leave, at some point. And that may have been why he had that list. It is just frustration, confusion, chaos, and it's going to be really hard, for folks here, to sort of make sense of it.

But when you get between the lines, if you've looked at other gunmen, in other cases, he's a classic profile. He's an injustice collector. These businesses that slighted him, or threw him out, or didn't hire him? He has stored these things, and they have rotted within him. He's also a loner. He's isolated. He writes in the note, \"They hate me. Why do they hate me? I'm alone. I'm neglected. I am what you made me, a killer.\"And the real question, Erin, is I get the places where he had run-ins. But there's no real explanation for going to Michigan State University. You could posit that a guy, who was completely isolated, completely alone, and very angry, looked on that university, as the center of town, where people belonged, where people were together, where people were succeeding, and he wanted to try and break that, which, obviously, despite the tragedy from all we see tonight, he certainly did not.",
