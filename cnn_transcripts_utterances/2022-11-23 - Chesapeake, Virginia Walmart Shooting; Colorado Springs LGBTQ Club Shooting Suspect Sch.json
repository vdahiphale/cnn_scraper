We asked him what he's been able to glean from the details that we have so far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  There's the customer area, which most of us are used to being in. You go, you buy your items, you check out and you leave. But there's a separate segregated area for employees, the break room, where they have their down time. We're told from a law enforcement source that this shooting took place primarily inside that area. So, that's key for investigators because that tells you that the person appears to have at least some access or familiarity to that particular area. And, secondly, looking at the timing of the shooting, we're told that this took place just around the 10:00 p.m. local hour. This store itself close just an hour later. And so, you know -- you know, I've covered so many of these shootings. And you know, this is a -- not to get too morbid but, obviously, if you're a shooter whose intent on causing widespread carnage, that would not be the time of day that you would try to shoot as the store is getting ready to close. And so, that tells me as a former investigator, this appears to be very personal. The person, perhaps, is one of so-called injustice collectors that we talked about, you know, so often than this shooting or someone who had some kind of personal grievance. Of course, that will all come to light as investigators continue to conduct their investigation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In both explosions, in both attacks, police say that more than 14 people have been injured and we just learned that a 16- year-old is the one who died from his injuries. He was here at this bus stop when the attack took place. He was a 16-year-old religious Yeshiva student. But this is a deadly escalation. What's already been the most violent year for both Israelis and Palestinians in years. But bombs like these, parcel bombs that are placed at bus stations and the potentially detonated remotely, well, Israel hasn't seen attacks like these in years. This is bringing back memories to the Second Intifada, to the early 2000s. when there were regular bombings at bus stations, on buses, restaurant, at shops and things like that. But this is something that Israelis have grown rather used to not seeing. Despite this being a very violent year for Israelis and Palestinians, most of the attacks targeting Israelis have been knife attacks, shootings, rammings. On the Israeli side, the West Bank is an incredibly volatile situation. The Israeli military is doing regular incursions there. More Palestinians have been killed in any year since 2015. And we've seen the rise of new militant groups. Now, no group has yet claimed responsibility for this attack. But this type of attack is showing a level of sophistication, of coordination that other attacks that have happened recently have not seen in recent years. Now, the Israeli Prime Minister, Yair Lapid, is the outgoing prime minister, said he's going to be holding a situation assessment and will also be in talks with the incoming prime minister, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, again. This is currently a quickly developing situation. Coordinated double attacks. The likes of which Jerusalem and Israel have not seen in a very long time. And now the biggest concern is whether there will be more such attacks, more such coordinated attacks, because already, Max and Bianca, the ground has felt very dry. The (INAUDIBLE) is very dry for something very big, potentially even a third Intifada. So, the question is whether this the moment that it starts. Bianca, Max.",

We do have a storm system moving into the Northern Rockies, that may produce some snowfall. But it looks like the delays for Salt Lake City and Denver will be some minor delays.And developing system across South Texas, I'll talk more about that in just one second. And we think it will primarily be volume delays across the northeast and into New England. So, that's where you have problems where the flights kind of get backed up, and stall a little bit but it's not going to be weather related. However, as we go into Friday, different story. Weather system develops across the South Central U.S., moves towards the east and as a result, I think, Boston, New York, Newark, Washington D.C., those areas will be impacted by weather. So, you might anticipate those minor delays becoming, perhaps, more moderate delays. And then for Dallas and Houston, it's rain. But if you were to travel towards Midland and Amarillo, it looks like this is going to be maybe an icy mix or perhaps some snow. Either way, we have got some cold air on the back side of this. Out ahead of it, along that I-10 corridor, look for some wet weather, could be heavy at times as well. Thanksgiving Day forecast, Mild in Washington, D.C., even Chicago will see about 52 degrees. And what about New York City for the big parade? Well, it looks fairly, it's cold but it's going to be relatively mild. It doesn't look like wind is going to be a problem there. Temperatures 30s and into the 40s. All right. What about for Sunday? Everybody trying to get back home so work can start on Monday. Chicago, it looks like that may be a little problematic as that storm system moves across the region. Delays could be a little more significant across the I-95 corridor from Boston, New York, Newark, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. look for delays there. Atlanta, lots of people crowding into the world's busiest airport. Millions will move through the thresholds here trying to get into or out of the city. And we could see the development of some Santa Ana winds across Southern California for the most part. All right. What about that rainfall I was telling you about. Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, Jackson, Mississippi, South of Atlanta, that's where the congregation of the heaviest precipitation will be noted. A couple of inches for the most part in most of those areas. But this is a developing storm system across the South Central United States, back side of it, as I mentioned, that's where the snow or that icy mixture will be located. And we'll start to see by Saturday, area of low pressure move off the eastern seaboard. But then right back into some of that messy weather all the way from the Great Lakes to the mid-Atlantic and down towards Florida. Hope everyone has a great holiday. Back to you guys.",

Little Saudi Arabia in footballing terms, the second lowest ranked team in this tournament beating the might Lionel Messi's Argentina. It was a result that their French coach, Herve Renard, described as totally crazy. And you can see just what it meant by the reactions from the players and the fans. I mean, Saudi are one of the -- well, the closest competing country to Qatar here on a thousands of fans have traveled just a short distance by road to be here. And it means so much, not just to Saudi Arabia as a footballing nation, as a country but to this region as a whole. We saw Qatar's Emir waiving the Saudi flag. Sending his congratulations. Fascinating from Renard. He said his team only going to be allowed to celebrate for 20 minutes and then they've got to get back to their focus, focus on the job in hand which is their next match against Poland on Saturday. Argentina, for their part, well, Messi just said there were no excuses for that performance from his side. He said, though morale was dead after the match. But did urge fans to stick with them, as you mentioned, many people's pre-tournament favorites. And if you look back to 1990, they lost their opening game then to Cameroon and still went on to make the final. It was Germany or West Germany, as they were known then, in 1990 who took the victory in Italy. They kick off their campaign today. A very much looking make amends for what was a really embarrassing, disappointing tournament in 2018. They went out in the group stage. But it's a really tough group E. Also, in there with the 2010 world champion, Spain, they kick off their campaign against Costa Rica.

The Biden administration has gone to the Supreme Court asking them to allow for the implementation of the program while these legal challenges play out.Now, about 26 million people have applied for the student loan relief. And 60 million of those applications have been accepted and approved. But the Department of Education has notified people that they can't discharge that debt with this program currently tied up in the courts. But so many people have been facing questions about whether the student loan repayments would begin come January as this relief program is tied up. And now the president is saying that they will offer them a bit more relief extending that pause until the summer. Arlette Saenz, CNN, traveling with the president in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

A gunman has killed multiple people at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia just two days before Thanksgiving in the U.S. A law enforcement source tells CNN the shooter was believed to be a current or former employee who took his own life. Walmart has issued a statement saying, it is shocked to the tragic event and praying for all those who've been impacted. CNN's Brian Todd reports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  It could be a few hours, at least, until they can give us some information on the dead and wounded. You can get a pretty good picture that this is going to take maybe a few hours. I mean, it is overnight and they've got, of course, as many resources as they can. Police units, and many of them responding to the scene, tactical units and others. So, they're, you know, very well versed at going through scenes like this. Chesapeake in the Tidewater area of Virginia is not a small area. They're between the towns like Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach, they're all fairly close together. It is a very heavily populated general area. Chesapeake, itself, not all that big but it's part of a fairly large, what you would call, maybe a metropolitan area in that Tidewater area of Virginia with several mid-sized cities. It's very close together. So, you know, the police units in these cities are not -- you know, they've -- they have a lot of resources. But they've got to comb through a very large building with potentially a lot of people still in it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
