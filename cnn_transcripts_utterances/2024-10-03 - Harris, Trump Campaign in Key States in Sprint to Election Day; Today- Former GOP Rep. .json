And it is those fundamentals that are most important even if there are policy disagreements among the Independents and conservatives that she is trying to reach. But listen, not every voter here I spoke to convinced by this message. I met one man. He's actually going to be attending the remarks tonight.

They're also investing in this up on the airwaves.But listen, not all Democrats think that this is the right strategy, some Democrats I speak to say they think the campaign instead should be investing in the base of the party, speaking to black voters Asian voters, Latino voters and stop trying to chase these Republicans. It is notable though, this strategy because the former president isn't employing something similar. Yes, he has former Democrats out for him stumping on the campaign trail, but there isn't formally organized Democrats for Trump equivalent for instance. And so that just gives you a sense of how much they are prioritizing this. The Wisconsin Democrats tell me they think it's the right strategy. Boris? Brianna?",

He often doesn't bring it up in his speeches.For example, today, we don't expect him to talk about abortion. But at the same time, he tries to grab credit for that overturning of Roe v. Wade whenever he can talking about how no one else could get it done by - but him, so it's something he's clearly grappled with. And here you see the former first lady going against something that is essentially one of his signature achievements while in office, something that he has touted as one of his signature achievement, the overturning of Roe v. Wade time and time again. And she is coming out against it at a time where we have seen her almost zero times on the campaign trail. She was there when he announced his candidacy back about two years ago, but other than that she has been missing from the debate, from any significant event and from all of his court appearances and now we see her coming out.

And you're talking about small businesses that have been impacted, and people's homes, more than 70 percent of the area is without power. So the best way to see it is from the vantage point of the air. And obviously, they have Marine One and the other helicopters here that can survey this damage here. We know the Governor of Georgia talked about the 33 deaths across the state of Georgia. This storm will be one that many people here will never forget because of its immense impact. I'm talking to the Small Business Association here in town and they believe there will be several hundred businesses that could be impacted greatly. And then when you put in the fact that Agriculture is such a big deal here in the state of Georgia, from pecans to cucumbers, to bell peppers, there have been farms that have been decimated by this storm. So the impact will be felt for some time. There are ice and water stations set up across this county. But people are really just trying to get any sort of resource they can, because as we know, this economy has been so tough over the last few months. But these people really do need help. And, of course, with the President in town, what they're hoping for is those federal dollars to come surging in to help get the infrastructure back up in place. But over and over again, we've talked to people who've been concerned just about not being forgotten, because obviously the images from across the country have been so strong. But when you start driving around this area, you really do get a sense of the vast impact that this storm had, and because of how wide and how large it was, and all the trees that were damaged in this area. So we do have this immense security presence here and then we'll take the President over to another location where he'll be touring some of the damage here. But I think a lot of people are just hoping that with the President's eyes on this situation, and the Governor's eyes on this situation, and even the former President Donald Trump's eyes on the situation, that something will happen here in South Georgia and that has been the big hope so far. So Brianna as we wait for the president to come off this helicopter, it's a really a lot of those anticipation of what could happen next. Now, I talked to one business owner today who said they can't afford to take another loan because obviously they took a loan during COVID, so they don't want more debt.
