America'stop diplomat will try again to salvage a deal for the release of dozens of hostages in Gaza. Extreme weather hits California. Heavy rain and high winds bring power outages and potentially serious flooding. Deadly wildfires sweep through Chile, leaving little but rubble and ash thousands of homes there has been destroyed. And Taylor Swift makes history at the Grammys and announces her next album on the same night. Well, the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now. The futures markets at least indicating a lower opening assume some profit taking on at least the DOW Jones Industrial average after another record close on Friday. We'll check in on those markets as they open at the bottom of the hour. Well, the top U.S. diplomat back in this region, today pushing for a truce in what is now the nearly four month long war and urgent humanitarian help for Gaza. Antony Blinken faces even more challenges this time around and this is his seventh trip to the region since the war broke out with the war spilling outside of Gaza's borders. Now the Secretary of State's first stop is Saudi Arabia where he has just arrived after that he'll visit Egypt and Qatar. Both have been heavily involved in truce negotiations. Blinken then visits Israel and the West Bank. This is happening as Israel's military again warns civilians to leave parts of Gaza City and Khan Yunis. It's not clear how many people are aware of the orders with internet and mobile service once again unavailable across much of Gaza. Meantime, the U.S. National Security Adviser promises there will be further action against the Iranian backed militia in Iraq and in Syria. The U.S. says dozens of targets were hit over the weekend in retaliation for the deaths of three American soldiers in Jordan, the U.S. and U.K. also hitting Houthi targets in Yemen. Again, it's -- there continue trying to attack commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Excuse me, there's a lot to unpack. We've got Natasha Bertrand connecting us from the Pentagon. Ben Wedeman is in Jordan's Capital of Amman. Let's start with you, Ben. And a sense from you about what happened over the weekend, these retaliatory strikes as we are sort of terming them by the U.S. on targets in Iraq and in Syria. And what may happen next, where are we at?",

I mean there are those in this region that suggest that frankly, Washington has no strategy for the wider region at this point. And that is worrying and frustrating many governments around this region and leaderships. The Middle East currently resembling a cauldron that risks really boiling out of control at this point this is Antony Blinken's latest visit to help defuse tensions. It is his seventh visit as far as I can account since October the 7th. And frankly, things have got worse not better. What do we understand to be his very specific priorities on this trip?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think Blinken is hoping to get more of a sense for the appetite for a ceasefire deal, right.I mean, that is the primary goal of the United States because everything is kind of stemming from that. The U.S. understands that these Iranian backed proxy militias they have ramped up their attacks on U.S. and coalition forces since Israel and Hamas went to war in Gaza. And the Iran-backed militias are saying they're doing it in solidarity with the Palestinians. So are the Houthis. These Houthi Iran-backed attacks coming out of Yemen towards commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Those are also linked to the war in Gaza. The Houthis also saying that they are going to continue their attacks until that war is over. And so one of the key priorities for Blinken while he's in the region, is going to be trying to come up with some kind of solution here whether that is a further path towards Israel and Saudi Arabia's normalization of diplomatic relations which would then come with some kind of recognition of a Palestinian state, maybe once after this war is over. Or whether it's just making additional progress on hostage release where the Israelis are with where Hamas releases the hostages that are still in its custody. And Israel agrees to a longer term pause in the fighting that would then ideally subsume these attacks by these Iran-backed militias and the Houthis coming out of Yemen. And so the really the priority here is to try to get to some kind of even temporary peace. So that the wider region, the tensions there are eased a bit. But that is obviously going to be a huge, huge task for Blinken who has gone to the Middle East before has come back relatively empty handed. And so I don't think hopes are particularly high for this trip. However the U.S. as of it's still working very hard of course, to come to some kind of ceasefire or temporary peace in the region.",

And the wildfires are likely to continue in the next days due to a heat wave that it's been affecting the country in the last past days. As you can see in the images is a real nightmare. Not only houses, but also the parks that -- and even animals and a lot of other stuff and very popular things that are recognized here in the region of Valparaiso have been totally consumed by the flames. At least at this point there are 112 people that have been killed due to these wildfires. And this number just like you was saying it's very likely to increase. President Gabriel Boric has already said it's a very tragic situation. It's the biggest tragedy after the earthquake that we had in 2010. At this point we still have at least 300 people that are still reported missing and the authorities are trying to look for the people but the situation is very tragic. Their priority as the government says at this point is to rescue people to evacuate the people and try to contain the flames. But as far as the firemen tried to extinguish some wildfire a couple of minutes later, another wildfire starts. And it's a very complicated situation. The people right now here in the location of -- in the region of Vina del Mar (ph) is trying to clean the ashes to remove the rubble. But they're also asking for help for the government for special machines to remove all the woods, of all of the ashes and other things so they can start all over again. They're also asking for more security because they also reported that having seen some people trying intentionally to start some other wildfires. The government so far has already declared a curfew in four towns of the region of Valparaiso but the situation is still very critical. The heat wave that it's been affecting our country in the last day is going to continue at least until tomorrow. So this situation is going to be very tough and very -- for all the people here in the region. As you can see in the images of my cameraman -- the fire consume absolutely all of the hills in the park, in the location of the -- one of the towns that has been more affected by the fires. We've been talking with the people. They say they're scared. It's a very complicated situation. And they're still asking for more help from the government. So far, President Gabriel Boric already said we'll have two days of national mourning. And we'll see how this situation is going to develop in the next days. But the authorities are also saying they're especially calling all the people to follow the instruction of the military and all of the authorities, Becky.",

There are highways that are open. Yes, but this is like a game of trying to move the barricades where the flooding is happening because water is going up and the water is going down. We've had 300 millimeters of rainfall on top of the mountain right here and another probably 100 millimeters to go. That all has to come down through the rivers, creeks and streams and out into the Pacific Ocean. This is going to take a while. This flood may last two to three days for some people that are all the way down river. Up on top where the land is moving because people put really big houses on dirt cliffs up there.
