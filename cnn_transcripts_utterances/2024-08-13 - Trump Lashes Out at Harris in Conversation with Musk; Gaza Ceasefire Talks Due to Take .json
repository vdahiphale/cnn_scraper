And we begin in the U.S. as former President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a friendly and public conversation for more than two hours on Monday. They spoke live on Musk's social media platform X. They covered a broad range of topics including energy policy, climate change and immigration. With Trump promising the largest deportation in the history of the country. He also recounted the assassination attempt he survived last month. The event started more than 40 minutes late due to technical problems. Musk said they were caused by an online attack that overwhelmed the company's servers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the momentum around Kamala Harris continues to build. Donald Trump promoting far right conspiracy theories around his Democratic challenger. Falsely claiming on social media that the crowd size at Harris Detroit rally was AI generated. Writing, quote: This is the way Democrats win elections by cheating. And they're even worse at the ballot box. Adding that anyone who is willing to fake their crowd size, quote, will cheat at anything. Recent polling showing Harris improving on President Joe Biden standing in several battlegrounds with a close race in the critical states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump's allies imploring the former president to focus on policy, not personal attacks. KEVIN MCCARTHY, FORMER U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: You've got to make this race not on personalities.

It's going to be their first joint campaign appearance since Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Now, it's going to be interesting to watch how Kamala Harris navigates this. Because, on one hand, she, of course, is going to want to stand next to the man who essentially put her at the top of the ticket, who made her vice president.But yet, at the same time, she has already tried to distance herself from some of his more unpopular policy decisions, particularly around immigration or inflation and crime. We also know Republicans are seeking to tie her to Joe Biden in a negative way, so she's really going to have to walk this fine line as she figures out how she's going to campaign with Joe Biden in this now very tight race.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama will take the stage on Tuesday, and we're hearing both Clintons are also in the lineup. Hillary Clinton will speak on Monday, eight years after she herself accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for president.And former President Bill Clinton will speak on Wednesday. The Clintons were quick to endorse Kamala Harris after President Biden bowed out of the race. Israel says its military is on high alert as the country prepares for a potential attack from Iran. Both Iran and its most powerful proxy, Hezbollah, have been vowing to retaliate after the recent assassinations of two Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. Amid the escalating tensions, the U.S. is strengthening its military forces in the Middle East with a guided missile submarine and carrier strike group expected in the region soon. The U.S. has also released previously approved funds of $3.5 billion to Israel to spend on weapons and military equipment. The Israeli military says it's taking the threats seriously and is at the highest level of readiness. U.S. President Joe Biden, along with the leaders of France, Germany, the U.K. and Italy, are calling on Iran to stand down on its threats of an attack against Israel. And the U.S. and its allies are also expressing their full support for efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza just days ahead of those expected negotiations. The source says Hamas is planning to attend those talks on Thursday, although the group hasn't made any official announcement just yet. And over the weekend, Hamas issued a strong statement urging mediators to implement the ceasefire plan put forward by President Biden in July. We'll see now as Paula Hancocks here to discuss this. And, Paula, let's get to the ceasefire discussions in just a minute. First, the IDF say they are at peak readiness. We know that the U.S. has sent some serious military hardware to the region. How is Israel preparing for this? What more are we seeing in terms of their readiness and their response in the region?",

We know that, obviously, the mediators, the U.S., Egypt, Qatar, will be trying to bring out this final bridging proposal, is the way they put it. But what Hamas has said is that they have agreed to what was agreed upon last month.The proposal that the U.S. president was very vocally supportive of, that the U.N. Security Council was very supportive of as well, and they're calling on Israel to step up and to agree to that particular proposal. I think from this statement we've seen over the weekend from Hamas, they don't want to go back and rehash the entire deal. They are saying they are happy with the proposal as it is. We also have a source telling us that they believe Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, is ready to sign up to a ceasefire. But, of course, we're hearing both sides blaming the other for this not going any further at this point. So we'll have to see what happens on Thursday. Israel has said that it will send a delegation. We'll have to see if Hamas comes to the table as well and if they can actually push this forward after those key assassinations.",

A lot of people say that not enough has been done. But the other reality is here that you've got this fire that started around 40 kilometers outside of Athens, sped rapidly because there wasn't sort of assistance initially when it was daylight, the sun goes down, and then there's very little that people can do on the ground, and that's when the fire spread into the suburbs. I mean, people were absolutely shocked. What the government is really good at, though, Christina, is evacuating people, but a lot of people choose to stay behind because they want to protect their homes. And we've been seeing the images of people just using hose pipes to water down their homes. And funny enough, that actually does work. It does put people's lives at risk, but they're thinking about how they can take their own, you know, efforts forward. A lot of people help on the ground. I mean, it's really incredible to see the community side of things. But at the end of the day, they know that come the season, you've got high winds, you've got an extended heat wave, and then you've got the fire hazard as well. And experts say, it tells us, that this is going to become not only an annual thing, but it's also going to be exacerbated on a yearly basis as the climate changes in Greece because so much forest has been burnt.",

You know, because the advice is, that they're giving the residents, is stay out of the sun between the hours of 10 o'clock and 6 p.m. Now, that's prime tourism time, and so you see long lines outside the Colosseum, you see people throwing their coins into the Trevi Fountain, and you see people trying to, you know, share any tiny little bit of shade they can find.You know, the cities put up palm trees at the bus stops to try to give some respite, but at the end of the day, it's almost as hot in the shade as it is out in this incredible sun. One of the things about these heat alerts, though, you know, there'll be 22 cities on Wednesday that'll be under heat alerts, is that the heat doesn't subside during the night, and so many people don't have air conditioning in their homes, and a lot of people are, especially the elderly, especially the vulnerable, if you have respiratory problems and things like that, you know, you're seeing those people showing up in emergency rooms with heat stroke symptoms. So, you know, we talk about this every year, it always gets hot, but it seems to be getting hotter, staying hotter longer, and those long, you know, the nights are not cooling off, and that really makes it difficult for anyone who suffers from any sort of heat-related, you know, ailment -- Christina.",
