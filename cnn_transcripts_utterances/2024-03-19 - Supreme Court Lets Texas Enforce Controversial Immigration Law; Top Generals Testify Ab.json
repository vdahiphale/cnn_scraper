This is to so a lot of chaos at the border, frankly, at a time when we don't need chaos.How Texas is going to implement this is going to be challenging at best. How they're going to quickly mesh, you know, their practices in terms of arresting perceived undocumented immigrants with the federal -- the Border Patrol's efforts and overall federal government's efforts will be very difficult to implement. And I think the final thing here is I'm going to expect some copycat legislation to be popping up in other states very quickly, not necessarily border states. I would expect to see a state like Florida. Now that the Supreme Court has essentially at least given a greenlight, even if only temporarily, you've got to expect a state like Florida and some other states that have been very vocal on these issues to try to implement their own form of this legislation.",

And you can see how you would expect that to go.So as this proceeds, at least in the interim of this issue of this law making its way through the court, we have to be very clear about that, right, John, is that this isn't the last word when it comes to this law, that is still something that is proceeding at this point. What do you think about the court saying, in the interim, we are going to allow this to proceed? What kind of message do you think they're sending by not wanting to interfere, but letting this proceed in what we're going to see is a bit of an experiment in states' rights on this issue?",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly, you would think that the court, by lifting this injunction, that it means there's a greater likelihood that they will -- ultimately will validate that the Texas state law, allow it to go into effect fulltime.Of course, that could change in the way this is implemented that could also make a big difference. So you know, look, the argument centers around whether or not this conflicts with federal law. And I think what Texas was doing, frankly, exactly what Arizona tried to do, is write this legislation in a way that made it look consistent with existing federal law. I have my doubts about that. Obviously, the crux of this issue, as we've discussed a million times, there's our asylum laws and then the fact that we give rights to individuals who come into the United States to make an asylum claim. I'm not sure how this -- this Texas state scheme is going to be reconciled with that aspect of it. And frankly, I don't know how Texas is going to be actually to be able to deport people to Mexico is they try because, of course, they need the permission of Mexico as a sovereign nation. Or, and candidly, Brianna, most of these migrants are not from Mexico. The majority are from other countries. I don't know if Texas -- Texas' plan is to start initiating repatriation flights to Honduras or El Salvador, how they would actually coordinate that. But look, as it relates to the court, I mean, you are right, this is temporary. And things could change depending on how it's implemented. But certainly, I would think that this is indicative that the Supreme Court is more likely to validate the statutory scheme than they are to invalidate it.",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, officials at the White House are still pouring through this recent decision by the Supreme Court, but it certainly will be a disappointment for the Biden administration.The Justice Department had long argued that this law down in Texas is conflicting with the federal and constitutional standards, noting that enforcement of immigration has been left to the federal governments in the past. Now President Biden, right now, is in Reno, Nevada, a bit north of where we are in Las Vegas. He just wrapped an event and we will see whether he might speak to reporters about this decision from the Supreme Court. But it does come at a tense moment in the 2024 campaign when border security issues have really risen to the top of many voters' concerns. We know that this is an issue that has proven to be a liability for President Biden. The Republicans have tried to weaponize the issue of the border against the president. But the president has tried to push for that bipartisan border policy, a lot that -- that was negotiated in the Senate but ultimately, was scuttled by Republicans at the urging of former President Donald Trump. This also comes as we have seen these tensions between the federal government and the state of Texas over how to enforce immigration policy. Texas Governor Greg Abbott doing things like bussing migrants up from the U.S. southern border up towards northern states. You've also seen the Justice Department waged in this fight with Texas over that concertina wire along the border down there. So this is just another episode in this one long-standing dispute with the state of Texas over how to address the issue of border security. So we will wait to see what the White House has to say a little bit later today. Just yesterday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had been asked what the administration would do if this law were allowed to go into effect. She would not get into the details of that. But it certainly will be a blow to the Biden administration as they had really tried to stop the -- to prevent the enforcement of this law, which the Supreme Court has now said the state of Texas can do. Of course, there are still legal challenges playing out in the federal appeals court on this level as well.",

Congress can be very loose and careless and absurd often in trying to use the subpoena, as they tried to put the attorney general, Eric Holder, in contempt of Congress. But it -- this does start to get back to normal. And I think Congress should -- should really get its own inherent power back. And there have been a number of bills have just been ignored to do that. Because they do have this power, but they've deferred to the Department of Justice to enforce their contempt citations.",
