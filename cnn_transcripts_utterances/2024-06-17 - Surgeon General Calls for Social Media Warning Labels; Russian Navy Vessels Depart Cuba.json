He says social media is so harmful for children and teens that it should be -- it should come with a warning label like the ones you see on tobacco products.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. VIVEK MURTHY, SURGEON GENERAL:  Not only have companies not demonstrated that their platforms are safe for kids, but there is growing evidence of harm. A warning label would help parents to understand these risks. Many parents don't know that those risks exist. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, the surgeon general has been talking about these risks for some time now. Last year, publishing an advisory warning about these potential risks to children. And today, citing data in this op-ed, noting that kids on average spend almost five hours per day on social media. That's according to Gallup data as of last summer.And he notes a study also that was published in JAMA Psychiatry that says that kids who spend at least three hours a day on social media face double the risks of mental health problems, like showing symptoms of anxiety and depression. He also cited data showing that nearly half of adolescents say that social media makes them feel worse about their bodies. Now, a surgeon general warning does really hearken back to the 1965 warning that was put on cigarettes after that landmark surgeon general advisory that went out the year before that. And of course, over the ensuing decades, we've seen cigarette use decline. He also cited things like putting in legislation to require seatbelts and airbags and crash test dummies to make cars safer. He also cited things, even this year, like the FAA grounding a bunch of planes after we saw the 737 MAX 9 issue with the door plug mid- flight, or even things like recalls of dairy products because of Listeria contamination. So, these are the kinds of things that the surgeon general is citing here. But of course, it would require Congress to act to put in this kind of warning.",

And he shared three tips that are really important for parents to know. One is to have the conversation with your kids. That's where you have to start. Second is to try to establish phone free zone, social media free zones like the dinner table, bedtime, social experiences to try to maintain that social connection.And the third is to band together with other families so that your kids aren't saying, hey, we're the only ones with these rules in place, really trying to make sure that together your community is saying, hey, we're going to do the same things here. The surgeon general has said really before 13 kids should not be on social media.",

The official word was that they were going to use this area as a buffer zone.The next possibility, though, that -- was that they would move on to Kharkiv itself, which is the second largest city in Ukraine. That would have been a major defeat, a major disaster, really, for the Ukrainians. But the Ukrainians have been able to stall the Russians.",

There are certain tactical gains that they make, and then the Ukrainians move forward against them.The Ukrainians were reporting last night that they had surrounded a Russian unit. Now, that may or may not be the case, we're not sure. But the real issue here is that the Russians have not been able to take advantage of any gaps in the Ukrainian defenses. They have also not been able to take advantage of any type of manpower superiority that they have in terms of numbers. And in terms of equipment, the Russians have the capability to use air power. The Ukrainians do not, except for drones. And the fact is though, that the Russians haven't prosecuted that advantage at all. And the Ukrainians are getting much better at fighting the Russians and also giving them, in essence, a taste of their own medicine in many cases.",

The key thing here is the quantity is what matters. And that's one area where we have to be careful, they can be primitive yet effective. And if there's quantity, there's certainly, you know, as they say, equality all its own in that case, and we have to make sure that the west can respond in kind with these situations.",
