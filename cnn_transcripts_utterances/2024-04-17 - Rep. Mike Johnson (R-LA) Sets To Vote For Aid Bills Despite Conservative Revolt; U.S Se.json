Also tonight, very disturbing warnings from Boeing whistleblowers accusing the company of putting out defective airplanes while engaging in a, quote, criminal cover-up. We have details from their alarming testimony up on Capitol Hill. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our coverage begins tonight up on Capitol Hill where Speaker Mike Johnson is staring down a conservative revolt, vowing to put critical foreign aid bills to a vote despite Republican hardliners pushing to oust him.

They are furious over this funding for Ukraine and also the fact that it does not include border security provisions. Johnson has promised a separate vote on a border security bill, but some hardliners say that is not enough.So, there are issues now heading into some of these votes and it's looking like some of these Republicans are threatening to vote against the procedural rule. That is a key vote to get these foreign aid bills over the finish line, which means Johnson is going to have to rely on Democrats to get these bills over the finish line and he also might need to rely on them to save his speakership. Our Jake Tapper did interview the speaker in the last hour here and asked him about all of these threats to his speakership. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I've not asked any Democrats to get involved in that. I believe the House will do its will. I don't walk around thinking about the motion to vacate. It's a procedural matter here that I think has been abused in recent times. Maybe at some point we changed that. But right now, I've got to do my job, and so do all my colleagues. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, literally, Prime Minister Netanyahu is correct. We are not going to fight any fight for Israel. They will have to decide what is in their best interest.

Jean Carroll case where the jury awarded her nearly $90 million after funding that Trump defamed Carroll and also sexually abused her. They also want to mention a sanction by a judge in a different case where he found that Trump filed a frivolous lawsuit against Hillary Clinton. They also want to bring up a settlement agreement between the Trump Foundation and the New York Attorney General's Office, where Trump agreed to dissolve that foundation as part of that deal. And they also want to bring up the 2022 tax fraud convictions of two Trump Organization entities. That was just the case that went just before the same judge as Justice Juan Merchan. These are all issues they want to be able to confront Trump with on the stand to try to discredit him. Now, Trump's team has indicated that they're going to oppose some of this. The judge said that he will hold a hearing on this issue before he determines what prosecutors are allowed to do.

And there are a lot of questions of whether or not he could get a fair trial in New York. We know -- we saw Donald Trump today say that he thinks there should be unlimited strikes from his team to be able to remove people from the jury, not just the ten that they are allotted, and that's because he's worried about the makeup of New York. Biden won New York City or Manhattan specifically overwhelmingly in 2020. And that is very much playing on Donald Trump's mind here.

I don't think it would matter if it was in New York or down in Florida or where.
