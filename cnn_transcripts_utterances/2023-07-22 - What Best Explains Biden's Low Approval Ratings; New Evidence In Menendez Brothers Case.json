I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.This week, No Labels, the group seeking to mount a third party so- called unity presidential ticket in 2024 held a town hall to announce its intentions and what it calls its common sense agenda. The co- headliners were Joe Manchin, Democratic former governor now Senator from West Virginia and John Huntsman, former Utah governor and Ambassador to both China and Russia. Former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, who's working with No Labels and introduced Manchin at Monday's town hall defined their mission this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAT MCCRORY, (R) FORMER GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA; We hope we won't have to do it. But the fact of the matter is, if my Super Tuesday that we see the final two candidates, frankly, being Donald Trump or Joe Biden -- and Joe Biden, the American people are saying loud and clear, and we'll measure that again, come Super Tuesday. Right now, 60 percent to 70 percent of the American people are saying we can do better. That's not the choice we want. Now, hopefully by shaping the agenda between now and then things will change. But if it doesn't change, and we do get on the ballot access, which we will, we will present a president and vice president, president candidate on a No Labels ticket. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's much more dismal than that or they'll talk about his age and ineffectiveness. I could be making the same point about Donald Trump that I'm making about Joe Biden. My point is, it's emblematic of the time in which we're living. I mean, it's frankly, quite shocking to think that not that long ago in the Reagan '80s, he was able to win 49 states, I can't see anyone winning 49 states in my lifetime.In fact, I'll frame it for you this way, I can't think of a person on the planet. Just put aside the requirements necessary to run for president, I can't think of a person on the planet that you could put on the American ballot in next year's election who could win 49 states.",

Not necessarily that they've seen him, you know, gaffe or stumble, but just that they think he's getting up there in age, maybe he's not in charge of his own presidency, that he's a passenger in his presidency.They don't see him as a real assertive figure, so they're not maybe as inclined as they were with previous presidents to give him credit when things start turning around in the economy the way that they're doing right now.

      "sentences": "More than a dozen years ago, my next guest pretty much nailed the profile of the person who would later be arrested as the Gilgo Beach serial killer. \"The New York Times\" piece in April 2011 described the likely suspect this way. \"He is most likely a white male in his mid-20s to mid-40s. He is married or has a girlfriend. He is well educated and well spoken. He is financially secure, has a job and owns an expensive car or truck. As part of his job or interests, he has access to, or a stockpile of, burlap sacks. And he lives or used to live on or near Ocean Parkway on the South Shore of Long Island where the police have found as many as 10 sets of human remains.\"One of the experts cited by \"The New York Times\" in that piece, Jim Clemente, who had retired from the FBI in 2009 where he was a senior supervisory special agent in the agency's Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico. Clemente is then quoted as saying -- quote -- \"He did not stumble upon that location. He has some familiarity with it.\" And he also theorized it may be the time that his wife or kids or parents are away for the summer. Meaning in which he carried out the killings. Well, all of those things turned out to be true of the apprehended suspect. Fifty-nine-year-old architect Rex Heuermann, who lives near or where the bodies were found drove a Chevy Avalanche truck. And law enforcement sources are now saying that Heuermann may have murdered victims at his family's home while his wife and kids were out of town. Joining me now is Jim Clemente. He is an FBI supervisory special agent profiler who worked at the D.C. sniper case, the JonBenet Ramsey case and many serial killer cases. Today he co-hosts the podcast \"Real Crime Profile.\" So, for many of us, Jim, all that we know about your line of work we learn from \"Silence of the Lambs\" and the Jodie Foster character what is the job of a profiler? JIM CLEMENTE, RETIRED FBI PROFILER/CO-HOST, \"REAL CRIME PROFILE\" PODCAST: Basically, Michael, it's to look at the behavior exhibited at a crime scene, and the victimology, the choice of victims, to use that behavior to reverse engineer back to the type of person who committed the crime.

He didn't want his daughter to know everything about him.But other serial killers, because once they have been convicted and they know they'll be in prison for the rest of their lives, they do want to talk to us because it is sort of their last hurrah, their ability to sort of go down in history, and we use that to actually get them to open up to us.",

That is atypical, but it probably tells us that it wasn't just for hunting.

But that's why, I think, the police decided to arrest him in New York City while he was on the street so he would be away from his weapons. I think that was -- that was unusual.Also, there were things about him in his -- in his professional life in which he seemed to be very kind and caring to certain individuals, went above and beyond to explain things and be nice. That is probably -- there's probably some underlying reason why he didn't pick those particular people to pay that kind of attention to because in general, I think, he was very controlling.",

I think that is the norm.The fact that they were paying for food with food stamps tells me the relatively poor way that he treated his family. He did not hold them in high regard.

Another thing that's students deal with is that their high schools require them to do community service, you know, 40 hours before they graduate. So, they have to do that during the summer. It's a requirement. So, between all of these factors, I think, some -- and some jobs just don't lend themselves to being very flexible. You have to be available for eight weeks, for 10 weeks.
