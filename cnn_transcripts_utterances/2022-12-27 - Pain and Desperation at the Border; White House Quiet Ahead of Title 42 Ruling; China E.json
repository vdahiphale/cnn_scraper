That policy enacted as a public health measure during the Covid-19 pandemic allows the federal government to send migrants back to Mexico to await their asylum proceedings.

We're just outside a church that serves as a shelter overnight. But capacity is about 120, 130. So, a lot of people end up having to sleep on the street because once capacity -- once the church fills up, then there is no more capacity for more. Now, a lot of these migrants say that they have either desperately waited in Mexico and got tired because Title 42 was never lifted, and/or they decided to just simply cross over illegally because they felt that they couldn't do anything else. They were so desperate. Now, as you look around, you'll see that there are also a lot of children here. Those are some of the more desperate and heartbreaking stories that we've been hearing out here, just from mothers who say that their child will ask them for food, their child will ask them for something warm and these mothers don't have anything to provide. They will ask them for a bathroom. There are no facilities around here. Now, these scenes are also duplicated on the Mexican side. Jessica, like you mentioned, you said that there was -- we've learned that about 22,000 migrants are waiting in at least three northern Mexican cities. That's Matamoros, Reynosa, which is across the river from the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas, and in Tijuana, near San Diego. Facilities there are also at capacity. There are individuals who are living either on the streets and in camps. And, again, Jessica, those are the ones who have decided to wait for Title 42 to lift. There's many who are not waiting. Those are - those are the ones you see around me. Those decided to either turn themselves into authorities or to enter the U.S. illegally. Jessica.",

You know, when you ask the White House about Title 42 and the Republican criticisms that -- or the criticisms from Republicans that -- about the Biden administration's border policy, they said, well, Congress hasn't fixed this problem. Congress, for decades, could have done something to really reform the system, both on the security side and on the legal immigration side, on the illegal immigration side, and they've done nothing. And also remember the White House was also very -- pushing heavily for Congress to send them more funding to deal directly with this crisis, and they didn't get all that money that they wanted in this latest round of spending talks.

Just one more step the country is taking as it moves rapidly away from its zero Covid policy.CNN international correspondent Selina Wang is in Beijing with details on major changes in travel restrictions as well. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: China is making a major move towards ending the country's nearly three years of isolation. China is dropping quarantine for all international arrivals from January 8th and promising to gradually restart outbound tourism for Chinese citizens. Inbound travelers still need to get a 48 hour negative Covid test before boarding, but they dropped all of the other cumbersome requirements. To understand why these changes are such a big deal, we have to look at what the reality has been in China during the pandemic. The country has been severely limiting who can go in and out of the country with strict border controls. Flights have been very limited and expensive. All arrives had to go through quarantine in government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines myself, including 21 days earlier this year. And we're talking about harsh quarantines. No choice in where you get sent, no opening your door except for food pickups and Covid tests. All of that is now going away. This new change would effectively also end the ban on Chinese citizens for going overseas for non-essential reasons. But the timing is still unclear. Authorities have not said when they'll restart issuing tourist visas or allowing foreigners to apply for business, study or family reunion visas. But, finally, people are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Online searches for popular international travel destinations on China's travel booking site Seatrip (ph) jumped ten times within an hour of when this announcement was made. I've also spoken to a few Chinese citizens who have been stuck overseas for years. They are overjoyed and relieved that finally there's a way for them to see family. But there's also some bitterness over how long this has taken. They've already missed so many important moments, family deaths, births, reunions. But in response to this change, other countries are starting to issue restrictions on travelers from China. Japan announced travelers from the country will be tested for Covid upon arrival. Japan's prime minister also said the country will restrict plans to increase flights in and out of China. India announced similar Covid testing guidelines. Authorities in India said the guidelines are aimed at ensuring Covid does not spread as quickly as it has been in China. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The time requirement will jump from four months to a year starting in 2024. And that's a major u-turn for Taiwan, which had previously shortened conscription as recently as 2018. [09:45:02] Taiwan's president now says four months can, quote, no longer suit the needs of Taiwan's defense. Turning now to Russia's war on Ukraine. This morning heavy fighting reported in parts of the country including Bakhmut, Kreminna, and other areas in the Donbas. All this as Russia demands Ukraine abide by its proposed peace talks, which includes the demilitarization and so- called denazification of the regime controlled territories.

      "sentences": "So, the air raid sirens have just lifted here in Lviv, which is certainly welcome news, although what the Ukrainians think that Russia is doing is sending strategic bombers up into the air potentially to see how Ukraine responds and then plan accordingly because the Ukrainians are bracing for a potential attack either on New Year's Eve or before to try to devastate once again civilian infrastructure targets primarily, but also military targets, across this battle scarred country. Nine million people have been affected by these blackouts as a result of Russian attacks. That's according to Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned of dark, difficult days ahead and also saying the situation on the front lines in the Donbas and also to the south continue to be very dark and very painful, which is an unspoken way of referring to likely heavy casualties on both sides as both sides take a relentless pounding from each other. The artillery war on the front lines has been absolutely horrific.Also, in the cyber realm, Ukraine says that some 4,500 cyberattacks have been waged against this country just in the last year. That's a threefold increase over just two years ago. The rhetorical escalation, of course, continues. You heard the Russian foreign minister using that word denazification. They love to say that the current government, the democratically elected government here in Regin (ph) is somehow allied with Nazis. That's one of their propaganda messages that they, you know, tell the Russian public to try to justify this war. And on the Ukrainian side, its foreign minister is calling for Russia to be removed from the United Nations Security Council. It's one of five, you knew, permanent members, which gives them veto power to any resolutions to punish them for their brutality against civilians here in Ukraine. Jessica.",

GasBuddy is projecting that next year the national average will be $3.49 a gallon. Now, that is down roughly 50 cents from this year. And so that means that Americans may be spending a little less at the gas station and have a little bit more money for everything else in life. It would transfers to about $55 billion less spending by U.S. consumers on gasoline. That translates to almost $300 on average per family for the whole year.So, all of that is the good news. There is some bad news, though, here, and that is that GasBuddy does expect gas prices to go up this spring and summer as Americans hit the road again. They see the national average going from about $3.10 a gallon today to as high as $4.05 a gallon as soon as May and topping out at $4.25 a gallon next year. Now, GasBuddy does not expect a repeat of the $5 a gallon that we saw this past June, but they do see prices going higher.
