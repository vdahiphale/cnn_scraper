We are continuing our breaking news coverage this hour as the FBI investigates an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump.The former president was not harmed in Sunday's incident at his golf club in West Palm Beach, which comes just two months after an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. A 58-year-old man identified as Ryan Wesley Routh has been detained. A source says the FBI investigation has now gone global as officials look into his background. We have learned Routh weighed in on politics and social media in the past and at times, criticized Trump. At the time of Sunday's incident, Trump had been playing golf. The Palm Beach County Sheriff says the Secret Service fired shots at a man who had a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club and described what else they found at the scene.

What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the President was at, and he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engage that individual, at which time the individual took off.

A suspect is in custody, and I commend the work of the Secret Service and their law enforcement partners for their vigilance and their efforts to keep the former president and those around him safe. I am relieved that the former president is unharmed. There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened.As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety well. Well, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris also released a statement saying, I am deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today. As we gather the facts, I will be clear. I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence. I am thankful that former President Trump is safe. I commend the U.S., Secret Service and law enforcement partners for their vigilance. As President Biden said, our administration will ensure the Secret Service has every resource capability and protective measure necessary to carry out its critical mission. Well, the Palm Beach County Sheriff offered an explanation as to why Donald Trump's Secret Service protection was, quote, limited. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He clearly was in a position with especially with those two plates up in that photograph, providing additional cover and concealment.

I think that needs to be readdressed. I think we that has to be discussed now between the U.S. Secret Service and Congress to discuss that and to increase the bubble. Former President Trump clearly is now the victim of a second assassination attempt, which is unprecedented in presidential history. Only President Ford was there were two attempts against his life during his presidency, but nobody at a candidate level has had two attempts upon their life. I think this needs to be addressed now, especially with the threats that are coming from international individuals, international governments, against former President Trump. I think the conversation needs to be had that if he's a candidate, and it's decided that he needs to have increased coverage, that the candidate needs to have coverage, much like the president of the United States or the Vice President of the United States, but it's something that needs to be addressed, because this rhetoric is not going away. It's not going to change. And this -- we still have 50 some days until the election. I think we're going to see a lot more, unfortunately, a lot more problems.

Clearly, this is a new world 21st century, advancements in AI have moved the threat level to a new level, and the Secret Service really needs to address it in possibilities.

I think we saw the first assassination attempt kind of fade as a political, you know, kind of motivator or wedge.But really, what we're seeing is a transformation, I think, of American life. I mean, just think about how routine threats and actual attempts at political violence have become, not only here at the apex of American politics, with the former president, but with local education officials, public health officials, local governments, a kidnap attempt against the governor of Michigan. We have moved into a different era in which the kind of backbeat of political threats and threats of violence have become much more common.

So I'm not surprised that they would do that here.You know, that isn't really the issue, I think, for me in terms of this. I mean, it's more about his role in creating a climate in which threats of political violence are becoming much more normalized. As a society we don't want anyone taking a shot at Donald Trump. We also don't want Donald Trump spreading baseless racist accusations against Haitian immigrants in Ohio, they could end up with someone taking a shot at one of them. I mean, there was some thought after the first assassination attempt that everybody would look in the mirror and step back from the use of divisive and dehumanizing and violent rhetoric, and that is far from what we have seen. So you know, you do worry, as I said, about where this is going, not only for those who are at the kind of apex of politics and have, you know, a law enforcement protection, even if there are reasons to question the adequacy of it, but all across the country now, with election officials being concerned about threats that are becoming more common. We are heading into a different period, and we're already in a different period, and really, everyone in society needs to look at it and kind of say, Is this the way we want to live?",

I mean, two attempts in this shorter period of time with people who have gotten relatively close to the president, especially the first time, it is totally legitimate for Congress to ask questions.But what DeSantis is talking about is something very different. I mean, it's kind of, you know, implying that somehow the federal government, you know, is not, you know, in more than implying, he's strongly suggesting the federal government is not going to give you the truth. You had Elon Musk put out. And this is not unique for this occasion, truly reprehensible comments tonight on his former -- the website formerly known as a Twitter. Yes, you know, so much of the met. Look, if there was a Democratic candidate who had two assassination attempts, I am sure Democrats would be very exercised. But again, we need to kind of think about, is this the way we want to live? Because every sign Anna is that this is going to get better, not worse, and where it's really troublesome and worrisome, and I think most insidious is not even in this kind of attempt at the leader of a political party. It's what we have seen at the grassroots, for people who are on school boards or public health officials and certainly election officials, and the way in which this is becoming much more common. A Trump -- a former Trump Department of Homeland Security officials, said to me immediately after January 6 that she worried we were moving into our own version of the troubles in Northern Ireland, where threats and realities of political violence just becomes a much more common back be to our life. That is clearly the path that we are on, and we need a broad kind of society, wide effort to marginalize and to condemn the use of dehumanizing language and the toleration of political violence, and because otherwise, we're going to see more of this, not less.",

And one thing that the FBI, according to my colleague Josh Campbell, would be focusing on is trying to cull that social media profile on as far as his recent mindset. In a separate post on X, the former Twitter, he had been tagging President Joe Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, encouraging them to visit people who were injured at the rally at the first assassination attempt of the former President Trump. He wrote in a post directed to Harris to please come and visit the people who are injured. And then in an April post, he tagged President Biden's presidential account and he was making suggestions about what the tagline for the campaign should be. We were also -- the investigative unit was also able to reach the eldest son of the man who has been detained.
