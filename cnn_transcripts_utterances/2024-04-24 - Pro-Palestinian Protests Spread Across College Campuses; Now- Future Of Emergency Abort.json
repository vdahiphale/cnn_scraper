We start at the Supreme Court where the justices appear deeply divided over one of the biggest abortion cases since Roe vs. Wade was overturned. The issue is whether an Idaho abortion ban prevents doctors from performing abortions for women who are having a medical emergency that may not be life threatening but is a threat to her health.CNN's Paula Reid and Meg Tirrell are here to break it down.

For pregnant women, there is an exception. Abortions can be performed if a woman's life is at risk. The Biden administration sued the state of Idaho saying, wait a second, it shouldn't get that far. If you need to perform this procedure to stabilize someone that should be sufficient under federal law, which is how we heard -- well, we found ourselves today at the Supreme Court.And from what we heard, I think the most interesting takeaway is that the votes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett seem to be up for grabs. And that's a little bit of a surprise. I think a lot of folks might think, well, of course, they're going to side with Idaho. But in fact, based on the question that we heard today, both of them seemed open. And that's critical because they would of course, be key swing votes here.",

And so, what we're hearing is that this has a couple different effects. One, Dr. Salas and patients tell us, we've been to Idaho to talk to folks there about this. They tell us they're afraid to be pregnant in the state of Idaho. Because if you have a situation like this, where you have to wait until you're at death's door, oftentimes that means that doctors will be afraid to provide that treatment.And what we hear is that now they're counseling patients that they need insurance to be flown out of state to be able to get that kind of care rather than the doctors putting themselves at risk by providing it within that state. And we actually heard some numbers about this. They are small numbers, but they show that there's been an increase as a result of this entire situation. Last year, the largest hospital system in Idaho said that they had to transfer one patient out of state because of this kind of situation. This year, and just the first few months of the year since this EMTALA ban essentially was lifted in the full ban went into effect in Idaho. There's been six patients transferred out of state. They say, you annualized, that that's 20 patients. It's a rare situation that this happens, obviously from these numbers but it obviously affects people.",

All the women that three liberal justices joined by Amy Coney Barrett, who dominated the first half and really grilled the lawyer who is representing Idaho, Josh Turner. This was his first argument before the Supreme Court. And at times, it did show. He got some pretty tough questions, some hypotheticals questions like that.

When we talked about, she says she used to provide abortion care. But over the past couple of years with this restrictive law, it's really not possible.

In special elections that have happened in very red states like Kansas or in battleground states, or congressional districts. Time and again, when this issue was on the ballot, it draws support to a coalition of abortion rights supporters that the Biden team believes they can put to their effort of success, their hopes -- hope for success this fall.

And then if you look ahead to North Carolina as well -- and so, you know, let's be real here, the president of the United States is kind of limited in what he can do on putting Roe back in place without Congress and everything else. But what the Biden campaign and Democrats can do is rally enthusiasm, particularly in the states that matter the most. And on that note, you of course have ballot proposals in a lot of these states. Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, and it goes on and on. The key ones from a presidential perspective are Arizona, Florida, Nevada. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, POLITICS &amp; POLICY COLUMNIST, BLOOMBERG &amp; CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. Listen, Bloomberg is going to pull out today of swing states and it shows that for half of the voters in the states, abortion is a very, very important issue to their vote. In Arizona, you look at independent voters. According to our poll, they trust Biden on these issues by 12 points over Trump. In suburban women trust Biden over Trump by 25 points. So that is the sort of constellation of voters that they are looking at energizing.

CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it's important because one of the main things that the prosecutors have to prove in this case is that the former president was knowledgeable about the fraud that is alleged to have taken place. And so, this general characterization of the former president as being a micromanager, being involved in the details of things sort of goes along that path of him having knowledge of the fraud that that the prosecutors say, takes place. But you know, the other aspect of Mr. Pecker's testimony is that it is not generally, it is not illegal to do sleazy things to influence an election in the way of trying to win it.
