We turned them over to the FBI and soon thereafter communicated it to Congress.While I was not aware that those classified documents were in our personal residence, let me be clear. Those classified documents should not have been at my personal residence. Mistakes were made, and I take full responsibility. And I've directed by counsel to work with the National Archives, with the Department of Justice, and with the Congress to fully cooperate in any investigation. Our national security depends on the proper handling of classified and sensitive materials, and I -- I know that when errors are made, it's important that they be resolved swiftly and disclosed. And my only hope is that as the American people look at our conduct in this manner, that they see that we acted above politics, and put the national interest first. And I pledge to each and every one of you and to the American people that we will continue to do so. So help me God.",

      "sentences": "Well, Alisyn, this is exactly what the Fed wants to see. Inflation is chilling out, and that's great news for everyone. Today's reports the PCE index. This is the Fed's preferred inflation metric. And it shows that prices they inched higher between November and December, up by 5 percent year over year in December. Now normally this is nothing to cheer about, right. This is about twice as hot as inflation is supposed to be, but everything is relative.And if you look, inflation is actually cooling off. Because last June we had 7 percent inflation. It has ticked down to 5 percent, and this slowdown in inflation, if it continues, this could give the Fed the cover it needs and wants to try to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at next week's meeting and maybe even pause altogether this spring. We do need to keep an eye on consumer spending though because spending dipped last month as people were dealing with inflation. Peoples a saved more money. They're setting aside extra money for a rainy day, and hopefully we get to see inflation calm down some more and consumer spending can tick-up because we need consumer spending to get this economic expansion continuing. Matt let's talk about gas prices. They're going up again. What's the story?",

It's weird to see it during the dead of winter because demand is pretty weak. Normally people are staying off the roads, but this is really not about demand. This is a supply situation.We see outages of refineries, including Colorado's only refinery. This happened last month during the winter weather, and that's why we've seen this spike across the country, almost $1 higher over the past month in Colorado, 60 cent increase in Ohio, Delaware, Georgia, Florida, all of them seeing big increases. Oil prices also gone up. The question is, how long does this last? We don't know, but GasBuddy's Patrick Dehaan, he said that wonders whether or not the springtime pickup in gas price that is we normally see gets pulled forward. That would mine in this case instead of $4 gas this May, we could see $4 gas in March -- Alisyn.",

So many people have likened the video of Tyre Nichols to that of your dad in 1991 being beaten by the LAPD. Not everyone, but many people. I'm just wondering what this week has been like for you to hear your dad's name invoked so much.LORA KING, RODNEY KING'S DAUGHTER: You know, I often try to stay away, but then when I heard everyone just comparing, I had no choice but to face it as with all of us. It's really horrific honestly because I've read details on it and I'm sick to my stomach. I'm actually not well, and I don't think anybody in their right mind, anybody that respects humanity is OK with this. I don't -- I'm lost for words about it, and I'm just sad. I'm sad for his mother. I'm sad for his family. I'm sad for his friends. I read that he has a child. I'm not sure, but I'm sad for his son. I'm just sad for just where we are in America. We're still here. I'm in disbelief.",

That is something between God's grace, God himself, and them. There's no one -- even if Martin Luther King were here today helping us, as he is in our spirit, he couldn't even help. This is something that's indescribable. Their life unfortunate. It's very unfortunate that the world will know him as a hashtag. Something I'm grateful that his family is continue in his legacy by all the good work he's doing and, you know, he's done, and, you know, skateboarding and things of that nature. I'm proud that they're representing him very well. Because this is -- it's not acceptable. It's just -- I still can't -- I'm, like, in disbelief about it.And I don't -- I don't understand why it takes that many officers for 140-pound man. There's no way anybody can explain that to me, let alone the way they beat that man. That picture, that's sickening to me. That's sickening, and to my knowledge, he was handcuffed while they were beating him. Not to say it would have been better if he was not handcuffed, but that's even worse. It's like people often wonder why people run why people run. That's why. This is why, because they're fearful of their life and they know what's to come 90 percent of the time. So, it's like well, my natural human reaction is to run because I feel like I'm going to die, and nine times out of ten, we see this happening. Imagine how many times this happens that it's not recorded, you know, it just makes me sad. And don't get me wrong. There's great officers out here. I know them. Our commander here, Ruby Flores is great. She does everything behind the scenes to make things right with us and the community and things of that nature, but one person, two people, there's a few. There's a few office officers. I can't speak for all of them, but it doesn't compare to what we're still seeing. You know, we have to do something better. Obviously, this way is not working. It's not working. The only difference between my father's situation and now is hashtags and a clearer camera. We have to do better. This is unacceptable. Yes. Lora, we really appreciate getting your perspective on this. We know this week is been hard for you and it will continue to be, I'm sure even more so when the video comes out. We're thinking of you. We really appreciate you being here.",
