      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York. Anarchy in Haiti as police and militias battle gangs for control of the nation's capital. Civilians caught in the middle of just struggling to secure food, fuel and water. Coming up a report from CNN's team on the ground in Port-au-Prince.In just moments President Joe Biden will mark Women's History Month with an event at the White House where he is expected to issue a new executive order to promote women's health research. How will this play in his re-election campaign against Donald Trump, my political panel will discuss. Plus YouTube creators will now be asked to add a special label to content that was made or altered using artificial intelligence. Just ahead a live report on the new policy and its implications for users. But we will begin this hour with the exodus in the Caribbean. A U.S. State Department charter flight has arrived in Florida carrying U.S. citizens out of Haiti. And they're the lucky ones able to flee scenes of anarchy like this in Por-au-Prince as militias battle gangs for control. A handful of elites are haggling over the makeup of a Transitional Council after the government's near total collapse. But gangs rule the streets, choking off the supply of food, fuel and water across the city. And what's left of the country's police force finds itself under siege. CNN's David Culver reports now from Port-au- Prince. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So police stations like this one here in Port-au-Prince are main targets for gangs. They feel like as soon as they can get hold of a station like this, they can then take siege and take control of much of the community. And they've tried coming after this well many of times, reinforcements have been built up not only because of the police, but because of the community. They've built barricades all around here. For the police station to function properly, they need to rely on the community and to have these almost vigilantes building a lot of the barricades to keep out any gang members. So this was a school here in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. And every single classroom that we pass, like this one here, has now become a dorm room essentially. There are dozens, if not hundreds of people who have made this a recent campsite. As you can see a lot of them are following us around and are curious as to what we're doing because for them, it's a distraction, really. And you talk to a lot of these folks, and they've come here in the past couple of weeks because of the most recent surge in violence, and gangs taking more and more territory here in the city. But these folks have also been on the run from their own home for months, if not years. She just got this small bag of rice and she's going to cook it up for seven people. A lot of them tell me they don't know where their next meal is going to be. One little girl, eight years old, saying she goes to bed every single night hungry. And a lot of that is because in the past two weeks in particular, supply lines, especially for programs of international aid, like the World Food Program, have been severed. So while these organizations are trying desperately to get food in, it's not just about getting them into Port-au-Prince. It's then about getting them into communities like this. The challenges logistically are immense. They're dealing with this at a level that they have not faced prior. I mean, it's unprecedented. And the pain, we can sense it in the kids' eyes and their parents who feel helpless at this point. But for them, it's about pushing forward. I asked one woman how you get up every day and move ahead. She said with the grace of God, but then admitted in the same breath, that sometimes they feel they'd be better off dead than living. David Culver, CNN, Port-au-Prince, Haiti. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So this will be the recommencement, if you like of the Israeli delegation, being here in Doha, and working through what was Hamas' (inaudible) proposal that we saw last week.Now, the Israeli Prime Minister, as you heard there has called the proposal outlandish. He's called it unrealistic. And yet he has sent his delegation here. There were key meetings in Israel on Sunday, there was the war cabinet meeting, the security Cabinet meeting, where they decided the parameters, the boundaries of how far the Mossad Director could go. So they have a red line of they can agree up to that point, and that is when they walk away. So we know at this point that Hamas has, through officials and sources has suggested within this what we're hearing a six week temporary ceasefire, they want to see between 700 and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released and in return, they would release female hostages, including IDF soldiers, also the elderly, the sick and the wounded, which is believed to be around 40 hostages. And so that appears to be what would be phase one. Of course, after that it gets very difficult. That is when Hamas would like an eventual permanent ceasefire, which Israel is not ready to do at this point. Again on Sunday, the Prime Minister of Israel saying that he will go into Rafah where more than half the population is sheltering at this point in the southern part of Gaza. And that once that starts, it will be an operation that lasts several weeks calling it the last bastion of Hamas. So at the same time, as there are discussions ongoing, there is some hope that there could be a temporary ceasefire at some point, but we are hearing from a diplomat close to the talks that it will be not an easy task to get the Israelis to agree to this.

Let's bring in our panel. I want to welcome in Democratic strategist Brad Woodhouse along with Maura Gillespie. She served as an Adviser to former House Speaker John Boehner. Good to see you both.

I would say after defending democracy, health care has been his signature domestic issue. Expanding and enhancing the Affordable Care Act, lowering drug prices for - for seniors and he's made a heavy commitment to ending inequities in health care.And one of the inequities that we've seen, you know, for decades is that women's health and research into women's health has not been funded. It's not been a priority, but he has made it a priority. This executive action he's announcing today will direct federal agencies to invest more resources into research into women's health care issues, midlife issues, heart disease, fibrosis, menopause. And so I think it's incredibly important. And I think it is an important contrast. No one could imagine Donald Trump who ripped away Roe v. Wade, who wants a national abortion ban, no one can envision him hosting this same event.

Consumers can start ordering the Opill online and get it within a few days.

And the product will be shipped in discrete unbranded packaging.Now what we know about Opill, it's a progestin only birth control pill. It's up to 98 percent effective and it does come with the manufacturer's suggested retail price of $19.99 for a one month pack, $49.99 for a three month supply, and $89.99 for a six month supply. And as part of this rollout, Rahel, earlier this month, shipments of the product were sent to distribution sites. Today, online orders are beginning. You can purchase this online. Next in the next few weeks. We expect the product to be available in stores. Major retail pharmacies, like CVS, like Walgreens are expecting to have it available in stores in early April. So watching this rollout of a major milestone products, the first over the counter birth control pill is really interesting.

And if they repeatedly fail to do so, they could potentially face consequences, including losing the ability to monetize or make money from their videos. This of course, an effort by YouTube to address these really real concerns increasingly that widely available AI generated - generative AI tools could potentially make it so that users are confused about what's real and what's not.
