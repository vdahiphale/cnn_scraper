You are as privileged as they come. There are many things in my mind that are crystal clear about this case. You are no hero, you abused your position and you're a charlatan who used and is still using your prior position in office to peddle a snake oil that's been proven to be junk time and time again.

Duke Energy says that 90 percent of customers in North and South Carolina will have their power restored today with an additional 134,000 customers by tonight, while 85,000 customers in the hardest hit area should have power by Sunday.This is new video from the men and women of the North Carolina National Guard, as they're coming to the rescue of people who have been trapped for days. The guard says its air set assets have saved some 538 people and 150 pets, and it could be a dire situation for those in need of medical care. Greg Lowe joins us now. He is the CEO of HCA Healthcare's Mission Hospital in Asheville. Thank you so much for being with us, Greg. We understand city officials are saying it could take weeks for the water system to be fully restored. How are things going inside your hospital right now? What needs do you have? GREG LOWE, CEO, HCA HEALTHCARE'S MISSION HOSPITAL:  Thank you. First, I really want to thank all of our HCA Healthcare colleagues and team members that have done just an outstanding job of caring for all of our patients in our hospitals and serving everyone that is seeking care. As you mentioned, we're still without city water. But HCA Healthcare has come in and helped us re-pressurize the hospital with a line of tanker trucks so that we can be fully operational. We have clean water, showers, sinks, toilets to be able to serve all of our patients in our hospital.",

We have the resources and the staff to be able to deliver that care. Over 100 nurses, physicians and other individuals to help us have been brought in from outside through the connections with HCA Healthcare to be able to continue to deliver on our mission.We've also, with HCA Healthcare, set up mini marts in all of our hospitals to be able to provide food and water and supplies and all those things necessary for our employees to be able to get home and come back. We are pumping gas in thousands of our employees' vehicles through our HCA Healthcare supply chain to be able to get them home, check on their families and come back and do what they do best is caring for our community.",
