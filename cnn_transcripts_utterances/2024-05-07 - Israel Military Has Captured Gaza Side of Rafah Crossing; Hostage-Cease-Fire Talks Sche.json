We're watching the prosecution as they're expected to call adult film star Stormy Daniels to the witness stand today. B. ANDERSON:  Good stuff, Omar. Back with you a little later. There is sharp reaction here in the Middle East, as Israel says, it has taken control of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing. That Rafah crossing, of course, between Gaza and Egypt. Egypt condemning this operation, saying it threatens the lives of more than 1 million Palestinians. Hamas calling for U.S. and international pressure on Israel to stop what it calls a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel's war cabinet says it will continue targeted attacks in Rafah while its delegation engages in further hostage ceasefire talks in Egypt. Medical officials say 23 people, including children, were killed in Israeli strikes in Rafah overnight. Well, let's break all of this down with our international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, and CNN's Arlette Saenz at the White House. Nic, I want to start with you. And Hamas because it is in Rafah that Israel reportedly believes at least four, quote, \"battalions of Hamas militants\" remain. And that is the reason why they are, they say, so intent on targeting this border town with this offensive. This is not a full-on military offensive at this point but certainly there is an operation now on the ground and people are being killed. Meantime, we have ceasefire talks going on in Cairo. Once again, there's been some confusion as to where those stand. You have Hamas' position as it were with regard these ceasefire talks. I think it's important that we just get that for our viewers to work out where we are at and where these talks are going.",

But last night, as that operation was getting underway, officials said that they were watching it with concern but that they also did not believe that this was the beginning of that widescale expected military offensive into Rafah by the Israelis. Now it comes as the White House has repeatedly warned against conducting such an operation. President Biden reiterated his position in a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu just yesterday. Here's National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby as he talked about the concerns for civilians as they have pushed Israel to develop an implementable plan when it comes trying to secure the safety and evacuation of the more than 1.4 million Palestinians in Rafah before they launch any ground offensive. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  We don't want to see operations in and around Rafah that make it harder for the people that are seeking refuge there and shelter to be safe and secure.

We do not know at what point; the day certainly has not started with her on the stand but that is something we are for sure watching for. Trump's attorneys said in court that the defense team was informed she will be the second witness. Now it's the latest twist in a years-long saga over Trump and Daniels' alleged affair and hush money payment. Her testimony will allow jurors to hear from the person at the center of the prosecution's case against Trump. Now remember, the former U.S. president has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to cover up payments to Daniels to buy her silence. Now prosecutors say it was all part of an attempt by Team Trump to mislead voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election. I want to bring in CNN's Jessica Schneider, who has been following the trial closely for us from Washington. So Jessica, obviously we did not start out with Stormy Daniels today. Doesn't mean we haven't seen interesting testimony. We've been hearing from Sally Franklin, the SVP at Penguin publishing house here. What did we learn so far from Sally Franklin? And what more are you learning about the expected appearance of Stormy Daniels?",

And that may be one of the beginning pieces of them that start to put -- connect some of those dots. We will see. Thank you, Jessica, as always. Really appreciate the reporting. As she mentioned, we are continuing to monitor testimony from Sally Franklin, the -- from the publishing house. But again, we do expect Stormy Daniels to be the second witness. We will actually wait to see if that becomes a reality. Coming up, though we are following a lot of other stories going on around the world. For example, on his first trip to Europe in five years, China's President Xi Jinping has been visiting France's Emmanuel Macron. He says China wants to support peace in Ukraine. We'll have more coming up. (MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) B. ANDERSON:  Well, we're getting more detail now on a foiled plot to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Kyiv's state security service says two Ukrainian officials have been detained over a suspected Zelenskyy assassination plan. Now these two officials are accused of leaking classified information to Russia. Well, at the Kremlin in Russia, a short time ago, Vladimir Putin was inaugurated as Russia's president again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) B. ANDERSON (voice-over):  We have been down this road or through those doors before. This is the Russian leader's fifth inauguration. Russia's top military and political figures showed up for today's ceremony. But the U.S. and many European countries refused to send representatives, claiming the March election was a sham.

We also know from events of the last 24, 48 hours that Russia is going to continue to use the one lever that it sees as especially effective in this, which is the nuclear threat. The ministry of defense, just one day before the inauguration, saying that it's preparing a military drill to sort of simulate the use of tactical or battlefield nuclear weapons. That does not, of course, mean that they're going to use them. The U.S. for its part says it sees no change in Russia's nuclear posture but it does show that they are willing to keep using this threat, especially when faced with suggestions that we saw from David Cameron, the U.K. foreign secretary and from Emmanuel Macron of France. The West's help for Ukraine could even step up again. So this is the situation that we're in, a policy of confrontation with the West and that is said to be one of the hallmarks of this fifth term, Becky. B. ANDERSON:  I started by just alluding to the detail on an inside plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine. Briefly, what further details do we have?",

      "sentences": "Not the first time we've seen an assassination attempt, Becky, but this one is interesting because the Ukrainian state security servicessays that they have now arrested and charged with treason two pretty high ranking officials in the Ukrainian secret service. That is the department charged with protecting President Zelenskyy and other top officials, two colonels. They are alleged to have been part of a network of agents, they say, working for Russia's FSB, Russia's own security, and passing information to Russia about the whereabouts and classified information around President Zelenskyy himself. And also the head of the Ukrainian state security services and the head of Ukrainian defense intelligence. As I said we've seen assassination plots before. One was just three weeks ago where a punishment was arrested for allegedly passing information to Russia. But this potentially is a good look for Ukraine that they managed to foil it but also embarrassing, perhaps, that it affected such high ranking officials in Ukrainian secret service. No comment, as of yet, from Moscow on this. B. ANDERSON:  Clare Sebastian on the story. Thank you, Clare. President Xi Jinping has said that France and China should work together to prevent a new cold war. During the joint press conference with the French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Xi said the two countries should jointly oppose building walls and barriers. President Xi is in France during his six-day visit to Europe, amid growing China-Europe, tensions which, of course, have been exacerbated since the beginning of Russia's war with Ukraine. Beijing is hoping to use this trip to present China's own narrative. Joining me now from Paris is senior international correspondent Melissa Bell. Is it clear what the outcome of the meetings between Xi and Macron were and what's been achieved during this trip?",

Now before she even took the stand, even before jurors were in the room, there was a discussion between Trump's attorneys, the prosecution and the judge about how much evidence they are going to allow in with Stormy Daniels, as she says she prefers to be called on the stand. And they said they can make the fact that there was some sort of sexual relationship but they can't get into details, like it's not necessary. The jurors don't need to hear about that. The judge was very clear about that. But she's certainly obviously a big witness. People were very interested in what she is -- how she is on the stand. She said she's there because she is -- a subpoena to be there. The interaction about Trump that we're told from our colleagues inside the courtroom now, he has turned his body toward her. Again, a reminder to everyone that the witness can't actually see Donald Trump at the defense table. So there's a lot of interest in exactly what she is going to say and how much she is going to be helpful or not helpful for prosecutors.",

It's hard to detract from all the drama that's probably happening in that courtroom right now. But they need to connect the dots for jurors. They need to prove that not only did he fake these businesses records but he did it for another reason, to interfere with the 2016 election. He wanted to hush her up, as we've been talking about, with these payments. So her testimony obviously is very important but also dramatic.",

But to Brynn's point, there's a difference between being a marquee name and the substance of what you're actually going to be able to testify to. And I'm curious.

So she's there really to corroborate that part of the factual timeline. And she's very important in another way, which is Trump's team is having a little bit of a hard time figuring out what their strategy really is in their attack or defense of him. To the extent they have to decide whether to really lean into Trump's kind of general notion, this was all a fabrication; she made this up. She's an extortionist like the Keith Davidson who represented her. It does place within the jury's decision realm whether they believe her or not. I suspect she's going to come across as very sympathetic and believable. So she's important to the overall credibility because the extent that they believe what she's saying happened, then that automatically impugns the defense. And the notion that Trump is saying, don't believe her, she has other motives. So the more that she comes across as being nervous, credible, sincere, the more generally bolster is the timeline of, yes, this happened. Now let's turn to the legal cover-up, the fraud part of it and the intent to help his election campaign. So that's where she really fits in this as a matter of substance.",

They've done a lot of that circumstantially. I mean, there's enough circumstantial evidence that it's pretty easy to argue that to the jury. But the more detail they can supply on that, the better. And that most likely is going to come in the form of Michael Cohen. And in many ways, I see the whole trial up until now as pre-corroborating Cohen's testimony, which is to shore up all the details that he will reference, to lay the groundwork for that. So by the time he gets there to tell his part of it, the jury has really a very small target to look at, which is, do they believe him talking about these historical facts? The defense will try to slide them up, saying he's generally not credible. But the prosecution's laying the groundwork for it. There's all this credibility. It's already been corroborated by other people, including people who are close to Trump, who are loyalists. And so that's what they're really trying to set up, is to have Cohen be able to testify from a very solid and narrow area as to that particular detail -- connecting Trump, that is, Trump's awareness.",

So how much she's actually going to give, score points, I guess, is the best way to say, for the prosecution it's unclear. But the defense is usually just going to keep her at a distance from Trump.
