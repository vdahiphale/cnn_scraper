He has gone back on his word in a very significant way this year when he stepped down as a Democratic nominee.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): As Ukrainian forces grow ever more desperate trying to hold off advancing Russian troops, the Kremlin is growing ever more hopeful the incoming Trump administration will try to end the war on terms favorable for Moscow. \"The words peace or peace plan come from Trump supporters and those nominated for future positions in the upcoming administration,\" the Kremlin spokesman said today. The Russians irate after the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer distance U.S. and U.K. supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in return, firing a new, powerful intermediate range ballistic missile into central Ukraine that's never been used in war. President-elect Trump's pick for national security advisor confirming ending the Ukraine war will be an urgent priority. MIKE WALTZ, TRUMP'S PICK FOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: President Trump has been very clear about the need to end this conflict. And so, what were - need to be discussing is, who's at that table? PLEITGEN (voice over): And from Trump insiders and cabinet picks, proposals seemingly in line with Moscow's demands. Elon Musk posting his ideas on his X account in early October 2022, calling for U.N. monitored referendums in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia, for Crimea to be recognized as Russian, and for Ukraine to remain neutral. Ukraine's president, who has said he does believe the war will end faster under Trump, also said last week in a radio interview that Ukraine cannot be forced into talks. Musk then trolling Zelenskyy once again. Despite Elon Musk giving crucial battlefield support to Ukraine by providing Starlink satellite internet to its troops, Russians we spoke to in Moscow unequivocal, they like him. He's an extraordinary personality, this man says. And since he fulfilled himself and his business, society will work with him well. I think Elon Musk is a good example of the future of our planet, she says. He's doing a lot to bring our planet forward, and it's a good development.
