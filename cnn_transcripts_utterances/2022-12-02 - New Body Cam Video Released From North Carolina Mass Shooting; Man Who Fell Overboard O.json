So, Tara, the medical community over the past few decades has made so many advances in inroads in the fight against HIV. What do you make of this? What do we know thus far about this potential vaccine?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that it's exciting science, but it's very preliminary. This was a Phase 1 study, which is kind of the earliest study that we do, that looks really at safety and is there an immune response. And so what researchers did was took 46 healthy adult volunteers and divided them up. About 38 of them -- sorry, about 18 in one group, 18 in another group got the vaccine. Twelve of them did not. And each of the groups that got the vaccine, one got a low dose of the vaccine, one got a higher dose. They then got boosted about eight weeks after that, and they looked to see what the immune response was. And in fact, in 97 percent, they did see an immune response. And that was what we call broad neutralizing antibody precursors. Now, the reason this is important is because these are the types of antibodies, almost like super antibodies, that we need to fight a virus like HIV, which has a lot of different global variants. So we think this research will help going forward not just with HIV, but with some other viruses that we've had trouble developing a vaccine for. As far as side effects, there really were no adverse serious effects. The most common things, as you would expect was injection at the site where they got the needle, as well as some malaise fatigue. So, you know, this is so important. As you mentioned, 38 million globally have HIV AIDS. Each year, 1 million new HIV infections will be detected. So, you know, this is really exciting research, but very, very early at this point. This is one of about 20 trials worldwide that's going on currently for HIV vaccines.",
