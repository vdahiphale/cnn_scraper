And it was not until Wednesday night that Jordan issued a statement to call off the dogs.But in that intervening time, it was not just pressure that was, please support Jordan or why aren't you supporting Jordan or the rest? It was very, very hostile phone calls and texts. And in fact, I'm going to play a little bit, this is from a voicemail message left for the wife of one of your colleagues who didn't support Congressman Jordan. Take a listen to this.",

That list is not public. It was made by Speaker McCarthy. And there's a very good argument to be made that McHenry already has those powers to bring bills to the floor. There's nothing in our house rules that limits the scope of his power. That is a myth that has been perpetuated. It is not true.Now, he has decided that would be the limit of the authority of his powers. And so, if that vote did take place, he may very well say, I don't want it. You need to go to the next person in line. That could happen. I think that's our best option now, and then we need a reset on figuring out who can get to 217, and there is talk about candidates, that is fine. Jordan -- it would have to wait until Jordan actually decides to step down. And then we take a breath. And we have that conversation -- I think we should have that conversation while there is a speaker who can bring bills to the floor according to the process that we already.

And I just talked to one representative, Malliotakis, who told me that she called Jim Jordan today and told him that she thought he should keep fighting this out over the weekend, to keep members in Washington, to keep them on the floor, to try to grind them down, essentially. But you and I both know, Dana, that that kind of strategy can absolutely backfire. In fact, I just talked to another Republican, Representative Molinaro, who told me that he is not going to be voting for Jim Jordan on this ballot. And in fact, what he thinks Jordan should do is just go back to conference, have another closed-door meeting, and let Republicans sort out who the next candidate should be to be the speaker. So many varying opinions about what the strategy should be right now. But dana, you can imagine that if it ain't go round after round today, tomorrow, into Sunday, that that is probably not going to help Jim Jordan warm himself to any of colleagues who are saying and have told him over the last several days, they are not voting for him. They are never voting for him. And that he needs to step aside. Dana.",

SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes, and it's another example of refusal to accept outcomes. I mean, Jim Jordan has been told he's not going to have the votes. It doesn't look like he's going to have the votes. And what do you hear from the people who are helping him? We're going to keep you here all weekend. We're going to keep voting. And essentially, we're going to keep punishing you until you change your mind. That attitude is exactly what's hurting him. It's why he's going the wrong direction. This attitude of we're going to punish you and this attitude of bullying that has taken place. You hear from all corners of the Hill, this bullying is not -- this -- even people who are voting for Jordan are highly uncomfortable with it because some of these folks are their friends, and they don't like that members of Congress are being harassed in this particular way.",

I pressed him time and time again about the expectation that he is probably going to lose even more Republican votes. He's -- he did not want to entertain that at this moment, but that is exactly what is expected here at this moment.He said this is chaotic. We need to elect a speaker. Then he went on to criticize the eight Republican who voted with Democrats to oust him from the speakership. He continues to call them the crazy eight. And he says -- and I said, well, if Jordan can't get there, then what's next? He said, well, who can get 217 votes? And that really remains the key question. But, Dana, I can tell you also, I talked to several Republicans on the way in to vote, including one of them Congressman Mike Garcia of California who's sticking with Jordan for now, but said if Jordan continues to lose votes, then they're going to have to reassess his candidacy. That Jordan should, himself, reassess things. So, you're seeing some concern from Jordan's supporters themselves that he can no longer continue in this race if he continues to bleed support. So, expect that pressure to mount after this vote if he does in fact lose more than 22 Republican votes which we expect for him to not continue in this race from even the people who are now backing him. That is going to be a real issue that he will have to navigate even as his most ardent supporters are telling him to fight on, battle this, potentially take this through the weekend, into next eventually to try to get there. Some of the -- now, those members are simply getting weak-kneed, are getting tired about this very bitter process that we have seen unfold over the last couple of weeks. That is going to be his huge challenge in the days ahead. Will it be time for him to step aside after this vote, or will he try to continue on? That will be a question for him, but as you can see, a lot of members losing patience, Dana.",

CHARLIE DENT (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, PENNSYLVANIA:  No, I don't. And frankly, Dana, what we're really witnessing here is the fight I was hoping that this party would have had years ago. This is a fight between the institutionalists and the Trump populists. And the battle lines are drawn. What's really interesting today is, how many more people are going to join the institutionalists and vote against Jim Jordan? That is really what we're witnessing. The House Republican conference is deeply fractured right now for the whole world to see. I mean, to watch Jim Jordan this morning at that press conference, talking about making the appropriations process work, he spoke -- he was speaking to his detractors, Kay Granger, Mario Diaz-Balart, Steve Womack, Mike Simpson, these are institutionalists. Serious people who want to govern. And they must hear that, they are immovable objects right now. And so, this fight must occur.",
