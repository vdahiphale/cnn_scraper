Kamala Harris promises to lower housing costs and wage war on price gouging in the first major economic speech of her presidential campaign. As Russia struggles to contain the incursion inside its borders, CNN gets a firsthand look at life inside Ukrainian-held Russia. And OpenAI says, it has discovered an Iranian plot to use ChatGPT to influence the US election. All right, coming to you live from New York. It is Friday, August 16th. I am Zain Asher, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, Kamala Harris says, bringing down the cost of living will be her priority if she becomes the next American president. The Democrat outlined her economic plan during a half hour speech in the swing state of North Carolina. Her proposals are aimed squarely at middle class and lower-income Americans. They include tax credits and better access to housing. Harris also said she would go after companies that she accuses of price gouging. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The focus on price gouging because how much of these sort of significant price hikes we saw during and after the pandemic were due to corporations playing foul? Because it is a lot more complicated than that, isn't it? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": It absolutely is. I'll tell you what, Zain, just at the top level, this was a masterclass in sticking to the script, keeping the details light and very popular, I think with voters and the price gouging point was foremost, I think among those. It is very difficult. Remember, price gouging is when corporates collude in some way to try and keep prices high, or when prices are rising, they try and strip of their ounce and fatten up their profits. She was light on details over how this would work. Right now, the Federal Trade Commission deals with it and it can tackle what is going on in terms of what corporates are doing. But it doesn't have the right to go into a grocery store, for example, and say, hey, your egg prices or something else, a loaf of bread is too expensive and you need to reduce those. Finding to your point, what part of this might be corporate greed versus supply chain issues coming out of the pandemic, the cost of wages for agricultural workers not being able to find agricultural workers. The impact of the war in Ukraine on grain prices, another great example its incredibly difficult, Zain. So just on a top level, the idea sounds good, the execution complicated.",

You want to live an ordinary reasonable life and to ever hope or dream of getting on the housing ladder. She can, I think cherry pick in terms of accepting some of the benefits like the restrictions on drug prices that have come from the Biden administration and try and promote and take credit for that. What she very cleverly did, I think in this speech is, distance herself from some of the challenges and talk with a big smile and optimism about how we are going to tackle some of the issues that have been a problem for the last three-and- a-half years, certainly, under this administration. The question is, you can promote, you can talk about what you hope to do. The question is, and one of the big questions walking away from this is, one, how do you pay for it? And how much do you need Congress to back you up and allow you to execute? And that requires you taking the House, of course, and the Senate as the Democratic Party. There are a lot of unknowns here, and there was a little bit of, I think of Harry Potter or Hermione Granger financing here, because at the end, she said she plans to reduce the deficit.

She is ahead on that question by a very slight margin, actually within the margin of error, to be honest, but 41 to 38 percent, but Trump had been holding a five-point advantage over Joe Biden. Ben Harris was an assistant Treasury Secretary for the Biden administration. He helped craft Biden's economic platform during his 2020 campaign. Ben, thank you so much for being with us.

Thefirst thing that she did was she was very forward-looking, so you'd ask, is she going to basically defend her record as vice president or is she going to try to distinguish yourself from the current administration? I mean, she made very clear that she wants to be forward-looking if she wants to talk about the future. Also, there was decided focus on the middle class as part of that speech. And my guess is there will be a central theme in her campaign going forward. Also, when this was less than the speech and more in some of the written materials, there is a real through line in terms of competition. She is looking to level the playing field for American families and businesses and when she comes to -- when it comes to markets, it is obvious that she is a capitalist, but you'll hear her talking more about being a pro-competition president, that will obviously be a through line moving forward.",

I think that has to be looked at in conjunction with the supply expansion. I mean, the number one problem with the housing market in the United States that we have about four or five million too few homes, so it is critical that we first build a lot more homes and that was central to her proposal. On the first time homebuyer tax credit. It is probably true that some of that will get capitalized on the price of the home. But if you're a first- time home buyer and you're receiving that $25,000.00, there is no way you're not coming out ahead. And one of the drawbacks of the US housing market is that it is increasingly getting to the point where young people just can't afford the down payment on a home. So I think that that proposal was laser-focused at families that haven't yet accumulated the cash, to put a down payment on a home. People shouldn't have to wait until their late 40s or 50s to buy a house. So I think it needs to be looked at in conjunction with the supply expansion and it needs to be looked at in conjunction with the realities of the US housing market.",

Just this idea that the economy in the US is robust, it is resilient, but for a long time, people just simply weren't feeling that and they blamed Biden for rising prices.

But also as you probably know,voters in the US do not do a great job of accurately characterizing the macro economy. So for example, there was a Morning Consult poll in 2022 that asked US voters, are we in the middle of recession? We hadn't been in a recession for a year-and-a-half and we wouldn't be in recession for at least another two years. But half of respondents said we were in recession. You see similar responses when we ask people what is the current inflation rate, so we've done research here at Brookings and you see 25 percent of people saying the inflation rate is 10 percent or higher at a time when it was 3.1 percent. So part of her challenge will be defending the record, but part of the challenge will also be setting the record straight and just reminding people how terrific the US economy currently is.",

And I was reading those articles and I was wondering myself why they sounded so fluid and sort of glib almost and very much like a native speaker, and it turns out its because it was ChatGPT that was writing these articles. So this is the latest evidence, like I said, that the Iranians are really interested in trying to shape voters' perceptions.

Now, when you have only four companies, they can easily coordinate their prices and easily avoid cutting their costs and cutting their prices.

But now we're seeing itreally be targeted towards the masses, especially given that people sort of drinking habits have changed. Walk us through how important taste was for you because a non-alcoholic beer has had a reputation of not necessarily tasting that good in the past. How much of a priority was taste for you?",

Common logic,historically and non-alcoholic beer had barely had any overall since prohibition, in innovation or marketing. And logic had it that non-alcoholic beer was something for one percent of the population, one percent of the time, these very specific life times and occasions where really people are not consuming alcohol, 95 plus percent of the time they're awake, and a huge amount of the population is decreasing their alcohol consumption. So, there's actually an enormous occasion base for this category just needed to be remarketed and reformulated in an exciting, modern way. And that's where John Walker, our co-founder, and brew master, came in. He brought a very talented brewing background to non-alcoholic beer for the first time, and we've won well over 100 globally recognized taste awards in our life at Athletic Brewing, over 27 this year alone, globally. So, really standing out on a global stage of taste. But then, equally as important is the marketing of the category, people needed the confidence to hold these beers in their hand and say they were great. And I think from everything from U.K. football footballers with the Arsenal team to American footballers with J. J. Watt and different celebrities and chefs and everything, we've tried to make the marketing really easy and aspirational also.",

And it is exciting to see the innovation around us in the category also. 10 years ago, you couldn't get any major brands in non-alcoholic form. And now almost every major global brewer has their flagship beer in the category. In the U.S., Athletic Brewing is about 20 percent of market share. We have three of the top 10 non-alcoholic beers in the market, and we're actually about two percent share of the overall U.S. craft beer market now. And then, as we go international, that has quickly been climbing up the ranks, also in Canada and the U.K., as we expand globally.",

I think we're just kind ofdecoupling drinking from drinking alcohol, and this is the first generation that's turning legal drinking age and having the option to drink exciting offerings and alcohol and non-alcoholic offerings. Every other generation when they went to a bar or restaurant or a party, there really wasn't any way to socialize if you weren't drinking alcohol.",
