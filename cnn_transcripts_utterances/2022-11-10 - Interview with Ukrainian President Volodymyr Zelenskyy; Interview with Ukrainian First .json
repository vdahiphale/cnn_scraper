I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv where the country is bracing itself for what could be the decisive battle in this brutal war, that's the battle for Kherson. Russia's defense minister is ordered the withdrawal of its troops from parts of the region, as Ukrainian forces advance towards the city. It seems to be a major setback for Putin's war aims, but Ukrainian officials are expressing skepticism and caution. Especially as the Kremlin's top security adviser visits Iran, where western officials say he is seeking more advanced weapons. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants to ensure international support for his country's defense continues, particularly from the United States after these midterm elections. And at this pivotal time, I sat down with the president and his wife, first lady Olena Zelenska, for a global exclusive. Their leadership and courage have driven this story and Ukraine's remarkable resistance. But it is clear, the war is taking its toll. They were tired but determined. Here is our conversation.

ZELENSKYY (through translator):  Thank you for the question and thank you for the meeting. You asked whether I thought this war would last so long. No, because I didn't start this war, and I'm sure there isn't a single Ukrainian who knew what this will be and what tragedy this would bring to every home in our country. Because, I repeat, we did not start this war. But Ukrainian society united and showed that it was ready for what, unfortunately, was such a tragedy showed that it was ready for these challenges. I was really impressed by the power of one nation. And was impressed by the swiftness of the response of Europe, the whole world, and the whole International Community that rallied around Ukraine for this challenge.",

But the Pentagon, actually, its very senior defense official said, and I'm going to quote to get it right, that \"Russia has probably lost half of its main battle tanks. Used up most of its precision guided weapons in this war. That 80 percent of their land force is bogged down here, is stuck here in Ukraine.\" Does that match your figures? And what is your answer to that? ZELENSKYY (through translator):  I think this, more or less, corresponds to reality. Although, frankly speaking, nobody knows the full reality, especially as regards personnel. Because nobody can tell you precisely how many people died. Nevertheless, we clearly understand that the artillery that was provided as assistance to us for the United States and Europe, it definitely had to break this initiative which Russia launched to us 24th of February. And we did break this military initiative. We stopped them. We de-occupied a large part of our territory. And, this indeed, was helped by the artillery and the new technologies. We never resorted to any of the lies that the Russian Federation produces about dirty bombs or nuclear challenges, and so on. And I'm very pleased that we're working jointly and responding quickly to that. Straight after Russia's allegations we invited the IAEA and they verified everything and said it is just another lie from Russia. So, I cannot confirm those numbers for sure. But I can say for sure that it is a stunning number, both in terms of heavy weapons and personnel.",

I can't give you the exact numbers but there's a very significant difference. Because our war tactic is not to throw people. Because people are most important. Not to use people as cannon fodder. And that's why it is very important to us. Whenever we asked our partners for artillery or armored vehicles, that it is not just about the weapons but first of all protection for our military.",

And I think the world has noted that Ukraine has used technologyin a really innovative and effective way. What was your message there and what do you want the tech world to do for this country? ZELENSKA (through translator):  Well, my message was pretty simple and I hope it was heard. The people gathered there were people who pushed technology forward. These people have an impact on which direction technology and the whole world will move in the future. So, my appeal to them is to choose a side what technology they will invent or design. Will this be a technology that kills or a technology that defends? Because we have a wonderful and vivid example. For example, Bellingcat recently conducted their latest investigation and they found a group of I.T. experts from Russia, young people aged 23, 25. Before the war they worked in private 90 companies. And now, they're targeting missiles at our buildings. And this is a choice. A conscious choice made by people who know this technology, who have the expertise, are narrow specialists. They chose to be murderers and terrorists. So, my appeal to all those thousands of people gathered at the web summit was to make their choice from a moral and ethical standpoint as to what they will do in the future. And really the technologies help.",

Here in Kyivand in the area, I've met and watched over the last few days, kids who've been obviously traumatized by the war, the air raid siren frighten the little ones. Kids who've been told to be quiet and hide quietly. Have difficulty speaking and communicating. Some kids have seen horrible things happen under occupation, their mothers raped for instance. Obviously, you're a mother but you're very involved in the mental health aspect. And with your foundation also with women and children. ZELENSKA (through translator):  First of all, it's a big tragedy that our children are being taken away to Russia. There is a large number of children who our social services lost connection with and we can't find them. Sometime in summer, the Russians relax their adoption legislation. They simplified the procedure to adopt Ukrainian children, which is horrible. And we understand, we'll have to fight for them. And we keep talking about it at all international forums. Currently, we have an agreement on the evacuation of two children's homes from the Odessa region. And there's already an agreement reached with Turkey. We're trying to save them in advance. But just two days ago, I heard the news that a children's home has we move from the occupied territories in Kherson region. We cannot reach them, unfortunately. We cannot save them. But hopefully the International Community will help us return our children. Now, as regards to helping those children who suffered psychologically from the horrors of war, now there are hundreds of these children already. And we cannot even imagine what those children suffered. Who had to bury their own mother in the yards of their homes. Who saw their relatives murdered. Who stayed in the basements of Mariupol. We can only observe them and try to help. And for that purpose, we are establishing a national program on mental health and psychosocial supports, which I hope will have a lot of projects for kids. I can give you an example. Once, fairly successful, I believe, we organized a camp together with Ukrainian psychologists and donors. There were 20 kids with psychological issues. We took them to a special camp where the tutors were psychologists. They spent 20 days in Spain under constant 24-hour psychological monitoring. And this therapy had wonderful results. The children who did not speak started speaking. The children who had eating disorders or didn't eat at all -- and there was a boy who never slept. The tutors had to sleep beside him because he could only sleep if there were somebody next to him. And indeed, we saw wonderful results. We want to scale up this project. We are supported by experts from Israel and Belgium. The next training destination for our specialist will be in the U.K. Very soon this month, we will be sending our psychologists and psychotherapists for training there. We choose the world's best practices for coping with PTSD.",

Other than the ultimatums, I've not heard anything from the current president of the Russian Federation. Starting for the 24th of February, there have been only ultimatums. Denazification, denationalization. Every issue they raise starts with a D. They always want to deprive us of something violently on our own land. So, I said that I'm not going to talk to this person if this person conducts these sham referendums and recognizes all of those sham authorities that they set up as legal. We said this clearly. And I said that if they do that, then this means they don't respect our people, our sovereignty, our rights, and our freedoms. What is there to talk to them about? But I haven't closed the door. I said, we would be ready to talk to Russia, but with a different Russia. One that is truly ready for peace. One that is ready to recognize that they are occupiers. Ready to reimburse our people. That's not about money. They need to return everything, land, rights, freedom, money, and most importantly justice. To parents who lost their children. Money is not enough. It's not a priority. Bring back justice. And so far, I have not heard statements like that from the Russian Federation, either from Putin or from anyone else.",

ZELENSKA (through translator):  I think the president knows better how much more we need. I'm sure we need much more. But as a citizen of Ukraine, as a mother and wife, I can feel that we need it because the missiles keep coming. When they stop coming, when our people stop dying in their beds in the morning, I will feel OK, maybe that's enough. But we can't wait for Russians to run out of their supplies. It would be wonderful for them to run out, but I guess that's fantasy. That's why I asked to protect our children, to protect all of us. It's hard to live under this burden every day when you don't know what will happen tomorrow. When missiles hit the crossroads while people are driving to work and get killed on the way. The other part of that missile hit a children's playground in Shevchenko Park. I literally walked there with my children when they were young. I'm really happy that it was 8:00 a.m. and there were no children yet. And I'm happy that my children are older and we weren't there. But this brings it closer and closer.

Are they finally delivering what you need to win? And do you feel that you're getting enough to win or just not to lose? ZELENSKYY (through translator):  I think my wife answered it very well. But the answer is fairly simple. It's enough when you can no longer hear explosions. It's enough when the air defense system ensure no missiles hit the ground or buildings. It's enough when you are not being fired at and no missiles are launched against you because Russia is working together with its partner, if I may call it that, with Iran. Since the 10th of October, we've seen them use around 450 kamikaze drones, attack drones, air reconnaissance, attack drones, kamikaze drones, missiles. Over this time, we've had over 2,500 hits, that's without artillery. 2,500 hits by drones, explosives, or missiles, that is a large number. Do we have enough defenses? No, I don't think we have enough at all. Is it enough to make 100 or 1,000 calls, probably not enough either. Too few. But I'm ready to make 1,000 calls if every call I make results in more air defense systems. I'm ready to stay on the phone and just do that. It's difficult. A joint decision on the protection of Ukraine and Ukrainian airspace will definitely help us. And all the answers are there. I'm sorry, it's not even like the start of the COVID epidemic. When people didn't know what to do about it. When we needed to create a vaccine and it didn't exist. There is a vaccine against Russian strikes and we know it. There is a vaccine against Russia and we know exactly which countries have it and in what amount. And I would say frankly, there are even countries that have a surplus amount, from my point of view. So, I guess an answer to your question, there is not enough willingness, I would say.",

And you guys are constantly poking on the ground, in the battle, in the airwaves, in the Twitter accounts of the ministry of defense, all over. A lot of people outside are afraid of Russia and what Russia might do. Where did this come from? ZELENSKYY (through translator):  You know, I think that Russia feeds on these fears. And I think this is a big mistake over the last few decades. Russia feels it has this power. The more you give it, the more it fuels your fear. It lives by it. ZELENSKA (through translator):  I think historically, we've been under pressure for so long, it's no longer scary. It's not even interesting. We just want it to stop. It's more of an emotion rather than a fear. Centuries of Russian empire, then dozens of years of Soviet Union, with all of these famines, with all the repressions, with all the expulsions of Ukrainians to Siberia and Kazakhstan. We've suffered so much from them that if we don't put an end to this now, there may be no chance in the future. This is our last stand. And when it is a last stand, we've all seen it in the movies, there is only one winner. And of course, our soul desire is to be that winner. Otherwise, we will have no future for this nation because everything that's happening is elimination on ethnic grounds. All this calls for denazification, this is all about the Ukrainian nation being wrong. Not having a right of -- to exist. The Ukrainian language is not a real language, it's just bad Russian. It's all about losing the values -- there are no values for humanity. This is something we can never put up with really because it would mean rejecting ourselves. Therefore, there is no fear. There is resilience. There is bravery. All we need is swifter and more powerful support than we are getting now. ZELENSKYY (through translator):  And this dignity, this Ukrainian dignity, is very important. And that's why we have this resilience. Russia keeps wondering, what's happening here? I don't understand why they're so keen to know what we're up to.

These are the women who chose the path of the military in wartime, not in peacetime when it would be more of a military romantic idea. There is a shortage of purely female things, in the uniform, there's only male underwear in the army. Women in the armed forces are still unique, but it's not unique in Ukraine anymore. And this whole war continues our path towards gender equality. And we've already made great strides in this. So, this war is as equal as Ukrainian society.

You describe some truly painful episodes, not just in your life, but in the lives of the people closest to you like, your mother and your dad's year's long struggles with substance abuse disorder. Your grandma and some of the ways in which she clearly stood up for you, and some of the ways when she frankly, you know, failed your mom, and by extension, failed you.

But your work, whether you knowingly intentionally chose that or not has always been identified with bringing those worlds together. The things that people are experiencing in their real lives become part of their sporting life. And similarly, sports, and the way as a commentary on the rest of life.

And your right, is that,people act like sports in the world are happening in two different universes and they are in the same universe. And so, therefore, everything that is going on in the world impacts what has happened in sports or what does happen in sports. And so, the more I saw these collisions between race, politics, gender, with sports, the more I understood that part of my mission was to write about these messy intersections because it was actually a way of getting people to understand those issues much differently. We are a very segregated country. We do not do a lot of things together. We do not intermix a lot of times. But the one place we do is in sports. Because you can have people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, different nationalities, different genders, all be Laker fans. OK? And they are not a lot of things in this country that force us into that bubble with one another. And so, why not use that opportunity to speak about issues a little differently or to write about them with that sense of awareness? It is why in some -- in many cases, sports has been ahead of the rest of society in terms of seeing advancement. Jackie Robinson integrated Major League Baseball in 1947. That was almost 20 years before there was a Civil Rights Act and a Voting Rights Act, before, you know, we saw the crumbling of segregation in certain parts of our country, that had already started to happen in sports. And because people saw it in sports, I'm not saying it made them more open to it necessarily, but it had least provided a model that it could be done.",

My very first college job I got when I was 28 years old at the Orlando Sentinel. I was the only black female sports columnist at the daily newspaper in North America. There are 405 daily newspapers in the USA, Canada and Mexico, and I was the only one. And that was a lot for me to take in. I felt a lot of pressure. I felt a lot of scrutiny. And it -- I think it showed up in my writing, like the first -- I write about this in the memoir, the first few months I did the job, I wasn't very good because I was thinking too much about what other people were thinking about the fact that I had this job. And once I was able to kind of get rid of that, it allowed me to, you know, find my voice and write to my standard. Once I got into broadcasting and saw that I was one of the few black women in a visible position, and the distinction of, by the way, being a black woman in commentary, I was not an anchor. So, that means I was driving shows with my actual opinion. And that was not seen hardly anywhere. And, yes, I also was aware it then too, like this comes with a lot of responsibility, but it was a responsibility I embraced, because in my presence, being on ESPN, inspired other women that they could be in the same place and to do it in the way that I was doing it, they did not have to follow my exact career path, but they knew there was more value to them than just being a sideline reporter or being a host and teeing up other people and us hearing their opinions, that there was a place for their actual voice.",

And ESPN isvery visible, it's the most dominant sports media brand in America, but some version of that had been happening throughout my whole career. I don't mean just their response to it or, you know, me finding out there are guardrails, they -- traditional media has always those throughout my career. You know, if you work at a newspaper, they tell you, you can't put up any political science on your yard, whether you are covering politics or not, right? There are certain rules you have to abide by in order to work for this place. And that is the trade-off that you make because you feel as if it's worth it, because you get to tell stories, you get to cover things, you get to impact the world with the content that you are creating. And eventually, you get to a point where you have more lived experience, more leverage, more savvy, where that trade-off is no longer worth it. And they -- one of the biggest lessons that I learned from leaving ESPN, which, by the way, is the best job I've ever had. I mean, I was there 12 years. It's the longest job that I have ever had. And for 90 percent of it, that relationship was good and it was fruitful, but it taught me a very important lesson about networks and about working in traditional media in general. And that is, is a conditional relationship. There will come a moment where you are going to need a level of support, a level of bravery and courageousness from the employers that you worked for. Especially if you are in my line of work where you give your opinion and sometimes that opinion is going to rub certain people in power the wrong way. And you hope that you have their support to count on. In my case, I didn't. And so, I learned a very important lesson in that, like regardless of how good that you think you may have it somewhere, the bottom line is always the bottom line. And the fact is what I said about the NFL was going to impact the bottom line. They are in a billion-dollar partnership with the NFL, and me suggesting that if the fans were so upset at the NFL for how they treated Colin Kaepernick, that they should think about maybe not watching the NFL instead of putting all the onus on the players and activist and other people. Like you have the power to change this yourself. You realize this, right? Instead of -- I understood what comes with that statement. And I never complained about being suspended. I knew what it was.

She had the highest rated show on the weekend. And they unceremoniously showed her the door because she responded to a text by Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly. And they felt like her response was not up to standard. Meanwhile, Megyn Kelly is allowed to call Tiffany Cross out by name. Tucker Carlson is allowed to put together a complete races monologue for several minutes on his air, and it's totally fine.

What could we do to, you know, strengthen the relationship? How can we amplify black creators and black commentators and hopes and all of this? And we are all telling the same thing, which is, that support means that when I go after an establishment, a hierarchy, people who are clearly in the wrong but who might, as I said, mess up the church's money, are you going to be there or not? Because that's what it comes down to. Like, they are fine with, you know, sort of attacking things where there could be a great swell of public support behind, where they feel, you know, it's the only reason why in 2020 so many of these corporations who wouldn't say black lives matter at the Ferguson suddenly were saying it in statements, nothing changed about the condition of black people in America. What changed was they felt more empowered to take that stance because they saw other people on the same bus with them. If the only time you are going to be with me is if when you feel comfortable and the level of support that is around, then you are not really with me. You know what I'm saying?

It's that, oh, as long as he has pledged to go after these specific people who they don't like, or vote against these people that they don't like, then it's perfectly acceptable to have a certain amount of incompetence. So, unlike a lot of times where I went to vote where there was a sense of optimism and, you know, hope and, like, oh, OK, let's see where this lands us, you know, I was kind of depressed going to the voting booth this time around because I realized that some of the staining of our democracy that has occurred in the last seven or eight years is permanent. It's not going away.
