We're going to go live in Atlanta with details on the ruling and early reaction to this decision.Plus, the union for the WNBA tells a renowned journalist that she went too far by daring to ask an uncomfortable question of a player, which is of course her job. Does this suggest that the WNBA players' union is turning a blind eye to serious issues facing its sport? Well, that journalist, Christine Brennan, joins the lead this hour to discuss. And leading this hour, post-apocalyptic, unprecedented, like a 250- mile-wide tornado has hit. Those are some of the descriptions used to talk about this heartbreaking toll of Hurricane Helene across the southeastern United States. Today we learned that the storm has killed at least 128 people. That number has increased since an hour ago when I reported on this. Hundreds of others have been reported missing. Towns reduced to debris. We begin our coverage this hour with CNN's Rafael Romo. He's in Western North Carolina with a close up look at this horrific destruction. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For Sarah Timko, this freshly brewed coffee is a luxury made possible by the love of her father. DAVE TIMKO, STORM VICTIM'S FATHER:  I asked my daughter are you okay? I just texted her and she sent me back these horrifying pictures. I mean, it looked like Armageddon. ROMO (voice-over):  That's when Dave Timko decided to travel hundreds of miles to come to the rescue of his daughter and her family bringing food, water, gas and supplies. D. TIMKO:  Buildings down, houses washed away. I'm like, oh my God, my daughter is in the middle of this and she's seven and a half months pregnant.",

Emergency crews say they're overwhelmed not only by the amount of people in need of help but also because they're unable to reach many of them. (On camera):  Cut-off communities, destroyed roads, and broken bridges like this one here in Swannanoa are making the job of first responders and search and rescue teams very difficult here in western North Carolina.",

We've heard from the same people that we helped previously that they have been re-inundated. So the impacts in Florida are also incredible.But here in North Carolina this is new and so people sadly in Florida have some experience of evacuating and preparing and really here we're seeing because of the mountainous geography such severe impacts.

That's immigration and border security. Something that throughout the debates I watched of Vance, both as a primary candidate in the Republican primary for Senate and in the one-on-one debates between him and Tim Ryan, he leaned on at moments when he really wanted to land a hit or move away from a topic that was perilous for him.

We're hearing from the Ministry of health that there are already fatalities from those strikes.Now what's interesting is that about an hour and 40 minutes ago, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli Military put out on Twitter a warning for three neighborhoods, big neighborhoods, in the southern suburbs of Beirut without specifying exactly what about a bit after that. About an hour ago, he put out a second tweet specifying buildings and telling people to get away from those buildings and any buildings around them that would be hit. But 20 minutes later the first strike happened. So that's not an awful lot of time if you have people who can't move quickly to get away from some of those buildings. So certainly this is the most intense series of strikes we've seen, certainly in Beirut within the last 24 hours. This as, of course, anticipation is growing for some sort of Israeli ground incursion in the south of Lebanon. What we're hearing, Jake, from residents down there is that there is an intense presence of Israeli drones and warplanes in the sky. Earlier Lebanese media was reporting that there was tank and artillery fire on the eastern sector of the border between the two countries. There's no indication just yet if this ground incursion the Israelis are talking about has occurred, but certainly expectations are high that something could be happening within the next hours or.

It was bloodier for Israeli forces than Israel expected. And by the way, after they left, Hezbollah lived another day and infact grew in power during that time period. Then you could go back to 1982 to 2000 when Israel had a longer occupation of Lebanon, and again during that time period, Hezbollah grew in power. The question is what has Israel learned from those experiences? I mean, you can certainly say, Jake, that the shaping operations, or the operations in preparation for any ground incursion, have been far more extensive than we saw in 2006, for instance, to completely decapitate the entire Hezbollah leadership from top to bottom and signal quite clearly to Hezbollah fighters and operatives, thousands of them, that it could reach out and touch them via exploding pagers and walkie talkies. Plus all these airstrikes we've been seeing. I should note, Jake, that, as I was just speaking there, heard a jet fly overhead, and we often do hear the jets fly overhead when they head towards Lebanon. They've certainly taken more steps prior, but that does not guarantee that when Israeli forces go in, if they do that, they will solve this problem definitively and for a length of time. Then, of course, the question is, how long do they stay? Because their goal, as stated, Jake, is to move Hezbollah back many tens of kilometers to the Litani River. That would take time, and that would take numerous ground forces.",

We're not quite sure what, but Caitlin's down and holding her eye, and she did end up with a black eye. So that's what happened. Looking at replays that were all over the internet. And this is what hit me. This is Sunday afternoon. The game happens now, it's Tuesday when I ask that question. So 48 hours later, basically. But replays were just running rampant on the internet with all kinds of pictures of DiJonai Carrington guarding Caitlin Clark, and then what's happening with her hand. And they're even, like, her fingers are going in Caitlin's eye. And I thought, you know what? The best thing I can do as a journalist is to try to give the athlete an opportunity, which I've done tens of thousands of times, to answer the question and tell us what she believes happens. That was literally it. And as you know, first of all, I'd ask that question 100 times out of 100, I'd ask it today. The athlete has every opportunity to then take that question and go with it any way she wants. And obviously she did.
