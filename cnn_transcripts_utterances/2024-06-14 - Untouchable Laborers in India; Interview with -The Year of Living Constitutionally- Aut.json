I decided to do this because I wanted to explore what the constitution actually says and how should we interpret it? And as you probably know, in the last couple of years, the Supreme Court, the conservative majority, has embraced something called originalism, which says the most important thing when interpreting the constitution is what did it mean when it was written 230 years ago.",

AndI'll give you just two quick examples, the First and the Second Amendment. So, the First Amendment, back then, was much more constrained. I love the First Amendment. Free speech, I'm a big fan. But I'm a fan of modern free speech. Back at the founding, it wasn't quite Stalinist Russia, but there were Laws against obscenity, against blasphemy, sedition, was much more cracked down upon. And we don't want to go back to that original meaning of the First Amendment, neither conservatives nor progressives. Because the First Amendment would not allow for political contributions, unlimited political contributions to candidates. So, that's an example of one that's very different. And the Second Amendment, the technology was so vastly different. I mean, I went and I shot a musket and it is 15 steps to shoot a musket. It is, you got to take out the ramrod, pour in the gunpowder, put back the ramrod. It's like building a desk from Ikea. It takes a while. So, it is a vastly different machine. And the question is, should there be regulations that are different because it is so different. And it's not something -- a musket would be very hard to do a mass shooting with a musket because it takes so long to load.",

Evenoriginalists would say, for instance, that the law -- the rule against unreasonable searches and seizures. Originally, that meant the constable banging down the door to search your papers, but now, they say, yes, it does apply to the internet and iPhones, but it's inconsistent. When do you update and when do you not? So, a hardcore originalist like Clarence Thomas would say that the 14th amendment, which guarantees equal protection and due process, when that was written after the Civil War, it did not apply to gay people or gay marriage. So, he would argue, that does not cover the constitutional right. Whereas those who are on the other side, often called living constitutionalists or pragmatists, would say no, you have to update the morals as well. With the times, the morals change and gay people should be protected by the 14th Amendment.",

I'm not going to do it the slacktivism way on the internet. So, I got out a roll of -- a big roll of paper and have people sign with a quill pen. Now, my petition was -- because I'm concerned about the president. Both Democrat and Republican presidents have way too much power. The founders would be shocked by the war powers and trade powers. So, I went back to an idea from the founding fathers during the constitutional convention, when someone brought up the idea of a single president. Several of the delegates said, are you jesting? That's a terrible idea. We just fought to get rid of a king. Why would we want a single president? Let's have three presidents, three co-presidents. Let's have 12 presidents. Ben Franklin wanted a council of 12 presidents. And I thought this is an interesting idea. So, I brought a petition. to Congress, to Senator Ron Wyden in Washington. I was wearing my tricorn hat, my regimental coat, buckled shoes, the whole thing. But he said he would consider it, which I think he meant he would consider it for five seconds. But he did agree with my general thesis, which is the president is too powerful. And we have a -- we have on the -- in the future, possible presidents who are going to be more authoritarian. So, we do need to constrain the president. I don't actually think three presidents. I don't know if Biden, Trump, and RFK Jr. co-working in the Oval Office is a great idea. But there are ways to constrain the president that we need to look into and give power back to the Congress, which is what the founders wanted.",

And I think that I don't think everyone needs to go back to quills, but I think writing and thinking offline is so crucial, and it allowed me to, I think, see the world in a more subtle way. And one of the big -- the other big takeaway for me was that it allowed me to see the other side a little more. I think we are nowadays so stuck in our opinions, so intransigent and unwilling to look at the evidence and see the other side. And this is not a patriotic way of looking at the world.

Others like Justice Breyer, who retired, he was very interested in how foreign Democracy's worked. And I think I agree with Justice Breyer, let's look at what is working and what is not. One thing that I don't think is working for us is the two-party system and I don't think the founders wanted a two-party system. But you look at many European democracies, and they have six or eight parties. There seems to be a Goldilocks zone of about -- I think it's about four to eight parties is the best.
