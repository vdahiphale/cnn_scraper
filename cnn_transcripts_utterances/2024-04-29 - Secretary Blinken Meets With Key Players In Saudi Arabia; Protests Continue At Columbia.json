And that's because this framework is really a last ditched attempt in many ways by the Egyptian government to try and avoid that Rafah offensive, which would be right on its doorstep. Egyptian officials have put this latest framework on the table that would see the release of 20 to 33 Israeli hostages released over the course of several weeks. The ratio of numbers of days to hostages would be one to one. So, as many hostages as are released would be the number of days of that initial ceasefire.Israel has also agreed in this framework to the unrestricted access of Palestinians to northern Gaza, something that has been a key sticking point for Hamas over the course of the last several weeks. But now the question is, what will Hamas' response be and how exactly will the issue of a more permanent ceasefire be linked? Because also in this framework is the notion of a sustained calm, which is effectively a one year ceasefire that would come into place after that initial release of some nearly 33 Israeli hostages. So, Hamas officials are currently in Cairo discussing this latest framework. Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, has this framework in hand. And his response is expected as early as tomorrow, perhaps in a matter of days. And that will give us a sense of whether or not there is a serious way to move forward here with these negotiations or whether it's clear that these talks are at a dead end, in which case Israeli officials are determined to move forward with that ground offensive in Rafah.",

And so, you know, at the end of the day, it becomes a moral question of when there is an on-going genocide that is being broadcasted, live broadcast to the world, why would we not do everything that we can, including peaceful protest, to call for an end to the genocide and call for an end to our institution's complicity in that genocide.",

In the video, which CNN is not airing,American-Israeli Keith Siegel pleads for Israel's prime minister to negotiate a hostage release deal. One would assume this was clearly under duress, given that he is being held by Hamas. It is the first video released of Siegel since he and his wife Aviva were abducted from a kibbutz in southern Israel on October 7th. His wife was released in November as part of a hostage deal. Also appearing in that video is Israeli hostage Omri Miran, who was also abducted by Hamas gunmen on October 7th. Now, the families of both men are demanding the Israeli government approve a deal for the return of all hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANI MIRAN, FATHER OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE OMRI MIRAN (through translator): I'm convinced that all the people of Israel and the nations of the world want to see the end of the bloodshed and the end of the suffering of our people. Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and the cabinet, please make any deal, make any deal, but every deal is executable. I'm asking you to get a decision now, now, now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we compared it side by side during the commercial break of what he looked like in that video. And it is shocking. I mean, he barely looks like, if I'm honest with you, the same person. He's obviously been through so much. This is a Hamas propaganda video, right? That is what this is. And that is why CNN isn't airing it. That's why most media outlets aren't airing it at this point.

The content was dictated by Hamas andwas forced upon Omri to say, and it's a war crime to force hostages, to hold hostages in the first place, and of course, to use them as a propaganda tool. But what we do want people to take from the video is that two hostages there, Keith Siegel and Omri Miran are alive and that these two hostages, alongside 131 other hostages, need to return home to their families. And the fact that they're still alive, that they can still communicate with us, that we can still feel them and feel that they're so close and yet so far, requires us to continue and push our policymakers to do everything they can to bring them home. And I'm so inspired by my sister and by Dani's father. Both of them spoke in the press conference today. And, you know, from their behavior, from their conduct, they always remind me of \"Ulysses\" poem, the poem \"Ulysses\" by Tennyson, how they strive to seek to find and not to yield.
