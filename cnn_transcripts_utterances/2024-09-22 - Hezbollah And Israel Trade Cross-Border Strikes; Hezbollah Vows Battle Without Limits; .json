Israeli officials have briefed me that many of them are inside or near populated areas. That means counterinsurgency, going house to house, looking for hidden caches of weapons.And on the Hezbollah side, the reason I think they're holding back is, first of all, there's the communications disarray caused by the pager and walkie talkie attacks that have been attributed to Israel. Plus, Hezbollah has always intended to use those weapons as an answer to Israel's attack on Iran at some point in the future. If it starts hitting populated areas with those missiles, that would trigger a back and forth conflagration that would force it to use rockets that Iran hopes to use in another strategic context if it gets threatened in the future.",

That's a very kind of calculated way to describe it, but when you hear from Israelis, that's what they, many of them, especially some of the hostage families think is going on, that Netanyahu is dragging out the violence in one sense because on the international stage, he's hoping there'll be a new person in the White House who will be more favorable to him.",

His plan funds the government with a limited continuing resolution through December 20th.Now Johnson is leading with a very slim majority, and he has tried to fix this funding problem over the last week, bringing other versions to the floor. But after some members of his own party pushed back against it, he was really having trouble getting something over the finish line. We are hearing some hope from the other side as Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is responding. He says that the Democrats will evaluate the plan when they return to Washington, but added Congress is now on a bipartisan path to avoid a government shutdown that would hurt everyday Americans. This still has a lot of hurdles to go through before it makes it here to the president's desk. As far as some of the specifics that are added into this bill, we do know that there is going to be some additional funding for the Secret Service.

It probably was over before the revelations that Andrew put out late last week, but it is now officially over. Josh Stein will be the next governor from North Carolina.The question and what make this significant then is how does this impact Donald Trump and his campaign and how does it affect those campaigns down ballot as well. And I can tell you, the night that the story came out that Andrew and his team wrote, I got a text message from somebody who's running statewide and it said, I think I'm toast. And that's the problem for everybody who's running statewide and even in some of these -- some other races. We have a targeted congressional seat in North Carolina, one for instance, the Robinson effect there could be big. Donald Trump didn't mention him because he wants no part of Mark Robinson right now. That also is significant. But the idea that Mark Robinson is ever going to be the governor of North Carolina is over.",

He said he remains in a strong position to make the case to voters and win on November 5. But Doug, I hear you. When you look at just the polling even before this all came out, it was going to be a tough race for him. And now, to your point, we're here.",

And now, we're talking about, you know, the QRS teams of anybody who might want to join his campaign. He also doesn't have a lot of money, which means -- watching the North Carolina football debacle yesterday, there were a lot of TV ads that I saw for Kamala Harris, for Donald Trump, and for Josh Stein. Didn't see any Mark Robinson ads. He doesn't have the money to go on the air. So, how he's going to make that case really doesn't exist at this point.And it's all really about those people who are going to decide the election, the 440,000 new unaffiliated voters who've moved to North Carolina or registered unaffiliated since 2020. They're going to decide the presidential election. The governor's election is already done.",

Does it make -- does it close the gap enough for the other person? Maybe not. But in a place like North Carolina where we can continue to see this polling that is so unbelievably close and it is going to likely be one on the margins, that this is something that could drive just enough in the margins. What do you think of that?",
