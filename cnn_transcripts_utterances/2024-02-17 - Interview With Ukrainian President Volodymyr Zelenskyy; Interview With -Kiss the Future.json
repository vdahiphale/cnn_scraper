He died in a Russian prison and the case is being investigated according to the Kremlin. Long a thorn in the side of Vladimir Putin, a former security official, western leader says, it is an ominous message to the world before.

And as Trump's Maga Republicans in Congress thwart (ph) further military aid to Ukraine, the real and urgent question whether Kyiv can hold off Putin for another year.

They're destroying complete all the houses, the households, buildings, and then they're trying to move into certain areas.These are small villages, or very small towns and I let me repeat it again for wished to seize them, it has taken them two years. What we expect? We expect to see, what has been promised what we have agreed upon, that we will be able to unblock the sky is where the Russians have an advantage. As soon as we can do that, they don't -- no longer control the sky. I've been emphasizing this. That's the very purpose of the word, to unblock the sky. We have started receiving, we're grateful to our partners, we've started to receive the air defense systems, Patriot (INAUDIBLE) and others and we have too few of them. I'm not criticizing now, but we have too few of them in order to quickly move ahead. But the decision is very simple. Where we had our air defense systems, where we had that time, people would come back, they would bring back the economy of a certain town or city. The city was practically protected. We have such cities. It's not very fair toward the other cities. We don't have priority lines here, just we're short of such systems. But where we had such systems of air defense, immediately Russia would move back because it would lose its aircraft. That I can tell you. Well, I will not tell you exactly what we are using, but one of the latest examples we destroyed 12 aircraft of the Russian Federation recently. So those systems will unblock the sky and will make it possible for our soldiers to move ahead. Because -- so you'll ask me what we're expecting. If we have those systems and long-range weapons because it's all an unfair war, it's unfair in general, but it's unfair in terms of the advantages. If you have artillery with a range of up to 20 kilometers and the Russians artillery has the range of up to 40 kilometers -- that's the answer. A human being is fighting artillery. That's unfair it's not modern war ideology. We have to develop technology. We've started doing that. We have to develop to start building drones.",

Hello. Hi namaste. Namaste. He was with a unit of Nepalis battling Ukrainians, she tells me, when he was gunned down. \"It was my husband's friend, his Nepali commander in Ukraine, who called me in the middle of the night and told me he'd been killed,\" she tells me, still shocked at the news. \"There's been no notification from the Russians, she adds, \"nothing\".
