He was working, as I work, as you work, doing nothing out of this. Just no crime at all. And for this, he is in prison. This is how Russian state works right now. And it's important to remember that Vladimir Putin is not a person who you would negotiate with, you know, as you do with -- I would repeat, as you do with normal leaders.

That's even though ISIS has claimed responsibility for the shooting and arson attack which left more than 140 people dead. But Moscow now says the suspects received cash and cryptocurrency from Ukraine without revealing any of the alleged evidence.Ukraine has denied any involvement in the massacre. And the U.S. dismissed Russia's claim as propaganda and nonsense. It says it warned Russia more than two weeks in advance that a terrorist attack could be in the making. Meanwhile, the London-based investigative group Dossier Center says Russian security services knew about an ISIS threat days before the attack. The group says it obtained a Russian internal intelligence report. The White House isn't ruling out a plan in the House of Representatives that would structure aid to Ukraine as a loan. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has been working with Republican backers of Ukraine aid on a package that also includes restrictions on the U.S. border with Mexico. He spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday. Zelenskyy says he reminded Johnson of the dramatic increase in Russia's air terror over the past few weeks. And he urged quick passage of a new aid package. Now Ukraine isn't taking Russia's increased attacks lying down. Its forces are stepping up their drone campaign against Russian oil refineries with the help of artificial intelligence. CNN's Clare Sebastian has details.

In fact, the latest victim, a six-year-old boy, we heard from a doctor in Gaza today at the Kamal Adwan Hospital, that this six-year-old boy died of malnutrition and dehydration.

Now the U.S. is doing rather ludicrous efforts flying or moving 1,000 troops across the Atlantic to the eastern Mediterranean to try to set up some sort of seaport to provide food to Gaza, whereas, it would be very easy if the Israelis would allow hundreds of trucks to go into Gaza every day to provide the necessary food, water and other supplies.

CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has more on their daily struggle to find food. Now we just want to warn you, some of the images in this report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This video filmed 11 days ago at a northern Gaza hospital, captured little Mohammed's final days. His labored breaths and all that staff tried to do to keep him alive. On Thursday, 6-year-old Mohammed became the 24th Palestinian child to die of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza. And the fear is many more vulnerable lives could be lost. Hunger is in every corner of this besieged territory. The pain visible in the eyes of mothers like Najla (ph), who's helplessly watched her children go hungry for months. Her husband, Mahran (ph), has thought the unthinkable, throwing his children in the sea, he says, to spare them this torture of an existence. Dante's family endured months of bombardment in northern Gaza. But it's a looming famine there that's pushed them out of their home. If you grab a bag of flowers, someone can kill you to take it, Mahran says. Our daily meal for our children became things we hadn't heard of before, like ground soybeans and a wild plant that we'd never tasted before. Food that animals refuse to eat, we ate. What they'll do, where they'll go, they don't know. All they want right now is to feed their little ones. My children were crying every night asking for a piece of bread, Najla says. We were dreaming of white bread. We were eating animal food. For the first time in five months, they say, the children are having real food, even if only plain bread. This is what Dante's family left behind in the north, scenes that tell of the desperation of so many who also just want to feed their children as they rush the little aid that's made it into this part of Gaza. More than 1 million Palestinians are now facing catastrophic levels of hunger, according to a U.N. backed report, with famine projected to arrive in the north any day now. In this manmade crisis, where Israel's been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war, something it denies. People every day find themselves scavenging for food, forced to pick wild plants to boil and eat. This grandmother can't hold back her tears as she washes weeds and leaves. It's today's meal. What else can we do, she says. It's the indignity of hunger. Avoidable suffering as the world watches on. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's very easy in these instances to zoom in on what I call the precipitating causes, what happened on the ship, what happened next and how it hit the bridge. But -- but it's important, I think, to always just sort of sit back from that a little bit and look at the intermediate causes and the deep causes.And if you look at the deep causes, that's the thing that surprises me here is the resilience of that bridge or the lack of it. Now, that would have been known about in the port area. At some point, someone's done a risk assessment on the vulnerability of that bridge. They've looked at measures to ameliorate that lack of resilience and have decided to not do it for the reasons of cost. And I think when the investigation digs into the layers of this investigation -- of this terrible accident, I think they'll look very closely at the decision chain to not provide greater resilience in and around the bridge and or knowing that take tugs when ships pass under it.",
