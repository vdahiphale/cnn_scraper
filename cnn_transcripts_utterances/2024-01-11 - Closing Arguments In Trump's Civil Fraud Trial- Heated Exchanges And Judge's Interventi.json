We're closely tracking the closing arguments in Donald Trump's civil fraud trial in New York. The prosecution is set to begin in just a few minutes, and a short time ago during the Trump defense argument, the judge allowed the former president to address the court, and Trump used the opportunity to reiterate the claims that he's made outside the courtroom almost every time he's appeared at this trial, to the point that the judge cut him off after five minutes.",

But they're not only speaking to the judge today, they're also making their closing argument in the court of public opinion, trying to frame this entire civil case as a political persecution. And yesterday, the judge appeared to close the door on the possibility of Trump participating in today's closing arguments.And for the first few hours, it was just Trump's lawyer, Chris Kise, summarizing their case, emphasizing that they believe he is being targeted for political reasons, emphasizing that their client had, you know, no motivation to defraud Deutsche Bank. Now, at the very end, though, Kise asked if his client, former President Trump, could speak. The judge allowed it. And not surprisingly, Trump went on a bit of a rant, attacking the district attorney, attacking the judge, attacking the entire process. Now, as you noted, our colleague Kara Scannell was in court today. This was a little bit of a surprise, but it wasn't really a surprise that Trump got the final word, right?",

And he had three chances already to speak to the public. He addressed cameras on his way in. He spoke to the judge, spoke briefly on the way out. And then he is expected to give a statement. We're not sure if it'll be a press conference where he'll take questions, but a press availability shortly thereafter.Now, this is quite a contrast from what we saw in federal court on Tuesday. Of course, he showed up kind of trying to do something similar to oral arguments in D.C. But federal court is quite a different thing. There are no cameras in the courtroom. There's no pool spray. And you pull into a garage. No one sees you. He really didn't get much of a return on his investment showing up to federal court. So, making sure to make the most of it today, because, of course, not only does he have these various legal problems, he's, of course, once again running for the White House. So as important as the legal arguments were today, the arguments that he is making to the electorate about how to solve political election interference, he calls it, just as important for him, of course.

Who among us, ladies and gentlemen, has not overvalued a property by a factor of three, which is essentially the argument that he's making.And they're just trying to play to that.

Now, it gets a little bit complicated because what do you do with existing loans that they might have? What do you do with assets? Do you sell the companies? Could they move to another state, reincorporate there and then do business there? So, what what would happen is you just open up more litigation and more legal wrangling.And I don't think anybody knows for certain what would happen given how complicated the Trump organization is and their business relationships are not just in the city of New York, but around the country. But yes, principally speaking, they're going to lose the ability to lose business in New York to do business in New York. And it's just it's not good for them.",

He is what remedy if it's, you know, it's forcing them to sell or take away their business certificates.

The reality is at the end of this process, it will no longer be a rumor, a allegation, the question of whether Donald Trump inflates his business identity. It will be a matter of fact.
