Critical bridges destroyed as Russian forces moved to encircle the city amid fears that it could fall at any time.Also this hour, Alex Murdaugh is sentenced to life in prison after jurors quickly convicted him of murdering his wife and son. The judge condemning the disgraced lawyer and calling him a monster. And the Trump DeSantis split within the GOP is on display at dueling conservative events. This is CNN has uncovered comments by a new appointee of Governor DeSantis peddling a baseless antigay conspiracy theory. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Brianna Keilar, and you're in The Situation Room. Tonight, Ukrainian forces are in an intense struggle to hold on to Bakhmut and prevent Russian fighters from capturing the city and giving Vladimir Putin a new win. CNN's Alex Marquardt is near the front lines in eastern Ukraine. Alex, Bakhmut is symbolically significant. Where do things stand tonight?",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, Russian forces are still trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, but they are holding out. This is a very tough fight for the Ukrainians. They got even tougher today with the Russian destruction of a bridge on the main supply route that Ukraine uses to get to the front line. Essentially, it's the only paved road that Ukraine can use to back up its forces.We were on that road yesterday, we showed it to our viewers here on this program. We saw all kinds of military vehicles going to and from that front line. So now if Ukraine wants to supply its forces, if it wants to withdraw, if it wants to try to extract civilians, it's going to have to do so on dirt roads and across open fields, which makes things a lot more difficult, a lot more dangerous. Brianna, we also heard from the head of the Wagner group today, those are the Russian mercenaries who've been leading Russia's fight. He called on President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to withdraw his forces from Bakhmut, saying that they are almost surrounded, that they will be completely surrounded in a day or two and that he should save his troops. Ukraine calling that part of a disinformation campaign. We did see the top general for the eastern part of the country in Bakhmut in photos today. It's unclear when those photos were taken, but that was a clear sign that Ukraine is saying that we are standing firm, that we are not giving up this fight. Brianna, separately, we also saw the U.S. Attorney General, Merrick Garland. He visited Ukraine today on an unannounced visit. He went to a judicial conference in the western city of Lviv, meeting with Ukraine's prosecutor general and President Zelenskyy, saying, repeating that the world needs to hold Russia accountable for what it has done here. Attorney General Garland, the latest in a string of U.S. officials to visit Ukraine. Of course, we had President Biden last week. That was followed by the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, earlier this week and then Garland today, all showing their support for Ukraine. Brianna?",

A very substantive meeting and one in which both leaders, not only on the staff side but also in one on one conversations between the two, really wanted to focus on continuing and maintaining what has been pretty much rock solid coordination over the course of the last year, but also the critical nature of that coordination continuing in the months ahead. As Alex was just reporting, this is a war that continues to grind on with no end in sight. That is what makes this bilateral relationship and the critical nature of this relationship within the larger transatlantic alliance that has been in place and led by President Biden so crucial as the President made clear.

They may be waiting, they may be in the wings, they may be waiting for breakthrough. But we think those forces are there, along with aircraft north of the Ukrainian border there in the eastern part, northeast of Ukraine. So I think that we're in a very difficult situation. As long as Ukraine can hold, it should. It should do its best not to fall back a withdrawal under enemy pressures of very difficult military operation. As long as they can hold, they should hold. The idea, though, that the Russians have is to force the Ukrainians to give up the Ukrainian offensive capability that's being held back and force them to throw that into the fight.

We all remember that ad for governor in 2018 in which he is reading the Art of the Deal to his child, he's teaching another child how to build the wall, referencing Trump in that Florida ad nonstop.So he clearly was trying to appeal to the base. And I will tell you that there are a number of people that I spoke to here who say that they actually like DeSantis a lot. Even the people who say they want Trump to be president in 2024, say they like DeSantis. They just don't believe it's his turn. The question is whether or not he can continue to scave off these insults from former President Donald Trump. I mean, for the last several weeks, we have seen Trump just go after DeSantis on through Social as well as interviews calling him disloyal, hitting his COVID policies. And the list goes on and on hitting him over Social Security and Medicare. Now the question again whether or not DeSantis can continue to just blow this off as noise, that he's not going to hit other Republicans or if at some point he actually decides to take on former President Trump. And then what does that look like for this Republican base? Do people split? Do they go towards Donald Trump? This is a group that has been very loyal to him. But again, there are people there who like Ron DeSantis. So he has a very fine line here that he has to navigate.",
