We know, as you mentioned, they are back at the bargaining table today, the auto workers union said they sent new counter offers to each of the big three: Ford, G.M. and Stellantis. Yesterday, they are waiting for a response, no doubt, that's going to be discussed today. But it's hard to imagine this is going to be ending at least anytime soon. We certainly, it doesn't seem within the next 24 hours. And we've heard from a lot of workers who have said, they are preparing for this to potentially last for a while. To set the scene for you here, we're outside this Stellantis factory, which is right behind me -- they are right in front of me, I should say. They build jeeps here more than 1,000 a day. And if you look down, there are groups of these picketers of for a half mile in each direction, covering every gate, every entrance, there are 5,800 workers on strike here in Toledo. 13,000, across the country, between these three plants. And you can get a sense just being here, talking to some of these workers of the frustrations, they have been feeling. I actually want to bring in one of those workers now. Dominic, can we grab you for a second?",

But either way, whether more workers go out on strike, we know that in the coming days at these facilities stay close, we're going to start to see more of a ripple effect across the auto manufacturing industry here in the U.S. We're already seeing it. Ford, announcing, they are laying off 600 workers in Michigan. G.M. saying they're going to idle 2,000 workers in Kansas.

And so, they are trying to turn back the time where, you know, we had fixed benefit pensions for these workers there were not two-tier employment right now, the new workers are coming in at lower standards.

In that case, we have a little bit more of a streamline situation where there is one employer here, we have three, of course, and this is a historic strike in the sense that the United Auto Workers have doesn't ever strike against all three at once.I think what's happening here is, you know, you have an industry that's very much in transition, maybe even more than in logistics, where the companies are trying to figure out how to go from internal combustion engines to this, these new E.V. products, the E.V. facilities to date aren't really unionized. And so, what does that mean to try to win in the facilities that are making the traditional vehicles. This also fits into a larger sort of political context with President Biden and his manufacturing and green manufacturing policies. But, you know, I think there's a lot of connections between the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters UPS, strike preparation. A lot of the United Auto Workers will talk about how they were watching the UPS workers do practice pickets. They were kind of trying to figure out how they too could harness a strategy that was much more grassroots. The United Auto Workers like the Teamsters is also coming out of a period of reform within the union, new president, past two president saw prison time for embezzlement. The United Auto Workers is seeing the strike as a sort of moment where they can declare we are a new union. We're more of a grassroots union.

And visitors here on a weekend, listening to this music, as this very dramatic vote is just going on feet away from where these visitors of the capitol are listening to the concert here, and then, returning almost like a cinematic Godfather kind of feel, if you will. But it has been a rather dramatic vote, by and large, Ken Paxton receiving support from the vast majority of the Republicans. Remember, he needed 90 -- he needed 19 -- or 10 of the 19 Republican senators to vote for him and he is getting the vast majority of that so far. In fact, most of the votes have been 14 to acquit. There needs to be 21 votes to remove Ken Paxton from office. So, these votes are sending quite a signal. And Fredricka, important to remember that in the last few days, the amount of political pressure has really ramped up intensely here in this state as extreme right-wing groups that have been very supportive of Ken Paxton have been pushing their followers and their supporters to get people and to get the senators to understand how much they appreciate Ken Paxton despite the amount of baggage and controversy that this attorney general has brought.

He was shown a series of planes, including fighter jets and an attack aircraft. A hypersonic missile system and a long-haul passenger plane were also seen on display. State media also reports he went to see a warship with the commander of the Russian Navy. As far as the bigger picture using an armored train for travel, these most recent stops are part of a larger visit by Kim to Russia, which included time with Vladimir Putin. These are two nations that have really isolated themselves from the rest of the world during the war in Ukraine, yet, could stand to gain having each other support. Analysts point out that Russia needs munition. North Korea may want military technology or simply food. This gathering certainly draws concern. As we've reported, United Nations resolutions ban unregulated arms trade and military cooperation. The Kremlin says it's fully complied with the restrictions, both nations are already heavily sanctioned.

What makes LGBTQ representation in film and television important in your view that is now being jeopardized by this strike potentially? SARAH KATE ELLIS, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, GLAAD: So just to give context to that, most people know someone who's trans through media, right? And 30 percent of Americans say they do know transgender Americans, or 30 percent of Americans say they do know somebody who's transgender, meaning 70 percent don't. That means that 30 percent of Americans, more Americans report having seen a ghost. We rely on Hollywood to tell our stories as the LGBTQ community to humanize us. And if you look at the context we're living in right now, we've seen over 500 anti-LGBTQ bills this year. We're seeing bans on books, bans on drag shows. So when Hollywood tells our story, that humanizes who we are. And I think, this year, with our studio responsibility index, which we just released the other day, we're seeing great growth in our storytelling. However, what's happening right now with the studio executives not coming to the table, not negotiating, not offering fair solutions here is that, as this continues to move on and on and on, the stories that will be cut first are LGBTQ stories around marginalized folks' stories.

Half of those, where we did see LGBTQ people, we were on the screen for five minutes or less. So while we're seeing an increase there, we are not seeing full stories being told. Right? And there's a lot of progress that we have to make here, but we're seeing steps forward and we don't want to see that fall back.",

Ken Paxton has survived 16 votes on articles of impeachment. Really resoundingly.There were only two Republicans who, at any point, voted to impeach their fellow Republican attorney general. So rather overwhelming support for Ken Paxton in this impeachment trial. He was tried during this trial on 16 of the 20 articles of impeachment that House -- that the House of Representatives brought here in Texas. And just now, the Senate also voting to dismiss those final four articles of impeachment. So essentially, a clear victory here for Ken Paxton this afternoon as Senators are still inside the chamber. They are going through the final readout of the vote on that motion to suspend or to dismiss the last final four articles of impeachment. But this is a vote that will have massive ramifications across the political spectrum here in Texas. There was an intense amount of pressure on Republicans in the Senate to acquit Ken Paxton, despite him having served in this office of attorney general under a constant cloud of controversy since he was first elected to this office years ago. He's been elected three times despite being under federal investigation. He's also facing financial security charges in state court. So this is a state official who has been under a constant cloud of controversy. But despite that, he has benefited from having a close relationship with Donald Trump. He has benefited from all of that as he has garnered a great deal of support among extreme right-wing Republicans here in this state. And that appears to have been enough to convince many of these Senators to vote for Ken Paxton here this afternoon. So the bottom line, this just now developing, this vote has gone on for almost two hours on 16 hours of impeachment. Ken Paxton survives, and he will be resuming his duties as the attorney general here in Texas -- Fredricka?",
