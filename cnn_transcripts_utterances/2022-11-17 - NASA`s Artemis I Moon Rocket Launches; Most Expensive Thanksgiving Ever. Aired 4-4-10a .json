(END VIDEO CLIP) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Thursday, everyone, or as I like to say happy Friday eve. I`m Coy. Thankful to be hanging out with you. Time for the best 10 minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let`s rise together. We start today with the liftoff of the rocket we just saw. Yesterday, NASA launching its long-awaited Artemis moon rocket. The mission was a long time and a lot of money coming. NASA has spent more than billion dollars to date getting Artemis off the ground. But there were scrubbed launches hurricanes and mechanical issues that delayed takeoff for months. But the rocket finally got off the ground. This mission kicks off a key test of America`s ability to send astronauts back to the moon. Can you believe the last time humans were on the moon was way back in 1972? That`s 50 years ago. But hold on a moon-it, there won`t be any humans on the moon just yet. There`s no crew for this expedition. The rocket will come within 60 miles of the lunar surface before flying forty thousand miles beyond the moon and then looping back to Earth over three weeks` time. The journey will conclude with a splash when the rocket lands at sea on December 11th. We`re going to hear now from CNN`s space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher about the first test flight of the Artemis moon rocket. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And so, what we`ve seen over the last few hours is launch and then the capsule separating from the rocket, and the rocket falling back to earth. And now, this little capsule, the Orion capsule, is now making its way to the moon. It`s going to take about five or six days to get there. When it gets there, it`s going to fly by very close to the moon just about feet off the lunar surface before then traveling farther out into space than any spacecraft ever designed to carry humans has ever flown, before flying back to earth testing out that all-important heat shield at the base of the Orion capsule before splashing down into the ocean.

Here`s what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17 percent year- over-year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 cents a pound. That`s up from a $1.74. Now you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and hire fuel feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43 percent more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 33 percent. Flour is up nearly 25 percent. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans. A new Wells Fargo report suggests some Americans may opt to eat out rather than shop and cook at home this year. Dining out also can be cost the report says, but it may be a better value than one might expect. Government data backs that up year over year the cost of dining out rose at a slower pace than the cost of a typical grocery store run. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
