Ukraine's president is accusing Russia of energy terrorism as the country suffers blackouts and both sides prepare for a battle for the city of Kherson. And the new boss of Twitter, Elon Musk, will decide the fate of thousands of employees this morning. Who gets to keep their job and who is fired? Hello, and welcome. I'm Christina MacFarlane in London. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. At this hour in Pakistan thousands have taken to the streets. One day after someone shot the former prime minister Imran Khan. This is the scene in Quetta where protesters blocked traffic. It's one of at least five cities seeing protests today. In the hall where Khan is recovering, protesters burned ties outside the government's house. Khan was riding on top of an open truck when the shots rang out. He was quickly rushed to the hospital in nearby Lahore and was reportedly hit in the leg and is expected to recover. Police have one man in custody for the shooting. They say he confessed in a video. Well, Sophia Saifi has been following the story since it broke about 24 hours ago. She joins us now live from Islamabad. Sophia, good to see. What more are you learning about the motive for this shooting and if indeed the shooter acted alone?",

It had been released to us yesterday within an hour of Khan being attacked. We do know from watching that video that the person in the video, he's an unnamed male, who's saying that he was unhappy with the way Khan was operating. He said that Khan's rallies were playing music during the call to prayer. And that's when he decided that he needed to get rid of them. Now this could just be a lone wolf situation but because of how highly charged the political atmosphere here in Pakistan it's already become a politicized issue. The Pakistani government headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif who Imran Khan through his aides claimed is behind his attack. Imran khan released a statement via his close aides saying that Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister, Rana Sanaullah, the Interior minister, and Major General Faisal who is a senior intelligence official, is behind the attack on Khan. Regarding the investigation both parties are already blaming the other. And the government has come out and called Khan's statements grievous and the irresponsible. We're expecting Khan to speak and address the nation in just a couple of minutes. So we'll have more on the investigation on what Khan feels and what evidence he might have for these accusations that he's made against three men -- Christina.",

The latest example, South Korea scrambling fighter jets after its military port is seeing around 180 North Korean warplanes near the border. That comes after Pyongyang's barrage of missile launches this week. And thus the U.S. and South Korea extend their joint military drills to Saturday.

      "sentences": "Well, you know, if you'd kind of take a step back, Christina, with 240 warplanes from the U.S.and South Korea engaging in Operation Vigilant Storm, you can see from the North Korean perspective why they to get as many of their own warplanes to fly near the border on Friday over a four-hour period because they wanted to show force. And then the South Koreans then they sent their planes, including some very advanced F-35 Stealth fighter jets to show force of their own. So it's this tit-for-tat escalation that we've really seen all week. And when you consider the fact that yesterday North Korea attempted to launch their most powerful ICBM over Japan, a launched that is believed to have failed mid- flight, but still a very serious provocation from the perspective of the South Koreans and the Japanese and the United States. The day before that you had North Korea with this unprecedented missile testing blitz, more than two dozen cruise and ballistic missile launched in a single day, the most ever, which caused the extension of the, you know, war games here in South Korea that North Korea is saying is the cause of all this in the first place. An excuse, let's be honest, because North Korea conduct their own military drills regularly. But every time the U.S. and South Korea engage in these scheduled military exercises, which are, you know, required because of the diplomatic and military alliance between South Korea and the United States, then North Korea calls it a dress rehearsal for an invasion. Then they often engage in missile launches and other types of provocations of their own. Because don't forget there was also now on a couple of different occasions this week large scale artillery barrage from North Korea into the maritime buffer zone that divides the two Koreas, known as the Northern Limit Line. So, the big question now is, is this it? Is this Friday going to be -- you know, is this going to be the end of it or because these girls have extended into Saturday, does North Korea have something big planned for the weekend? We don't have to answer that question. I wouldn't even try to guess, Christina. But I will say this. I'm keeping my phone ringer on loud and right next to me because you just never know when you're going to get that call that something else has happened.

But what you are seeing is people rising up demanding change, demanding the freedoms that they have never known for this young generation especially under this repressive Islamic republic. And the government for the past nearly two months now, Christina, has been trying to throw everything it's got. All the brutal tactics to try and crush dissent and to try to stop these protests.

As you mentioned there, we are still seeing protesters taking to the streets, several protests taking place yesterday, again today as well. Some of them seem to be larger than others we have seen in the past, angrier, and some even turning more violent. And you know the government has tried everything. The brutal force that we have seen unleashed on the streets, the beatings, shooting of protesters, and the most disturbing latest news that we have gotten from the United Nations this weekend, an official saying that 14,000 people have been arrested so far. Behind bars. Some of them facing the death penalty, including a popular dissident rapper. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over): These are the lyrics that could cost Toomaj Salehi his life. The Iranian rap artist was arrested last weekend charged with crimes punishable by death, including cooperating with foreign governments, forming illegal groups to destabilize the country, and propagandist activity against the government. But his real crime, his music calling on Iranians to rise up and remove their repressive regime. Toomaj has also proudly posted these videos recently showing him out at the protest leading the chants for change. Family members say he was arrested along with two friends in a violent raid on Sunday. His uncle tells CNN they have information he was tortured. EGHBAL EGHBALI, TOOMAJ'S UNCLE (through translator): We still do not know anything about Toomaj's health or condition. The family tried hard to even hear his voice.

But if you Zoom out,it does paint the picture of a surprisingly resilient jobs market. Companies are still hiring. They're still competing aggressively for workers. And that is driving up wages. And I do think that this is probably not going to sit very well with the Federal Reserve, so that does probably mean more tough medicine ahead in terms of interest rate hikes. But let me just break down some of the hot and cold parts of this jobs report. On the hot side, as you mentioned, more jobs added last month than expected, and August and September's hiring numbers, those were revised significantly higher. At the same time, we saw the supply of workers shrink. And month over month, wages actually accelerated. All of that is pretty strong, especially considering this all-out war on inflation that the Fed is waging. On the cold side, this was the weakest payroll growth since late 2020. The unemployment rate went up. As you can see on your screen, though, it is still very low, historically way below that 2020 peak of nearly 15 percent. Also on the cold side, though, year over year wages have slowed down significantly. I think at the end of the day, though, Christina, this is not going to allow Jay Powell and his colleagues at the Fed to sleep any better at night. This jobs market is still running hotter than they want.",

So it's not like we'veseen a big decline in inflation or a big cooling off of inflation, and we still have a strong jobs market. Inflation really hasn't budged much. It remained near this 41-year high. And so, you know, the good news is that the job market is not falling off the cliff despite the fact that the Fed is doing things that they haven't had to do since the early 1980s. So that is encouraging, but the Fed has more work to do clearly. So there's nothing about today's report that is going to, you know, make them decide not to raise interest rates again in December. They may have to move again early next year. So the question is, what does the jobs market look like at that point, Christina, and we don't know.",

And so usually around that period there is already a lot of chaos because foreign actors might be trying to exploit the platform, there is disinformation being spread and misinformation being spread by the campaigns. And so this is only going to perhaps increase the mayhem on Twitter. And finally as you mentioned there is this class action lawsuit already that's been filed. Twitter employees are basically or some of them are saying that perhaps the way this layoff was executed was not in accordance with federal regulations, which require advance notice if you're laying off more than 50 employees at the specific site.
