And the Pentagon press secretary, Patrick Ryder, he told us that the reason that these notifications were not made earlier is because Austin's chief of staff was sick herself and therefore she could not do so before Thursday, which is when everyone started being notified that he was in the hospital. But, of course, the immediate follow-up question is, well, was no one else available to notify the appropriate people that he was, in fact, indisposed. And we did not get an answer to that question.",

DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: You know, I think, Poppy, that this is most likely a mistake that snowballed. It looks like the secretary had a procedure that was -- where he was told he'd maybe be in the hospital overnight, be out the next day. The procedure was scheduled for, you know, right over the Christmas, you know, weekend and the Christmas holiday when, you know, perhaps government is a little bit quieter and he thought he could have this quick procedure, be out the next day, and then just be onto his business. But, unfortunately, ten days later, he suffered this significant complication requiring what looks like emergency hospitalization. And if you haven't disclosed that you had surgery, you know, a week ago, and now you have to go back for emergency hospitalization, now you're going to have to disclose that, and why didn't you disclose the original procedure, and it - and it snowballed until he could no longer, you know, remain silent about the hospitalization. So, to me, it looks like it's probably just an, you know, unfortunate set of circumstances that started with an unfortunate decision to keep his hospitalization away from the government. I don't think the public necessarily has a right to know that the secretary of defense was having surgery. He's not the president or the vice president where I do think the public has a right to know. But I do think his chain of command needed to know.",

And that is, of course, part of what we're asking.And, look, we -- I think that, you know, the secretary's a very private person. Anyone who knows him will tell you that. And the issue here is not that he did not disclose this elective surgery to the public. The issue that is being raised by national security officials is simply that they were kept in the dark for so long, even though many people here in the Pentagon were told that he would just be on leave last week and they assumed that he was working from home.

We have seen a great uptick in the potential for this conflict to flame out of control in recent weeks. We saw that strike by the Israeli forces in Beirut to take out a senior Hamas leader. We have seen the Houthis in the Red Sea who are backed by Iran attacking ships, increasing their aggression there.

This comes after House Speaker Mike Johnson reached a spending deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on top-line spending levels. It marks a critical first step towards averting a government shutdown with just 11 days until the first of two deadlines, but Johnson's right flank in the House is calling the deal, a quote, \"total failure.\"CNN's Lauren Fox joins us now. Lauren, top line deal is very important. Does this mean there won't be a shutdown? LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it doesn't guarantee that there won't be a shutdown, Phil, but what it does do is it sets both Republicans and Democrats on the right track to try and avoid one. In some ways, the deal that was reached and announced yesterday looks a lot like the top line negotiation that was part of that debt ceiling deal that passed during the summer. And, in part, that is no coincidence because it is the deal that Republicans and Democrats really find as the middle ground. What this deal includes is $886 billion in defense spending, about $704 billion in non-defense spending with an agreement to also reprogram about $69 billion in non-defense spending. That also was part of the debt ceiling deal. In some ways, Phil, this really puts Mike Johnson in the exact same position that former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy found himself in after that debt ceiling deal passed in June with the House conservatives really revolting against McCarthy. The question now becomes, how do conservatives react? Already they're saying this deal is worse than they thought, but many of those members are the same ones who would never vote for a spending deal to begin with. So, right now the first spending deadline is coming up on January 19th. There's a second deadline for the rest of government funding on February 2nd. It looks promising that they have taken this step, but now they have to write the bill, agree where all this money is going, and that is, again, another hurdle that Republicans and Democrat are going to have to iron out in the days ahead.
