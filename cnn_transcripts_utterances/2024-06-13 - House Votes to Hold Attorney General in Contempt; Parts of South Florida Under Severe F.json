Eric Holder back in 2012, because he refused to turn over documents in the Fast and Furious gun scandal, which was a big Republican political focus at that time.Then there was Bill Barr, who defied a House Oversight Committee subpoena for documents related to changes to the U.S. Census. That might not sound political, but actually, the census is one of the most political areas that Congress often deals with. And then now we have Merrick Garland. Now, Garland has been a very aggressive in saying it's this House that is undermining the rule of law in the system. But look, there's a track record here.",

But I think you can neutrally and objectively say that this is about politics. This is about getting out an interview that did not generally go well for the president in terms of the political ramifications of it. They would like to have his voice.
