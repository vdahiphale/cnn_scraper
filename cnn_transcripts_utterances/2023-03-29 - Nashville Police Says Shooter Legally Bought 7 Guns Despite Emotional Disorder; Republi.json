This art teacher tells CNN that back in 2017 she taught the -- the shooter rather at the time for two semesters, and according to this teacher, she described the shooter as, quote, \"whimsical and childlike,\" but that there was one incident in the classroom on the very first day of class where the shooter had some trouble trying to log into a student portal. The student showed a great deal of frustration, and the teacher said at one point was asked to leave the classroom. Now the two of them apparently stayed friends on Facebook and at some point last year, according to this teacher, the 28-year-old shooter posted about the grieving, the apparent death of a former basketball teammate, and a short time after that, the teacher says that the 28-year-old shooter asked to be referred to as he and him when it comes to pronouns. Now earlier today, we also heard from some witnesses who were here the day of the shooting and described hearing the gunshots and then helping parents as well as kids.

Also enhancing background checks for people who are under 21 years old, but stopping short of some of the other, more aggressive gun reform measures, such as imposing a ban on semiautomatic rifles and creating universal background checks, two things that Joe Biden has called for.

Thanks so much for that reporting.And let's continue this conversation now with CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem. Juliet, it's always great to see you. We just heard Manu walking us through talking to those lawmakers about banning AR-15s, which are used in so many of these school shootings. They are weapons of war, and the fact is they simply destroy bodies a lot faster than other types of guns. Do you think an assault weapons ban or a ban on those types of guns would make a difference going forward?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, and decades of legislation and people who studied crime and gun control proved it, and I think just to your point quickly, six people -- three children and three adults died at the school. No one made it to a hospital. In other words, these are meant to kill. There's no recovering from this kind of weaponry.So what the data shows us is, first, that if you make gun owning harder, you will limit gun violence and we've seen it in this country during our assault rifle ban, but you've seen it in New Zealand, Scotland, Canada and other countries. So the numbers are there so people -- legislators who say it doesn't work that has just defined the numbers and facts. The second is just crying generally. We know from decades of study of crime that all crime are crimes of opportunity. You allow someone, you make it permissive for them to do something. And they will do it. So that's why we fortify banks. And that's why we, you know, put locks on our doors, and so if you can, the more guns there are the more violence there is, and so you take away that opportunity. I'm not saying ban everything. I'm just saying you make it harder, more regulations. And then the third piece, and this is important to remember because everyone's going to get legalistic and focus on mental health. None of these are a total cure, but it's society can either make gun ownership permissive or less permissive, and we have essentially made it like chewing gum at this stage. It is too permissive. And you heard the mayor from Nashville say, you know, maybe we just need to make a statement, right? [10:10:01] Make this stuff less permissive. And then people will, you know, have less opportunity. There'll be fewer guns on the street and then it works, and the -- I just want to make clear that data is clear. The nihilism you hear from these legislators just defies decades of data.",

There's not one in Tennessee and there were warnings about it, even her family had warned about her state of mental health, and apparently she had sold one gun but still managed to buy seven others legally here. So does this show that red flag laws at least have a function? Right, not to say that they would catch everyone because you're in effect putting the onus on everyone out there to warn about everybody else.

And why is that? Once again get to opportunity. What you essentially want to do is someone who's having bad thoughts. Someone who is made do a crime. You want to create barriers for them to commit the kind of crimes that we saw at the Nashville school and we see every day now in this country.And so the red flag laws take away the ability of them to easily purchase guns, and they also engage the community in this common effort. I want to be clear. I'm not -- you know what? You know, I'm not naive. Laws alone will not change conduct, but they are part of an overall package of looking at mental health issues, of fortifying schools and protecting our students when they are at schools. All of them are necessary. But to simply say, well, you know, we don't need laws. We need to just focus on mental health, that denies any acknowledgement that the common thread we see in all these cases isn't, you know, it is basically the use of mass of wartime weaponry in our classrooms against our kids.",

In some cases, those communications are occurring between Trump allies and advisers and committee staff or legal counsel. But in many cases these communications are occurring directly between Donald Trump and members of Congress.That includes Elise Stefanik. She is a member of GOP leadership. She also serves on the so-called Committee on the Weaponization of the Government. Jim Jordan and -- Trump are also close to Jordan, of course, is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing a number of these investigations related to Donald Trump. And then, of course, there's Marjorie Taylor Greene. She is a key Trump ally who now serves on the House Oversight Committee. She has been trying to use her platform to relitigate the events of January 6th. And I want to read you what she told me about Trump. She said, I keep him up on everything that we're doing. Sometimes I am shocked at how he knows all these things. I'm like, how do you know all this stuff. And so a lot of the communication according to this reporting that I did with my colleagues Annie Grayer, Alayna Treene and Kristen Holmes, is centered on trying to keep Trump up to date on the pace and progress of their investigations, but in some cases Trump world has tried to exert influence over the direction of these investigations. In fact, last month, a Trump lawyer, Joe Tacopina, sent a letter to Jim Jordan requesting that he opened an investigation into the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is investigating Trump or his hush money payments. And of course, that is exactly what House Republicans ended up doing. So this is just one example of how Trump is still continuing to exert influence over the GOPs' investigative priorities, and it shows just how much influence he still has on Capitol Hill -- Jim and Jessica.",

That's why the January 6th Committee didn't have luck with these people. But Jack Smith is having that luck.What it tells me that they're now moving forward to actually get these people in the room, in the grand jury, is this is the end of the game. I mean Mark Meadows and Mike Pence are the two most important witnesses here who know the most about what actually happened in the days leading up to January 6th with respect to this scheme, so the fact that they're putting them in the grand jury in short order means that they must be getting to the end, at least of the evidence collection period of this case.",
