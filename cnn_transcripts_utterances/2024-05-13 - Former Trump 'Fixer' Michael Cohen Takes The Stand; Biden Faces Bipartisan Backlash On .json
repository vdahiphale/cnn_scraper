Because we have seen some instances of these previous witnesses testifying to -- like, the lawyer Davidson, for example, in talking about how he dealt with Cohen. I mean, there do seem to be a couple of examples where they can do this. I mean, just to kind of drill down on the point you're making, you're saying you don't feel as though they've shown in other instances that Trump himself knew about this stuff?",

      "sentences": "It's not that Donald Trump didn't know about the payments and the payback, it's the criminality aspect that I think is lacking. At the end of the day, the prosecution needs to prove that the entries into the business records were false entries. And, essentially, that would require them to show that annotating something as a legal expense was not, in fact, a legal expense.So I'm wondering what the theory is. My best guess is that because Michael Cohen ultimately took a plea deal to something involving payback as a campaign finance violation, that is the theory. But ultimately, it may be that Michael Cohen took a deal to something that may not have been criminal itself. So I see the ties to Donald Trump in terms of making the agreement but not in terms of the elements of the offenses that are charged thus far, and that is something that the prosecution needs to close the loop on through Cohen or somebody else.",

Obviously, eventually, they'll get a chance to cross-examine him. We may or may not -- I think it's probably unlikely we're going to see that today. But they also will have potential opportunities to object, for example, to his testimony. The judge has honestly suggested that at some -- at some points, they weren't aggressive enough in their objections during earlier testimony, particularly around Stormy Daniels.As this starts to unfold, what would you be watching for were you Trump's attorney?",

      "sentences": "Sure. Well, the prosecutors are going to draw out much of Michael Cohen's credibility issues with all of his convictions and, of course, maybe even some of his motives to have a bias against Donald Trump. He's been very expressive about his own hatred towards Donald Trump at this point and his desire to see him convicted. So the prosecution might draw a lot of that out.I would expect on cross that the defense is going to nail in a lot more detail about his history with credibility issues and, of course, his own direct bias against the defendant in the case. That being said, the jury is the one who makes the decision about how much weight they give to any particular person's testimony. It is difficult when you have somebody that has a prior conviction for lying. Specifically in any case, the credibility of a witness is going to be very difficult to overcome something like that with external corroboration of everything that they're saying. And then ultimately, like I said, regardless of what Michael Cohen says, the prosecution needs to hone in on the actual elements of the offenses. And I'm not really clear how Michael Cohen is going to be able to explain why the annotation of the payments as a legal expense was improper. Perhaps the prosecution needs to throw up an accounting expert or something like that to suggest that is not a proper designation because at the minimum, the misdemeanor offense requires proof of that as a false entry.",

He did everything for him, in his mind, and he got kind of left out of coming to Washington, which was a huge deal for him. So certainly, he has a significant vendetta against the former president by his own admission -- something that will cut against his credibility, of course.And then, again, with regard to the payments, obviously it's been established that the payment was made and that Michael Cohen was ultimately reimbursed. But why that was criminal is really where that loop needs to be closed if they want to establish that they've presented proof of all of these elements at this point.",

The bigger the bomb, the less precise it's going to be. And so, when you're talking about how to eradicate Hamas, the weapons of war means that oftentimes there are civilian casualties -- and that's what this is about. And Biden is trying to -- a lot of people are concerned about that and try to reduce it.But politically, what is happening is now Democrats are saying this concern about civilian casualties can be interpreted as going soft on the war against the Hamas -- the war against terrorism. They're worried about the political vulnerabilities. They're worried about being perceived a no longer being true allies of Israel and how that could affect support among Jewish voters. How that could affect support among some key Democratic Party allies. So these are really complicated issues, but I think the fact that this is an election year -- a lot of people are on the ballot. The fact that this is a vulnerability for President Biden has a lot of Democrats scared and trying to stake out a position to make sure as it affects them it doesn't affect -- as it affects Biden, it doesn't affect the party as a whole.",

It's like everyone forgot the now three-time MVP Nikola Jokic is the best player in the world. And the Nuggets -- they opened up a nice lead in the second quarter of game four. Jokic running the floor here and throws it down. He would have 35 points in this one. Then check out this sequence to end the half. Nuggets get the steal. Michael Porter Jr. gets the slam with just one 1.6 seconds left. The T-Wolves then just throw it right to Jamal Murray and he hits this shot from beyond half-court at the buzzer. The Nuggets just go wild. Denver leads the entire second half of this one to win 115-107 to even the series at two games apiece. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
