There are reports out of -- journalistic reports out of the U.K. saying the U.K. has to tell Biden, you got to buck up here. There are reports out of the White House and questions about how committed Biden is to this campaign. I think at one level, Putin has got to look at this and think about the unity among the west.

The Ukrainians have beaten the Russians time and time again. I think going into 2023, if you go into the spring of this year and the Russians don't make major or significant gains or at least hold their games, going into 2023 -- the spring of 2023, if the Ukrainians keep making gains, I got to really look at a lot of what we were saying a year ago and asking whether the Ukrainians might actually win this one.

They saw the three-month assault by the Russian military on Mariupol, which leveled a good part of the city.And so, the attitude of the Ukrainians and also the attitude of President Zelenskyy himself, I believe, have hardened. There was a poll in October and it said 86% of Ukrainians want to keep fighting and they have pause negotiations. So, there are real limits.

The Washington that Zelenskyy arrived in today, in terms of support for Ukraine, what was that in the Washington he left tonight, in terms of support for Ukraine, did it change? BOB CUSACK, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE HILL:  John, I think it did. I mean, I think it was a very impressive speech. I think House Republicans, in particular, have to be concerned because they are not unified on Ukraine. A lot of House Republicans do support Ukraine, but there is a big difference between what Mitch McConnell is saying in the Senate on Ukraine, he is a big backer of Ukraine aid, and what he said to Kevin McCarthy. Of course, Kevin McCarthy has got to first focus on being speaker, but at the same time, their message is very different than Democrats.

SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDNET TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  Yeah, well, certainly, House members are about the least serious people that you can possibly consult on waiting (ph) topics. That is one of them. And so, that is what I think about him. I think a distinct minority of Republicans have decided that supporting Vladimir Putin is a good way to own the libs. That's a minority of the party. The majority of the party understands that it is not a great idea to let a murderous dictator run wild through Europe, and so they have decided to support our Ukrainian allies. Think about the amazing deal the American people are getting here. We are fighting the Russians. We are defeating the Russians. And now the single American soldier is in harm's way. We are helping people who want to fight the Russians. This is a good deal for the American people. I do think that that is the majority position of the Republican Party. I do think that accountability and transparency is vital. That is why McCarthy says that he does not want a blank check. There is going to have to be some (INAUDIBLE) under the hood here. Where all this money gone? Has any of it wasted, et cetera, et cetera? That's perfectly fine. But the issue here is not letting Putin get away from this.

Were there personal expenses that he was pretending were business expenses? All sorts of stuff like that. There were tons of red flags even before he took office.The IRS also has a policy in its manual and this policy has been its manual for decades, that every year, the president and the vice president get audited. So, the question -- whether or not they have red flags, by the way. So, the question is, why didn't they audit him for the first two years that he was in office? In fact, it looks like, according to this Ways and Means report, they didn't even begin an audit until House Democrats asked them about the audits that they presumed were already going on. They were like, hmm, maybe we should notify the Trumps that we're going to audit them now. So, it is just -- it is very bizarre and it's hard to know what is going on here.

All of that stuff is important in addition to all of the alleged possible fraud that Norm just talked about. How is he wielding his power and where does he -- how might he be influenced by his business empire? All of that stuff is very compelling to me.This question about the presidential -- the mandatory presidential audit system, I was, like, ah, whatever, but then it turns out, actually, it doesn't seem to be functioning as it is supposed to be functioning. And again, we don't know why, we don't know if there was some sort of intervention from on high or if this was just incompetence or if people were just, you know, very nervous about crossing Trump. I don't know. If you look at the report itself, there were multiple reports that were released, but if you look at some of the documentation that was released this week, it does suggest that IRS employees were unusually deferential to Trump's tax counsel on a number of issues and that Trump's tax counsel was very uncooperative in providing information on a number of issues. So, we don't know what went on here, but something didn't function right.",

You know, when you issue a report like the one Catherine just referenced, it is customary to back that up with the data. The tax returns are the data that the American people need to see to understand these failures, but they are also available to the United States Senate now.So, we've already heard from Senator Blumenthal and others that something doesn't quite smell right over at the IRS presidential audit system.

I think this is a difficult, task. That said, I still think they really dropped the ball here. This should have been a priority for a whole bunch of policy-related reasons among others.

Tonight is the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, 14 hours of darkness. Fortunately, we have day centers for the homeless. We also have two overnight shelters, one of which we just opened tonight. We've got a great team of churches, nonprofit organizations, volunteers, our rescue mission, our continuum of care, they're working hard on this to take care of our homeless.

We are not seeing frost levels at about the feet where our water mains are not that much below that. So, we're starting to see broken pipes. And, of course, what happens when pipes break? They need to be fixed.And so, a lot of people don't appreciate when they are having Christmas dinner or Christmas eve with their family and the water works. That is because utility workers and city employees were in a deep, dark trench in 25 degrees below fixing those broken pipes. And that's the story all over the United States.
