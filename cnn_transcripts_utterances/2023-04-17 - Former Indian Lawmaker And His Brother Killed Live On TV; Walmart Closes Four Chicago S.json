And all of this was caught, believe it or not, on live television and people have really reacted sharply to watching that footage which, of course, could be disturbing for many who watched that video in (INAUDIBLE) actually.So let me just tell you what went down. It all happened within minutes of Atiq Ahmed coming out of the Jeep -- of a police car. And then he was walking with his brother when -- and he was flanked by a lot of police officers when some journalist approached them and asked them a couple of questions on the death and the killing of his son, which happened coincidentally a few days back by the Uttar Pradesh police. Uttar Pradesh is a state in northern India governed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Moments after that interaction the first gunshot went off and Atiq Ahmed fell to the ground. Seconds later there were a series of gunshots, Christine, and the brother was killed as well. What we know from the police is that those three assailants were a part of the T.V. crews that were asking questions to these two men when panic ensued and the gunshots just carried on. And the opposition leaders in the state are now calling this complete lawlessness and they're worried about the future of Uttar Pradesh given what's happened and been caught on camera, Christine.",
