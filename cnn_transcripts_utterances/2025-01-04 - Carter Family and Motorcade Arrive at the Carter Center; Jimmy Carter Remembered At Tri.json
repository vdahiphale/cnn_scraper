But it was important for all of us that we stop here.These buildings, as you all know, are filled with his life. Not just because this is a museum to his life, and not just because there's a collection here of his beloved paintings, but his spirit fills this place. And the real reason that this spirit fills this place is because of the people who are standing here. The people in this room from the library and the museum and the Carter Center itself, you all are the real keepers of my grandparent's legacy. Jimmy Carter Library and Museum holds the historical legacy, tells my grandparents' story, which is really this unbelievable American story. And you hold it and you present it for my kids and for their kids and for all of those other generations to come. And to the people at the Carter Center, you continue the vibrant, living legacy of what is my grandfather's life's work, really. You know this. He won the Nobel Peace Prize. He was president of the United States. And when he won that prize, it was in no small part, as you know, because of the work that this organization has done and continues to do. We will spend this week celebrating this incredible life and a life that I think we can all agree is as full and powerful as any life can be. As someone said, it's amazing what you can cram into 100 years. (LAUGHTER)",

When my brothers and I were 10 years old, we were hired by Carter's Warehouse to put seals, tags on the top of seed peanut bags. They did 100-pound bags of burlap and the federal government would get a ticket that said what the germination was and the foreign material. And then you climb on top of the bags and you put those tickets on 100 bags. We got paid a dime a 100. But if the little husk on the peanut, the pink thing on the little outside of it is cracked, the peanut will not come up. So it's a perfect job for 10-year-olds. (LAUGHTER)",

Our neighbors, the closest one to us were African-American, and they're the ones I spent my Saturdays with. They were my age. We had a wonderful snow sled we brought with us from Connecticut when we came back and we carved a trail down the side of the canyon, across the street from our house, and then we cut a vine off.So if you could go down this thing and when you got to the bottom, if you actually grabbed the vine, you could swing out over the briers and come back without getting hurt. And then you could use the rope to crawl up to the top and then pull the sled behind you.",

      "sentences": "He did that every day of Christmas vacation, and the first day of the school year after Christmas, I went to my teacher and asked her if she'd let me take the final over again that she had given us, the midterm test, and she said yes. So after school that day, I took that test and I made 100. I owed it to my father, who spent that kind of time with me.He was a Boy Scout leader in our town. One day we were trying to get our merit badges in hiking, and so we took a six-mile hike to our pond in one of the farms, about 20 of us in the Boy Scouts. We had a great time. We had hot dogs and marshmallows and whatever, and had the big fire going. And at the end of all that, Dad started telling ghost stories. And one particularly bad one at the end was very gross. He claimed it happened on our farm, and so he told us to all go to bed, but we were in -- just sitting there not knowing what to do. And after a little while we decided that we would use the buddy system to go into the woods to use the bathroom after dark so that we could all get some relief before we went to sleep because we were sure that we were going to be attacked when we got there. I want to thank all of you here, as Jason said, because Dad's legacy from Georgia and his governor's office and from the presidency was a little bit rough at the end of it because of our opposition in the way they framed us, which was probably somewhat true and somewhat not. But all this stuff after that, it's in the hands of the people that worked here and that still work here now. I see many people here that I don't recognize, and I welcome you to come. I welcome you to spend your time doing the kind of things that my parents loved to do and loved for us to do, and I need to thank some other people, too. The hospice folks that looked after my father for 22 months were amazing. Every week we got a report from them on how he was doing, what we could do to make him more comfortable, and it gave us a lot of confidence and it gave us the ability to think about him in a different kind of way. And then we had caregivers. One of them is here in the audience. She was with my father for six years. They became my father's friends. They are the people that helped keep him alive and comfortable, and fed and cleaned, and doing all that kind of stuff that we didn't want to do. It was amazing what they did for us. And another thing I'd like to say is I'd like to thank my family. You know, when you're president of the United States, you're thinking about your family, but you're not interacting with them very much. His job was so much more than doing family stuff, so we didn't lose touch. But you had to get an appointment in advance. And that giving up of that time and sharing that was something that affected our family because we didn't have our parents as much as we could have. And I want to thank them for the sacrifice that they made and all that they gave. I was lucky, seven years ago, for the five years I went to see my parents, three nights, two days, a little plus every week for five years. I took over the farm from him. He liked that because he was able to boss me around every day. (LAUGHTER)",

So truly, we are seeing, to a person there -- these are Carter Center employees and people who -- who loved and dedicated their lives to the Carters as well, from who had portfolios that spanned the globe, from democracy to humanitarian issues. And as you said, this was not a farewell to a president. That will come next week in Washington. This was to Jimmy Carter, the man, the proud son of Georgia. And what a remarkable life he had. In scripture and song, sending him off as they planned several decades ago. And the choir from Morehouse resonating there in the Carter Center was what he intended to send him off. And boy, did it.",

I also was struck when I was watching the service. Meredith Evans, who's over the Carter Presidential Center and library, was there. And a quick story about her. When she was four years old, she wrote to her then president, Jimmy Carter. She asked, could she have her birthday party at the White House? She put a dollar and one centers in the letter and mailed it off. President Carter wrote back to her. He said, \"I'm sorry you can't have your birthday party here,\" and gave her -- her money back. And that was so meaningful to her as a four year old. Well, now she's the first black woman to lead a presidential library. She actually can pull that letter she wrote as a four year old out of the archives that are contained at the center. And I saw her there at the services today.

And the Carters brought her to watch their then toddler, Amy, in the governor's mansion, then brought her to the White House. Jimmy Carter became her parole officer.

It's an amazing speech. It's the so-called Malaise Speech, in which he talks about, among other things, Americans' tendency to worship self-indulgence and consumption. And this is very unlike -- unpresidential words. This is -- these are words from a sermon. And it's really -- he was railing in this speech against what he saw in America as a culture of narcissism.
