      "sentences": "As surely as night follows day, Saturday night these past eleven weeks in Israel has meant mass demonstrationsagainst the government`s judicial overhaul. Protesters are concerned it will remove pretty much all checks and balances on the government, allowing it to appoint allies as top judges and removing the Supreme Court`s ability to strike down laws except in very narrow circumstances. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads the most right wing and religiously conservative government in Israel`s history, says his overhaul is required to restore the balance between the government and the judiciary. But the protesters don`t buy it. They worry it will rode Israel`s claim to be a liberal democracy and that will damage the economy and infringe upon their freedoms of expression, worship, and the right to demonstrate. President Isaac Herzog`s attempts to broker compromise unveiled earlier this week were rejected by the government. And though his warnings of civil war seem far-fetched for now, so long as the overhaul continues its passage through parliament, the protest will continue. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We`re traveling to Sydney, Australia, where one organization called LivingSeawalls is changing the way we think about building infrastructure in the ocean. Experts are engineering seawalls to create critical habitats that are more hospitable to marine life that grows there. We`re going to hear from marine experts who believe it`s just as important to save the little creatures in the ocean as it is the big ones. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. ARIA LEE, LIVING SEAWALL PROJECT MANAGER:  I started getting into marine science when I was in my twenty s and was doing a lot of scuba diving. I was really interested in the tiny critters that were living in the marine environment. There`s a lot of attention with biodiversity and conservation around the large fish like the sharks and the whales. But you have to remember that these organisms rely on smaller organisms in order to survive. We really need to start at the bottom and build up a really strong base on which to build up this food web. My name is Dr. Aria Lee and I`m the project manager for Living Seawall. The problem in urbanized areas such as Sydney Harbor is that so much of the shoreline has been built over with artificial structures. Over 50% of the shoreline in Sydney Harbor has some sort of structure built upon it, whether it be a seawall, wharf or pontoon. And these artificial structures have taken away the sort of microhabitats like rock pools, crevices, tiny holes that you would see on a natural rocky shoreline. So what Living Seawalls is doing is bringing back these natural habitat features to an artificial structure such as a sea wall. We, as marine ecologists went out and identified features of a natural shoreline that are missing from a flat featureless seawall. And we`ve translated that onto a Living Seawalls panel. The panels are designed digitally and then a prototype is 3D printed. There are currently 14 Living Seawall sites around Sydney and around the entire world. We`ve installed over 1000 Living Seawalls habitat panels. We can certainly see the difference that the living SeaWorld panels make. The textures can provide seaweed a really strong hold onto the surface. And that`s extremely valuable for all the marine organisms that rely on the kelp, not just for protection and for homes, but as a food source. When there is a new construction, we want the designers to think about how they can design the structure to benefit both humans and the natural environment. Right now, seawalls are really only useful for humans. They stop erosion. They protect the property that`s behind it. What we want to do in the future is think about what the marine environment needs as well as what humans need, and that way we can build more sustainably for the future. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
