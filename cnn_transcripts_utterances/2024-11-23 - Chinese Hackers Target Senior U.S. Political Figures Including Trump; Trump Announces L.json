Jessica Dean has the weekend off. Tonight we are getting new insight into one of the biggest cyber and national security challenges that will be facing the incoming Trump administration almost immediately. \"New York Times\" was the first to report the top telecom executives, including AT&amp;T and Verizon, were summoned to the White House situation room last night to meet with National Security officials to discuss the scope and scale of what has turned out to be a long running Chinese cyber espionage campaign targeting some of the most senior U.S. political figures in this country, including President-elect Trump. Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is calling it the worst telecom hack in our nation's history, says the hackers are still inside the system. And by the way, it took a long time to even discover them. In sign of mounting concern and all senators' classified briefing is scheduled for Congress -- for after Congress returns next month. Joining us now is the senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Glenn Gerstell, also served himself long time in the intelligence community. I want to tell you, as you read the details of this hack, how concerned are you?",

It isn't necessarily surprising because we've seen, Jim, China going after our infrastructure, telecoms, valuable assets, stealing intellectual property over the years through cyber warfare. But this is easily the most audacious.Obviously Senator Warner who's not prone to exaggeration described it as the worst telecom hack ever. It is of grave concern for our national security. It's sophisticated because the Chinese were able to figure out apparently some ways to exploit vulnerabilities in our telecom system and then most of all it's strategic because China decided what they wanted to do most, and we don't know this for sure, but this is what it appears like. They wanted to be able to find out which spies, which Chinese spies operating in the United States we might be tracking, trying to use our own surveillance mechanisms on those spies here in the United States, and that's the information they were looking for, among other things.",

Obviously, the U.S. does as well. We get exquisite intelligence about national security threats facing the United States, not only from China, but elsewhere around the world. So it's -- I don't know that we would necessarily comment, the U.S. government hasn't commented on whether we do anything exactly like this, but I can assure you that the United States government has robust capabilities itself which, of course, complicates this because this isn't an act of war.

Trump would also use the DOJ to investigate his already debunked claims about massive fraud in the 2020 election. All right. So let's dig deeper with CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig. Elie, I got a lot of questions for you. Let's start with his plans to fire all these DOJ lawyers who worked on these federal investigations, who, as I noted, went to grand juries, who then looked at the evidence and indicted the president-elect. He wants to fire them all. Is there any legal basis to do so? Can he do that under the current structure of the DOJ?",

Let's remember, the attorney general runs the Justice Department, whether one likes it or not. The president runs the executive branch. And as much as I personally sympathize and empathize with the rank and file, the nonpolitical employees at DOJ, I was one once, they don't make the rules.Now, important to know, first of all, if Donald Trump goes in there and either himself or has Pam Bondi, his attorney general, assuming she gets through, fire these people, that will be breaking a very important bedrock norm of independence at DOJ. Typically political appointees, the attorney general, U.S. attorneys, they're in play, but not the rank and file. But it's also important to note, people can push back. If people get fired, some of them have civil service protections. Some of them have union contracts. So if there is this mass firing, we may well see some lawsuits challenging those firings, which will then have to go through the courts.",

The other thing that's important to note historically is there have been three FBI directors ever fired by presidents before the end of their 10-year term. One was by Bill Clinton early on in his tenure. That person, a guy named William Sessions, had various problems with personal use of FBI property.And then the other two are going to be Jim Comey and Chris Wray by Donald Trump.

I want to ask about the other part of this \"Washington Post\" reporting. That is that Trump wants to take the DOJ to, you know, dredge up the false claims about 2020 election being stolen, which, by the way, were already rejected by, as you know, his attorney general at the time, Bill Barr. But he wants to go at it again, which, by the way, as well, is a tactic he's used before. You'll remember, after 2016, he had this commission to investigate just the popular vote in 2016, which he lost, later disbanded because they found nothing.

I mean, the Justice Department and the attorney general can decide to use their resources to investigate essentially whatever they want.But I'll tell you right now what the ending is going to be, Jim, you already said it. There is no such thing. And DOJ, by the way, did look at this. As you said, after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, he appointed this commission. They worked for a long time. They issued this ridiculous nothing of a report. It still sits on the internet now. They didn't find anything. And then Bill Barr actually tweaked the rules a little bit in a way I didn't think he should have around the 2020 election to expand DOJ's ability to investigate for election fraud. They did do that before the election, after the election, the whole reason Bill Barr had a falling out with Donald Trump is because Bill Barr went to Donald Trump and said there's nothing there. And then essentially they parted ways. And also, of course, Jim, remember, there was 60 some lawsuits brought that challenged that whether there was election fraud in the 2020 election, of course, all of them but one failed.

You had a president who took with him to his home a whole host of classified documents. Again, indicted by a grand jury. You have a president who attempted to overturn the results of the election in Georgia in 2020, indicted there, that didn't go anywhere for a whole host of reasons, which you and I have talked about. What is the cloud over the Justice Department and just the legal system that it wasn't able to adjudicate those charges? I mean, prosecuted, but it didn't bring them to trial for a whole host of reasons, delays, et cetera. What cloud does that leave in terms of credibility, right?

First of all, the Supreme Court's immunity decision, I don't say it was necessarily right or wrong, but it was certainly very, very broad and gave Donald Trump a lot of cover in the federal cases that were brought against him and the state cases.Also, we have this longstanding DOJ policy. It goes back to 1973 from the Watergate era that says the Justice Department will not prosecute or try or imprison the sitting president. That helped Donald Trump evade the Mueller investigation. And that's the reason actually that the current indictments you just referenced, Jim, they're getting thrown out. It wouldn't matter if Donald Trump fired Jack Smith or not. Jack Smith is out of there because of that policy. He knows he cannot continue with the policy. And then if we want to further look sort of on the other side of things tactically to the way prosecutors have handled this, none of these prosecutors, and I mean Merrick Garland and Jack Smith, I mean Fani Willis, and I mean Alvin Bragg, none of them brought their cases in a timely manner.",

There has to be an Iran strategy or an Iran deal, which also addresses Iran's regional ambitions. So it's much more complicated than Trump thinks.

He's unlikely to cross the nuclear threshold like North Korea and detonate a bomb. I think he wants to be a threshold state, but he's not going to turn the screwdriver.I think when he leaves the scene, the danger that Iran tries to weaponize its program in my view, increases because after he dies or he's left the scene, what's more likely is an Iran which is dominated by the military, by the Revolutionary Guards and I think they'll likely have bolder nuclear calculations than he does. So, I think in the time that he's alive, you know, there's still a possibility of averting a nuclear armed Iran with a lot of coercion and diplomacy.",

And over the last week as that allegation has gained some more press, you can see that the betting markets have significantly gone down on Hegseth's odds. So this is the chance that he gets confirmed as defense secretary.A week ago he had a 77 percent chance. Look at where we stand today, 57 percent, that's only a little bit better than a coin toss, Jim and that's a drop of 20 points over a week and of course, you know, most confirmations fly through the Senate, so the idea that you have someone who's just a little bit north of 50 percent is quite unconventional. But as you yourself said earlier this hour, Donald Trump is quite unconventional, breaking a lot of norms and of course, the idea that you have only a 57 percent chance to get through the United States Senate for Pete Hegseth that in itself is breaking a norm -- Jim.",

And it's just because Trump does really well for a Republican among young menLook at this. This is Trump versus the Democrat margin, men 18 to 24, you look at 2020, look at this. Joe Biden won them by 20 points. Look at what Donald Trump he gained 22 points, he actually won among young men. He is the first Republican nominee for President to win among young men since, get this George W. Bush back in 2000. So, Trump, gaining tremendously among young men. And I think that there's some idea out there that it's just young White men that he's doing well with. But take a look here. Look at the gains that he had among men 18 to 29, among Latino voters. Four years ago, Joe Biden won that group by 29 points. Look in the exit poll. My goodness gracious, a 20 point margin for Donald Trump and even among Black voters, Jim, age 18 to 29 young men, look at that, 67-point margin for Biden, Kamala Harris only won by 54.
