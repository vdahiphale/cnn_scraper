The fear is, they'll be walking into a deadly situation even after news earlier Thursday that Israeli troops were pulling out of the area. Pictures from Jabalya show widespread destruction, with streets covered in rubble and most buildings flattened or destroyed. An UNRWA building, which is being used for shelter by people forced out of their homes, was also burned. And in southern Gaza, Israel says it now has operational control of the strategically  important buffer zone between Egypt and Gaza, the Philadelphi corridor. To break this all down for us, we've got CNN's Jeremy Diamond, live for us in Jerusalem. So much going on, Jeremy, I want to start with Jabalya refugee camp with the IDF leaving the camp.

Multiple Israeli strikes on camps for displaced Palestinians in recent days have made that point with deadly clarity. None more so than this strike in Northwestern Rafah on Sunday night, which killed at least 45 people and injured hundreds more according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The Israeli military has said it did not expect civilians to die and has launched an investigation into the strike, which killed two senior Hamas militants. But at least three people can be seen on the road outside those structures, moments before the strike. The Israeli military targeted these two containers like structures just steps away from structures housing displace civilians, which were also destroyed in the blast or the subsequent fire. Four weapons experts tell CNN the weapons used in the strike were U.S. made bombs.

It all dates back to over three years ago, January of 2021 when 47 pro-democracy figures were arrested in a dawn raid. They were charged of conspiracy to commit subversion, which is a serious crime here in Hong Kong. Under the National Security Law it's punishable by up to life in prison. They are accused of staging and unofficial primary vote which was deemed illegal by authorities here.

The instructions that have to do with circumstantial evidence instructions, that have to do with how to interpret hearsay, how to interpret Michael Cohen's testimony. So like I said, a big chunk of those jury instructions are going to be read back or are being read back to the jurors right now. Remember these jurors don't have a hard copy of those instructions going back with them in the deliberating room; it's against state law. So that is why they have to be read back in open court. When this has finished -- and it should be wrapping up relatively soon -- then those jurors are going to hear the parts of witness testimony that they had requested in a jurors' note yesterday. Now that testimony has to do a lot with David Pecker and his interactions with Donald Trump when it came to the Karen McDougal incidents and the hush-money payment discussion with Karen McDougal. And then also the overall discussion between David Pecker and Michael Cohen inside the Trump Tower in August 2015, where prosecutors essentially say this conspiracy was hatched, this whole idea of catching and killing stories. So these are pretty crucial parts of the witness testimony now these jurors want to hear back. They actually sent back another note today, this morning before court even got started, saying they want to have some headphones or possibly even a speaker so that they can actually hear evidence that's inside their deliberations room. Remember, they have a computer back there that has all the evidence on it. But they couldn't hear it, so now they're asking for their headphones or speakers. So thorough, thorough jurors that are really just underway in these deliberations, 4.5 hours, they've done so far. And then that will -- clock will continue.

But we've also heard since another deal with Sweden, which he didn't visit. But another deal worth some 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine. And of course, that is important for Ukraine's fight to defend itself. But it's also important the context of the blockage, once again, that we're seeing at European level, the E.U. level, as we saw back in December with Hungary, again, blocking the latest tranche of E.U. funding, $7 billion that were meant to be disbursed. And that in fact now will be blocked as European leaders try to find a solution to this particular latest version of the impasse. So those multilateral packages extremely important, all the more so, Eleni, given that this was a tour after all that President Zelenskyy made slightly delayed because of the opening of that third front to the north of Kharkiv.

They were killed within hours, according to the mission that runs the compound and an orphanage there. But what happened after that, to retrieve their bodies, to ensure that they wouldn't be held for ransom by gangs or desecrated, was an incredibly delicate operation managed by the U.S. government. That required negotiating with several gangs in the area and actually bring them together in a conference call to ensure that the bodies would be released. We know that an ambulance that was asked to go pick up the bodies before Haitian authorities even had a chance to inspect the crime scene was blocked on the way by gang members who were armed and threatening them. And we understand that, in the course of this conference call between the gang leaders, one gang leader had to assert that he had a claim on the bodies because they were Americans and subsequently got the local gangs to release them and eventually into U.S. custody. The U.S. has been carefully shepherding through all of the bureaucratic processes around the handling of the bodies and the criminal inspection in Haiti.

And we've seen some of that play out in Hollywood as well. And so that is what strategists say is involved in the thinking for celebrities and whether or not they want to endorse a candidate. And that alone is very different from 2020. We have some clear examples. For example, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, he endorsed Biden in 2020. He says he's not endorsing either candidate this time around. Then too, Cardi B, who also endorsed Biden in 2020, says she's not voting. And so those are some examples of people who decided not to come around this time around for an endorsement. Now, historically of course, Hollywood has rallied around Democratic candidates and the Biden campaign has acquired star power. You saw that with Robert De Niro earlier in the week. In June, there'll be a fundraiser with George Clooney and Julia Roberts. And so they have clearly found some celebrities who are willing to go out and endorse them and serve, too, as surrogates. But the big question is, can they hit those younger generations, too? Will the younger stars, also trying to mobilize younger voters, who will also be crucial in November, especially in such a tight race. Now political strategists and consultants also tell me and my colleague, Elizabeth Wagmeister, that, if they're not endorsing candidates, it's entirely possible that they will endorse around issues like climate change and abortion. So there is still an opening for celebrities, even if they choose not to endorse. But the key part of all of this is that the campaign wants these celebrities to help put out their message. In fact, one senior adviser told me, quote, \"People know who Biden is.\" They went on to say, \"We need to make sure they're delivering our message to audiences.\" And that is ultimately what these endorsements can do, is reach people who are otherwise very hard to reach. And, at the end of the day, timing is everything. So essentially we will likely see more of this rollout in between the Democratic national convention and Election Day, perhaps, too, in October. In 2020, if you recall, Taylor Swift endorsed Biden that month and then, too, Jennifer Lopez. So that is the time where all eyes on whether these celebrities really will come out for President Biden. But in the meantime, there's a lot of discussions happening behind the scenes to try to sort out who is willing to come out and help them deliver their message. Back to you.",

Still unclear though if Boeing will release this new plan to the public. We know that we will hear from FAA administrator Mike Whitaker. But Boeing right now, really trying to prove its plan so far is a fix for the quality control issues that you mentioned, were highlighted by the Alaska Airlines door-plug blowout that grounded the 737 MAX9 nationwide here in the U.S. for about 19 days. Boeing stresses that it's already laid out clearer assembly line instructions for workers at its plant in Renton, Washington, as well as training improvements and improvements to tools on the factory floor. Now notably, Boeing says it is now hounding suppliers to no longer ship defective parts. While that might sound basic, remember it was an issue on a fuselage built by supplier Spirit Aerosystems that caused Boeing workers to remove the door plug on that 737, that was ultimately delivered to Alaska Airlines. The door plug was put back but all of the bolts were not. Boeing in general also trying to fix its safety culture and our report found that it had gaps in its safety culture, somewhat underscored by whistleblowers that keep coming forward. All of this has lead to delays in certification of new airplanes and deliveries of new airplanes and an erosion of the stock price. And shareholders are losing some faith in Boeing. Of course, we will be keeping a big eye here on what is in this new plan when we get it. We do know that outgoing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is reportedly also meeting with the FAA administrator today, a really big day. And a lot of developments on the Boeing front.",

The jury also wants to review testimony from two key witnesses. Now Trump has pleaded not guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records involving payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. For some insight, let's bring in Jeffrey Swartz, a former judge for Miami-Dade County in Florida. Great to see you. Now. Look, the jury is currently hearing a readback of four separate parts of witness testimony from David Pecker, the former publisher, and Michael Cohen. But significantly, two parts that they've asked for had to do with a 2015 Trump Tower meeting, where essentially Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly created the catch and kill scheme here. The jury is currently hearing a readback of Pecker's testimony right now. But the fact that they asked for Pecker and Michael Cohen's testimony about that meeting, does that signify anything to you about where this jury is as far as what they want to know right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's two ways to look at this.Number one, remember that they state in their closing argument, specifically asked for the jury to go through everything in a chronological order as they did in the closing argument and review each and every witness' testimony especially as it might corroborate Michael Cohen. To the same extent they might be looking at the idea that the conspiracy that is Donald Trump's knowledge of the catch and kill and the payoffs to people began with that meeting. And they clearly -- he was aware of everything that was going on. And that is an important factor, too. So I think that we're not quite sure where they are. I don't think we will know until we get some more questions. And even then, to be honest with you, I've been doing this for 50 years. I have a hard time second guessing juries or trying to figure out where they are. Most of the time the prognosticators are wrong. So I don't really want to give you any idea of exactly where they are right now simply because this is just not enough information.",

Now one relevant note that the judge made and is relevant to what they're asking for is that the judge said, even if you find the testimony of Michael Cohen to be believable, you may not convict the defendant solely upon that testimony unless you find it was corroborated. So that could be a moment where they're trying to corroborate, based on David Pecker's testimony. I want to ask you about another part of the jury instruction, though, because a lot has been made about it outside of court, the claims by some, including former president Trump, that the jury does not have to be unanimous in its charges here. That's not really what the judge said, that they have to be unanimous in what they decide for these charges. But they don't have to be unanimous in a specific part of what was unlawful about the separate crime here. Can you distinguish out what the jury has said here and why that's so important?",

And among this sample group, they found that those people who had tattoos showed a 21 percent increased risk of malignant lymphoma compared with people who had no tattoos. But the reason why I said there's no need to panic, this is just a correlation. It does not imply causation. And the researchers say we need to study this further to see what exactly is behind this possible link. They think possibly it might have some thing to do with tattoo ink itself, because often we know that ink often has carcinogenic chemicals in it. But again, we just really need more research in this area to see what's going on. Lymphoma itself is rare. So that's why I had that takeaway message of, this is an area that needs more study.
