It's - we just do. We've been through - you know, Ian was a - Charlie. Charlie was the first one I went through in 2004.

None of that is true. The head of FEMA says that worse than it not being true, it is dangerous that the -- if this is pushed and circulated for the people who are most in need of help.

The bottom line is that FEMA spent $1 billion on funding for illegal immigrants that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden let into the country. CNN, and many mainstream media outlets, reported that more than a month ago. Now, today, we find ourselves in a predicament where Americans are in dire situations, in need of food and of water.
