      "sentences": "Yes. Hi, Erin. We're in Ashkelon. We are hearing air raid sirens. I'm seeing the Iron Dome up there, hearing some booms. You can probably hear that.This is now, my count, about the fifth or sixth time we have had volleys of rockets being fired here at the city. Hamas had put out a warning that people needed to leave the city by 5:00 p.m., that they would be striking the city and they have kept true to their word. There has been sustained activity here. We have been here for three days now. But certainly, in the last couple of hours, it has been at a far more intense pace than anything we've seen in the last 72 hours. It appears to be a little bit quieter now that you can see -- I'm going to step in now. You can see still the remnants of the smoke from where the Iron Dome intercepted those missiles. I think the hope for people living here had been that after those barrages, which were periodic from about 5:00 p.m. to about 5:35 local time, then there was a little bit of a lull. You even started to see a few cars on the street. But clearly, this is not something that is going to end anytime soon. Israel's leaders have warned people that this was not going to be a quick and easy fight. And here on the ground, it's very clear that this is essentially part of the new normal, and that you are going to have these barrages of rockets coming. And they come at a moment's notice, Erin. I mean, I don't know if you heard that. The time difference from hearing the siren to hearing the Iron Dome intercepting, a matter of maybe 30 seconds or something. So, people do not have a lot of time to get to shelters in this situation, which is exactly why you see so many people are basically living in shelters at the moment. And, Erin, they are staying in there as much as they can to try to keep safe. Erin. BURNETT: All right. Clarissa, in Ashkelon, whereas it is dusk here, you can -- you can hear this picking up and again as we've said possibly a very long night. Even here in Tel Aviv, you know, you can hear when Gaza whether it's Israeli strikes on Gaza, it's unclear what it is, but you can hear the thuds. I don't know if you can hear it behind me. But you could -- we could feel it in our bodies. I don't know if all that -- if everyone can hear that but that's what you're having here. So, it gives you a sense of just the scale and the space that we're talking about. Amir Ben Natan is with me and -- he was with me, as you know, just before Clarissa was speaking, was at that music festival. Amir, as we're hearing this, and Clarissa is reporting on what's happening in Ashkelon where she's standing, how are you managing through this right now? Obviously, your life in so many ways has changed in just these past few days.",

And then I -- so, I believe one dead body on the way.And I didn't feel safe so after like, shortly I decided to hide again in another bush and will -- when it was in the second bush, I heard like war outside -- like serious war. Like, the rockets that are right now it's nothing like this. It's like -- really like they knew that anytime like a bullet or a grenade or something can fall on me.",

But in those couple hours before that, there were three of them. And at that point, everybody has to immediately go and take cover as Clarissa was just talking about. It is just sort of a constant interruption into the focus of anything in anyone. And certainly, for the IDF as they're trying to actually rescue hundreds of people, right, more than a hundred people whose lives are at risk in Gaza right now, hostages.

They have responded with strikes that we also want to show you the result of some of those strikes.We have seen huge buildings that have been crushed. But we have also, as we were on the air, saw strikes coming into Gaza port. And you can see a couple of boats that are on fire now, those caused by Israeli airstrikes. That is a picture from Ashkelon. I know you saw this as the Iron Dome had taken out some of the rocket fire that has been coming over. But we also did see what appeared to be a hit. You see that black smoke there under all of those rockets. I do want to ask you sort of a two-pronged question. One. Is it surprising how many rockets that Hamas has amassed? They have sent over thousands of rockets, and this is unusual in this short amount of time. And secondly, what in God's name is Hamas's endgame in all of this?",

This is one of the issues that maybe nobody wants to talk about too much right now. But the Israeli people are talking about it. They're on social media. They are very, very upset at a catastrophic intelligence failure that has cost them so much lives and the catastrophic inability to actually explain and reach their needs right now.And I've spoken to IDF members. I've spoken to, you know, former government officials, former foreign ministers, prime ministers, they all say there is going to be one heck of an after-action report to find out what went wrong. Why did it take so long for soldiers -- Israeli soldiers to get to the massacre areas on Saturday? Hours and hours and hours these people were hiding and pleading for help before they got any official help, just volunteers were helping them. So, yes. The entire system was taken by surprise. And the question is why and what happened in however long it's been taken to have you know Hamas in Gaza planning this huge attack, this unprecedented attack and that nobody knew was coming.",
