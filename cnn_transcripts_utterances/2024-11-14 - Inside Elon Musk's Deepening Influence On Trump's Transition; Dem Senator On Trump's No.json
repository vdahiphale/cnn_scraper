He's been on the phone with world leaders, weighed in on critical cabinet choices at Mar-a-Lago, even joined Trump's trip here to Washington yesterday.Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker joins me now. Thank you for being here. You've done extensive reporting on Elon Musk. You wrote about his brazen and expansive influence on the U.S. that was before he became attached at the hip at the president. Ronan, during the break, you and I were talking about the kind of unprecedented nature of this very wealthy private citizen having so much influence. We were sitting here at the table trying to think if there's anything that even comes close, like a Rockefeller or JPMorgan or Luce. I don't think so. Do you?",

And then of course, there's the fact that Trump announced that he and Vivek Ramaswamy would be tasked with finding wide-ranging cuts to federal agencies. I wonder how that is going to kind of run up against what you just talked about, the billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts that he has.",

And then also, this is an individual, and these are companies that are under extensive investigation by U.S. law enforcement organs, everything from the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency to the Department of Justice.There's a major investigation that's been ongoing into whether Musk was fraudulent, his companies were fraudulent in their representations of their self-driving technology, and there were deaths that resulted from that technology in some cases. This is not to, you know, demonize in a simplistic way. These are new technologies. There's always complicated regulatory issues around those. But these are particularly important technologies with life or death stakes. And the representations his companies make are really sensitive. And he's now positioning himself to have potential oversight of the agencies that are investigating him. So that's also a brand new phenomenon. That would be an unprecedented level of conflict of interest. And I think for all of us in the press who care about creating accountability in these relationships for the American people, we're going to have our work cut out for us.",

Over and over again, we see analyses that are credible. This is not just anecdotable, showing that there's a real rise in not just all speech and radical speech on all sides, but a particular brand of right-wing extremism and misinformation on this site.And the warning signs were all there. This story that you mentioned that I worked on when I profiled Musk also got into his apparent personal turn towards right-wing radicalism. And, yes, there's a number of things in his personal life. He's talked a lot about his relationship with a trans daughter that he has as an origin point to that. But it all lines up in this very convenient way where a figure who had a lot of power, who was facing scrutiny from what he now decries as a liberal element in the government and in the public square, has been able to take control of really all of that. He found a way to inject himself into controlling the discourse that is quite unprecedented to return to that word. I think it's really merited here. And he found a way to exercise what looks very much at this point, like it might be actual control of a sort in his ability to cut the budgets of agencies that would otherwise be not just managing his relationships with the government, but investigating him.",
