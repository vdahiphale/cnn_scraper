And over the course of those 35 minutes, he answered questions from voters in a town hall format, one that was moderated by Tulsi Gabbard, who formerly ran for president as a Democrat, is now an independent, and has endorsed the former president. And over the course of the answering to these questions, the former president touched on some of the familiar themes we've heard throughout this campaign cycle.Him railing against the situation at the border, railing against the economy under the Biden administration as well. But we also heard him touch largely, in many different aspects, on the reproductive rights issues. For example, the way this town hall began was with Tulsi Gabbard talking about her struggles to conceive using IVF. And that opened up a conversation where the former president said that he is putting forward a proposal that would essentially make the government or insurance companies pay for IVF. That is something that he unveiled over the course of Thursday. Now, Wisconsin wasn't the only place he went to. He also went to Michigan earlier in the day Thursday. But what's critical about both of those stops is these are two battleground states that will likely be essential to whoever takes the White House. Wisconsin in particular, or actually both of them, I should say, were states that Trump won in 2016, then Biden won back in 2020. Wisconsin, by just the slimmest of margins, 20,000 votes or so. And so this will likely be a location that the former president, but also the Kamala Harris campaign, will return to as they try to lock up the amount of votes they will need for one of those two to make it into the White House.

If you look at the three key swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, 80 percent more, give or take, eligible voters are white voters. That vote is split. It's biased, certainly, in favor of the Republicans. And it is a new step for the United States to be putting forward a woman. It shouldn't be. It is. And so I think it would be powerful for Kamala Harris to also talk about why that's where we are and where we should be and why it's important. I think probably the one moment where she could have made a more powerful and persuasive statement was in response to that question from Dana Bash about, you know, Trump pushing back against her prevarication or swinging on her question of her Black identity. She's got to nail that. It's important to many voters who wish to vote for her. She's got to defend it.

When you look at how settler activity in the West Bank has just increased tremendously, exponentially, actually, over the last few months in comparison to the last few decades. So there's a lot of territory that has been taken, of course, by force.And this happens at the same time that it's been reconfirmed by the International Court of Justice that the occupation in the West Bank is illegal, that it is Palestinian territory, and that the Israelis are the occupying power. In response to that, at least partially in response to that, I think that the Israeli authorities are trying to make it very clear that, no, this is ours. This is quote-unquote Judean Samaria. It isn't Palestinian territory. At the very least, it's disputed. But in reality, the military authorities that are governing the West Bank are making it very clear that, no, the Israeli settler activity is not only here to stay, but will be widened, will be strengthened, which, you know, calls into question the very notion of having a peace process at the present moment in time, while you have this continual expansion of Israeli settlements and the forced expulsion of Palestinians from their land in the West Bank.",

I think everybody agrees that they are illegal, including the United States.I think the issue then becomes, so what are we going to do about it? And very little seems to have taken place. You've seen the EU High Representative Josep Borrell actually argue for sanctions against not only, you know, a settler here or a settler there, but including Israeli ministers who have been, you know, really ramping up the rhetoric in terms of not just the West Bank, but more generally vis-a- vis the Palestinians. And he's been pushing for that in the European Union. You had certain foreign ministers in different governments in the EU agree. But, of course, when it comes to the EU, there needs to be consensus. You also have the U.K. government sanction particular individuals and groups with regards to Israeli settlement activity. And, of course, in British law, there's no question these settlements are illegal. And there ought to be sanctions that are applied when it comes to engaging with those settlements. But this has been the problem for quite some time, that allies of the Israeli state have made it clear this is illegal, this is illegitimate, but are not using to use the leverage that would be required in order to actually force a change in behavior in that regard.
