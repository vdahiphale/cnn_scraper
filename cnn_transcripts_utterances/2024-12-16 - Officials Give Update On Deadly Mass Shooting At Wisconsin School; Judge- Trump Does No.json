They don't just decide one day to engage in this egregious behavior. Instead, they make a decision and start research and planning towards an act of violence. And when they're on that pathway to violence, they often demonstrate observable behaviors that others noticed. Eighty-two percent of the time, somebody knows about a school shooter's plan to attack a school. So I would encourage all in the community students, parents alike, to report, to speak up, Speak Out Wisconsin, our 24/7 call center, where we do receive concerns about planned school attacks and deliver them locally to local law enforcement and schools to intervene to prevent violence.",

As you mentioned, police are interviewing the parents as we speak. That is absolutely critical as they try to figure out what the motive was here, Erin.At this point, Chief Shon Barnes, the chief of the Madison Police Department, could not describe in detail the motive. I asked if the parents are supplying that information. He was reluctant to say that they were because the most important thing, he says in an interview like that is to just let the parents talk and keep that conversation free flowing. The critical details, Erin, that we did learn at this press conference for the first time all day is what kind of security protocols that school has in place. And it's really a lesson for schools even beyond Madison, because the representative of the school here said that they took advantage of Department of Justice safety grants to help them beef up their security. And as part of that, Erin, they were able to upload blueprints of their school. And so when police arrived, they were able to download those blueprints of the school immediately, which significantly helps a police response. We know that police response was immediate, Erin. It was within three minutes that call came in at 10:57 a.m. Police were inside that building by 11:00 a.m. law enforcement, did not fire any shots, according to police.

It's very helpful to a community to believe that, that they are getting the answers that they need. And what seems like the inexplicable.

Tim picked up on one of them that in terms of the families, in terms of the DOJ official. Basically, these things are always known and we have to get serious about these interventions because otherwise these kids are going into schools and harming others. The other was earlier in the day when the police chief just basically didn't care about anyone's politics. He basically just said, this is not only a school, it's also a religious school.

They weren't sure that this was going to go their way, but they told me they're going to continue to appeal this decision.

In your briefings, have you gotten all the answers? Do you feel like you know everything that's going on and why it's going on? Who's responsible and that they've told you everything? REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA):  Well, first of all, nobody knows everything that's going on. But -- but three quick points about this one. The hysteria is dangerous. As has been pointed out, a lot of these sightings are manned aircraft. Also, there's a ton of drones up there. There's a ton of things going on. So, you know, the hysteria around, you know, it being a plot around a dirty bomb or, or an Iranian mothership off the coast, that's all completely made up. Second thing is that the U.S. government could have been a little bit more open and honest up front about what was going on here and about the concerns about it, because this is a major problem. There are so many of these drones now that they are potentially dangerous. Someone could have a bad intent. What are we doing about it? So those are the three ways.",

We're now hearing from him on this post, but we haven't actually seen him. But tell me why you think Putin will protect him. IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF EURASIA GROUP &amp; GZERO MEDIA: Well, Putin doesn't have that many friends around the world, and he does want to show that if you're going to line up with the Russian dictator, if you're going to, you know, sort of provide sort of the diplomatic engagement, the space for military bases and things go badly. Well, your country might not do very well, but Putin will take care of you. Putin will take care of your family. That's an important message for someone like Kim Jong-un in North Korea. That's an important message for the IRGC and the supreme leader in Iran. It's a very important message for President Lukashenko. For example, in Belarus. So, I mean, you know, you look at these countries around the world and the dictators, including in some African states that have been lined up with the Wagner Group, lined up with Putin and sometimes, you know, they may last for a long time, but their -- their regimes can fall very, very quickly. And if you want to maintain that support, if you're Putin, then you need to make sure that you follow through on it when suddenly the country collapses.

The two met after Mangione became a fan of Bhogal's blog, which covers everything from politics to self-help, and they exchange messages. For months, they had a nearly two hour video conversation. Now all of this ended in June, when Mangione stopped communicating with Bhogal. In his first TV interview, Gurwinder Bhogal is OUTFRONT exclusively. And, Gurwinder, I appreciate your time. So you began exchanging emails with Mangione in April, and I know you also had hours long video call with him in May.

GURWINDER BHOGAL, BRITISH JOURNALIST:  He seemed like a really down to earth guy. I mean, he was polite, he was thoughtful. He was open- minded. He seemed very curious. Curious was a very particular thing about him. He always wanted to know more about things. And, you know, sometimes I'd make an obscure reference to something, and he would tell me. He'd tell me to tell him more about it. So he was very interested in learning, and he was very interested in self-improvement as well, like whenever I would sort of make a statement about, say, for example, human psychology, he would ask me how he could apply that to his life.
