Why? What are the major concerns? And is NASA confident they can safely bring them home? I'm going to ask the man who spent more than a year aboard the International Space Station. Plus, we're just days away from the TikTok ban going into effect in the U.S. But now the nation's highest court says it's going to take the case and the justices could make a decision before that crucial deadline. And a secret vote and a stark reversal on Capitol Hill. Multiple sources telling CNN that the House Ethics Committee will release its report into former Congressman Matt Gaetz within days despite voting not to release the results just a few weeks ago. The report would mark the end of a years long probe into numerous allegations against Congressman Gaetz, including whether he engaged in sexual misconduct or used illicit drugs, allegations Gaetz repeatedly and to this day denies. But we're going to start this hour with breaking news on Capitol Hill where it appears a deal to avoid a government shutdown is hitting some major roadblocks. Let's get straight to CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol. Manu, what are you hearing from House Republicans?",

This negotiation had been going on for months. It was unveiled late last night in an effort to avoid a government shutdown that would occur after 11Now, all day long, Democrats, Donald Trump has said very little. He's been silent about this bill, amid this growing concern on the right. People like Elon Musk have come out in opposition to this plan. And just moments ago, Donald Trump said he too was opposed to the plan. And he added a huge complication on top of it. He is calling for Congress to raise the national debt limit as well as keep the government open, tie that all together and get that done by Friday. That is going to be an enormous challenge given the difficulty it takes for Congress to deal with the national debt limit, something that they were thinking about. They hadn't even discussed or planned to punt that until next year. But in this statement that he just put out with Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, they said the most foolish thing inept, the most foolish and inept thing ever done by congressional Republicans was allowing our country to hit the debt ceiling in 2025. It was a mistake and is now something that must be addressed. They go on to bash the details in this proposal. And they go on to say increasing the debt limit is not great. We'd rather do it on Biden's watch. They say if Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes you think they would do it in June during our administration? There was a belief that the debt limit could -- they would have to deal with it by middle of next year. Yes, perhaps by June, which is why Congress hasn't even discussed that. They just wanted to avoid a government shutdown. And Jake, as we know, a debt limit, for they dealt with that last year, it took them about two months or so to cut a deal to raise the national debt limit and it would expire next year. But now Trump wants to add this on top of all of everything else, which leads Congress at a loss. It's unclear, Jake, how they can avert a shutdown. How could they get Trump on the same page?

It's to say that when there's these serious, credible allegations of sexual misconduct, drug use, that we don't let people brush under the rug just from resigning. And I do just want to -- I want to clarify one thing in your prior remarks or the report you just had, there's lots of evidence of members losing elections and the Ethics Committee not continuing reports.

And that's actually going to be -- that's actually the theme at the moment.People really don't know what is next, Jake. They don't know if a government shutdown will be -- can be avoided. They don't know how serious Donald Trump's demand is. This 11th hour demand to raise the national debt limit, that is an incredibly complicated negotiation, typically takes months and months to resolve. He wants it resolved within 48 hours. He said the Democrats need to supply the votes to get this over the finish line. Well, without any Democratic provisions in there. But Democrats, if they were to even agree to that, would want a whole host of things, given the fact that they control the United States Senate, they're going to need their votes in to get it out of the United States House. And there's a Democrat in the White House. They're going to need a bipartisan, bicameral deal. And the deal that was cut that Trump is now just bashing, it was weeks of negotiation for them to even get to the point to keep the government open until mid-March. That includes a whole host of issues. Billions of dollars of disaster relief, aid to farmers, a bunch of some measures that have actually been blasted by both sides of the aisle, including a congressional pay raise. But there's a whole host of measures in a 1500 page bill that took weeks and weeks to negotiate by Trump's statement there, has completely undercut this entire process. Now, two quick key reactions that I got from members that I just spoke to Senator Dick Durbin, he's the number two Senate Democrat, I just asked him about this 11th hour demand of Donald Trump to raise the national debt limit along with avoiding a government shutdown by the end of the day on Friday. He said this would be an incredibly complex negotiation to get done by then. He also said that anything needs to be done has to be done in a bipartisan basis. Meaning what Donald Trump is saying for Democrats, just do whatever Republicans want is not going to be enough. And then Tom Cole, who's the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, helped negotiate this spending deal, I asked him about these demands. And all he said, Jake, was, I don't know.

Which means, frankly Jake, he could be on his way back to New York by sometime tomorrow, perhaps as early as the afternoon. Meanwhile, Jake, we have updated information on some of the efforts the outside world has made to contact Mangione since he's been in prison here in Pennsylvania. Per a spokesperson, for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, as of this afternoon, Mangione has received 158 deposits into his prison commissary account. Also, as of this afternoon, he's received 40 e-mails and 53 pieces of mail. That's notable because that's up considerably from the six pieces of mail that he had received as we reported yesterday.

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, big question. Got a lot of these. And I'll tell you that I'm answering in part as a doctor and part as a journalist, but mostly as a dad of three teenage girls. Something you're familiar with as well. Big topic of conversation in our household. First thing to point out, addiction may not be the right word here because strategy for addiction sometimes is abstinence. And as I think you alluded to, Jake, very hard to be abstinent from something that we're so dependent on. But there's no -- no doubt there can be problematic use when it's starting to interfere with your activities of daily living, with your sleep, with your grades if you're a kid, these are real issues. A couple things that, you know, in our reporting really jumped out at me. One is that oftentimes teenagers are using this as a tool of self- soothing or self-care. So really trying to understand the fundamental cause here as opposed to just the symptoms is important. Why -- why are -- why is your kid on the phone so much? I think it's an important question to ask. More practically speaking, there are three things you can always ask yourself or ask your kid to ask themselves before they pick up their phone. Three basic questions, what for? Why -- what am I doing this for? Why right now? What else could I be doing instead? Kind of important, Jake, because it kind of brings your brain back online for a second, makes you question why you're doing this, and maybe sort of reduces the chance you'll go down rabbit holes. Second of all, I'll just tell you could set time limits on these phones for your kids if -- if this problematic use is a real concern. You can set the amount of time they can be on the phone and also the specific times. So for example, if it's the nighttime and they're not getting sleep, you can turn some of those apps off at night.
