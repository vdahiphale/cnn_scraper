The weather not expected to clear up tonight or tomorrow, so unclear when this one's going to launch.And speaking of weather, severe storms are hitting the Great Lakes region overnight, knocking out power to nearly half a million customers, plus a cold front making its way across the Midwest towards the Mid-Atlantic, finally breaking, hopefully, the record heat.

So, St. Louis, Cincinnati, D.C., up through New York, still looking at another day of incredibly warm temperatures. St. Louis topping out at 102 yesterday, Chicago, 99. Again, we're going to start to see things calm down.So place like Chicago going from 99 yesterday to a high of only 84 today, so a little bit better. Similar in Cleveland, going from 95 yesterday to 83 today. But it's going to take at least another day for areas in the Mid-Atlantic and the northeast to drop. So D.C., topping out at 100 today. Tomorrow will drop down maybe below that 90 degree mark. New York City, Philadelphia, both still going to be in the 90s today, but hopefully getting back into the 70s again tomorrow. Now, one of the thing that's helping with that heat is it's also helping to fuel a lot of severe thunderstorms in similar areas, especially along the Mid-Atlantic, Ohio Valley. You can see here most of these areas, looking at the potential for damaging winds. Large hail also going to be a concern across portions of the High Plains. Could see some hail up around the size of golf balls.",

MARCUS CHILDRESS, PARTNER, JENNER &amp; BLOCK: Yes. I mean, I think the big takeaway from January 6th, even to this day, right, right now, is the fragility of the peaceful transfer of power, right? And that's -- that's a core tenet of our, I know we use the term democracy, and it's not really popular now on the campaign trail, but it is a tenant of talking points. Is it -- it's real fragile. And I think what you see here Speaker Pelosi saying that, but for the actions of -- of Donald Trump, not acting in this capacity as President, but acting as a candidate who wanted to keep power, Capitol Police would have had to respond. National Guard would have had to respond, just like every other election in American history. And so I think she's appropriately pointing at the leadership, pointing at the head that was actually inspiring sowing down to our election, and wanting to keep the focus there in those important moments at moments after January 6th.",

At that point, it would be impossible for us to imagine that there is a way back politically for Donald Trump, yet his strength in the Republican Party was such that within three or four weeks of that, Kevin McCarthy was down at Mar-a- Lago. And the speaker's reaction there helps us understand why she was so active in recent weeks about trying to change the Democratic ticket, because she believed that this under President Joe Biden, was a ticket that couldn't thwart a return of Donald Trump.
