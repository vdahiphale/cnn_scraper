But as the three -- the judge's law clerk was reading the verdict and that first count finding in Carroll's favor, you could see that she had a sense of relief. She was holding one of her attorney's hands as the verdict was being read. And you could see moments of, you know, relief, a smile come across her face.Nothing was audible though from her table or from Trump's attorneys' table. And once the verdict was completed reading and the jury was escorted out, Carroll had another side hug with another one of her lawyers. And then Trump's attorney Joe Tacopina walked over to the plaintiff's table. He shook E. Jean Carroll's hand and shook the hands of each of her attorneys. Now we are waiting for them to exit the courthouse to see if either side has a statement. E. Jean Carroll has previously spoken about this case though. I would expect she will say something and address the cameras. But they are taking their time leaving the courtroom today after this, you know, trial. We are in our ninth day of the trial, including both the closing and the opening arguments --",

There is no other way to put it here.But former President Donald Trump being found liable for battery, sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, is what the jury found and for defamation.

Jean Carroll's favor, as she was holding her attorney's hand. She's looking forward. She seems to have a sense of relief on her face, and kind of a leaning forward, nodding forward as he continued to read the counts which were going in her favor.You know, he did ask for a no audible reaction. So, we didn't see or hear anything, you know, exclamatory after it came out. But she looked pleased. And then once the verdict was completed being read and getting awarded $5 million, you know, she gave one of her other attorneys a hug. She was sitting between the two of them. And then after the jury was escorted out of the room, Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina came over and shook E. Jean Carroll's hand and he shook the hands of all of her attorneys. It had been a very cordial trial actually. Neither side was slinging mud at the other. They were all being very respectful, and we saw that continue even after this verdict went against the former president. His attorney shaking E. Jean Carroll's hand. You know, the judge did tell the jurors that they could talk to the press if they wanted to. They could talk to anyone about this trial if they wanted to. But he said that if they chose to, which he advised them against, he asked if they would not give the identity of any other jurors. The judge made this jury anonymous, because he was concerned about, you know, some of the public statements that the former president has made. As he took a precaution in the case. You know, and that will be up to the jurors to see if they wanted to discuss how they came to this conclusion -- Jim.",

I am sure stunning. I am sure she is in shock. And I am sure that she is relishing in the moment right now. Because you're right, it has been 27 years. So, it's a long time.And finally, because of the Adult Survivors' Act, that's why she was even able to bring this case. And these cases are very difficult to prove as you have spoken about. But it was consistent with what she said prior bad act witnesses, her friends. Of course, they did not find him liable for the most heinous of all, the rape. But she needs to be prepared also for the appeal that's going to come. Because I am sure it is going to be stringent. And what I saw by watching -- listening to this trial, reading transcripts, the defense team felt that the judge was biased in the rulings, and there were numerous pretrial rulings, rulings during the trial. I think that could form the basis for an appeal. And also, one of the theories of the case was that this case continued to go forward because of financing. Financing from someone in the Democrat Party that wanted this case to go forward because of their hatred for Donald Trump. The defense was allowed to depose E. Jean Carroll the week before trial, to specifically ask her about that. But the judge ultimately ruled it would not come into this trial. And there was some testimony that danced around that, but I think that will be a major issue on appeal. Whether the appeal will go anywhere, we don't know, but appeals take time. And I will tell you, Harvey Weinstein's conviction in New York, they appealed and that appeal is still alive and it is going to the highest court in New York. Because of all those prior bad act witnesses that testified. So, you've got to be careful. Because his verdict in New York, it could conceivably be overturned, that criminal verdict.

I want to ask Dave Aronberg, as we noted the judge telling jurors before he dismissed them, Judge Lewis Kaplan, saying that his advice to them was to not identify themselves. He said, not now and not for a long time. And then he said to them basically, if you do identify yourself, don't identify anyone else on the jury, because each of you owes that to the other, whatever you decide for yourself. Explain -- I mean, think we understand a little bit of why, but why do you think he said that to the jury? DAVE ARONBERG, STATE ATTORNEY, PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDABrianna, this judge, Judge Kaplan, is really careful about publicity. That there were no cameras in the court, and there were no cameras in federal court. But he's also -- went out of his way to make sure that the names and identity of the jurors were concealed. That's something that you normally get in mob cases, in mafia trials. You don't normally see that in a civil trial, especially one involving someone who is supposed to be of, you know, high character because he's a presidential candidate. But you're seeing it here. And so, this judge, Judge Kaplan was so worried that Trump supporters would attack the jury or at least try to tamper with the jurors that he isolated them. He made them private just like you would do in a mob trial. And so, now that the case is over, he's still worried about their safety.

Preponderance of the evidence basically above 50 percent as opposed to beyond a reasonable doubt like you would have in a criminal trial. It did have to meet several standards. For instance, on the defamation, they had to determine not just one of these things.But all of the things that the statement denying it was defamatory, that the statement would reasonably be understood to be about Carroll and that Trump published statement himself. But these other elements as well. That it was false and that it was done with malice, right? That and other words -- and I wonder if you could you speak to this more, Jennifer Rodgers.

There was a measure they could have gone higher on rape. The jury determined not to do that. They also could have gone lesser, and they did not do that either. $2 million in damages for that, and nearly $3 million in damages for being found liable for defamation.

I mean, his private attorneys are far more concerned about the criminal case, just a few blocks from here, that as you noted, where he was charged just a few weeks ago for the first time in a criminal court.But they are most concerned about what could potentially happen down in Georgia with the investigation into his alleged efforts to interfere with that election. And they are also watching very closely any potential criminal charges that could be brought by special counsel Jack Smith. Either related to January 6th or related to the possible handling of classified documents, or efforts to obstruct that probe. So again, this is a civil case. Of course, they absolutely would have liked to win this case. But as Kara has reported, as I've reported, they didn't even put on a defense here. And I can tell you that the lawyers in the criminal cases that the former president is facing or maybe facing, they were very concerned about him getting on the stand in this case. And if you saw portions of the deposition in this case, you can see why. Because again, this is a civil case. Ultimately, it is about liability. But that comes down not to jail time, but to money. And they were concerned, if he was to take the stand here, what other questions, what other issues could come up that could potentially expose him to criminal liability? So, in the broader scheme of all of the legal threats that he is facing, they were certainly worried about this. But they are far more concerned about the other more imminent threats, particularly Georgia, and then also the special counsel.",

And then the event that, you know, they do, you know, you can't evaluate or base someone's credibility upon the facts they're not shouting and screaming. Addressing the police report, addressing her memory, addressing a number of things.

So, in answer to your question, Boris, while it's tough to pinpoint anyone thing, I think the collective weight of the evidence in this case really establish her claims.
