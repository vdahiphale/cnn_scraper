The DeSantis campaign says it raised more than $1 million in the first 24 hours after the debate. Today, he's out campaigning in Iowa hoping to ride that wave, even as former President Trump continues to dominate the national polls. CNN's Steve Contorno is live for us in Iowa.

And he did a lot to quell the concerns of donors and supporters who went into the past week with a lot of questions about the DeSantis campaign, given all the struggles they had of the summer. You talked about the fundraising they've seen since the debate, that's emboldened them. And now it's about changing hearts and minds in Iowa on the road. That's why he's here today. He's been touring the state, trying to hit all 99 counties. He hit 39 today. He's going to spend some time getting to know these voters and touching as many palms as possible. He's also avoiding talking about the elephant who wasn't in the room, Donald Trump. I tried to get him to talk about the mugshot the former president took yesterday. However, he had some pointed remarks about 2024 that seemed very clearly pointed at the former president. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

As we're seeing in Ohio. Ohio is almost certainly to pass a ballot measure in November to protect abortion rights. We saw in the midterms last year, that was an issue that denied Republicans the red wave they expected.

He wants them to focus squarely on the $18 million purse that is on the cards here for the players, the 30 players gracing these links. Whether or not they have the appropriate mitigation efforts, we walked around and we've seen a lot of precautionary measures in place, from additional misting stations to cooling centers to additional hydration stations, even sunscreen stations.

This is one of the more common forms of heart failure. The majority of patients who have this type have obesity or are considered overweight. What they found was that Wegovy not only helped people lose weight in the trial, 13 percent, compared to more than 2 percent on those with placebo, but it also really helped with symptoms of heart failure, like shortness of breath, fatigue, and improved their quality of life. Doctors I spoke with, who ran the trial, said this was the largest benefit ever seen with a medication on that symptom score in these patients. They're very excited for this treatment option. As you noted, this is just one of several potential new applications for this medicine. It recently showed a benefit for preventing heart attack, strokes and heart-related deaths in another test.
