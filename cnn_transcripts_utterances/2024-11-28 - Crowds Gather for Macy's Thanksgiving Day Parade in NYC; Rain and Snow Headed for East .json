America taking a time out from the chaos of the world to celebrate Thanksgiving. Tumultuous transition. Aide of Donald Trump's picks allegedly targeted by bomb threats and swatting, none of them being protected by the Secret Service. Ceasefire holding. With this week's deal between Israel and Hezbollah. We'll talk to the parents of an Israeli hostage held in Gaza. They're hoping the next step is the return of their son. It is 6:00 a.m. here on the East Coast. A lot of clouds there in Seattle. Look at that. Live. Look at Seattle, Washington, where thick clouds are blanketing the city. It is 3:00 a.m. there on the West Coast. Good morning, everyone. I'm Jim Acosta in for Kasie Hunt. Thank you for joining us on this Thanksgiving morning. In just a couple of hours from now, the Macy's Day Parade will kick off as families across the country get ready to celebrate Thanksgiving. And right here on CNN, we'll be giving you a front row ticket to the biggest parades across the country with our inaugural \"Thanksgiving in America\" coverage starting at 8 a.m. Eastern. Experts are predicting record travel numbers this holiday, with almost 80 million expected to either fly or drive. According to AAA. So hopefully you've made it to your destination because depending on where you live, rain and cold temperatures might make you want to stay inside. Certainly, the case here in Washington. Tracking it all for us is CNN's Brynn Gingras in New York. And meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, live in Atlanta. Brynn, I think let's start with you first. The umbrella there tells a story. Where do things stand right now with the weather and the security preparations for the parade this morning?",

The Macy's Day Parade. Let me get out of the way real quick so you guys can see Tom the turkey. He is here on this West Central Park, west here in New York City. He is, of course, the first float to come down this parade 100 years ago. Can you believe that? That was when the first Macy's Day Parade happened here in New York City. This is the 98th parade, and it's going to be a celebration. Despite the rain. I will say, Jim, I've covered this parade several times and this is the worst weather that I've experienced, but it's going to be incredible.",

One woman I talked to from Salt Lake City dragged her kids out here at 4:30 in the rain. I said, is this the first time that you've ever been to the parade? Are you excited? And she's like, this is our second. And oh, by the way, the last time it poured as well. So they don't exactly have the best luck. But it's going to be exciting, of course. Our coverage starts at 8:00 a.m. with Erica Hill and John Berman. It's going to be a blast. And you know what? We're just -- we're just going to get wet. It's OK.

The transition team says several of Trump's top picks for his second administration targeted with bomb threats and swatting. Plus, how a stowaway successfully boarded a flight from New York to Paris during the holiday travel blitz. And Thanksgiving in America. Time for food, friends, football and family, for millions around the country. CNN spoke with singer and songwriter, Andy Grammer, about what's important to him during this holiday season. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:11:10] ACOSTA: This morning, the FBI is investigating a rash of threats against Donald Trump's picks to lead his incoming administration. CNN has now confirmed eight people chosen for cabinet roles have been the targets of bomb threats or swatting incidents in recent days. Trump's choice for Defense secretary is among those threatened. He posted about it -- posted about what happened on social media. Pete Hegseth said on X, \"a police officer arrived at our home -- where our seven children were still sleeping. The officer notified\" my -- \"my family and I that they had received a pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family.\" Forgive me. Just trying to read that there. \"He adds that the threat has been cleared.\" \"I will not be bullied or intimidated. Never.\" Meanwhile, after President Biden was briefed on the incidents, the White House said the administration, \"unequivocally condemns threats of political violence.\" Joining us now for the latest on the transition and the transition of the latest there that's happening is CNN's Steve Contorno in West Palm Beach, Florida. Steve, what's the latest? Good morning.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Jim. Happy Thanksgiving.The latest that we know is that on Tuesday evening through Wednesday morning about eight -- at least eight members of Donald Trump's incoming cabinet received similar threats to the one that Pete Hegseth described in that message. You just read. And it includes Trump's picks for Agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, U.N. ambassador, Elise Stefanik, his onetime pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, Lee Zeldin his choice to lead the EPA, HUD -- incoming HUD secretary, Scott Turner, his choice for CIA director, John Ratcliffe, as well as his choice for Labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer. And what we know at this point is that none of these incidents proved to be actual threats. It was, as you said, threats of pipe bombs as well as swatting. Swatting is when you call the police saying that there's some sort of activity going on at a residence, hoping that the police show up with guns drawn. And it's a very scary situation. It's also, unfortunately, a phenomenon that has become increasingly common in our -- in our political environments. Many of Trump's political enemies over the years and political foes have also been on the receiving ends of these pipe bomb threats and swat threats, including special counsel, Jack Smith, for example. Now, the FBI did tell us that they are taking these threats seriously. And they encourage the public to report anything that they see immediately if they have any information. ACOSTA: And, Steve, just this week, the Trump transition team signed a transition agreement with the White House. But one name is notably absent from the ethics pledge. What do we know about that?",

And Leah Wright, CNN political historian and associate professor of history at Johns Hopkins University. Guys, thanks so much for being with us. Happy Thanksgiving. Bakari, let me start with you. Last night, Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma reacted to these threats. Seemed to blame the Biden administration. Let's listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): It's extremely concerning. And at the same time, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, they're going to have to come forth and tell their group to calm down, to not take it this far, because they're the ones that fed the fire, and they're also the ones that can kill the fire.

I believe that the fact is we need to figure out where these threats are coming from before you go out blaming one side or another. We have no idea who is perpetrating these threats.I can say just resoundingly, just as the president of the United States has said, that these threats have no place in our discourse, have no place in our democracy. And -- and need to be stamped out but to come on TV, to come on national TV or Fox News or anywhere else and say that your group is doing x, y or z without knowing who is doing what is irresponsible. And what -- what -- what he's talking about is the same type of rhetoric that needs to stop. We go back and forth with this both sides of what rhetoric needs to be done this time, and who said what when where, how. But as a United States senator, you have to have some responsibility and let's at least figure out where these are coming from. Let's figure out who's perpetrating them. Let's let law enforcement do their job. And let's let the president lead, as he did with his comments. And quotes.",

Steve Scalise got the crazy person who tried to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Of course, Donald Trump was nearly assassinated during the campaign.So I agree with Bakari. I don't know where they're coming from, but I do know that we have the climate in this country that has somehow, over the last several years, led to several conservatives and Republicans being targeted with these kinds of swat things, or with actual violence. So I'm not happy about it honestly, as a Republican, I don't like it that these people have been -- had their names put forward for public service, and now they are immediately being treated this way. So I hope folks calm it down and whoever is doing it stops doing it. Because when you have this kind of climate, it's -- it's supposed to instill fear, and it's supposed to keep people from wanting to step forward and serve our government.

Bakari, I mean it -- it was interesting when -- when Trump came out with that -- that post. He made it sound as though he had solved the immigration crisis and what's happening down at the border.

It's something that we see on X a lot, where -- which has really become this, this kind of -- very in terms of intellectual honesty, very shallow. But President Sheinbaum, in her response, ran circles around the incoming 47th president of the United States talking about the agreements that Mexico has already made and the reduction that we've seen of border crossings and the things they're already doing. And she's going to be more than a formidable foe for Donald Trump.But I would -- I would tell people who are watching and sometimes we don't do this. But Donald Trump is going to claim credit and then send a tweet out without actually doing anything. And claiming some victories or success. That is who he is and that's who he's always been. He has not solved anything yet. Although he's claimed victory. And so this is going to be something that's happening. And this is why journalism matters. And people like you matter, Jim. Because you're going to have to turn the page and be able to show people that. Look, I mean, just because you tweeted and say it, doesn't mean anything.

I don't think we ought to have to think of Mexico as a foe, although we currently should, because they've been a terrible neighbor. And I think he got her attention this week with his threat of tariffs. And she clearly hopped on the phone with him. And that's a good thing.She needs to pay attention to Donald Trump, and they need to pay attention to the United States. They have an important economic relationship with us, but they've been a terrible neighbor, and they do need to do more in terms of migration and drugs. This poison comes across the border. It kills Americans. And so, I'm glad they talked. And I know that they're both doing their own public posturing for their own political purposes, but they have an important role to play. And I don't think they've done near enough to do what they can do to help the United States solve this crisis. So we'll see how it turns out. But there's -- there's a lot of things yet to happen. Trump hasn't even taken office yet, and he's already got the attention of both Mexico and Canada in a way that I don't think Joe Biden ever did.",
