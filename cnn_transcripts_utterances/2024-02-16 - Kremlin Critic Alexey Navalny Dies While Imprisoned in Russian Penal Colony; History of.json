Poppy and Phil are off this morning.We are following the breaking news out of Russia. Putin Alexey Navalny has died in prison. That is according to the country's prison service. Navalny was 47 years old. As for the cause of his death, that is a mystery at this hour. Navalny was serving a 19-year prison sentence at a penal colony near the Arctic Circle on charges of extremism. Navalny, of course, led a nationwide anti-Kremlin protest for more than a decade. He had run for office to challenge the Russian establishment, expose a lot of what was happening there, survived several poisonings. He spoke to our Christiane Amanpour in 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is a reason why people are so poor. We have 25 million people living below the poverty line. And the whole degradation of system, unfortunately for me, including system of assassination of people, he's the reason of that. And I want to go back and try to change it.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I think this was a moment where everybody feels chills. It is something that a lot of people had braced themselves for the possibility of since Alexey Navalny was taken into custody when he returned to Russia after being poisoned with Novichok and surviving it in January of 2021. There was, of course, a great deal of concern from his supporters and his loved ones that his life would be at risk. We saw him really in the most difficult and depraved of conditions being held, having repeated health problems, complaining that he was being overprescribed with many different antibiotics, that he was having terrible stomach issues, that he was not getting adequate medical care.And yet still, he was able to keep up this town of defiance. He was able to keep continuing to communicate with his supporters via social media. And while he didn't pose a direct threat to Vladimir Putin in any sense, because he was being held and everyone understood that he was not going to be released anytime in the short-term future, there was also, of course, broadly this expectation that it would be crazy for the Kremlin to do something like kill him potentially while he was in custody. Now, of course, at this moment, we do not know exactly because of Alexey Navalny's death, but there will be a feeling, surely, around the world, and particularly from his supporters that he would not be dead if he had not been languishing in this penal colony, if he had not been getting such poor medical treatment for the number of different health issues and abuses that he was complaining about. Let's take a look now though, at the real legacy of Alexey Navalny's extraordinary career. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

      "sentences": "He exercised those rights by calling on his millions of followers across social media to protest, putting him firmly in the Kremlin's crosshairs. In August 2020, on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow, Navalny fell seriously ill. An emergency diversion by the plane's pilot appears to have saved his life.Amid an international outcry, he was allowed to fly for treatment to Germany where it was discovered he'd been poisoned with Novichok, a chemical nerve agent. Later the CNN Bellingcat investigation revealed that for years Navalny had been trailed by FSB agents. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement. But an assassination attempt and a medically induced coma didn't deter Navalny from taking his fight to a higher level. Whilst recovering in Germany, he conducted a sting operation against an FSB agent, convincing the operative detail in a phone call how the Novichok was used against him. That was then broadcast on his YouTube channel. Shortly after, he released a video offering Russians are look at what his team called Putin's palace, a mansion by the Black Sea estimated to be worth more than $1 billion. President Putin denied the palace belongs to him or his family members. In January 2021, Navalny returned to Moscow after receiving lifesaving treatment in Germany. He was immediately arrested for violating probation terms imposed from a 2014 case and sent to a penal colony where he went on hunger strike, protesting against a prison official's refusal to grant him access to proper medical care. He'll be remembered for his bravery in tackling corruption across Russia, and as one of Vladimir Putin's biggest adversaries. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

When we look at this and we're hearing a lot of reaction, obviously, coming out of Munich, but also from world leaders. E.U. President Ursula von der Leyen saying Putin fears nothing more than dissent from his own people. Jill, pick up on that point of paranoia, if you will, because I think, for most people, too, as we look at this, Alexey Navalny was in this remote penal colony. Yes, he could still communicate with the outside world, but the sense that he was still a real threat to Vladimir Putin in this moment, the paranoia that we've talked about this morning of Vladimir Putin, can just touch on that for us, Jill?",

      "sentences": "Going back to 2017, 2019, 2021, when I was in Moscow and we would cover the protests, many of them organized by the Navalny team, and I would talk to these really --sometimes why are you here? Is this in support of Navalny? And many of them would say, well, it's not really Navalny. It's the country and my life. And the fact that we've got an old theater who is keeping us from having some type of a real life.And I found that very intriguing. So for some people, it is, yes, they would love to see Navalny as the president of Russia. Obviously, that will not happen, and probably never would happen, obviously. But I think it's more the feeling that the Kremlin with an old leader -- Vladimir Putin is now over 70. He has a very old style of communicating. And Navalny was a new type of guy with really modern communication. He mocked. He trolled. He was really good at engaging young person and talking the way a young person does -- ever ever answer that in their propaganda, they were not able to sound interesting and modern. And this has been a problem for Vladimir Putin. He tried, and I would look at these video meetings with young people and it was really almost embarrassing. So I think there is human capital and moral capital that Navalny had that was more valuable, let's say, then probably polling numbers or something like that. He really touched a lot of brushes. Now where we go with this, there's no question that on March 15, 16, 17, we're going to have an election, and Vladimir Putin, no doubt, unless there's an invasion by aliens, will be elected president of Russia, reelected. He could be there until he's 83 years old. Thats not -- it's expected, and that will happen. However, what the people of Russia are thinking is very unclear, and we went back to Prigozhin. We talked a little bit about that. When Prigozhin rose against the military and against the Kremlin, he struck a chord, too, a populist note. And that is dangerous for the Kremlin because it's very unpredictable. They don't really, truly know what the Russian people are thinking.",

The threat to peace and stability in Europe is aggressive the imperial authoritarianism endlessly inflicted by Russia upon itself.\" So, look, while we don't have the confirmed the exact cause or nature of death at this point, how does the symbolism of his reported death in a Russian prison further that described dynamic of aggressive imperial authoritarianism?",

He was alive, healthy and happy.\" And I think that there really speaking, Erica, to this sense of disbelief that even though Navalny had had so many health problems, had complained bitterly about the appalling treatment and deprivation that he was facing in this penal colony, that he had been relatively healthy, you know, relative to the circumstances that he was being held in. And so, this is coming as a huge shock even though on another level, it is of course, not surprising and will be confirming in some ways the worst fears of many of Navalny supporters, his loved ones. We have yet to hear any news from his wife, Yulia, or his two children, Dasha and Zahar.
