Well, it comes as RFK Jr. tells me that Biden is bigger threat to democracy than Trump. Plus, global outrage after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers delivering food on behalf of the Chef Jose Andres's organization. How could this have happened? We're going to ask the spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And did Trump already violate his gag order by re-posting an insult about a New York judge's daughter? Our legal analyst Ryan Goodman says yes and he will tell you why. So, let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the last election we ever have in America -- Trump's words tonight is he campaigns in Michigan and Wisconsin. He's predicting the end of the United States, as we know it, if he does not win the election.

You mentioned RFK, I will tell you. I met a voter yesterday in GreenBay, who told me they were coming to this rally tonight, that they were supporting President Donald Trump -- former President Donald Trump but that they had been very interested in RFK. And while overall, Donald Trump's team is not asking (INAUDIBLE) taking more from Biden, they, as you said, aware that every single vote will count. They don't want to lose any single votes to RFK. Now what they're doing to court voters here in Wisconsin particularly is trying to paint the status quo under President Biden as so terrible. They want to energize voters the show about the polls in November, they are very aware that in 2016, he had an energized base, Donald Trump. But in 2020, there were a number of people, Republicans, who sat out of the race because of the fact that they were really exhausted from four years of Donald Trump. They want to bring people back into the fold and make sure they're brought back to the polls in November. And they're doing that with a message particularly on immigration. Donald Trump has been ramping up his anti-immigration rhetoric and that's really what we saw today, both in Michigan and Wisconsin, talking about how migrants are animals, linking them to violent crime. And, Erin, as we have reported over and over again the data shows that immigrants and migrants are far less likely to commit crimes than citizens. However, there have been a number of high-profile recent cases that Donald Trump has really latched onto. You can see the key talking point for him, and it comes at a time where most Americans, according to polling, are most concerned about immigration in the 2024, November election. So he is really hoping that that propels him back to the White House in 2024. The other part of his messaging in Michigan and Wisconsin is trying to reach those working class voters. Some of those voters that broke for him in 2016, but did not break for him in 2020, he's talking about entitlement plans. He is telling everyone there are going to be tax breaks for everybody in the crowd. He's talking about unions and working class voters and how he's going to support them. Again, all of this messaging is driving it towards November 2024 because as you know, they know every single vote counts.",

If we don't win on November 5th, I think our country is going to cease to exist. Now, Mike, you've been all 50 states about twice in the past year. So you've spoken to many of the people that this message is aimed at. Do you think they believe it? MIKE ROWE, EMMY AWARD-WINNING TV HOST: You know, last time we talked, Erin, I think I said twice, I'm so worried about painting with too broad a brush and what I see happening everywhere. I look and from a lot of the people I've talked to, I think they feel the same way. I don't want to put words in their mouth people are certainly scared.

So somebody did approve it on a quite high level in the IDF. And does a lot of frustration that such a thing happen when it's clearly, clearly against all the rules of engagement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
