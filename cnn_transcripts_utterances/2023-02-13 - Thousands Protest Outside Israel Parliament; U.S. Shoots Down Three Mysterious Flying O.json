Three mystery objects were shot out of the sky by American fighter jets in the last three days. More on that is coming up. I'm Becky Anderson. Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. Live for you tonight from the World Government Summit here in Dubai. Leaders from across the business and political world have gathered here to talk about trends in tech and A.I. and the future of our planet. Discussions that affect each and every one of us. The IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva telling CNN today that the global economy is still in a difficult time, there are more reasons to be positive. More on that coming up. First, our top story. Dire conditions, geopolitics and what many are calling miraculous rescues. That is the story on the ground after that catastrophic earthquake in Turkey and Syria exactly a week ago today. But it is a horror story with heroes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Baby Mohammed (ph) takes every little labored breath on his own. No mom, no dad to hold his tiny hand. His parents didn't survive the earthquake. The three-month-old was rescued by neighbors who brought him to this ICU. In the room next door, we find that Halia (ph), the 26-year-old will never walk again. The earthquake brought down her family's home and crushed her back. Her stuck mom tells us Halia and her three children were under the rubble for 18 hours. The children survived but they don't know where they are. In every room of the Syrian hospital at bittersweet tale of survival. Many more should have been alive today to tell their stories. Doctors say they tried to save them, but didn't have enough supplies to save everyone. The few medical facilities in rebel-held Syria are barely still standing after years of Russian and Syrian regime bombardment that left them ill-equipped to deal with a disaster of this magnitude.

And I can tell you, Becky and as you've seen in our report, that -- those supplies couldn't get there soon enough. But a lot of people in northwestern Syria would tell you that this is just too little too late. And even the U.N. is admitting failure here. We heard from the U.N. Relief chief Martin Griffiths when he was at the border for that delivery, that he's saying that the people of Syria have the right to feel that they have been abandoned because the international community has failed them. And now is the time to try and fix that as soon as possible. I mean, they just need everything, Becky in there. It is unbelievable.

The tracks that you were alluding to are coming in through the only crossing that is currently open between Turkey and Syria. This aid that the U.N. is promising now will come up through what are known as these cross lines.

Jomana, thank you. The grief is unimaginable. And for those who have lost loved ones, sometimes their entire families a sense of utter hopelessness, remarkably, there are glimmers of hope, hope and encouragement. Next hour, see our --a toddler in Turkey pulled from the rubble is inspiring people to carry on. Well, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is with me now. Sanjay, moment of silence at the start of this World Government Summit earlier on today here in Dubai to mark the victims of the quake. And many discussions ongoing amongst regional leaders here about how to further support the victims of Syria and Turkey. We are a week into this disaster. And I was on the ground at the beginning of the week. And it was -- it was heartbreaking to see the devastation, the impact on those who survived it. Heartwarming to see the odd rescue. But as the hours go on, and we are now at that week's mark, how likely is it that we are going to get these glimmers of hope any longer? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is always so different disaster to disaster. You know, I mean, the thing about these is that, you know, Haiti, Nepal, Pakistan, these are all different scenarios. A lot of it has to do with the climate as Jomana was just talking about. If you look across the board, about 90 percent of people who are rescued, those rescues happen within the first 24 hours. World Trade Center after 9/11, the last rescue was 27 hours. But you do hear as we've been hearing, you know, obviously out of this region, you know, even close to seven days now, these rescues overall, the sort of average time to rescue after those first 28 hours is about 6.87 days, roughly. So, we're sort of starting to get to that point. But it's dependent on the things you'd think it'd be dependent on. Obviously, air, depending how trapped they are. Water, but also the shelter. And by that I would include the ambient weather and all that sort of stuff. That obviously can make a huge difference. You were there, you see how cold it gets, that not only hampers the likelihood of survival, but also hampers the rescue efforts. So, it's -- there's not a huge amount of data on this. It typically comes from other earthquakes but so many of those can happen in different parts of the world.",

And despite as you noted the plea is not only from the Israeli President but we've even recently heard from U.S. President Joe Biden calling for a consensus to be built. I can't tell you how rare it is for U.S. president to intervene in sort of internal Israeli politics. Now, things have wound down here, Becky, but earlier, there were tens of thousands. Some estimates go up as high as 100,000 came out to the streets of Jerusalem on a work day. And the reason that they decided to come out here to protest in front of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset was because today was the first time that these reforms were coming up in front of the committee hearing. And even at the committee hearing itself, it got dramatic. The opposition lawmaker, some of them jumped over tables, were yelling shame at the coalition members. And yet, of course, the bill with the majority -- with the majority that government has in that committee did pass through that committee is likely going to get its first reading on Wednesday. And for the people who are out here in the streets, they really feel as though this is their only option and to try to change the course of what they see as a potential destruction of Israeli democracy. For many of the people out here, they see these reforms as weakening the independence of the judiciary. They see it as you noted, they claim that it's a way for Benjamin Netanyahu to potentially get out of his corruption trial. And Benjamin Netanyahu, I should note, completely denies that. And for many of them, they see this is the beginning of -- some of them are even saying the beginning of Israel turning into a place like Hungary even. Very impassioned crowd out here. But they don't have these -- this point of view doesn't have the majority in the Israeli parliament. Benjamin Netanyahu and his partners have a 64-seat majority, that 120-seat parliament. Now the question will be is whether they will come to that table to have a consensus, have a conversation. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog making a very rare public televised address last night, warning that the country is on course for a violent collision between these two sides. And calling people to come together to come to a consensus saying, listen, both sides have valid points. Why don't we come together and talk about some reforms that can be made? So far, we haven't gotten any indication that people are going to come together and have the consensus. There is still time because this bill would need two -- would need three readings really before it could come into law. But the big question will be whether people will actually come together and be able to have these reforms or whether we will see these divisions in Israeli society only get even deeper. Becky?",

In fact, last year, it committed private companies and financial institutions to invest nearly $33 billion in developing economies.
