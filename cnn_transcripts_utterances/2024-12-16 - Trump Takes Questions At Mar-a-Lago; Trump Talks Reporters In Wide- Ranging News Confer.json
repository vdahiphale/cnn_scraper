So people can't go back to those cities. There's nothing there. It's just rubble. Just like when I knocked down a building in Manhattan, which is actually, this is worse, actually, because we do it step by step. This thing has just got demolished. And by the way, in those buildings are many people. Many people were in those buildings. You know, when they said the number in Ukraine is going to be a much higher number of deaths, is going to be a much higher number than you're hearing. You know, they're big buildings. That's what I did very well. And these are very long buildings. They're 15 to 20 stories high. They're massive buildings. I was surprised at how big. And they're flattened like a pancake. One or two bombs hit them and they just collapsed. And they'd say, nobody was hurt. Well, nobody knows who was in those buildings. There were a lot of people in those buildings. They're going to find that when they start doing the removal. Many more people are being killed in the Ukraine War with Russia than is being reported, and that includes soldiers. The soldiers are being killed -- it's a carnage that we haven't seen since the Second World War. It's got to be stopped. And I'm doing -- I'm doing my best to stop that.",

In this term, everybody wants to be my friend. I don't know. My personality changed or something. But I had -- as you know, I had Sundar from Google, but I also had Sergey. Nobody reported that. Sergey is the owner, the primary owner, along with his friend, as you know. And Sergey was here also. I can't believe you didn't pick that one up. Nobody picked that up. But I will tell you. No, it's a big difference. The big difference is that the first time everybody was fighting me, on all fronts, and we had a great administration. We got the biggest tax cuts in history, rebuilt the military. Too much of it was given away to Afghanistan, stupidly given away, horribly given away. I think that's one of the reasons that Putin went in to Ukraine when he saw the stupidity of million of these guys. Stupid people, very stupid people. If he didn't -- they didn't do such a big -- you know, we were pulling out of Afghanistan, but I would have pulled out with dignity and strength. They wouldn't be having parades, I guarantee you, showing our equipment that they left behind, because we weren't going to leave any equipment behind. Not 10 cents. We were going to take every screw and every bolt. So, yes, the biggest difference is that people want to get along with me this time. Well, they've gone through four years and, you know, it wasn't easy for me, but it wasn't easy for them either. And that's a great thing, though. Getting along is a great thing. So Tim Cook was here. I think he's done an incredible job at Apple. And he talked about the future of Apple. It's going to be a bright future. But we have many others also and not in that business. And we do have Jeff Bezos, Amazon, coming in sometime during the week. I look forward to that. We have a lot of great executives coming in. The top executives, the top bankers, they're all calling. And honestly, in the first time, I don't know what it was. It's like a complete opposite in the first one. And the press has covered that fairly, actually, for change. The first one, they were very hostile. And maybe it was my fault, but I don't really think so. They were just very right from the beginning. And this one is much less hostile.

You've been listening to a wide- ranging news conference for about an hour now with President-elect Donald Trump taking questions from reporters in Mar-a-Lago, talking about a myriadof issues ranging from domestic policies to international affairs, and specifically, as you just heard there, going back to Syria. He spoke on Ukraine, the war, saying that there has to be a deal and that he will be speaking with both President Putin and Zelenskyy once he does officially take office on January 20th. He spoke about the big announcement today economically with the CEO of SoftBank, announcing a four-year, $100 billion investment in the United States, adding some 100,000 jobs with it. The CEO of SoftBank stating that he has renewed confidence in the U.S. economy, thanks in large part to his words to some of President-elect Trump's policies that he will be unveiling as well. He spoke about any concerns that a number in the medical community have about his choice for HHS Secretary, RFK Jr. in that role, given his previous statements about vaccines. He said that he is not a vaccine skeptic, that he does support vaccine for polio and others, though he does not support vaccine mandates including in schools. He also spoke about the border as well. And he even touched on a story we have been focusing on and is receiving a great deal of interest, specifically on the East Coast, and that is the unprecedented number of drone sightings stating that he believes the Pentagon knows what is happening and owes the American public an explanation. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. And you are watching ONE WORLD. As we noted, President-elect Donald Trump wrapping up that news conference taking questions about his cabinet picks and vaccines. Also making that major announcement with the CEO of SoftBank, as I noted. SoftBank announcement is a big win for president-elect, who returns to the White House for a second term in five weeks.

He noted that Turkey, in his view, will have and that has had in the ouster of Bashar al-Assad, stating that, in his view again, following his conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, given the numerous issues and conflicts in that region. He still believes that the harder issue to tackle is the war in Ukraine. And then moving back domestically, we talked about the vaccine concerns, about some of the questions that RFK Jr. has raised about the efficacy of vaccines in the past, but also notable the role of the media and the precedent he views that the settlement with ABC News for $15 million has set for future lawsuits. And he specifically, I believe he made news, I haven't heard this before, stating that they plan now to sue the \"Des Moines Register\" over what proved to be false polling or, you know, false outcome of the polling from Ann Selzer, who subsequently then stepped down from her position, stating in that poll that there was increased support for Kamala Harris among voters that did not prove to be the case in Iowa.

And that connection is made up its fantasy, its anti-science. But the other thing is that we leave vaccines like for months, measles, rubella and polio up to parents, that creates a problem because if 15, 20 percent of the kids in your child's class are not vaccinated, that will make your children liable to catch these terrible diseases that have been essentially eradicated. So this is about public health. You know, you break your leg, you don't want to get it treated. I'm sorry to hear that, but you know, you'll live with that.
