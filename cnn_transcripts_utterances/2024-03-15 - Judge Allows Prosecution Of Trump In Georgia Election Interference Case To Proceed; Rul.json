      "sentences": "Donald Trump's election interference case in Georgia can now theoretically move forward. Today, the presiding judge delivered a major ruling that allows Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting the former president and his co-defendants. But she may only stay on if she removes special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who you may recall she'd been romantically involved with.This all follows a months-long effort by Trump and his allies to disqualify Willis. They argue that she financially benefited from hiring Wade and that that created a conflict of interest. Now, today's ruling is a major victory for Willis and her office, but it came with some harsh criticism from Judge Scott McAfee, who rebuked Willis for the relationship and now says that it leaves a stain on the prosecution's team. CNN's Nick Valencia is live outside the courthouse for us in Fulton County. Nick, you've been watching this case unfold for months. What stands out to you about the decision today?",

And those close to Fani Willis, her allies, they are seeing this as a big win, as a huge win, even if it's only a technical win on paper, and even if it does come with some blistering criticism from the judge, a massive indictment on her behavior. He called some of her testimony on February 15th during those disqualification hearings unprofessional, and he had some sharp and pointed words, about her relationship with Nathan Wade. This is what Judge Scott McAfee is saying in part of his decision, saying, quote, Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices, even repeatedly.He goes on to say that this finding is by no means an indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment for the unprofessional manner of the district attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing. You know, we've been hearing from defense attorneys, including the one that surfaced these allegations, and while they say they respect the decision, they do feel vindicated in a certain sense. And I also spoke to Scott Grubman. He faced off against Fani Willis in an earlier phase of this case when he represented Ken Chesebro. He criticized Judge Scott McAfee, saying he really kind of split the baby here, and says that he expects the defense attorneys in this case, primarily Stephen Sadow, the defense attorney for former President Trump, to appeal this decision.

Let's discuss the case, now with National Security Attorney Bradley Moss. Bradley, thank you so much for being with us. So Judge McAfee here is saying that there is no effective conflict of interest, that the relationship between Fani Willis and Nathan Wade was not relevant to the charges against Donald Trump and his co-defendants. But he does say that there was an appearance of impropriety that must be removed. What's your main takeaway from that ruling?BRADLEY MOSS, PARTNER, LAW OF OFFICE OF MARK S .ZAID: Yeah, Judge McAfee here, it was a pretty even-handed ruling. Basically decided, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. There was a bunch of smoke. There's certainly a stain on the reputation now of Nathan Wade and of Fani Willis and of this prosecution from an optics standpoint, but as a matter of law, in terms of the evidentiary standard that these defense lawyers had to meet they simply didn't have the proof that there was an actual conflict of interest That there was an actual financial material benefit tied to Fani Willis in prosecuting this case that would mandate disqualification. But he agreed with the idea that because there is this stain on the case, that because there's the appearance of impropriety, someone has to go, and that's almost certainly going to be Nathan Wade. The case will continue on, and the question becomes, if this gets to trial, will the voters even remember what happened leading up to it  if it makes it to the trial and we have a verdict before Election Day? SANCHEZ: You said it'll almost certainly be that Fani Willis stays and hires  a new prosecutor. How does that process complicate the case? It doesn't seem like this August timeline that we were trending toward is tenable.",

Trump's legal team also releasing this statement, slamming the ruling.While respecting the court's decision, we believe that the court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade, including the financial benefits, testifying untruthfully about when their personal relationship began, as well as Willis's extrajudicial MLK church speech where she played the race card and falsely accused the defendants and their counsel of racism. We will use all legal options available as we continue to fight to end this case, which should never have been brought in the first place. Let's talk about this now.

I don't know if that extends beyond the Trump base, and that has always really been the question for me. I mean, all of these cases are looking less likely to render a verdict before November. But whether they go to trial is also really significant. Trump's retrospective job approval has been rising in most polls now. He has a higher job approval, retrospectively, people looking back at his presidency, than he had at any actual point during the presidency.And I think one of the questions is whether any of these cases, particularly the ones related to election interference, are underway by the election in a manner that, like the January 6th committee, reminds voters, particularly those who are pretty tuned out. That last 10 percent of voters don't pay a lot of attention. What it was that happened in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election. And that, I think, is the risk to Trump at this point, more than that there will be a definitive verdict before the election.",

The delay in New York, the immunity case going to Supreme Court, delaying that. What looked to be just a couple months ago as a year stocked with Trump in a courtroom suddenly looks a little bit more free now. And that changes how he campaigns. That changes his message.

If you were a prosecutor and you're prosecuting the former president of the United States for actions they took in and around an election, you have to be above reproach. You cannot give, knowing that this will be a politically charged thing, your political enemies any sort of thing to latch up on. As we've seen here, just her lack of judgment, and as the judge said, gave, really left a stain in this case, and it left Trump and his campaign something concrete to now use politically. And look, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not going to pretend to be one. I'll leave that to Brad and the rest of the folks. But also, as this trial goes on, if it goes on, if there's an appeal, how they use it also can also be very potent, too.Keilar: But Ron, let's say, the judge said here, she stays on the case, she just keeps it business and proceeds with the case whenever that may be. And obviously, the timing is a huge issue. I mean, can the case then stand for itself and maybe change some perceptions of her at this point in time, if we see how that is carried out in court?",

I mean, the--as I said, I mean, you know, his retrospective type (ph) of approval is now at a level that exceeds his actual approval at any point during his presidency. And in some ways, that's because people are reacting primarily to the economy before COVID. All of these cases remind people of some of the anxieties they felt about having Trump in the White House, not only the question of whether he is bound by the rule of law or is a threat to kind of the Constitution. But just the sheer chaos and uncertainty and constant drama that surrounded him. So he has a strong interest in putting off any of these trials until after the election.I mean, the Supreme Court has certainly thrown in a big lifeline in that regard and the most consequential of them. But look, I think the damage to her reputation and her judgment has been done, can't be undone. The question is how much of this evidence will be out before the public before November. That is the real issue here. KEILAR: Yeah. That and also, Matt, because, you know, a lot of people have no idea about the fake elector scheme. We talk about it all the time, right? That's why we look at this Georgia case. We know it's important. But there are a lot of voters who completely don't realize that this happened during the election.

It focuses the attention a little bit more. And certainly in Georgia, where this is all televised, as opposed to I know some districts that are necessarily not, that does make a difference. And I think also to Ron's point. We saw with COVID, I think people got just tired of Trump because he's in your face every day with those COVID press conferences. And the like.And I think that wore some folks down. The ability now to not be on TV in a courtroom every day, not be the center of attention every day, does absolutely help. And I think that's no secret also why you're looking right now, he has a steady two to four point lead in a lot of polls against Joe Biden.

In addition to that, you know, we should put elections in quotes because these are far from free or fair elections. It's notable, of course, that one of his primary opponents he put away in a penal colony and died there recently, Alexei Navalny. And there is no free press there to cover the candidate honestly or cover the war honestly there as well, which normally would be, you imagine, a subject of debate.

I'm told by U.S. military officials that they believe, as this relates to Ukraine, that his presumed almost certain victory in this not quite election, that he will feel emboldened and might very well expand Russian military operations in Ukraine, including the possibility of a further mobilization of military-age men in Russia.In other words, to send more forces there.
