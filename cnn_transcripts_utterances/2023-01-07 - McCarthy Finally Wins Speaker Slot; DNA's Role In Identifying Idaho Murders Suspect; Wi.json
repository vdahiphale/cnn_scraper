It's helping to tell the story of this speaker election. Now, imagine if were able to do that when there's a major piece of legislation. I think that it would be far more engaging for the American people, and voters would really be able to see who's talking to who.\"Well, of course he's right. Tell me if you agree. This is today's poll question @smerconsish.com. Should the speaker allow C-SPAN cameras full access to the House chamber for all proceedings? Go vote.

Certainly the only one that got nearly violent, we saw this take place between the important 14th vote series and the 15th vote series. We saw Kevin McCarthy go right to Matt Gaetz and start talking to him. And that's where we saw Congressman Mike Rogers come over and he got in. Gaetz's face he essentially had to be restrained physically by another congressman to hold him back. And we saw Kevin McCarthy kind of look at the tussle up there on the floor and return there. That was an important moment because that was when McCarthy did not have the votes.And then the 15th vote, of course, is when he notched that win, getting 216 votes to become the next speaker. And he got there because in the end, Matt Gaetz did vote present, along with five other holdouts, that key group of conservative House Republicans that had been voting against Kevin McCarthy all week. All of the previous votes, they ultimately voted present, which lowered that threshold for Kevin McCarthy to score this major, historic and at times very ugly victory.",

Of course, he dropped out of the speaker's race years ago as well. So certainly this is a big win for him just emotionally. But there were -- and although as you played there, he, you know, played up that this was not an easy battle to get there.But he played up in that speech last night shortly after 1:00 a.m. this morning, the unity and that he -- you know, what he try -- will try to bring to the House going forward. But this is likely just a preview of what's to come. The fact that it took so long to get here really underscores not only, one, that he has a very narrow majority in the House, that's going to be hard for him, but that he has this raucous and chaotic side of the conference. The fact that he has this very block of very conservative members that we've seen already really flex their muscles. This is going to continue to raise a problem for him going forward. So, it is going to be a hard slog. And that hard slog, Michael, starts on Monday. When the House reconvenes, they have to pass the rules package that potentially could not be easy and then get to legislating after that.",

They don't want when I'm advocating, but who cares? We should want it. We should have a right to it. Let me show you something else. This is congressman -- Congresswoman Katie Porter from Orange County, California, reading a book. Oh, check out the title of that book. OK. All right, I'll give you another one. Here's Marjorie Taylor Green. Check out her cell phone. Can you zoom in on that, Catherine (ph)? DT. OK. It's not ET, it's DT. You know who DT is, DT phone home? It's Donald Trump.

Make sure you go to smerkonish.com and answer this week's poll question, because this is what I'm asking. I'm asking in this week's poll question, should the speaker allow C-SPAN cameras full access to the House chambers for all proceedings? Why should this week have to end? Up ahead, despite studying a PhD, obtaining a PhD in criminology, the suspect in the Idaho murders, he couldn't help but leave clues behind. Cell phone signals, an identifiable car, and most importantly, his DNA on a knife sheet in the victim's bed. I'm going to talk to DNA crime solver, who's one of America's leading experts on exactly this case. Plus, in Prince Harry's new memoir, he relates his fistfight with William, his drug use, his loss of virginity at 17, his father's coldness around Diana's death. These and many more juicy dales are now begging the question, has Harry finally gone too far? Who better to ask than Princess Diana's chief of staff Patrick Jephson about the latest dents to the crown? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But touch DNA, now that we can use it because of the sensitivity of our equipment, it also means you have to be more cautious about using DNA as your only evidence.So it's a really positive thing that they clearly have other evidence. This is just one piece of it. We have seen DNA -- touch DNA transfer in other cases.

Even if he tried hard not to leave something, you still would.And that is great news, because what it means is that anyone who perpetrates this type of crime in the future should be aware that they will be identified, they will be caught. There really is no reason that we should see serial killer, serial rapist moving forward. This guy, you know, potentially could have become a Ted Bundy or even a Zodiac not identified 50 years later.
