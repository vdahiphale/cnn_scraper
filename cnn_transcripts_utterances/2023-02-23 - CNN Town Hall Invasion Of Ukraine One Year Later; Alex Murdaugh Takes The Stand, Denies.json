And we all long for the day where you can walk freely with your classmates, not worry about having to scamper to a bomb shelter, not have to worry about your loved ones or yourselves when your neighbors and your friends and your family members are not off in some distant country where they became refugees but they're back home reunited with you.

The sun is due to come up on this anniversary in just about 90 minutes' time, and you're absolutely right, that this country is bracing for what they are calling potential provocative actions by the Russians.They could come from land, sea or air from the north, from the east or from the south. There is a high likelihood, Fareed, that we could see salvos of missiles fired all across this country, as we have seen many times before, fired at critical infrastructure, heating, electricity, water, crippling those facilities in the middle of the winter, which has had a devastating effect on the Ukrainian population. We could see Russia step up their attacks where we are already seeing fierce fighting in the eastern city of Bakhmut, in the southeastern town of Vuhledar, where I was earlier today with a unit that fully expected the Russian to do something on this anniversary, around Kherson where the Ukrainians have pushed back the Russians several months ago. There could be random attacks in cities like Dnipro, very far from the frontlines. We saw an attack in this city on an apartment building just last month, more than 40 people killed by a cruise missile, that kind of random attack just striking fear and terror in the hearts of Ukrainians. So, this country certainly girding itself for what could come on this anniversary. Farreed?",

And that's how USAID is proceeding as we try to catalyze the involvement of the European bank for reconstruction, development, the big international financial institutions and to get the private sector to be interested in coming back to those parts of Ukraine that are relatively peaceful, and even, you know, to continue to make investments elsewhere. We just struck a public/private partnership with Bayer, which is building a new seed factory in Ukraine, which is going to employ thousands of Ukrainians. The more Ukrainians are employed, the more revenue there is, the less assistance will need to come from outside. So, this is going to be from within and from without, but I think it's not necessarily going to be an on/off switch. It's something we want more Ukrainian refugees to be in a position to come home to have infrastructure that awaits them where they can live in buildings that have been repaired. But, of course, the damage that some estimates is that the damage so far has been $130 billion if you take arable land, homes, hospitals, schools. So, this is going to be a mammoth undertaking. The other thing we want to do is with an eye to those big ticket items, which most of which will happen only when there is a negotiated peace, but we have to make sure that resources are going to be well spent when you have those huge investments which go well beyond what is being provided right now. That's when, of course, you want to make sure that you have the safeguards in place so that all outside investors and donors know that and can say to their citizens that this is money that is going to be well spent. But I think President Biden has spoken really eloquently, powerfully to how much enthusiasm there will be when this war is officially over, you know, a number of actors are on the outside really wanting to be a part of the longer-term solution. But getting the institutional frameworks right is something we can be working on right now in addition to these stopgap recovery efforts. ZAKARIA:  Jake, I'd ask you one final question. We've talked all about the world, Russia, Ukraine. We haven't talked about what's going on in the United States. Do you worry when you hear voices like Governor DeSantis, Senator Hawley, Senator Vance questioning why the United States is doing this, asking why we should be spending this money, wondering whether we should be taking a more neutral position?",

You want to speak to every witness, you want to minimize their testimony through cross-examination, and then if it doesn't go well, you say, maybe I'll put my client on.Now, here's the kicker. Whenever you put a defendant on the stand, it's not about the case that you did as a defense attorney where you raised reasonable doubt, it becomes about your client. Is your client credible? Are they believable? Are they relatable, are they human, right, and in essence do they carry the day? The problem here is that you have a person who has lied and lied and lied and lied. However --",

The more time he is on the stand, the more the jury can scrutinize and really look at in a fine-tooth comb everything he said, whether it's consistent, whether there're inconsistencies. And so it's very difficult to kind of take a look.Look, these trials are all about, especially in a circumstantial case, character is king. This jury is trying to create a portrait, who is this man? Is he a sociopath who would lie to do anything and is a murderer or is it just truly an aggrieved husband who has committed sins in his past but then also is -- couldn't possibly do it?
