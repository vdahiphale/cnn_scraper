Experts say that children and senior citizens are most at risk of infection, and so far, there's no vaccine or medication to treat the virus. Doctors also say that you should consult a medical professional if you notice these symptoms, like a lower lung infection, hacking coughs, runny nose, sore throat, and fever.

But by the end of last year, they had completed construction of this three module structure. And now there's already talk about expanding this structure to extend research capabilities. So that's a kind of a pace of development we have been seeing. Now, this latest crew, these three astronauts, they are going to conduct a series of research and experiments doing their five months stay in space, but also, of course, installing, testing new equipment and conducting spacewalks. All of that has become increasingly common. But one of the most fascinating aspects, as you mentioned about this crew, of course, is it's the first time China is sending a civilian into space. All the previous Chinese astronauts have been military personnel. And this professor, Gui Haichao, is from a prestigious aeronautics university here and he is a payload expert, but he's been actually raising quite a eyebrows because he actually wears eyeglasses. So prompting officials and state media to explain, given the division of labor, astronauts tasks have become more specialized. So you don't have to have perfect 20/20 natural vision to be a astronaut. And I've already seen some facetious response online from parents actually complaining now they could no longer tell their kids, who are glued to their smartphones that you will never become an astronaut if you're near sighted.

Kim has test fired more than 100 missiles since the beginning of last year. Last month, he claimed to have fired off a long range intercontinental ballistic missile powered by solid fuel. Analysts say a solid fueled ICBM would give North Korea more flexibility because those missiles can be launched more quickly than others. North Korea recently tested an underwater drone that it said was capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, and the regime test fired cruise missiles launched from a submarine. Analysts say this new satellite is right up there in importance with all of those missile capabilities because it can provide the intelligence Kim's generals need to use those weapons in war.",
