We're in kind of a strange position on the Democratic side because, on the one hand, you know, we see consistently in polls there are a large number of rank-and-file Democrats who are skeptical about Biden running again. That was evident in the exit polls in 2022. It's evident in the national polls that continue to come out. They worry he's too old. On the other hand, there is no institutional support anywhere in the party for a challenge. I mean, you know, normally, you would look at those numbers and say, well, some ambitious new politician would make a name for themselves by challenging. But that is not developing. In part, because I don't think, in the Democratic Party, anybody else would be as strong as him in '24. So he has lots of time to make his decision. But I think Democrats, the institutional force of the Democratic Party are very comfortable with him running again and are expecting that as the outcome.",

Let's talk about potential Republican candidates.Ron DeSantis has not said he's made a decision on what he's doing, but a lot of speculation as to whether or not he will announce that he's running. He has a legislative session he's got to get through. But there is a book coming out, a lot of focus on him. You wrote about him recently and you said, \"In many areas where he could have been grasping for suburban or moderate voters and talking and talking about the economy and some of his accomplishments in Florida, he is, instead, going full MAGA and focusing on culture war issues.\" Talk about the question you raise in your piece about whether he can run on Trumpism without being Trump.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Right. I mean, this is the fundamental tension in the possible Ron DeSantis candidacy.And certainly, Bianna, he has the same built-in excuse that George W. Bush had in 1999 about delaying an announcement until after the legislative session in his state. But he is doing all the kinds of things you would expect of an eventual candidate, the swing around New York and Pennsylvania and Illinois last week. He will be in California this weekend and Texas. So he's giving himself the capacity to run. But what's striking, though, is there is a fundamental tension to the way he's presenting himself to a lot of Republican strategists. The potential appeal of DeSantis is the thought that, as someone who is less personally polarizing than Donald Trump, he could win back the white-collar suburban voters that moved away from the party in the suburbs of Philadelphia or Atlanta or Detroit, and really move those states out of reach for the GOP since 2016. On the other hand, as you note, the way he's choosing to define himself in the Republican primary is not so much as a competent administrator and someone who kept the economy moving. He's defining himself as a culture warrior. If you talk to a group like Pan America, which is a free speech group, they say what he's doing to control speech in classrooms, from kindergarten through college, there is no precedent for it in American history. And obviously, there are other issues, like permit-less carry for handguns and the potential of his six-week abortion ban in Florida. On the one hand, I think very clearly he is signaling he doesn't want Donald Trump to get to his right on the cultural issues. But the question is, even if he wins the nomination, does that undermine what is supposed to be one of his core strengths, which is the ability to win back some of the socially moderate white-collar suburbs?",

First of all, it is a reflection of what I was saying a moment ago, that DeSantis seems to have made a calculation, he won't let Donald Trump get to his populus right on any issue where he can help it.It was surprising to a lot of Republicans, including many who enthusiastic about DeSantis as a potential '24 nominee that he moves so far in the Trump direction, skepticism toward aid of Ukraine. Not only for the specifics, Bianna, but as a signal of this broader dynamic that Trump may be exerting a magnetic pull on him in a way that weakens him as a candidate. But this is where the Ukraine fight is going to be fought out initially. You might see it institutionally with the Senate Republicans being more supportive and the House Republicans being more skeptical. But the divide between a Mitch McConnell and a Mike Pence and a Nikki Haley on one side, or that neo-Reaganite position that we have to show strength, we have to stand up against Putin and Russia, versus this kind of populous conservative neo-Trump view of Marjorie Taylor Greene and potentially Ron DeSantis, saying, you know, this is not our fight. I think that latter group will be very loud in the House. And it will have an audience in the presidential primary. And then you will have this more traditional. That's where the fight will unfold first rather than the Republican Party unifying against one position where they could pressure Joe Biden.",

Kristin, this is a fully crewed mission with astronauts on board. What more do we know about the scrub launch today and plans for another attempt perhaps Thursday? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: I think it's important to the keep it in perspective, scrubs happen. Look at the current NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's SpaceX flight back in 1986. He scrubbed four times before successfully lifting off. So scrubs happen. That's not unusual. What is unusual here, though, this is the first time that SpaceX has ever scrubbed due to technical issues for a crewed or a manned flight up into outer space. So that's what's really different here. And when you look at what happened -- and that was the Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center, very early this morning -- there was a problem with the rocket's ignition system. Essentially, the fluid that's used to light the Falcon 9 rocket engines, there was a problem on the ground with that system. And so SpaceX called off this launch, with four astronauts on board, two NASA astronaut, one Russian cosmonaut, and one astronaut from the United Arab Emirates. NASA and SpaceX called it off with two minutes left on the countdown clock, at about 1:43 in the morning Eastern time. So, you know, Bianna and Victor, just imagine, I mean, everybody involved with NASA and SpaceX for this launch. Obviously, it's a huge inconvenience for them when you're dealing with a scrub this early in the morning. But imagine if you're one of those astronauts sitting on top of a fully fueled rocket, highly flammable. You've been gearing up to go for this moment. The countdown clock is ticking down. You get all the way to the two- minute mark and they say, oh, scrub, we've got to defuel the rocket and get you out of there safely. It's tough. It's a part of human space flight. It happens all the time. But it certainly doesn't make it any easier. They're going to try Thursday. If that doesn't work, the next attempt is Friday.",
