Brutal impact, the Range Rover bulldozers a crowd of migrants killing at least eight. Just moments ago, authorities identifying the driver signposting his criminal history and unveiling eight manslaughter charges against him.Plus, so much blood. Horror stories from first responders to a mass shooting in Allen, Texas. As investigators now examine the gunman's obsession with neo-Nazi beliefs. And outlier or a warning. New polling shows America is deeply unhappy with President Biden including Democrats, as the president confronts this week, crisis on the border and on Capitol Hill. Up first for us though, Texas families measuring loss, and police mulling over motive after a mass shooter blast his way through an outlet mall, taking eight innocent lives. On top of gunfire there, screams of where to run, sounds we are now, all much too used to hearing. Allen, Texas now the latest American city afflicted by a mushrooming gun epidemic, the mass shooting unfolding with breakneck speed. You can see here the moment the 33-year-old shooter stepped out of his car. The minutes that followed said shoppers scattering behind cars, hiding inside supply closets as the gunman stalked victims. The gun captured in this image an AR-15 style weapon. The shooter witnesses say also wore a tactical vest stuffed with magazines full of ammunition. The chaos turned bystanders by Steven Spainhouer into first responders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, you just heard Josh Campbell go through what we know, social media posting, neo-Nazi other white supremacist, the violent ideologies discharged from the military some kind of a mental health issue there.

In fact, the military notice something and they apparently from that report, he was released from the military for mental reasons. Yet they train them on a weapon and then they send them out into the general public, and he gets a security guard job.So, I'm all for these red flag laws, very strict ones. It at least gives you a tool or an avenue to intervene. And it's not, you know, it's not a permanent ban from weapon -- possessing weapons, it's a ban until you can get better. The other thing is, I think we need to fix the background check system NICS's broken, the National Background Check System is instant check system is broken, and it needs to be fixed. And I can -- we don't have enough time here to go into all the reasons why it's broken. And then, honestly, as a conservative, I still say that and I side with the IACP, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, certain shoulder weapons, semi-automatic weapons, extended magazines, armor piercing, weapon loads need to be rigorous, you need a rigorous background check.

We've had this conversation too many times. As Chris Swecker notes, you have these social media postings, you have this patch, Right Wing Death Squad. Again, we find these things out after the fact. Are there better ways? And does this depend on? Is it state? Is it a federal? Is it a local question, to try to get the dots connected beforehand, or to get people to raise those red flags? CAPT. RON JOHNSON, MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL: You know, I think we do have red flag issues here and there as a parent, but I think it's a federal issue. I think we have to be consistent. I think we have to have something that blankets our nation in a safe -- in a safer way. I think when we leave it up to everyone else, we'll see how some states are better than others. And so, I think the federal government is going to have to get in here and do something because these things become commonplace in our country. And there are red flags.

Gentlemen, thank you.Last hour, as Chris Swecker just noted, there was a tragedy in Brownsville, Texas authorities leveling manslaughter charges now against the driver who plowed into and murdered eight people. The victims include migrants from Venezuela. Police giving a dramatic run through of what happened Sunday in Brownsville, Texas and detailing the drivers long, very long criminal rap sheets.

We understand that the investigation has taken, you know, a variety of scenarios, John. They are looking at whether or not this could have been a malfunction of the car at the press conference. They did say it appeared that the driver ran through a red light and then appeared to lose control. But I asked a follow up question to the police chief here asking him, how were you able to rule out that this was not intentional? And he said at this point, the investigation cannot rule that out. So that is another scenario that they're looking into. They are looking into also whether or not he was intoxicated. We understand that they've taken blood work from Mr. Alvarez and sent that to the Texas Department of Public Safety crime lab to figure out if he was impaired. And earlier I spoke to some eyewitnesses who despite what investigators are saying, have no doubt in their mind that this was intentional. Cesar Romero, he's a Venezuelan national. He says some of those killed were his friends. Some of them had just arrived in the United States the day before. He said the driver got out of the car, tried to take off running.

They argued that Trump had, you know, mistaken E. Jean Carroll for his former wife Marla Maples in the deposition, being showed a photo of them. And also pointing to the Access Hollywood tape, which they replayed again before the jury, you know, saying overlaying what Trump said on that tape. I just kiss women when I see them. With E. Jean Carroll's allegations of being raped in Bergdorf Goodman department store saying that, he would let her into the dressing room and just kissed her. Trump saying that, you know, he just grabs women, detailing how Trump then raped E. Jean Carroll, and Trump saying that stars get away with it, unfortunately or fortunately, and then saying that he himself is a star. So, she told the jury to focus on that, to focus on the allegations brought by the two other women who testified in this case, saying that that is Trump's MO to assault women in semi-public places. And then when they go public about it, to deny and to attack them. You know, they also (Inaudible) so said that, you know, if they really wanted to know who was telling the truth in this case, that they should listen to Trump's own words going back again to that Access Hollywood tape saying that, this is what he really meant when he said it when he thought it was a private conversation on the Access Hollywood bus, not something that he was asked to say in a video deposition now. So, saying that if they think that anyone in this case is lying is Donald Trump.
