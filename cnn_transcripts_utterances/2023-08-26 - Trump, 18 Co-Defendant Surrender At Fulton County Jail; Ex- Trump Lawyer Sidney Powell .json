The Paris 2024 Olympics, now less than a year away.Bronny James, the son of Lakers superstar, LeBron James, he is expected to make a full recovery after suffering cardiac arrest on the basketball court. The 18-year-old was taken to a hospital last month after collapsing during that workout at USC. In a statement, the family said Bronny suffered from a significant congenital heart defect, but it can be treated and they're confident he's going to return to the basketball court in the very near future. All right, finally, check out what happened to Dive Back Red's game last night. Tommy Pham's going to blast this one to left. The Reds' Spencer Steer, he's going to go back to the wall and make a great leaping grab to rob the home run, or did he? The young fan there actually snags it out of Steer's glove. We'll show you a replay. Just an incredible catch from that fan. Look at this. It's in Steer's glove, but the fan grabs it out. So, they originally gave Pham a home run, but after they reviewed it, they called it interference, so Pham was out. They then made the poor young fan guys move from the front row, they kicked him out and made him go sit somewhere else. I mean, look, if you're under 18 years old and you make an incredible catch, you should be applauded, and you should still get to stay wherever you want.

She's, she had a theory about money, dark money moving through Cuba and China to impact the election. Even, even Rudy, you know, characterized some of her theories as crackpot theories.

So, you can expect right now that that's being looked at by this government-backed body. And it comes just days after, or just shortly after, rather, President Putin broke his silence on this plane crash, speaking of Prigozhin in the past tense, describing him as a talented man who made serious mistakes.Look, very few who are supporters of Prigozhin in the Western intelligence agency, even President Biden himself, are surprised that Prigozhin may very well have met the fate. In fact, the only thing that was surprising was that, for two months, he seemed to be a dead man walking, posing the most serious threat to President Putin's rule in nearly two decades. Now, the question is, can these Russian investigators carry out an independent analysis without meddling? You have to remember, of course, this plane crash took place on Russian territory. These investigators are government-backed for Western intelligence agencies, for supporters of Prigozhin, that's going to put a lot of question marks as to whether or not this is truly an independent body. Now, the Kremlin has, of course, denied, denied, denied any involvement in this crash, calling any finger-pointing absolute lies. But of course, over the course of the last several years from here in England and the Salisbury poisonings to Alexei Navalny, we've seen Kremlin critics meet very mysterious fates from poisonings to falling off balconies.

We may never know who ordered this. Was it Putin himself or was it someone in the upper ranks of power who wanted to make a move to take over Wagner or who simply wanted to possibly curry favor with the boss by taking out someone who'd embarrassed Putin on the world stage? Either thing makes a lot of sense. The ultimate result is that the top leadership of the Wagner group was on that plane with the exception of the executive director who hadn't taken part in the coup. So, you've sliced off the ideological people who were a challenge towards Putin and Mother Russia and the war in Ukraine, and you've left intact the Wagner structure, which has been very useful to the Russian government in places like Africa, operating as a de facto arm of the state.",

Now, we do anticipate that by Tuesday, likely to get up to major hurricane strength before it continues back out into some cooler water. So, you may end up seeing some rip current issues right there along the North Carolina coast if this starts to shift a little bit farther west. But again, for the most part, this is going to remain in between Bermuda and the U.S. The bigger concern for the U.S. is actually this system right here just to the east of the Yucatan Peninsula. That system is expected to slide to the north into the Gulf Coast in the coming days. Right now, it's very disorganized cluster of thunderstorms, but it's expected to move into much more favorable conditions in the next 24 to 48 hours, as it pushes also into extremely warm waters. And that is fuel for a lot of these storms. So, as it slides north, getting into more favorable conditions, we do anticipate that this system will turn into a tropical depression, and then into a named tropical storm. So, the concern is really going to be areas of Florida, especially between Tampa and Pensacola in the coming days where this could end up potentially having some impacts.

Get this, heat indices could range anywhere from 103 to upwards of 109 degrees. That is dangerous heat folks. Now, there are several heat mitigation efforts around this course that have been set in place. Something as simple as putting up cool towels at every tee for the players. But there's also additional hydration stations, misting stations, sunscreen stations, all to help the spectators and the athletes. One piece of very interesting technology that I've never seen before is this cooling med. It actually has the ability to cool the core internal temperature of your body in a matter of seconds if you stick your hand within this device. So, very, very interesting and critical piece of technology should a person become overheated. Now, the executive director of the Tour champion says he wants the players to focus on the $18 million purse that's at play, but not being dehydrated or overheated. We spoke -- actually, the press spoke to one of the Georgia natives. He thought maybe he would have an advantage growing up in this heat and humidity find out what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that's expected to happen around that timeframe. After that, the CDC director will likely accept that recommendation, and the vaccines will start to become available in pharmacies. So, we're talking about that sort of middle week of September, around September 12th. The few days after, that really starting to happen. Now, this updated COVID vaccine targets just one strain of the virus known as XBB.1.5. And it's not too dissimilar from the current strain that is dominant in the U.S. right now, called EG.5. That accounts for about 20 percent of an estimated U.S. cases within the last couple of weeks. Now, of course, we are in a little bit of a COVID spike right now. We have seen elevated levels of COVID in wastewater monitoring, suggesting that cases are at a higher level. We also are seeing in the CDC's data about a 21 percent increase in terms of both hospitalizations and deaths from COVID right now. And, of course, it's important to note that's off of a very low base, one of the lowest we've seen for the entire pandemic, but we are starting to see that uptick, and so, many health authorities are looking forward to the availability of this updated vaccine, which is expected to provide better protection against the currently circulating strains. Now, one thing that public health authorities are paying a lot of attention to right now is an emerging variant known as BA.2.86. [07:45:03] Now, the reason they are paying such close attention to this, even though only 10 cases have been detected worldwide including a couple here in the United States, is because this is a very mutated variant. So, it looks different from the variants that have come before it. Right now, there's no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease. It's not known yet how transmissible it will be, if it's more transmissible than others, and that will play a big role in whether this takes off in a big way. It's expected, according to a CDC risk assessment to still be detected by tests and medications like Paxlovid, are expected to can you continue to work against this variant. But what the concern is, is that it is so different from previous variants that existing immunity in terms of previous infection or vaccines may not be able to work quite as well against this variant. And so, will that lead to more infections, potentially more hospitalizations? Those are the questions that folks are wondering about right now. And they expect to have more data on that within the next couple of weeks. But at this point, this really has not been detected extremely widely, but it has been detected in multiple countries. So, it is expected that there is international spread.",
