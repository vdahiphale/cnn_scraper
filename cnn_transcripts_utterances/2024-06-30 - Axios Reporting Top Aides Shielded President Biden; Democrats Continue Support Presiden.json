Multiple sources tell CNN the meeting was planned a long time ago for a photo shoot and it is not some kind of emergency gathering to discuss the future of his campaign.But it has new significance in light of growing calls for the president to exit the race after Thursday's alarming debate performance. And now there's new polling that suggests voters' concerns are growing about the president's fitness for office. One of the burning questions since the debate is how much did President Biden's inner circle know about his apparent frailty before Thursday night. \"Axios\" has new reporting that President Biden's closest aides have shielded him for years from the wider staff. Alex Thompson is the national political correspondent with \"Axios\" with this new reporting and he joins us now. Alex thanks so much for making time. Can you explain how these aides have been shielding or protecting the president?",

You know, his core team is really not bigger than about 12 people. And you know this was really the instinct of two of his top aides.They're sort of you know very nondescriptive names Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini. And their task was really made easier at the very beginning because of COVID. And so keeping a really tight circle around the president was just sort of built in as a practice but then over time those habits continued.",

There is no way -- in the minds of a lot of people in the White House they are both sad because how this could affect the election. They're sad for him because it's great affection for him.But they're also angry because they feel that this side of Joe Biden must have been known to at least some of his close aides and they hid that part of it not just from them but you know from potentially from voters and from Democrats and from donors.",

And I think you know the fact that they've let him debate is, you know, sort of what's also driving this anger. If they even knew that this sort of Joe Biden was gonna show up, even if it was a possibility, you know, I think there's a lot of anger within Biden world that any of the close aides let him go on stage just because of the election, because of how this could affect his legacy. And you know I would also say part of the reason that Joe Biden debated is because Joe Biden wanted to debate. I can tell you behind closed doors Joe Biden has always often says I feel so much younger than my age. Joe Biden has a little bit of, you know, what I've report on his denialism about how old he is and how old he can come across. So, I think it was probably a combination of the fact that Joe Biden really wanted to debate and then the people around him were like, well he's fine.

So, you know, you'll notice that the president usually if he has a public event on camera, it's usually between the hours of 10You'll notice that whenever he's traveling abroad or whenever he's having, you know, a really late rally or even a really late fundraiser, you know, just even going through the White House transcripts you can see that they have to correct his words a lot and he can meander, you know. I think of, you know, one particular fundraiser just last September in New York when Joe Biden repeated the Charlottesville story that he's often told about deciding to run. He basically told the same story word-for-word just a few minutes apart. And then just at a recent rally in Detroit it was a late Sunday night, the White House transcription office had to correct the president's own words nine times. And so basically, what aides have told me is that he is just like he's solid between the hours of 10:00 to 4:00 but he often makes more mistakes he can ramble beyond those hours. And there's a reason why he doesn't have many public events before 10:00. There is a reason he doesn't have many public events on camera after 4:00. And it's for that reason the limitations of his age and how the White House is adapted around them.",

Senior staff will always err on the side of protecting their principal.I think what is really important here, Alisyn, is what is the Biden campaign and the Biden family going to do now. And what we have seen and this I think is relevant reporting is that the Biden campaign and President Biden himself is calling allies, calling supporters, calling donors, he did the rally on Friday which, you know, he was -- it was a night and day difference between the guy who showed up on Thursday and what he did on Friday. He's reassuring people that he is committed to staying in. He is committed to winning. They understand that there is a lot of damage control that needs to be done and they are committed to doing it. And the other important thing here is, Alisyn, in terms of the recent numbers that come out right after the debate, the race substantially has not really shifted and the focus on Joe Biden has left no focus for what needs to be a focus on Donald Trump and what he said during the debate.",

I looked at the polls this morning, the CBS-YouGov poll, I mean people thought he won the debate 56 to 16, which was even a wider margin than the snap poll that CNN conducted on Thursday night.The truth is Donald Trump just needed to deliver a simple message on inflation, immigration and Afghanistan and he did that. And by the way, one of the most and only one of the only coherent statements that Joe Biden delivered during the debate was when he claimed that not a single U.S. soldier had died while he's been commander-in-chief.

That is the second highest level of alert for threat level that the U.S. military has.Here is how the US Army defines force protection condition Charlie. The Army says it applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. Now, it's not just these two U.S. officials saying this. The Army garrison in Bavaria which encompasses several locations has on its website that it's gone to force protection condition Charlie and then a number of military facilities throughout Europe have pointed out that there is an elevated level of risk and elevated threat level and to remain vigilant. Now, it's unclear if this is a specific threat against one or a number of facilities or if it's more of a general threat at this point. It is worth pointing out that in Germany, they're currently hosting the European football championships, in Paris they're getting ready both for the Olympics and the Tour de France. So these are large gatherings that can frankly make attractive targets. We have seen both German and French officials warn of the elevated threat levels around this in fact since March, according to the U.S. Embassy in Paris. France has been at its highest alert level and the embassy there warns of going towards large gatherings of people, which is of course exactly what the Olympics is. So we'll keep an eye on this Alisyn and see which way this goes and what more we can learn about the threat itself.",

This makes it the earliest Category 4 hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic. Hurricane warnings are in effect for several eastern Caribbean islands.Joining us now is Michael Brennan, director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center. So, Michael, where is the storm headed right now? MICHAEL BRENNAN, DIRECTOR, NOAA's NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER: Well, right now, it's moving very quickly to the west-northwest towards the Windward islands. We're very concerned about this area here between St. Vincent and the Grenadines down to Grenada. That's the area that's most likely to experience that, you know, eyewall of Beryl, that we can see the very well-defined eye and satellite imagery. That's where we have those, you know, very strong 130 mile per hour winds. That's where we're going to see that very catastrophic storm surge moving through portions of the Windward islands over -- starting overnight tonight and through Monday morning. CAMEROTA: So, Michael, when you were on yesterday and we were talking the projections, were then that it could strengthen into a Cat 3. Are you surprised by how quickly it has intensified?",
