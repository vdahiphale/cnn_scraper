But that sense of on the ground and that - that terrain, that desert, gives you some perspective on where we stand right now.Just moments ago we did hear from the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is at the Rafah border crossing on the Egyptian side. So, he is there. You've got a U.N. compound on the other side where we know people are better supplied than most places, but still with dwindling, dwindling supplies. And, of course, he's standing where all those trucks loaded with aid are waiting to enter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: Behind these walls we have 2 million people that is suffering enormously. So, these trucks are not just trucks. They are a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza. What we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall, to make them move as quickly as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are expected to enter once the crossing opens. The United Nations is saying that it needs, though, 100 trucks a day to provide adequate aid to the people inside Gaza. Twenty trucks right now and they need 100 a day. This comes as Gaza's main medical facility is in danger of running out of fuel within hours. No fuel has been coming into Gaza now for days. And, of course, to run a generator, you need fuel. All of that is now running out. Doctors Without Borders said yesterday that the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City only had enough fuel to run its generators for 24 more hours. That hospital is one of the few places in Gaza that actually even has electricity, for now. And on that front, you know, we have been getting dispatches from people inside Gaza, daily, and, you know, they -- we get these small clips and they cut out because of the phone connections because they don't have the power. Our journalist Ibrahim Dahman escaped northern Gaza in the south with his wife and two sons. He's been filing these dispatches for \"OUT FRONT\" every night.

AVRIL BENOIT, U.S. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS: Yes. Erin, we are really beside ourselves because we often lose contact with them, as you mentioned, with the lack of electricity, the inability to charge phones, cell signals often being cut out. Very difficult to get real time information from the team. And what we do know is that our medical coordinator was warning that the fuel was reaching catastrophic lows. And, of course, they will ration. They will try to stretch it out as much as possible because you need that fuel to run generators for the life-saving medical equipment, including incubators for neonates, dialysis machines and just - just general functioning for all the trauma surgeries that they're trying to do.",

It's essential for life.We also need, of course, medicines, because the hospitals have empty shelves at this point. They have consumed what was available and other places where you might have some stocks they're too dangerous to be able to - to go between and bring the supplies in. And this is one of the most critical issues. So, those trucks that are waiting to be able to bring in the life- saving supplies, we really implore that - that the shortages are going to kill many, many people. It's absolutely life or death at this point. Hour by hour it's - it's essential for that - for that humanitarian assistance to be able to be brought in. And, of course, we're deeply concerned with everyone for - for the fate of everyone who happens to be in Gaza right now where nowhere is safe, there's constant bombardment, even in the areas that are purported to be safe, and you have a lot of people with international passports that are as desperate as others to find some safety and hopefully be able to leave securely.",

And when they were captured and murdered. And that's - I think that resembles Israel. If you go around Israel now, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, everywhere, you will see Jews and Arabs walking around even hugging each other. We are all together against the Hamas here. We know -- and I think the world now realizes that the Hamas are not freedom fighters. They're not interested in having their own state. They want to destroy and kill everyone here in Israel. They want to kill our baby. They want to kill our animals. I saw it in my own eyes. I went into the homes of, unfortunately, people who were murdered. Children were chopped up to pieces. And not only that, but they killed our children, they killed old people, Holocaust survivors that they murdered and tortured. They also did a lot of terrible things to animals. They killed animals. They shot - I saw one dog shot 15 times. Why do you shoot a dog 15 times? What's the purpose? And I think the reason they all did this is not to fight for freedom, but to destroy Israel.

They handle everything, from family law, to civil, criminal, juvenile stuff. So, it is possible that there was somebody, former defendant, current defendant, that this judge was dealing with that targeted him. Details on the scene are very sketchy right now. It was his home. Police responded -- or law enforcement responded to reports of shots fired. They showed up in his own driveway, multiple gunshots. He died later at the hospital. And now a full investigation is underway. Troopers in Maryland are now going to other judges, out of an abundance of caution, to make sure that other judges are protected.
