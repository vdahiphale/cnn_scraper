A powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake has rocked the county. And minutes ago the death toll jumped to 1300. This is the moment the earthquake struck. The initial panic has given way to new fears. Strong aftershocks are expected threatening damaged buildings and adding to the number of injured. CNN's Sam Kiley joins us from Marrakech. Sam, I understand it's about 9:00 p.m. there. How are the recovery efforts going?",

And you can see the remains, the glorious remains of its past, and now here is much of its present.This devastating earthquake killed 13 people here in Marrakech. Mostly here in the Medina because the city is ancient, and it is very tightly packed. There are buildings here that if there's another quake that have riven already by cracks, Jim, that could come down. But elsewhere in the country things have been even worse, Jim, with 13 people, as I say, killed here Marrakech, 1300 as you reported there across the country. That figure is expected to climb because in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains where the devastation was most keenly felt, there are whole villages, Jim, that have been destroyed, utterly flattened. We've seen that in pictures coming in to us from the authorities and from the local media. And it's those areas that the government is desperately trying to get to. Now the king of Morocco Mohammed has declared three days of national mourning. The whole country is being mobilized to try to cope with this, but it's coming at a time when there have been very serious aftershocks, particularly south of the city. If you look here up through here, this is a building that has collapsed from within. I'm standing on what was up there. That black hole there is the sky, Jim. The whole thing just plummeted down and landed under where I'm standing. Now there is a fear, of course, that these walls could collapse in further. So as a result of that, this major tourist destination here in the Medina is being evacuated. Large numbers of tourists are being moved out of this Medina, and that's for their own safety. So far it's kind of on the edge of feeling like a ghost town, and of course a little bit frightening every time there's a fall of dust or rubble. But that wasn't enough to shock -- it was just me being a little jumpy, Jim.",

People have been flooding into open spaces. There is, of course, a pressing need with the government mobilizing to find them accommodation, temporary accommodation being set up, tents and so on. But the main effort is to get out into those Atlas Mountains where the death toll is much higher.Jim, a lot of the access there is almost impossible because the earthquake has broken the roads. There have been landfalls across the roads. Entire villages are reported to have pretty much slid down hills with total devastation of those environments. A lot of these accessible only by air, and that is really where the main effort of the government is being put at the moment. But elsewhere in this city, there is much reduced presence of people, but in the safer areas, particularly in the big, open squares, where nothing can fall in on people, there are still people trying to sell vegetables, there's still people having a cup of sweet tea, and trying to -- particularly tourists -- trying to get on with their holiday.

In the end, Ukraine did come up early on in this joint statement, but it did stop short of condemning Russia, instead talking about the fact that no state should be allowed to threaten or use force against another state to acquire its territory, saying that the use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.Another statement that was in there was that, quote, \"We welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine.\" The Biden administration, top officials have been saying that they're happy with this kind of wording. One country that is not, one government, is Ukraine. Last year at the G20 Summit in Bali the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he was beamed in and addressed the gathering. He was not invited to this one. And a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry in Ukraine has come out with a statement saying that it's grateful to countries and its allies who supported it, but then going on to say, quote, \"At the same time the G20 has nothing to be proud of in the part about Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Obviously the participation of the Ukrainian side would have allowed the participants to better understand the situation, the principle of nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine remains as key as ever.\" Beyond the Ukraine issue, there were other areas of agreement, Jim.
