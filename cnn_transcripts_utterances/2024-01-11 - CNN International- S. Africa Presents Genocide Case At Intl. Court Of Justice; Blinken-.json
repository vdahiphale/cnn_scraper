It could take years for the International Court of Justice, just behind me, to rule on that question, Max. But, the immediate question before it, that is at the heart of the hearings, the one today from South Africa, the one that you hear tomorrow in Israel's defense, is about the provisional measures that South Africa has asked for that it wants the ICJ to tell Israel to suspend its military campaign urgently, while the more substantive question of whether genocidal acts have been a part of what it's done or what is doing can be considered by the court. And it was extremely sobering testimony that we heard here inside thecourt today, laid out forensically. And this was very much at the heart of South Africa's idea. We spoke to their justice ministry yesterday about their intention here. It was to lay out before the court and of course through it, Max, to world opinion the facts of what had gone on in Gaza so far. We heard several of their barristers speak, beginning by their senior counsel who began proceedings by really laying out forensically what had happened over the course of the last three months. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADILA HASSIM, SOUTH AFRICA'S SENIOR COUNSEL: In the first three weeks alone, following October 7, Israel deployed 6,000 bombs per week. At least 200 times it has deployed 2,000 pound bombs in southern areas of Palestine designated as safe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Coinciding with that hearing, America's top diplomat says in hiswords, creating a path to a Palestinian state is the best way to isolate Iran. The U.S. Secretary of State has been meeting with Egypt's President in Cairo, part of Antony Blinken's urgent mission aimed at preventing the Israel-Hamas war from spreading. Blinken is heading back to Washington after a flurry of meetings with leaders across the Middle East. You'll know from watching this program that the Biden White House is looking for a path which leads to -- leads the way out of bloodshed in Gaza. CNN's Paula Hancocks is monitoring all these developments from Abu Dhabi. She joins us now live. What do you think is the achievement of this trip and the impact it made?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, we heard from the Secretary of State himself saying that the main goals were to prevent the civilian loss of life that has been so significantly high in Gaza, and also to make sure that more humanitarian aid was allowed in. At the same time, he wanted to push for the hostages, Israeli, American and other nationalities still being held in Gaza to be released.Now, one thing that he has just spoken to reporters before getting on the plane and leaving Egypt, he believes was achieved was that during this particular trip, those in the region were finally willing to talk about the day after, to talk about once the Israeli military pulls out of Gaza, and pushing for that Palestinian state. Now, we know that it's something that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been willing to talk about or to even entertain in recent years. But, he has been hammering home the point that he has heard from other Arab nations in the region that there could potentially be some deals done or there could be a more secure future for Israel if there was a Palestinian state. Now, of course, the devil is in the detail. He did point out that that is going to be extremely difficult for all. And also, we are still hearing of the dire situation in Gaza, the WHO talking about the horrific food situation. So, even at the same time as the U.S. Secretary of State is calling for more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, it is simply not happening. The WHO speaking of the difficulties due to the Israeli bombardment, due to the restrictions in movement, pointing out one drugstore and hospital in the northern part of Gaza that they have tried to deliver desperately needed fuel and medical supplies to, has been denied by Israel, saying that it's the fifth time since the end of December that they have been denied to get to this area to give much needed medical supplies. So, even as the U.S. Secretary of State says he wants more humanitarian aid to get in, the reality on the ground is different.",

We saw him in a video link yesterday at a different court, protesting a different element of his own detention. Today, it was general rules governing prisoners. But, he brings these various different cases as a sign, one, to show that he is not cowed, not deterred, despite the fact that he is now been banished beyond the Arctic Circle by the Russian authorities, and secondly, to expose the ills, the abuses, as he sees it at the Russian justice system, to show that the conditions that he is facing are as they are.And we did get a lot of sort of color on that today from his appearance. He got a significant platform. He was able to do a lot of talking. He talked there about the need for newspapers to keep warm. We know that in the place where he is, in the Russian region of Yamalo, it can go well below minus 30 Celsius regularly at this time of year. We know that he talks about the other complaint, is the amount of time he gets to eat. He says he gets 10 minutes, which when you're dealing with bread, and he said boiling water, turns something that might have otherwise been a pleasant experience into something hellish. This on top of what we already know from social media posts on his channel this week that he is back in a punishment cell. That's essentially a very strict form of solitary confinement. This is the 24th time, according to his team, he spent some 273 days there. So, all of this is designed to keep him in the headlines, to keep shedding light on what's going on here. And all of this, of course, leading up to the Russian elections. His team, his aides have said there is no coincidence at all here. This is why they say he has been sent to Siberia. This is why the pressure on him is stepping up. He, as I said, is keen to show that he is not deterred.",

That's according to an EU official who says that Trump made those remarks to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen back in 2020. Trump, who was U.S. President at the time, also reportedly said NATO is dead, according to the same official who was at the meeting. The Biden campaign said the report is proof that Trump is more interested in cozying up to dictators than protecting America's place in the global stage.Donald Trump is expected to attend closing arguments in his civil fraud trial in New York in just a couple of hours. But, the judge says, since he didn't agree to follow the court's rules, he won't be allowed to make a statement. The New York Attorney General is seeking $370 million in damages, and a ban on Trump doing business in the state. The former President has already been found liable for fraud. The judge now considering damages. CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the courthouse in New York for us. Do we know what he is coming and what he expects to get from it? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. I mean, listen, Max, he has been at this trial several times throughout the two and a half months. And certainly, he wanted to make some closing arguments, which would be unusual for a defendant to do in any trial. But, there was, according to court, paperwork back and forth between Trump's attorneys and the judge, in this case, trying to discuss the terms of how those closing arguments could go for the former President if he were to speak. And ultimately, the judge said that they didn't agree to those terms. And so, he doesn't expect the former President to speak for closing arguments. Of course, we do fully expect him to talk outside the courtroom, as he has done many times when he does come to this trial. But, listen, both sides, these are the closing arguments. The state's attorneys are going to have two hours to present its final -- finality of this case, and the defense is going to have the same amount as time -- uptime as well. And we expect much of the same arguments that we saw in those two and a half months of trial that included, of course, high-profile witnesses like the Trump children, gag orders and such. The state's attorneys arguing that the Trumps inflated the values of some of their assets in order to get better business loan and interest rates. And the defense essentially saying that they were just doing business as usual in the real estate markets here in New York, and saying there is really no victims in this case. So, how is it that the State's Attorney's Office is going to ask for $370 million recouped back to the state? So, we'll see how those arguments go. But, essentially, we don't expect any sort of decision by the judge who will determine damages, as you said, until the end of this month. But, we are waiting for the former President to come. The court doesn't get started until about 10 o'clock this morning. He usually gets here about 9:30. So, he should be here shortly. Max.",

Listen, the President has taken every opportunity in these trials to basically say these are witch hunts to come against his moves for the presidency later in this election, later this year. It's no different for this trial. That's why he has showed up so many times while this trial was going on at the end of last year, and we don't expect anything different today. We expect, when he does go to the cameras outside the courtroom, he will use the same arguments that he has been that this trial is just one facet of states coming after him, trying to disrupt his campaign. And we know that he does profit off of these speeches that he gives outside these trials.So, certainly, there is no doubt that this is his purpose for coming today because he is coming voluntarily. He does not need to be here for these closing arguments. So, we will see how that goes later today. We'll actually see if he does speak in court. It's very unclear, but it doesn't appear he will.",

Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are making their case to voters in Iowa with just days to go before the Iowa caucuses. And though they both called out Trump for skipping the debate, they saved most of their harshest criticism for each other. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will build a wall. We will actually have Mexico pay for it in the way that I thought that Donald Trump was. We're going to charge fees on remittances that workers send to foreign countries, billions of dollars. We will build a wall. He also promised record deportations. Donald Trump deported fewer people than Barack Obama did when he was President. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Dictators always say, always do what they say they're going to do. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. They did. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. We watched it. China says Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries, and that puts America at war. This is about preventing war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
