Just ahead, China ends three days of military drills around the island of Taiwan testing military capabilities under actual fighting conditions then potential damage to America's reputation and intelligence operations.U.S. Officials have opened an investigation into how highly classified documents appeared online. And nearly four years after the horrendous fire that devastated Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, CNN meets the carpenters on a mission to restore one of France's most iconic landmarks. China has wrapped up its three-day military exercise near Taiwan after appearing to have carried out an aerial and naval blockade. The drills follow a meeting between Taiwan's President and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week. Taiwan says it has no intention of escalating the situation. But its Foreign Ministry is demanding Beijing \"exercise reason and self-restraint\". The increased tensions have some residents on edge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now this meeting between Tsai and McCarthy was held on American soil and that was done purposefully to avoid overly provoking Beijing. And also important here is that experts say Beijing has been normalizing military activity around Taiwan. Beijing already sends military jets and ships around Taiwan every day. The U.S. does not officially recognize Taiwan as a country but unofficial ties have been growing and that infuriates Beijing. So this kind of military intimidation of Taiwan is here to stay.",

South Korea says it will hold necessary discussions with the U.S. after the documents revealed a conversation between two senior South Korean National Security Officials.The U.S. says an inter-agency effort is underway to determine the impact of the League, which could provide rare and critical insight into Washington's intelligence tactics as well as key information about the war in Ukraine. For more now, let's go to Natasha Bertrand who is live from the Pentagon. Natasha, this is obviously very concerning for U.S. intelligence in terms of where the leak came from, and if they can expect further documents to leak, but what sort of issues of trust and operational difficulties? Is this creating for America's allies? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Bianca, as you said, the Pentagon still doesn't know for sure whether we are seeing the full extent of the documents that have been leaked online. What we have seen is that a lot of these documents were posted, at least within the last month, if not longer. And there are about 50 of them that CNN has reviewed and all of them appear to contain secret information, highly classified information, some even up to the level of top secret and they describe conversations essentially that the U.S. has been eavesdropping on with regard to allies like Israel, South Korea and even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now some of these conversations, they do detail, very sensitive kind of accusations what the U.S. has accused the Mossad (ph) of doing for example, the CIA says that they intercepted communications from Israeli Intelligence Officials describing efforts to - on protesters in Israel something that the Mossad has vigorously denied just over the last day or so. So already causing some friction between the U.S. and its allies as you mentioned there, South Korea is going to be having discussions with the U.S. about the conversation that the U.S. apparently eavesdropped on with regard to U.S. requests for ammunition from South Korea. So this is going to be a major issue moving forward as they assess really what damage has been caused by the leak of these documents that appeared on a social media site called discord again within the last month. Now we're also learning a lot more in these documents about the depth and the level of the penetration that the U.S. has in terms of intelligence of the Russian Defense Ministry as well as the Russian mercenary organization, the Wagner group. Things like the exact precise targeting plans of the Russians against Ukrainian infrastructure, conversations that Wagner group Officials have had with Russian Defense Ministry Officials. So a lot here that could compromise sources and methods and that is why U.S. Officials are taking this very seriously. Some of those sources and methods could now go dark, because allies as well as enemies now have a better sense of what the U.S. is doing, Bianca.",

When Ukrainian Official insists the online documents are full of fictitious information. Nick Paton Walsh has the latest from Kyiv for us. [08:10:00] Nick, you know, as I was just describing, this is a slightly mixed picture in terms of what operational significance these leaks might have if some are indeed fictitious.

      "sentences": "I mean, look at its enormously confusing picture and I think it's important to remember the timing here. This glut of information be accurate or misleading, depending on who you listen to is emerging matter of days possibly ahead of expected Ukrainian counter offensive.So it could be enormously damaging to that possibly, or it could also at the same time be exceptionally confusing and cause great anxiety amongst the ranks of Russian officers who are already seeing their forces depleted already know that the Americans who knew almost down to the hour when the offensive was going to begin way back last year. And are clearly eavesdropping very well across Russian Officials communications for some time that will of course be causing them to assess exactly what they can trust as they try and talk to each other. We've now heard Ukrainian Officials saying that some of the versions of documents online have been altered. We've heard that on a number of occasions. Now, since their emergence, clearly day after day, more documents appear to be emerging slowly that appear to show yet more sensitive information too some of it older than perhaps might be currently useful in this particular month. But it's important to remember here too, I think that they may, possibly in some way, a part of this be a bit to leave the Russians off guard to perhaps cause them to rethink some of their current precepts about how Ukraine is performing or where Ukraine's weaknesses be. But it also too will, I'm sure, make Russians deeply concerned about how penetrated their own intelligence services are at this particular point. It may be very hard to get to the bottom exactly how much of the information has been placed in public remember, oddly, on a gaming website. This is not necessarily it seems something that's emerged into the hands of somebody who thought right, well, I'll give this to the Russian intelligence services. He put it on a gaming website; they put it on a gaming website. So that's important to put in context as well. So a lot here that we don't know U.S. Officials to very vocal about how distressing they're finding these leaks. I personally find that odd, you might expect the government to use found is classified information to be leaked to try and play that down or suggest some of its outdated or incorrect or highly sophisticated fakes. But instead, we're being very clearly told this is a problem and the timing of it too very interesting indeed. Particularly here in Ukraine where day by day people are waiting for exactly when this long planned counter offensive main deep again and all this information plays very much into that, Bianca. NOBILO: Nick Paton Walsh in Kyiv, thank you. A Palestinian teenager has been shot and killed by Israeli forces during an IDF operation at a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. You can see part of that rate in this video Israeli forces say they were at the camp to apprehend a terrorist suspect and that they were met by violent riots. The incident comes a day after thousands gathered peacefully in Jerusalem to mark various religious holidays. Jewish worshippers came together the Western worn Sunday for a traditional priestly blessing. And later on in the day, some 25,000 Muslims took part in nightly prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Tensions in Jerusalem have remained high after Israeli forces stormed that mosque last week one of Islam's holiest sites. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins me now from Jerusalem. Salma, what is the mood like now? Obviously, there's a sense of it being a true political tinderbox from the violence and the loss of life over the last week. Are there efforts being made to stabilize the situation?",
