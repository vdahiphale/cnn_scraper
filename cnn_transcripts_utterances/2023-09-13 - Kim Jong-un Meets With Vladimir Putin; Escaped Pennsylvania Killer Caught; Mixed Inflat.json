The intense polarization in Washington is about to get supercharged. Congress has less than three weeks to avert a government shutdown, but the Republicans' Biden probe has further inflamed partisan tensions; 24 hours after McCarthy's announcement, the White House is fighting back, and the Biden campaign is fund-raising off the move, as Republicans are divided. Some think this is a distraction, while others believe the House speaker has not gone far enough. McCarthy held a meeting with the Republican Caucus this morning, trying to get everyone on the same page. Let's get you all angles of this story, starting with CNN's Kayla Tausche at the White House and Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. So, Kayla, what should we expect from this White House briefing? KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we know, Boris, at the White House briefing, the press secretary, will be joined by the national security spokesman, Admiral John Kirby, and Jared Bernstein, who's the White House's chief economist. They're expected to talk about the meeting taking place between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, and Bernstein is expected to talk about perhaps inflation numbers, which have been seen rising for two months in a row, after softening over the summer. The fact that the White House is talking about inflation and geopolitics at a time when this impeachment inquiry is reaching a fever pitch tells you how much they do not want to talk about that, even as the White House has been actively shifting from defensive mode, which it's been in for the better part of two years, preparing, battening down the hatches, as Republicans ramped up their oversight and investigations, and are now looking to shift into offense mode. With Ian Sams, the White House's spokesman on investigations, calling this inquiry illegitimate. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we can disentangle this language further. He didn't just say $20 million to Biden family members. He said $20 million to Biden family members and associates.

That is slightly higher than the 3.6 percent that economists have been expecting. And it is just over half-a- percent increase from July, which is the biggest monthly rise of the year. Rising energy prices fueling most of the jump here, rising 5.6 percent, gasoline alone surging more than 10.5 percent, shelter costs up 0.3 percent. It sounds small, but it does make up about a third of the CPI weighting here, so it has a big impact. There was one bright spot, and that is used cars and truck prices, which I'm sure you noticed had been getting a little out of control. That dropped 1.2 percent. Markets not really too phased by it all, the Dow right now up a little more than 20 points. Let's discuss this now with Justin Wolfers. He is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. All right, Justin, these latest numbers that we went through, they show inflation pressures are slowly subsiding, but then you have this high housing and the gas prices. They're still making it feel pretty tough. Is this why President Biden's economic message is not resonating with the public as much as he would hope that it would?",

The bad news is that prices had been rising pretty quickly for the past couple of years. But when you get to turning points in the economy, it's important to be looking at the freshest data, what's happening in the most recent months. And so when you say inflation rose at 3.7 percent over the past year, that tells us a lot about what was happening six months ago, nine months ago, 12 months ago. Let's focus instead on the past three months. And you have seen -- I remember, three months ago, we talked about it. We got a really good low number. Last month, we got another really good low number. And, in fact, we got another really good low number today. And so if you put those three numbers together, there's a lot of cause for optimism.

And we have seen wage growth actually start to outstrip inflation over the past couple of months. And if that keeps up, that's really going to help people. Two, there's how much interest you have to pay your bank. And interest rates right now really are dramatically higher than we have seen in quite a long time. A lot of that has to do with the Fed. And, hopefully, once we get inflation, under control, the Fed can take its foot off that break and let interest rates fall a little bit more. But the third thing that really matters for housing costs is, how much does the house itself cost? House prices rose dramatically in the post pandemic period, but, in fact, house prices have come down. House price growth has come down quite a bit and it's flatlining.

We moved a little bit down the road from where we were earlier at the northern -- the northeastern edge of the police perimeter that had been in place for more than 24 hours. Now we're in the spot along Pottstown Pike, where Cavalcante was captured. Just in this wooden area behind me, that's where Cavalcante's 14-day escape from prison finally came to an end. So let me talk about that timeline, though, Boris, and get to that burglary, which, as I said, really kicked off the end of this manhunt. So, according to Lieutenant George Bivens with the Pennsylvania State Police, this all started last night just a little after midnight. That's when a burglary alarm pretty close to where we are right now went off. And it brought a lot of resources to the area. Pennsylvania State Police said tactical teams really swarmed this area of Chester County to try and find Cavalcante. Then they weren't able to find him, but they got some help from above. An aerial team at around 1:00 a.m., as you said, picked up heat signals. It was actually a DEA fixed-wing airplane that was flying over. They picked up heat signals that they believed was Cavalcante. Tactical teams began to come in once again, but then this large storm hit. Lieutenant Colonel Bivens said there was lightning in the area. It forced all of those aerial assets to go back and land for safety. But then, according to Pennsylvania State Police, this team made a decision to stay in the area. They found Cavalcante in the woods behind us. And then take a listen to what Bivens said happened next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  He began to crawl through thick underbrush, taking his rifle with him as he went. One of the Customs and Border Patrol teams, BORTAC, had a dog with them.

There's been no deals signed.There wasn't even a press conference, a news conference at the end of the meeting today.

We don't even know how long Kim Jong-un is going to stay in the country for. We know he's got a few more engagements in the far east of Russia, but he's going everywhere by train. And so we don't know how long it takes him to get to various places and then make his way back out of the country. But make no mistake. I mean, North Korea definitely wants that rocket technology. It wants satellite technology. It's tried repeatedly to launch spy satellite and failed over the past couple of months. Russia could really help with that.
