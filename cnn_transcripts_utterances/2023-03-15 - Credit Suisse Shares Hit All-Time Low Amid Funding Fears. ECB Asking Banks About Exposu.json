Dow Jones is losing about 300 points on the back of panic spreading in the banking sector. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events: Swiss regulators step in to try and calm fears of the health of Credit Suisse. The UK Chancellor tries to keep his budget drama-free. And Hogwarts heads to Tokyo. Live from Dubai, it is Wednesday, March 15th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I am in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. Great of you to join us. Tonight Swiss regulators say they are prepared to step in as troubles at Credit Suisse revive fears of a banking crisis. Shares in the bank closed down 24 percent in Zurich hitting an all-time low. The selloff came after the largest shareholders said it would not add to its investment. That comments rattled investors already on edge by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Stocks fell sharply in Europe; and in the US, they've recovered some of their losses on Wall Street after the Swiss National Bank said it will provide Credit Suisse with liquidity, if needed. Anna Stewart is in London for us. We've just heard from the Swiss National Bank and also FINMA, the supervisory authority. It was important to get some kind of comment and interesting to see that they say the capital adequacy ratios are where they're supposed to be for a systemically important bank.",

But as you say they say they meet the capital liquidity requirements, Credit Suisse, that is, but they say if necessary, the Swiss National Bank will provide Credit Suisse with liquidity. So it really is trying to draw a line under what has been a seriously tumultuous day for this bank. At one point, share price falling below 30 percent. We saw it well under the $2.00 barrier. I never thought I'd quite see that. And for Credit Suisse, Eleni as you know, it is really issues compounded. There's the issue of Credit Suisse undergoing a huge restructure, and has faced for the last two years every kind of scandal, issue of risk management and corporate governance you can imagine including even this week, failures over its financial reporting. It cited weaknesses in past years. And then you've got the issue that spread from Silicon Valley Bank, when it comes to what these banks all have on their balance sheets, and particularly those long-dated government bonds and what that means for their balance sheets -- Eleni.",

The timing is not good right now. The ECB is making its rate decision tomorrow. Now up to this point, the expectation has been for a half a percentage point increase. And from what I'm hearing, that will still go ahead, but this is the first of the major Central Banks that now has to brace with the issue of not just economic slowdown on the one hand and inflation on the other, but chucked into it, financial stability, because the interest rate rises are really a huge problem now looking at these bank balance sheets. It was sparked by Silicon Valley Bank, but clearly the ramifications of that have really spread in terms of investor confidence. Whatever happens tomorrow in terms of the rate rise, I think whatever is said in that press conference, following it by Christine Lagarde will be critical really as to where we see some of the share prices going for the rest of the week.",

And frankly, Eleni, with Credit Suisse, in terms of patience, in terms of the investors, this bank hasn't had any kind of break when it's come to bad news, and I'm not sure anyone really believes that it will have a break or whether the restructure is actually going to A., succeed and B., when is it going to be restructured?

More dominoes could fall leading to financial instability. Dan Gerard is a senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. He joins me now live from Boston. So great to see you. Warnings coming through from Larry Fink, and it is interesting to sort of take a step back and see that the banking sector has been enjoying super low interest rates, barely any inflation, easy money, and things have shifted dramatically here. Do you believe that there is possible contagion that we're not taking into consideration? DAN GERARD, SENIOR MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS:   Thanks, Eleni. Great to be here with you. Look, I do think there is possible contagion. There is always the risk of it, but I also think that the system is in pretty good health. I agree, it is too early to tell. That doesn't mean there is something out there waiting. It just means we need to sort through a lot of this first. But I think to the main point here, this isn't happening in a vacuum. Some of the volatility we're seeing in banking is directly due to the fact that we had a system that was pushing money in, a lot of money in through Central Banks, which then as we started to build up price pressures and inflation, reversed it, and banks happen to sit at that intersection between the real economy and financial markets.

We were just a week ago, we were looking at a higher terminal rate for much longer into 2024. That has just quickly reversed into cuts expectation this year. And all the while, inflation pressures still haven't been tamed and are nowhere near the goal of Central Banks. So the Fed the ECB, they continually need to look at that from a real economic perspective, and keep a grip on this without pushing banks into crisis and that is going to be a difficult balancing act, but I think that inflation still has to be the lens we view this through.",

I think that once calm prevails that we'll see that the system is actually pretty strong, but the beneficiaries to some of those runs on the regional banks, for example, have been the large banks.

And chief amongst them, what essentially give the Israeli Parliament, it would be whatever party is in power essentially, not only have the power to overturn Supreme Court decisions, but also more power over how Judges are selected. Now, there are many other elements to this massive section of bills that are part of these overall reforms, but the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, who actually has mostly a ceremonial role over the past few weeks has been trying to speak to all the different parties, speak to academics, and come forth with a compromise. Because as he acknowledged in his speech tonight, there are structural changes that he believes should actually be made. This was sort of a nod to Netanyahu's governing coalition. And he put forth this compromise, which I won't go into the details, because it's very long, but it does give the Parliament some more powers that they don't have, while still maintaining Supreme Court's ability to overturn certain laws, not all of them. It also changes the rigor of how certain laws that are the quasi constitutional basic laws would be passed. And it does give the political parties a little bit more say in how Judges are selected. But almost as soon as the Israeli President stopped speaking, we heard from the governing coalition, essentially rejecting the proposal. And actually just in the last few minutes, we heard from Benjamin Netanyahu who is taking off as we speak, to go to Berlin after delaying his trip not only because of the situation over the reforms, but also because of an ongoing security situation. And he essentially said that, unfortunately, what was presented by the President were not agreed upon by the coalition representatives and that key sections only he say, perpetuate the existing situation, and do not bring the required balance to the Israeli branches of government, and that's the unfortunate truth. So it seems as though we might just be back to square one because despite this proposal, which the President, the Israeli President said, should be taken as a whole and you can't cherry pick parts of it, the Israeli government, Benjamin Netanyahu is coming forth right away and saying thanks, but no thanks.",

But Eleni, what is interesting. I just got off the phone with a banking expert and I asked him what will it take to calm markets, even after this government intervention program here in the U.S. He said, it is going to be more government responses. How quickly do governments step up and how much do they do? And I said, what are you hearing? And he said, the next thing that might come. I mean, this will be pretty extreme. But if we get an announcement, it is something that they are considering. But if we get an announcement from the Treasury Department, from the FDIC, that they will insure all deposits.

In 2018, former president Trump signed a bipartisan law that watered down reforms enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama, after the global financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act was designed to make the financial system safer for consumers. Among those who lobbied to weaken it was SVB chief executive Greg Becker. Representative Gregory Meeks is a Democratic congressman from New York and is senior member of the House Financial Services Committee. He joins me now from Washington, D.C. Sir, great to see you. Everyone is asking what went wrong. What was the reason behind SVB's collapse? If the Dodd-Frank bill had not been watered down, SVP as well as Signature Bank would have been liable to conduct a lot more stress tests, perhaps something would have been seen far sooner. Red flag would have been noticed. Is that your perspective as well, that part of the reason here is a weakening of regulation? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY), RANKING MEMBER, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE:  Thank you for having me, first of all. But let me just say that, clearly the purpose -- there's a strong support for stress testing for all banks, even the regional and small banks, and doing it in a transparent way and in a public way. Why? Because that then keeps the confidence to the public that what is going on. And if something is going on, you can wind it down in a timely fashion. And so, clearly one of the issues that might have been the case here, and you have to look at all of the issues in the longer term, I think that stress testing is one. If we had kept the rules where it was, at the very least we would not be talking about it now. We would say that stress testing worked or didn't work. And the next thing that we need to look at doing. So you should always err I think on the side of caution when it comes to banks in that regard so the credibility and all of the banks is clear to the depositories. And that did not take place here. So now we have to have this conversation. It is something that must be looked at as we move forward.",

So I would hope that we look at additional regulation, stress testing, whether or not we need to raise the $250,000 protection on depositories, whether we should have the same system for single or individuals as opposed to small businesses, because that is what has been devastating with the SVB and signatory situation. That so many small businesses and companies were affected which could affect then the salaries of workers. And we don't have to happen.

The vast majority of the small and midsize regional banks are still strong because they have had diversified portfolios. Therefore they are not at risk of failure absent some kind of run because of panic. So we look at SVB, for example, all of their investment seems to be in one area. Here is where the testing could have come in handy, stress test, to see that they over invested in one area, making it not as secure, as opposed to having it diversified.",

I think maybe had anticipated a recession in the U.K. That has changed and it gave the chancellor a little bit of wiggle room to be able to play around with budgets. I want you to give me a sense of what you are feeling right now with the way that he has handled the money and whether this will have an impact on U.K.'s growth trajectory. YAEL SELFIN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, KPMG U.K.:  Well, I mean to start with the wiggle room, it's all dependent on the forecast. The economic environment has improved but there are still relatively optimistic, especially for next year but also in the medium term. So that wiggle room that is around 25 billion at the moment per year may prove to be a little bit smaller than that. And then in terms of what he is done on average, he is spending about 16 billion of that. Part of it is going on sheltering households in the short term for a little bit longer from the higher energy crisis. That's a bit extended but it is relatively not that much money, considering what he was projecting that he will need to spend years the energy crisis have gone down. It's another transit is going on, trying to bring more people to the labor market. It is quite possible he will be able to do some of it, bring some people. But it may not be that many. And we will still probably have a tight labor market in the U.K. going forward. And then he has done a little bit on business investment as well by creating a new capital allowance that is relatively generous but it is still temporary so that may not make a big difference in terms of the trend of business investment in the U.K. And it's also still limited to only capital so plants and machinery, nothing on intangible and on the type of investment that many businesses tend to make nowadays in normal, more modern economies.",

Generally, if you look at the squeeze on disposable incomes, there were other things that were also making seem relatively tight for households.
