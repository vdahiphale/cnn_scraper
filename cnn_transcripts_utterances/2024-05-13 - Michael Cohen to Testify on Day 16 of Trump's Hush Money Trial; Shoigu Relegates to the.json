Trump's former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen is expected to take the stand. And prosecutors say it's entirely possible they will rest their case by the end of the week.CNN's Zachary Cohen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZACHARY COHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Prosecutors in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to call a key witness to the stand on Monday. The testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump's one-time attorney and fixer, could make or break the Manhattan District Attorney's case against the former president. He's the only witness who will testify about Trump's involvement in both the alleged decision to pay adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep her from going public, about a past encounter with the former president ahead of the 2016 election, and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Now, tying Trump to both the decision to pay Daniels and the reimbursement is critical for prosecutors who are seeking to prove Trump allegedly falsified business records to keep Daniels quiet. Now, the jurors have already heard a lot about Cohen from other witnesses who have testified over the last three weeks, and most of it has been unflattering. Trump's defense attorneys will likely try to further undercut Cohen's credibility during what is sure to be a tense cross-examination. Prosecutors, meanwhile, have tried to lay the groundwork for Cohen's testimony by introducing documents, including emails and texts they say back up his version of events. Ultimately, the case could come down to whether or not the jury finds Cohen's testimony credible, or if Trump's attorneys are able to convince them otherwise. Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington.

Campaign finance violations having to deal with Donald Trump. So it was crucial for the prosecution to bring out the corroboration from other witnesses, bringing out the phone records, bringing that crucial bank statement where Alan Weisselberg wrote out in detail how the payment was going to be reimbursed to Michael Cohen.

However, when it comes to a defendant testifying, the only person that can make that decision is the defendant, is Donald Trump. That is the sole decision of Donald Trump.In fact, Judge Merchan, at the end of the trial, will turn to Donald Trump and ask him whether he wishes to testify and whether he had enough opportunity to determine whether he wanted to testify or not. It's highly unlikely he's going to testify because of the prior rulings by the judge where he will be allowed to be cross-examined, having to deal with the two cases, having to deal with E. Jean Carroll, having to deal with the New York Attorney General's case, having to deal with the fines that he received from Judge Engoron, the $5,000 and the $10,000 for not abiding by a court order. So it's just subject to so much cross-examination and he's just not a good witness and you can't control him. So I think a jury is not going to take him likely.

They are often publicly at odds with one another, but they agree here on the scale of the exodus. 300,000 people have left Rafah in the last week or so. Where they disagree is on the safety of where they're actually going. The head of UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, saidthat the idea of safe zones, in his words, is false and misleading because no place is safe in Gaza. Israel is sending people to an area along the coast it's calling a humanitarian zone. The area is called al-Mawasi. People are pitching tents there, but there is very little in the way of infrastructure to support that volume of people. There is also very little aid getting into southern Gaza at this point. There have been some disagreements on precisely how many trucks have gotten through, but no one is claiming that it is a lot. In fact, UNRWA, the World Food Program, say that they are at risk of running out of food very soon if more isn't allowed in. The streets of Rafah are also looking increasingly bare, but according to our CNN stringer on the ground, there's a lot of people who will tell you that they are either unwilling or unable to leave because of sickness or exhaustion. Case in point, one elderly man who spoke to CNN said that he had initially decided to stay put in Rafah and then changed his mind to be with his wife and his daughter, but he has no money for a car. They're very expensive right now in Rafah given the scarcity of them. And so he's going there on foot, but to add insult to injury on his way there, what little he had, a change of clothes and some food was robbed. He was robbed of that. Other people doubt the safety of that al-Mawassi humanitarian zone, as Israel is calling it, saying that Israel could strike there anyways. Here's what one man told Reuters over the weekend in Rafah. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHER AL-RABALA, DISPLACED PALESTINIAN (through translator): We are tired and lost. We don't know where to go. In a small area, we are lost. No one is standing with us, not Netanyahu, nor Muslims, nor Saudi Arabia, nor any Arab country. This is the destruction. We are working as workers. I left with a shirt and a torn undershirt. I'm working as a worker for 10 shekels. We are suffering from the high prices from one side and the war from the other side, and we are displaced. I swear since five days, I only had one meal.

The U.S. obviously is not wanting to supply any weapons to Israel for that invasion.The U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also had a call with his Israeli counterpart, and at least according to the U.S. version of that call, Rosemary, Israel confirmed that they were taking into account U.S. concerns.

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think it signals a real prioritization, Rosemary, of the economics of this war, of the fact that it is, certainly in the words of the NATO Secretary General, a war of industrial production. Russia needs to keep that industrial production at full throttle in order to maintain its edge in the face of Ukraine now about to receive more Western aid. And this is why we see Sergei Shoigu, I think one reason, replaced by this civilian, an economist, by training a former economy minister and first deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, who is a sort of gray- suited, serious-speaking, close ally of Vladimir Putin. So that is one thing. I think obviously this comes at a point where Russia is more confident on the battlefield. It has been making gains. It's in the middle, really, of its most significant sort of cross-border push in many, many months.That, I think, masks the fact that they are dealing with a war now in its third year, where it was supposed to last just a few weeks maximum. So I think that is another reason, perhaps, that Sergei Shoigu was seen as a marked man. That, on top, of course, of a corruption scandal in his ministry, a top deputy arrested just under three weeks ago, that is something that the Russian government tends to do when it wants to get that individual to reveal information, perhaps even about higher ranks in the ministry. Shoigu, though, has not been completely sidelined. He has been given a pretty prominent role as head of Russia's Security Council. But in terms of the war in Ukraine, I think this is Russia really prioritizing the fact that the spending they are doing now, according to Peskov, up to 6.7 percent of GDP really needs to be funneled to the right places. And I think this does not spell any commitment from Russia to try to find an end to this conflict.",
