Does the speaker of the House agree with Fox's conclusion that everything about the phrase deadly insurrection is a lie? Does the speaker of the House agree that very little about January 6 was organized or violent? Does the speaker of the House agree that members of the January 6 select House Committee lied about what was on the security footage? And does the speaker of the House agree that, quote, \"the 2020 election was a grave betrayal of democracy,\" unquote.So far, Speaker McCarthy has not responded. One does wonder how much facts matter to him. This campaign to belittle what happened on January 6, 2021, was also done in service of the continued argument that 2020 election was a great betrayal of American democracy. So how are congressional Republicans reacting today to Fox's airing of January 6 footage last night as they did? Well, let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What do you think of how Brian Sicknick's death was discussed last night? I know his family has been pushing back a bit. MICHAEL FANONE, FORMER D.C.

They had no way to arrest people and take them to jail because they were surrounded.

Nobody has argued. Nobody has said that he died on that day. Everybody has said he died the next day in relation to that. But he pretends to his audience like somehow the committee said it happened on the 6th and we were lying. He creates strawman, refutes the strawman, and it's a complete lie to his audience, and we could go on forever about it.

CNN's David Culver went to Mexico's state of Sinaloa, one of the many spots where fentanyl is produced on a high scale. Sinaloa was once home to drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman and where cartels continue to run rampant today. David Culver joins me on the U.S. side of the border. David, you went to Sinaloa to trace how fentanyl ends up in the United States. Tell us what you found. DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jake, you really get a sense from our reporting down there just how prolific this is, the spread of fentanyl, and how difficult it is to track down. Now, you mentioned the organized crime aspect, you mentioned cartels, that's exactly what we stepped into in the state of Sinaloa in Culiacan, the city that went to. Let me show you from above what we had to travel in. This is part of an embed with the Mexican army. And you can see it, the convoy of six armored vehicles as they took us through not only the city of Culiacan to patrol and see if they could track down some of the fentanyl labs that have been popping up, as they compare it to basically a game of whack a mole. I mean, one pops up so quickly that it's very difficult to really stop the spread of these laps. And from inside the vehicle, we were talking to one of the colonels who's been working drug bust for 35 years. He's dealt with cocaine, heroin, meth. This is fentanyl surpasses them all in the difficulty in stopping its spread. And we went to one of those fentanyls, and this is why it's so challenging, Jake. It's basically a house that you're looking at, and it's not even the entirety of the house that is a fentanyl lab, but really a small room. So you compare that to, say, a meth lab, and those are rather sprawling. They need more infrastructure, they need to be near water. A fentanyl lab could be done really, as the colonel put it, just in the closet, and it can produce a significant amount of pills. In fact, the house that we went there, the small room, produced 270,000 pills in the bust that they made. So it is a huge challenge and one that tonight we hope to give you more insight on as we show you how this is an international blame game involving Mexico and China, Jake.",

But going back to Uvalde, there were 21 innocent people that were killed. 19 of them were babies. And so I'm proud of my vote for the Safer's Community Act. If it was today, I would vote on it again the exact same way. I think there's a way for us to be conservative in our values and our principles. I mean, I'll give you an example. Right now, I have six children. My children, my younger children, they go to school with a bulletproof backpack. My oldest son, who's 18 years old in college, not only does he have a bulletproof backpack, he carries a glock around. This is the world that we live in. I don't want my children growing up in this. I don't think anyone does.So we have to find real, tangible solutions that do not infringe upon the Constitution. I think we can accomplish that if people are bold and willing to stand up. I've always done that my whole life. Spent 20 years in the military. This is no different.",

We certainly heard him sort of tally his political victories in the state of the state address today, and it really kind of reflected what we've heard from him over the last few days as he's promoted his recently released book. And it also aligns with what we've seen from Republican lawmakers and the bills that they have filed here today being the first day of the legislative session.So let's take a look at those priorities that we've seen with the bills filed. They're calling for allowing for concealed carry without permits, prohibiting abortions after six weeks, with exceptions for rape or incest. That, by the way, was filed just minutes before DeSantis state of the state began today. And there's education, which has certainly become obvious. It is a very big priority on their platform from banning requiring teachers to use students preferred pronouns to, you know, expanding voucher programs. And here's what I thought was interesting. The very final words that he used. He said, you ain't seen nothing yet. Listen to another part of his speech today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: We must continue our momentum with K through 12 education by increasing teacher salaries, enacting a teacher's bill of rights, providing paycheck protection for teachers, expanding school choice, and fortifying parents' rights. Our schools must deliver a good education, not a political indoctrination. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So my colleague Barbara Laker and I got curious about whether there was a potential connection between these deaths.We were able to track down pieces of the astroturf that covered the field of veteran stadium in the late 1970s and early 80s and we had them tested by two different labs. One of the labs found 16 different types of PFAS, which are another name forever chemicals.",
