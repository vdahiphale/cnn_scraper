Perhaps, though, this is not all that surprising because it was less than a month ago that a Russian-backed official in that region said that the Ukrainians had really amassed a significant amount of military hardware on the other side of the river. And his expectation is that they would start using that hardware to start striking places like Enerhodar and make that part of the occupied part of Zaporizhzhya their primary focus along the front lines.

One other quick thing to mention, Laila, that is that while, of course, the Ukrainians are grateful for the international assistance they have gotten, they would like to make it more formal.

More importantly, Vladimir Putin sees winter coming and believes that plays to his advantage, that the Ukrainians will freeze, given the infrastructure that Russia has destroyed, particularly in recent weeks; that the NATO nations will begin to crack and divide as the cost of heating oil and gas rise. Now he may be getting this wrong and he may decide at some point to negotiate. But right now we've seen no indication that the Russians are prepared for a serious negotiation.
