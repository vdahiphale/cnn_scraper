And words matter, Donald Trump labels political opponent Vermin, warns of a sinister threat from within in a rally speech which echoed the language of Hitler and Mussolini.One by one, hospitals across Gaza have been forced to close. According to Gaza's Health Ministry, 21 out of 35 are no longer functioning because of damage from Israeli airstrikes or artillery fire or because of a lack of fuel. Now that includes the major medical center in Gaza, Al - Shifa Hospital. Conditions there are described as catastrophic, not only for patients but for thousands of people who have taken refuge in the hospital and surrounding area. The director of Al - Shifa says there is no longer fuel to run generators, which means no electricity, and requests to Israel for 600 liters of fuel needed to run the generators every hour have gone unanswered. The Israelis say 300 liters of fuel was delivered to the main entrance of Al - Shifa on Sunday, but medical staff were prevented from reaching it by Hamas militants. Israel has long claimed Hamas command centre is located directly below the hospital, claimed supported by one US official, but an allegation denied by doctors, administrators at the hospital as well as Hamas. Gaza's second biggest hospital, Al-Quds, also has no electricity but has also seen clashes between Israeli ground forces and Hamas fighters. The Israelis say they came under fire from militants embedded with civilians at the entrance of the hospital. The Israelis say more than 20 Hamas fighters died in the exchange of fire. U. S. President Joe Biden expressed concern Monday over hospitals being targeted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Since Israel declared war with Hamas, U.S. and coalition forces in the region have been repeatedly targeted by Iran-backed militias. One U.S. official tells CNN that at least 4 more attacks on U.S. forces in Syria over the past day. There were no casualties. The latest attacks come hours after the U.S. military carried out retaliatory strikes on targets associated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard as well as its proxies. Pentagon officials say those strikes were conducted to send a clear message the U.S. will defend itself and its personnel.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Our goal over time is to ensure that our forces are protected and that we respond if we get hit. That is what we have done. That is what we will continue to do. And this should be measured over the course of time, not over the course of 24 hours. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if Hezbollah and Hamas had operated at the same time, it would have been catastrophic for Israel. But it is true that you see multiple fronts in the Middle East. You have the -- both the Houthis and Hezbollah firing at Israel, in limited ways so far. Israel -- or Hezbollah could have done far more damage. But you have a second front, in effect, by the Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, targeting American forces in both countries who are involved in a totally separate war. They're deployed in both countries to fight ISIS, a holdover from the U.S.-led campaign to eliminate the Islamic State. So there are 900 Americans in Syria, 2,500 in Iraq. And they're coming under fire. More than 40 attacks and more than 50 Americans who have been injured. Some of them with dramatic brain injuries. So yes, this again is kind of tripping into a wider conflict, indirectly, including forces that are not deployed because of Israel- Hamas at war.",

Hezbollah, the leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has given two major speeches since this war began. And both of them, again, a lot of rhetoric. But Hezbollah has so far limited its attacks to a narrower strip along the border, when it could reach deep into Israel if it wanted to attack the electricity grid, the airport, and other major strategic sites.

However, the authorities are saying that the projection is still that there could be a massive eruption that is imminent.

There was only one person per household and only accompanied by the authorities. And a lot of the folks there have said over the past couple of days when they were evacuated, that they are not sure whether or not they will ever see their homes, whether or not they will ever see their town again because, of course, one of the risks that is there is that Grindavik could be destroyed, if, in fact, a massive eruption takes place right at that location.
