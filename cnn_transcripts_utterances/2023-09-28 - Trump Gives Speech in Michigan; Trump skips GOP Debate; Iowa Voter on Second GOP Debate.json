He skipped the debate again last night against his Republican rivals and made his case to a crowd of supporters, you see him there, in Michigan. He cast himself as pro- worker, repeatedly urged the union to endorse him.Of course, Michigan is a battleground state that he lost to Biden in 2020. Kristen Holmes, live in Detroit with more. I mean it's very clear how the UAW president feels about Trump. As Phil and I have been discussing all week, Trump's policies in the heartland on auto specifically are very clear in his actions from last time around. Did any of that matter last night?",

But we saw Shawn Fain greeting Biden at the airport, as well as walking the picket line with him. And he has had nothing but negative things to say about Trump, about him being part of the billionaire class, representing the billionaire class, being essentially everything that unions are against. So, it doesn't seem likely that an endorsement is in his future.Now, when I talked to Trumps folks, they say that there is a split between union leaders and the rank and file. And there were a couple of UAW striking workers at Trump's event last night, but not enough to say that they're a complete split here between leadership and the rank and file. So, that's something that he's going to have to prove at the ballot box or prove to these union workers every day until a general election should he be the nominee.",

I'm sure that's like a nightmare for lots of people. Because I think it's really interesting. But I also feel like it's become such a central point of the argument that Trump is making, not just in Michigan but writ large about environmental policy. And, Van, to that idea, you know, that's clearly the way Trump sees as his way in. There are legitimate issues the UAW has with the EV transition how the Biden administration has tried to accelerate that. Do you think it's possible to actually fight on the facts and policy here?",

But that becomes a little bit complicated, you know, trying to explain to this particular worker about their particular job.What I think is most interesting is that labor matters now. Unions matter now. I remember with Romney -- hold on a second. I remember with Romney that wasn't, you know, the Republican nominee's, you know, main point. Mitt Romney wasn't going around trying to convince unions that he was there friend. So, something has happened where this - this rise in labor, this -- this labor discontent is getting both parties to act very differently and show more respect toward labor.",

And that's where Donald Trump is really off tone in terms of how he's talking to and about the UAW. You have the UAW out there saying, you have record profits, business is good, we deserve a bigger piece of that. Trump is there saying, you're all going to be bankrupt in two years. And it -- one implication that would be, the automakers don't, in fact, have money to pay the workers more. And so I think he correctly -- it's correct that there are issues with the EV transition, but I don't think that Trump is talking about it in a way that reflect the concerns that the union seems to have and the workers seemed to be aligned with the union.

I mean this is a standard part of Biden's both rhetoric and - and the reality of his record. Now, will people feel that right way? Is there a lot of uncertainty? Of course there is. What's this about? This is about higher than normal union participation rates in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump got around 40 percent of the union -- the labor vote last time. There's, obviously, a disconnect between those -- the management and labor and the union leadership. But when they start demonizing and saying that the Trump -- the Biden administration is selling these folks down the river, that ignores the record, 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. In Michigan, manufacturing jobs were down 1,800 over the first three years of Trump's administration. They're up almost 1,900 over the first two years of Biden's administration.
