Today we're asking, does Donald Trump have a case for presidential immunity as the appeals court prepares to hear arguments that could change the entire election?Then, President Biden's new campaign strategy appears to be less Bidenomics, more Hitler references. So is the president running away from his record? And for shizzle, our panel gives its yay or nay on the country's newest Olympic reporter, Snoop Dogg. The gang is all here, so sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, as we mark the third anniversary of the January 6th attack on the Capitol, the central issue now is whether Donald Trump's criminal cases can go forward. This week a three-judge panel will take up the question and potentially decide his political future. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

And here is to a 2024 with lots to argue about. So Reihan, let me start with a threshold question with you. Does Trump have a case for immunity, that he can't be charged criminally for any actions while he was in office? REIHAN SALAM, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": My sense is that it is not an especially strong case, that these were things that were not done in his official duties as president but rather as an office seeker. But there is a line of argument that when you look at the founding era, when you look at the Federalist Papers, there was a deep concern about the judicial branch basically taking action against the executive branch. And I can't imagine a scenario if this were to go to the Supreme Court, that you might peel off two or three justices on that basis.

It was this blanket approach that said you basically were involved in insurrection if you were on the side of the Confederacy, in an insurrection, an uprising against the government.
