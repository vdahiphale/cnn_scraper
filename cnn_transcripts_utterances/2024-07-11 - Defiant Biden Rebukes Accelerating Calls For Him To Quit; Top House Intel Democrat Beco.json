Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have spoken privately about Biden and the future of his 2024 campaign and about how much harder they think Biden has made it to beat Donald Trump. But there is no consensus between the two on a pathway forward, at least right now. But, post-presser, the Biden campaign They seem relieved. Tonight, a senior Biden official says they're happy with Biden's performance, even if the press conference was not a home run, and even if Biden excused his debate struggles by blaming his staff.

You have said that you wanted to see the president in an unscripted environment, basically in primetime, late in the evening. This was pretty close to that kind of scenario. Should Biden stay in this race or should he step aside? REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA): I'd still like to see some additional presentations. This was all of the questions were either about Biden's health or about foreign policy. The voters are going to make their decision based on domestic policy and especially economic policy. And that's what I think was missing. But Biden promised that this press conference is just the beginning or a continuation of his efforts to try to put the June 27th debate behind us.

That being said, only if Biden is convinced that he should pull out, is there a clean way to get to the next step, and even that next step is messy and that's picking another candidate. Obviously, the vice president would be in the most likely position to get that and it might be a clean handoff. It might be a fight at the convention floor.So, we're in a difficult circumstance. We're in a close race. Each candidate is evaluated every day.

NIKEMA WILLIAMS (D-GA): Well, Abby, there's a lot of conversations happening across the country, but the conversation that matters most to me is the one with voters on the ground. I'm the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia. I was the chairwoman during our historic victory in 2020 for President Biden that nobody expected, probably not even the president himself. But I am committed to one thing before the debate, during the debate, after the debate, and that is defeating Donald Trump. We've talked to voters on the ground. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution polled delegates across the state, not just in my deep blue district, but all across the state of Georgia. And 96 percent of those delegates are hardcore, sticking with our president, Joe Biden. And as long as he's at the top of the ticket, I am standing with my president. We have a job to do, and that is to get out there and do the work, remind the voters who have delivered and that we're not finished yet. So, I am ready to continue to do the work that I always knew would be hard, because, remember, Donald Trump reminded us we only won Georgia by 11,780 votes. So, we knew it would be a tough battle. That's the nature of a battleground state. We have work to do, Abby, and I'm ready to do the work.",

And so what we need to do is ask Donald Trump, is he willing to do the same thing? Would he have a 60-minute press conference with no notes and answer any questions that's brought before him and bring any type of substance to a conversation around foreign policy? I doubt it, because we've heard him time and time again.

Right now, we only have two presumptive nominees for the major parties in this country, and that is President Joe Biden and our failed former president, who bragged about overturning Roe v.

There's nothing wrong with asking that question and asking. But it looks like they don't want us to know something. That's what it looks like. It has the appearance of we don't want you to see him.Why is this the first press conference in eight months? Eight months, they've been hiding him away, keeping him away from a solo press conference with the press. You know, why is it that in the Michigan primary in February of this year, why did he not campaign in Michigan? Not once for three weeks leading up to the primary did he go to Michigan. He was afraid to go to Michigan. He was afraid because we have 300,000 Arab and Muslim voters in our state, and he didn't want to deal with that. He didn't want to deal with the campus protests, young people just absolutely hating this war and funding Netanyahu and all that, just want to completely ignore it. And because we have a governor that would not send in the Michigan State Police to club protesters and tear them out of their tents and tear gas them. That's not our governor. So, they got to have their actual protests he, they kept him away from Michigan for the primary. The primary, oh, look at all the votes I got in the primary. Well, nobody saw him. And you know what, Abby, this is what happened in 2016. Hillary did not campaign in Michigan or Wisconsin. They said, don't go there. It'll only upset the Trump voters will remind them they've got to get out there and vote. And so she didn't campaign and she lost Michigan and Wisconsin. And as everybody has shown, all the data shows if you lose -- I'll just quote Michelle Goldberg, the columnist from the New York Times, it just took her three days, spending three days in Detroit and Dearborn, other parts of Michigan, to say he's not going to win Michigan because he got 60 percent of the Arab and Muslim vote four years ago in Michigan, 60 percent.
