Plus, a second strike, on the largest refugee camp, there, for the second day in a row. We'll ask a top Israeli official, why the IDF hit the same area again. And here at home, Donald Trump Jr., on the witness stand, at his family's fraud trial. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Moments ago, President Biden called for a pause, in Gaza, to allow for the release, of more hostages. This, after he was interrupted, by a protester, a rabbi, at a closed-door fundraiser, in Minneapolis, tonight. But his administration has been clear, saying that they rule out the idea of endorsing a ceasefire, as you've seen some, in the international community call for one. We'll have more, on President Biden's response, in a moment. But all of this is coming, after the first evacuations, of people, from Gaza. More than 2 million people have been trapped. The conditions there have been described as nothing short of hellish. Deaths continuing to climb, there is little food or water to be found. A small number of Americans were among the hundreds that were allowed to leave, through that Rafah Crossing, into Egypt today. President Biden says that's a result of intense diplomacy and that the White House is working, quote, \"Non-stop\" to get more Americans out. Most civilians have remained trapped though, as Israeli ground forces have been moving in, and airstrikes over Gaza have continued. That same refugee camp that you heard about yesterday, the Jabalya camp, that was hit, was hit again, today, 24 hours, after a large number of civilians there were killed, in addition, according to the IDF, to a top Hamas commander. This is the before and after that area. You can see the devastation that has happened. Israel claims that it struck a Hamas command and control complex, and reiterates that they had been warning civilians, to leave this area. This is what the IDF said about hitting that camp, again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: You're referring to a second strike. I think a more correct depiction of it would be that there's ongoing fighting. We're fighting an enemy that is embedded in each and every house. There's tunnels everywhere. And it's an active combat zone. This is a Hamas stronghold. It's not a refugee camp, it's a Hamas stronghold. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israelis are not going to pause. They're not going to accept a ceasefire. They see this, as the Prime Minister said, a war that potentially could lead to Israel's extinction.

And you could hear the activity. What's clear, Wolf, is despite the growing criticism, of the civilians, that are being caught, in the middle of this, I mean, Israel does not appear to be slowing its activity, in Gaza, at all. BLITZER: No. They're not slowing it down at all. They're going to be moving quickly, on the ground, and from the air, and maybe even from the sea. They've got a mission. And they're determined to try to succeed, and to eliminate Hamas, as a potential threat, down the road, to Israel, as a result of what happened, on October 7th. They're moving -- they're moving quickly. And they're not going to accept either a ceasefire or even a so-called pause. They see that basically as the same thing. They want to get the job done. And they want to get it done as quickly as possible. If you speak to Israeli officials, as I have, they're making that abundantly clear.",

And they're now active-duty. They're on the ground, over there. Some are already inside Gaza. But many of them are waiting to move inside. So, this is a full-scale Military operation that they're engaged in.

I mean, and what we're seeing in Gaza, happening, right now, I mean, it's 3 AM there. This is kind of what's been happening, every night. There is no pause happening, right now. And I think it's notable given what President Biden said, tonight, at this closed-door fundraiser. He was being shouted down, from a rabbi, calling for a ceasefire. He talked about a pause. But I mean, it's not totally clear, if that will happen, what it will look like. BARAK RAVID, FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER, AXIOS: Yes, I think there's a -- we need to differentiate between a ceasefire, that this is basically, something which is pretty long, at least a few days, that might lead to a total cessation of hostilities. This is not in the cards, OK? When Biden speaks about a pause, he speaks about something that the Israelis actually already doing, on the ground, without saying it. For example, today, when the ambulances came in, and took 80 wounded Palestinians, to Egypt? And every day when the trucks are coming in? There is an unofficial pause that Israel stops a lot of its Military operations, in southern Gaza, to allow that to happen. But what Biden is talking about, I think, what the White House is trying to achieve is at least several-hour pause, in the entire Gaza Strip, that will create some sort of conditions, that will A, allow the departure of Americans, from Gaza, because a lot of them are still scattered, around the Gaza Strip.

Over 3,400 have been killed. And so, therefore, the White House recognizes that this is really not sustainable.

Secretary of State, Blinken, recently also supported a humanitarian pause, which the Administration was not support of, few weeks ago. So I think you're seeing that public pressure working.
