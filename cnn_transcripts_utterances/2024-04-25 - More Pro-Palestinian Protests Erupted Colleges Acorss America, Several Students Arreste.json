The Hamas continues to insist on free movement of people within the territory, full withdrawal of Israeli troops and also a permanent ceasefire. All things that the Israelis have really shown no indication that they would be willing to agree to, especially since the Israelis continue to insist that the war will only end when Hamas is completely destroyed.

And that is what's being called by military analysts, the deep battle where Ukraine attacks far behind enemy lines, trying to degrade Russian military installations, equipment, storages, things like that before it even reaches the front lines.And I think it has had an impact. Certainly, we've seen the long range missile strikes in Crimea, for example, have been critical in what was essentially the biggest success story for Ukraine of 2023, which was gaining the upper hand in the Black Sea. So it's clear that Ukraine wants to do more of this. They've been using their own drones on Russian territory and occupied regions as well. And the ATACMs will play a major role and perhaps have already started playing a major role in that in terms of Russian reaction to this. And of course, this is where it's taken such a long time for the U.S. to get to the point of supplying weapons is the fear that Russia will see this as an escalation. We hear from the Russian ambassador to Washington who called this an underhand act.

Thank you.Well, joining me now is Michael Bociurkiw, former spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Michael, great to have you with us after that torturous gridlock in Congress. Finally, this aid package for Ukraine has been approved. Shipments due to -- to start in the next few hours. Explain to us what this means, not just in terms of weapons, but psychologically for the country. MICHAEL BOCIURKIW, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE AND SR. FELLOW AT THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Right. Well, it's absolutely a huge development. I've spoken to my Ukrainian contacts from government diplomacy and elsewhere. Everyone is very, very pleased. And the fact I think it's a bit of a surprise, actually, Anna, that this is coming so quickly, especially those longer range ATACM missiles with a range of about 300 kilometers that now give the Ukrainians a capability to strike from inside Ukraine to the Kerch Strait Bridge into Crimea and elsewhere. So that is a huge development. But, you know, it needs to be said that this should have come many, many months ago, because in the meantime, the Russians have been able to dig in with trenches, with barriers to Ukrainian forces. They've -- they've also been able to position more men there and they've also been able to stockpile more missiles. One final thought, if I can, on that particular one. You know, I think that delay, which is very costly to Ukraine in terms of human lives and damage to infrastructure. It may prompt some Americans to think, why is it that an unelected con man, Mr. Trump, can block such a big package of aid and in the process compromise U.S. security, European security and Ukrainian security?",

So what that means is big, big damage to critical infrastructure.One of the key energy providers in Ukraine has -- have lost 100 percent of their generation capacity. And where I live, one of the two ports, two big ports in Odessa, was struck by Russian forces just a few days ago. And, you know, again, it boggles the mind because people should be considering this infrastructure, the ports of Odessa, as a critical component of the global food supply chain. I can't understand why more Western muscle isn't being deployed there to protect these critical sea lanes, on par almost with what's being deployed, the muscle being deployed to the Red Sea.",

So I think what this means is that the American administration is going to have to find new ways to get money to Ukraine.And it does look like Canada that could include, for example, selling off frozen Russian assets. But it's also giving a push to, for example, in Europe, where there is, you know, we have to admit some opposition to aid to Ukraine, for example, releasing the millions and millions of interest accumulated from frozen Russian sovereign assets and Belgian bank accounts and giving that to Ukraine. So a lot of thinking going on how amidst this opposition, if we want to call it that, in the various democracies that, you know, elected officials can get more money to Ukraine, because if they don't, it's going to become a lot more expensive. Mr. Putin will not stop at Ukraine. And if he does attack a NATO country like Poland, that would trigger the need for U.S. and other allied boots on the ground. So the cost could be immense.",

And also, for example, putting out once and for all Putin's pet project, the Kerch Strait Bridge, which transports a lot of military supplies into the front line.But, you know, the Russians will use various tactics, including their long range missiles to fire at cities like Kharkiv, as far as Lviv in western Ukraine. And then this is also a psychological warfare that the Russians are waging because it is causing a lot of anxiety in Ukraine, forcing people to make that very, very difficult decision whether to stay or go.

They used objects from their environment as percussion. They're not able to go on Amazon and buy something, a drum kit, so they used the mop bucket that they clean with and turned it upside down, and that's their bass drum. And they grabbed a pan that they cook with and a spoon, and that's their cymbal.Yet, with these means, the honesty and the directness of the music is anti-A.I. It's music that's truly coming from the base of the human soul in the purest form and the way music has always been made, born out of daily life and their experiences. And with no goal other than to share their voice. It's a very generous and courageous act for them to do that. And there's nothing more intimate than the human voice, the fingerprint of the human voice. And the quietest singers are the ones that we really should listen to most, the ones that are the most reluctant, the most shy, the most meek, the most humble. They often have the most to share. And I think we have an ethical duty to turn away from those that demand attention, that are starved for it, and that are screaming to be heard.",

Many families, what the ration they're given a day is eight cents a day for their entire family, yet an egg at the time we were there, a single chicken egg, cost 11 cents.So this obviously leads to desperation and it leads to exploitation, particularly of the women that are there. Often women that have been widowed and women that are there alone with their children. The physical environment is very, very daunting. They're living, most of them, in covers with tarp and bamboo sticks. And a lot of these were destroyed just a few months prior to our being there by a major cyclone that came through. And there were landslides also. The area where most of them are is prone to that. But none of them discussed this. None of them complained about that. None of them talked about that. Instead, they were there to sing, and they were very happy to do so. But one of the most moving moments was a gentleman was speaking about his experience back home. He was sharing something with people he knew well that he'd never shared before. And I could not understand what was being said, but it was very clear that this was something very, very profound and emotional. And there's a moment as he's speaking, it was clear that something very emotional was already happening, but there's a moment where his voice just shifted and there was this flood of emotion. And at that moment, these men that were gathered, about seven men, began to weep, all of them, as he was expressing this. And it was incredible to see, because these are individuals that in general would probably be described as stoic. And to see a group of men weeping anywhere in the world is fairly rare. But to see this moment was intimate. I felt some shame as well and some guilt almost, because I was crying, but I turned away because it's their pain. But it was so courageous of them to share this. And what he was discussing was so horrific, discussing how they had come and burned down his mosque and how he could no longer pray and how he felt that they'd stole his soul. COREN: The suffering and the trauma that these people have gone through, the murders, the babies thrown in the fire, the sexual violence that you speak about.
