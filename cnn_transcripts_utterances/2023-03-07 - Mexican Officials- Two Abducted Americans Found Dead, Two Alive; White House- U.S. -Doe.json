They described them as a friend group that is tight-knit. The sister of Zindell Brown, one of those Americans says that they were like glue when they got together. They just stuck.And look. We're starting to get a better picture from friends and family members of how this journey to Mexico unfolded and how it seemed very normal until it wasn't. They talked about them all renting this minivan and driving down from here in South Carolina to Mexico. According to a friend of Latavia Washington McGee, who was getting that medical procedure, they rented a hotel in Brownsville, Texas. And she struggled, --the group when they went into Mexico to find the doctor's office. The friend describes the fact that McGee said that they were lost, they were having a hard time communicating with the doctor's office because of spotty and poor cell phone signal. On Saturday, when this friend had not heard from McGee or any of the others, she became concerned. And she actually reached out to that doctor's office. They confirmed that they had been trying to communicate but McGee never showed up. Now, McGee's mother also confirmed the doctor was concerned she had never showed up and contacted them. She says that the FBI contacted her on Sunday telling her that her daughter had in fact been kidnapped and that she was in danger. McGee's aunt says that she began looking online for information and found a video where she recognized her niece being kidnapped because of the blonde hair and because of the clothes she was wearing. Again, this was a friend road trip. They were going to support their friend who was getting a medical procedure. They were live streaming. They were FaceTiming. They were having constant communication with their family until they weren't. And family members have said that they suddenly couldn't get in touch with them anymore. It was all going to voicemail. It was just ringing until it -- until they couldn't get in touch with them. They became worried. From this point, they began communicating with the FBI. Again, look. McGee is a mother. She's a mother of six children. And people here in South Carolina are absolutely just they're sad. They're terrified as to -- as to what happened. And in speaking last night, they were holding out hope that it wouldn't end like this, Bianna, Victor.",

And that's probably because the State Department is still working to get in touch with the family members of those who actually died in this incident. We know, according to Mexican officials that two of the Americans died and two of them are still alive but we still haven't gotten, you know, specific confirmation on that from the U.S. government. It's just because they need to reach out to the families first, and then we'll learn more.They also haven't given us many details about the circumstances surrounding this. Of course, we have obtained a video that helps tell the story of what happened here. Mexican officials have provided some details and the FBI had provided some details but there are still a lot of remaining questions about how all this went down. I think it's really important to note that the State Department has warned against U.S. citizens traveling to this area of Mexico for some time now. It has a do not travel advisory. That is specifically because of the criminal activity in the area because of the gangs. Because of the murders that happen. And the CDC has also warned Americans against traveling to this area for medical procedures. Obviously, we know that tragically, this American who went for a medical -- cosmetic medical procedure didn't actually get it as far as we know on this trip because of this run-in that they had -- you know, this violent run-in with the individuals that they ran into. But it is an area that is known for their being medical tourism if you will. Americans going down there to get cheaper medical procedures and the CDC has warned that there can be a lot of complications that arise even when you do actually get those medical procedures, let alone, you know what the kind of issues you could run into when you're trying to get those. So, we'll wait to hear more from the State Department in terms of what they're collecting. And the other thing that we'll watch is we've heard from U.S. officials throughout the day talking about justice being served. And we'll watch to see what exactly that look likes -- looks like from the standpoint of the Biden administration.",

Up until recently, he was China's ambassador to the U.S. He has a reputation for being a careful and accomplished diplomat, so it's significant that he struck this much more combative tone in his first appearance in this role.We heard him make this argument that Beijing has been making for a long time, which is that the U.S. is trying to contain China and suppress its rise. He also lashed out at the U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy, accusing the U.S. of plotting an Asia-Pacific version of NATO. He defended China's partnership with Russia as imperative and said China has not supplied weapons to Russia or Ukraine. He accused the U.S. of creating a crisis over Taiwan. This was a fiery press conference and it sets the tone for China's foreign policy for years to come. And chose there is not going to be an off-ramp to U.S.-China tensions anytime soon. Now, this press conference is part of China's biggest annual political gathering, known as the two sessions. It's the first one held since China abandoned its zero-COVID policy. But the media, reporters like myself covering this event, were stuck in a COVID bubble. To attend a session today, I have to stay overnight at a quarantined hotel, get an on-site PCR test. Everything was highly controlled. The restrictions were surprising considering China has already completely opened up from COVID. The question is where these COVID controls or just an excuse to restrict press access?

And so, he called on Russia military to protect his flanks and give him more ammunition. So, it remains to be seen if the Ukrainian military actually able to execute such a maneuver and wants to do it at the cost of perhaps undermining its ability to advance elsewhere.
