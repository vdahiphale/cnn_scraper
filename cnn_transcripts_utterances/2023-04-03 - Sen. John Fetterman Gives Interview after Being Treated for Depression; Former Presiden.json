That means he would be in New York around 3Sources tell CNN that at times, Trump was calm over the weekend despite, of course, his team now admitting they were shocked initially by the indictment when it came down on Thursday. Over the weekend, Trump reportedly played golf, talked to his political allies, and discussed ways to use the criminal charges to boost his 2024 presidential campaign. CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is here with us now. Obviously, we've seen the way that he has been fundraising off of this.

But we have argued along with other media organizations, there is no greater public interest than having transparency in a case like this. One thing I thought was interesting, though, is I reached out to the former president's legal team last night to say, hey, you guys want cameras in the courtroom, right? I didn't hear back, so I'm really curious to watch. They have until 1:00 p.m. today, prosecutors or defense, to launch any objections with the judge that they have cameras in the courtroom.

It sounds like Alina Habba is making a lot of the arguments in the court of public opinion, which is to attack the District Attorney, which is to say it's his First Amendment right to attack the Judge, which certainly it is, but I don't think any attorney would suggest that's a good idea for their client.And as Alina just noted, she has testified as part of the ongoing criminal investigation into Mar-a-Lago, though she does not represent him in this case, you make a good point that there have been a lot of lawyers who have searched for various documents at one point in time, and there are a lot of questions about why classified documents keep showing up, even though the former President has been out of office for so -- for so long now. But in terms of all these cases coming together, I mean, there is a question, how will this indictment in Manhattan impact the other investigations the former President is currently facing? So, I think all of those questions are fair, but I did want to circle back. My IFB was not working. Was Alina able to answer the question about whether they want cameras in the courtroom?",

At a time when much of the GOP is rallying around Trump, Hutchinson is calling for him to drop out of this race after being indicted, and he joins me now, the former Governor of Arkansas, and 2024 presidential candidate. Good morning, Governor, and thanks again. ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. It's great to be with you this morning.",

The voters should decide this.But that's just a principle that I followed through my public career event that the office is more important than the individual who is seeking it.  HARLOW;  You were a former prosecutor, former US Attorney, actually and I thought it was really interesting that following Trump's indictment, you said: \"We don't want to erode confidence in our entire criminal justice system simply because we don't like the beginning parts of a case.\" It puts you in stark contrast to almost all of your fellow Republicans in office who have been slamming this investigation before knowing the facts, and slamming the District Attorney, Bragg, and I wonder why you think they're wrong to do that?",

You look at China, you look at Mexico, you look at so many countries, and there is corruption. It's unreliable.And so our rule of law sets the United States apart. And while we have flaws in it, it always need to be corrected and adjusted, everything we do should not be undermining our system. And so, there's thousands of people that are charged every day, some are acquitted of those charges, and the system works. And ultimately, a jury decides these issues. So if I was a prosecutor, I would not have brought this case, because I don't think it measures up based upon the facts that I know now, but let's let the facts come out.",

We've invested in school safety. We had our own Commission. We looked at how we can support our local schools and increase in the safety. It's tragic what happened in Nashville.
