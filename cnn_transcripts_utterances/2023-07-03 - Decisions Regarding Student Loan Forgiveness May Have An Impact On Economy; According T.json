      "sentences": "Yes, so important for the economy, right, John? So, it's really been remarkable how well the U.S. consumer has done over this last year or so, despite the interest rate increases, despite the inflation.And so, the question now is, well, how does this impact that? A few estimates going around. Greg Vallier (ph), he's a policy strategist, he put the estimate at about $70 billion. He said, it is obviously a headwind. So, $70 billion dollars coming out of the economy, as people will pay back these student loans payments. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's, he put it differently. According to his calculations, he put it in GDP terms, John. He said, it's about shaving a quarter of one percent off of GDP annually. That said, the census that this will not be a major blow, but if it -- it's your household, if it's your budget, it may feel differently. And one thing I can tell you people are watching really closely is the timing of this. So, when interests -- when these payments resume in October, it will coincide with what appear to be, perhaps, a slowdown that is already taking shape. We have heard Bank of Americus say, even according to their most recent data in June, they are seeing consumers pull back. We had some research from the Feds, from the Fed staffers suggested that all of the excess savings that the U.S. had saved over the pandemic is depleted. And so, it is the timing of this that maybe this, in and of itself, is not enough to cause a significant dent to the U.S. economy, but watch the space, because there will be a lot of things that seem to be happening around the same time, John.",

SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR: All right. This morning, new revelations about the case at the center of the Supreme Court's LGBTQ rights versus First Amendment rights ruling. On Friday, the Court's conservative majority ruled that a Colorado web designer, her name is Laurie Smith, could refuse to create websites for same sex couples' weddings on free speech grounds. In court filings, she had put in there that a man, only listed as Stewart, requested her services to create designs and other materials for his same sex wedding. Now, here is the rub, CNN and other reporters found Stewart through information contained in those court filings, but he told CNN he never made that request. He's not gay and has been happily married to a woman for the past 15 years. Here to discuss the potential implication of all of this, if any, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. OK. So, the first this is, does this change, in any way, the Supreme Court's ruling? Is there any chance that they would go back to the case and say, hold on a second, this, we need to look into? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY, AND FORMER FEDERAL AND STATE PROSECUTOR: Realistically, no, Sara. Because when the Supreme Court decided this case, they did it what's called a stipulation, meaning the parties agreed to certain facts. And they did it, really, largely, on a hypothetical which is so unusual, which courts are, frankly, not supposed to do. They said, well, this web designer is going to go into be business. She is, in the future, intending to deny services to LGBTQ couples, and the State of Colorado intends to enforce its anti- discrimination law, therefore, we sort of have this inevitable future collision between these Two. The statements about this Stewart person happened in lower courts. But I think the Supreme Court was wary of that and tried to work their way around it. But the big problem here is, you said the key word, standing. The Supreme Court is now deciding cases where there would not, traditionally, be standing and that's led to an expansion of the Supreme Court's power.",

And the court there questioned her standing, and then her attorneys in chief put this new information that actually she had been asked for a website in the court filing. This has gone on for seven years. So, when you look at the federal court and the state, they are looking for standing, but the Supreme Court decided they didn't need standing or they decided that they had standing?",

That's why, you have to go through the district court, the Court of Appeals first. And usually by the time you get to the Supreme Court, you will have a factual record. They will say, what's contained in this appendix that you have to file, it could be hundreds of thousands of pages, these are the facts of the case, and you argue accordingly. And so, you avoid this type of situation where people go, gee, that decision may have based on faulty facts.Sometimes, there's a bit of a dispute about the facts but at least you have a concrete set of what the facts are. And here, if the Supreme Court is going to continues to reach farther and farther to take cases that are abstract, this could be a recurring problem. It's really -- it's not for anyone's benefit, ultimately. I know someone always wins and someone always loses. It's not for the benefit of the parties, it certainly not for the benefit of the Supreme Court, and it's not for the benefit for the public. There's a reason for this. You know, standing is, sort of, sometimes seen as a boring technical requirement but there's a reason for it because we want our courts making reliable rulings on set issues of fact.",

Putin doesn't control the situation in the regions. He doesn't control the security situation. All of us understand that his whole army is in Ukraine, almost entire army is there. That's why it's so easy for the Wagner troops to march through Russia. Who could have stopped him?

It's not at all clear if this is something that's been approved by the Russian government or the government of Belarus. Now, Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus said on Friday that he was looking forward to Wagner fighters, mercenaries coming to train his military.
