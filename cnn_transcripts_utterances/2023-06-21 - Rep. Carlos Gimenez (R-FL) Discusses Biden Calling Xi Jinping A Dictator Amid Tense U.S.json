Perhaps not unrelated, Chinese sent an aircraft carrier through the China Strait today. Let's discuss with a member of the Select Committee on China, Republican Congressman Carlos Gimenez, of Florida, who actually just stepped out of a hearing on military spending to join us. Congressman, thank you for sharing part of your afternoon with us. Do you agree with President Biden's view that Xi Jinping is a dictator? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): Absolutely. Xi Jinping is a dictator. He is probably the most powerful leader, president, dictator that China's had since Mao. Some people say he has more power than Mao.",

I believe we need to be more aggressive in decoupling economically from China and stop helping China becoming a more increasing threat to the United States. And so that's what I'm saying, that's why I'll be more aggressive, be more aggressive on our posture. Economically, militarily, no. Militarily is deterrence.

When they say they're going to have closer ties militarily, that comes as no surprise either as Cuba now tries to get closer to what it will consider its dominant partner, which will be China. We need to make sure the sanctions -- strengthen our sanctions against Cuba, that their actions will have negative consequences on that regime. Unfortunately, what's happened way too often is when somebody makes this kind of move against us, we try to soften them up by, you know, easing up on sanctions, which never works really. The only thing that the Cubans, the Chinese, the Russians will understand is strength. It doesn't necessarily have to be kinetic. It doesn't have to come to blows. But it's strength.

You could see workers in there loading generators, loading gear all day, welding, putting on beams at the back of the \"Horizon Arctic\" to clearly launch something off of it. Now we know and we had understood that there was an ROV, a very specialized deepwater remote-operated vehicle on those C-17s. But they just have a massive amount of gear. The \"Horizon Arctic\" is on its way out. Another Coast Guard ship from Canada is on its way out. And there's a couple of other ships on the way. In all, they're going to have about 10 ships in that area doing everything from sonar sweeps to being prepared for any sort of health emergencies that, if they are found alive, that they would be able to help out, like a decompression chamber if needed, a mobile decompression chamber. And the planes as well, searching from the air, dropping the buoys, hoping they can find -- every tiny sliver gives them hope.

But now they are going to every single scrap of sound that they can hear in the ocean for that area. And remember, there are fishing boats, there are cargo ships, all sorts of activity in that area, many, many boats in that area, and also natural sounds that can be mistaken for manmade sounds. So they have very sophisticated gear trying to find it. Once they find it, then they have to confirm it is there. They have to figure out how they will get it up.
