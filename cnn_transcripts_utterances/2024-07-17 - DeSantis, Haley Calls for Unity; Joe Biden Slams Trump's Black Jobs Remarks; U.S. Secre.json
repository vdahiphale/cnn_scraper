But there are still many things that we don't know. But let me run through what we do know at this point.Let's start first with Thomas Matthew Crooks. That's the 20 year old shooter from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. We do know that on Friday before the shooting, we believe that he went to his sportsman's club and actually practiced shooting on that rifle range at the sportsman club, not too far from his home. We then know on Saturday morning, the shooter went to Home Depot and purchased a ladder. Not long after that, we know that the shooter then went to a gun shop and purchased 50 rounds of ammunition. Then law enforcement sources have been telling CNN the shooter drove to Butler, Pennsylvania, to the Trump rally that occurred behind me back on Saturday. And the shooter actually was spotted by law enforcement at one point looking suspicious near the metal detectors, but then went relatively undetected as far as we understand. Until later on, when he ultimately fired those shots towards former President Donald Trump. But here's what we still don't know. We still are no closer to understanding what may have motivated this particular shooting. The FBI is saying that it has done over 100 interviews of witnesses at the scene, law enforcement officers, family and friends of Mr. Crooks. They also searched the home and the car of the shooter. They also looked at the past internet search history of the shooter, and they actually were able to crack into the shooter's phone. Still, though, no evidence pointing to any ideological reasons that would have led him up to that rooftop to fire those shots at the former president. And now I want to turn to the investigation and this back-and-forth between U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement agencies that were on the ground here as well. We have learned from law enforcement sources that there was a sniper team actually inside of the complex where the shooter Crooks was on top of the roof. But these snipers, they were actually looking through second story windows towards the crowd, not actually on what was happening above them on the roof. This comes as Secret Service told us that they were not responsible for sweeping and clearing the area that contained this particular building because it was outside of the perimeter that they were focused on where the Trump campaign event was happening. The Secret Service said that was law enforcement's responsibility. However, we have heard from a number of local law enforcement agencies here in this particular area, including the Pennsylvania State Police, who not only said that they gave Secret Service all of the resources that they asked for, but specifically said in these types of situations, during these types of events, Secret Service is the lead agency. Then 48 hours after the shooting on Saturday evening, we finally heard the first comments on the record in a media interview from the director of the Secret Service, who said explicitly the buck stops with me. So it's unclear if we're going to see more back-and-forth between local law enforcement and between Secret Service. But we still don't have an answer to the question of why that particular roof was left unattended. Danny Freeman, CNN, Butler, Pennsylvania. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And yet the breach and the assassination attempt still occurred.Now, it is true, as you said, that the suspect, that the -- that the assassin has no known ties to any foreign intelligence agency. There'll be lots of speculation from all accounts coming out of the FBI and state authorities. This was a sort of loner, isolated 20 year old with lots of -- with access to lots of guns.

Well, he's not going away. He's just trying to find another place to shoot from. On the -- in terms of communication, the gap that we need to answer is that both people at the rally and law enforcement noticed him, noticed him as suspicious, as well as then on the roof.

They believe this for months, and they think with Trump's strength in the election right now, the Senate map is improving for them even more. So 51-49 for the Democrats now. Come forward to this map here. You see Manchin State, West Virginia. We've already turned it red. He's not running for reelection. That's a big state for Donald Trump. That seat is almost guaranteed to go Republican and to go red. So then you see, why are Ohio and Montana, why are they yellow? Well, these are big Trump states. Ohio, Sherrod Brown, a Democratic incumbent, great personal brand back home. But Donald Trump's going to win that state, or at least he has in the past, by six or eight points. He just picked Republican Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate. So Democrats think they're in more trouble. You see Sherrod Brown raising money all the time. So what if that happened? What if this went over to red? We'll try to click it over. There you go. That would give right there. John Tester, again, a Democrat with a great personal brand back home. Donald Trump won by 16 points last time in Montana. If Joe Biden's numbers are down even more, can John Tester hang on? So this is what Democrats have been thinking about for months, that these would be the two suffragettes. But as you see these speakers come to the stage tonight, here's what they're worried about now. Let's just come back and make those toss-ups. They're also worried about Pennsylvania. They're worried about Michigan. They're worried about here in Wisconsin. You just heard Kari Lake. She's losing in the polls right now, but they're worried about Arizona. They are worried about Nevada as well. You can make a scenario here, a reasonable scenario, the Republicans not only get 50 in the majority, but they get 51, 52, 53. Now Democrats watching are saying, you know, you're being overly pessimistic. Most of the Democratic candidates, I want to make this clear, most of the Democratic candidates right now are leading in these races. Narrowly in most of them, but they're leading in these races. The Democratic Senate candidates are outperforming Joe Biden in these states. But ticket splitting in presidential elections, one party for president, the other party for Senate, has become almost nonexistent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

ALI BAGHERI KANI, ACTING IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): As you know, the Islamic Republic of Iran immediately following the assassination of General Soleimani tried to judicially and legally follow this assassination. At Iranian courts and at the same time, we have tried to make use of the international judicial and legal procedures in order to prosecute the perpetrators and advisers who helped this assassination.

Authorities in Bangkok provided us an update just a few hours ago, and we are getting a little bit more clarity as to what they believe happened.Let me first tell you what we are hearing directly from police. They say a suspect they believe killed five people was a Vietnamese- American woman who took her own life and was one of six bodies found in this hotel room in central Bangkok on Tuesday. They say that she ordered tea to this hotel room, tea and food to this hotel room, and when staff tried to serve her, they say she was alone at the time and that the other guests arrived later. But when they tried to serve the tea to this woman, she resisted, saying that she didn't even break a smile and that she appeared to be, you know, very concerned about what was happening at the time. Now, according to police, this may have all stemmed from some kind of business deal, some kind of financial deal that turned sour. One relative told police that they believe this centered around some kind of debt dispute. That is what led to this gathering and possibly is what motivated this tragedy to take place. This all happened at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Bangkok in a fifth-floor room, and we are told that hotel staff found the folks, the people there, about 24 hours after this happened, after they all failed to check out. Rosemary, this is what we have so far from Bangkok police. Of course, if we get more, we'll pass that along to you. Back to you for now.",
