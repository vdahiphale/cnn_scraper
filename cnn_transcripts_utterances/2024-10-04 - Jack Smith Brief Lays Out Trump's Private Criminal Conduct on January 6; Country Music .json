      "sentences": "So Alisyn, the Justice Department has long had a written policy that says federal prosecutors shall take no action that may impact an election, too close to an election unless you cannot humanly avoid it. And what Jack Smith has done here is filed a 165 page opus that includes information that, first of all, has not been tested through the rules of evidence that Jack Smith actually concedes. Some of this would never be admissible at trial.It includes all evidence that has never been subjected to or tested by cross examination. But what happened here that's really unusual, Alisyn, is the way that Jack Smith and to an extent Judge Chutkan manipulated and twisted the ordinary procedure. Ordinarily, a defendant makes a motion first to dismiss a case or to do any other type of thing. And then the prosecutor responds. But here, Jack Smith said, first of all, Judge, I want to file a brief that's four times the normal maximum instead of the normal 45 pages. I want 180. And second of all, I need to go first. Judge Chutkan even said that's an unusual request. But then she granted it. So I don't think that Jack Smith's conduct here has been consistent with DOJ's policy. SANCHEZ: Elie, when it comes to DOJ's policy, the action portion of what you're talking about, not a new prosecution, but action that could impact the election, I understood to be within 30 days of an election. We were just outside of 30 days. How do you think Judge Chutkan has approached the timeline of this case overall, seeing as how this was a disclosure in her court, not necessarily an action carried out by the Department of Justice?",

We used to say, well, 30 days, 60. You ask someone from two different districts, they'll tell you two different numbers. The rule I'm citing does not give any specific number of days. It says likely to impact an election, close in time to an election.With respect to Judge Chutkan, she has generally been in agreement with Jack Smith about trying to expedite this case, not quite as extreme. For example, Jack Smith initially wanted a trial date five months after the indictment. Judge Chutkan set it for seven months after the indictment. But it's important to note, in its ruling on immunity, the Supreme Court actually went out of its way to excoriate Judge Chutkan for, quote, expediting this case without conducting adequate fact finding and adequate legal analysis.",

He deserves to be indicted for the classified documents case at Mar-a-Lago. The evidence on both looks quite strong to me.But I just simply don't subscribe to a view that, well, if a person's done something bad, we can bend or change the rules. Maybe I'm a prosecutorial purist in that sense. But I do think these two indictments, the two federal indictments, are well founded.

These two have had a contentious relationship ever since the 2020 election. The governor is outlining efforts locally to recover from Hurricane Helene. Let's listen.GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): ... But I told him how much we were glad to have him, and we appreciated the work that they were doing. The next morning, we tried to go see a bunch of linemen that were having breakfast at one of the tent cities they had set up at a staging site that had over 500 trucks and over 1,000 people. We got out of the car at 6:30 a.m. before the sun was even up, and most of these hardworking people had already eaten breakfast and were walking out to go crank their truck to start working to get people's power back up whom they've never met. Those same linemen were going to keep working well into the night. That is the kind of response that we have seen after this crisis from Georgians and from people far beyond in this state. Resilience and hope have been on full display everywhere we've gone, including right here in Columbia County. We're grateful for those incredible people all over this state, but we're also mindful that every moment of every day since this storm passed of the loss of life and the devastation that it brought. We knew it was going to be bad, which is why we prepared early, just like they did here in Columbia County. I declared a state of emergency two days ahead of the storm, which gave us time to mobilize and prepare for the worst, and I'm so glad that we did because it impacted literally every part of our state. Many communities have been scarred with major infrastructure damage, and at one point, at least 1.3 million power meters were not functional and many more Georgians were without power. That number, incredibly, is down to 225,000 as we speak. In Atlanta, we saw record rainfall with 11.12 inches of rain in a 48- hour period. The previous state record goes back to 1886 when we had 9.6 inches. As many people around the country know, we are an agricultural state. With agriculture serving as our number one industry, Hurricane Helene has wiped out much of this year's crop across the board. Our Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper couldn't be here today --",

This is in the mountains of Western North Carolina, Chimney Rock. You can see effectively what's a river now flowing through where that street and that parking lot used to be. Half of those killed by the storm died in North Carolina. And in the state most devastated by Helene, Asheville has become ground zero. Witnesses there described the scene in the city of 95,000 as, quote, post-apocalyptic. CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir joins us now.

It kept the hurricane alive for miles further inland than it would have maybe in 10 or 20 years ago. And of course, Buncombe County is like a big bowl and the mudslides that just fill in there. It's not built to absorb this amount of rainfall in such a short amount of time, a lesson. And we have to adapt to these new weather events, hopefully, as the scientists say, while mitigating the cause of it, the fossil fuel pollution that's overheating the earth and making all of these things so much more intense.
