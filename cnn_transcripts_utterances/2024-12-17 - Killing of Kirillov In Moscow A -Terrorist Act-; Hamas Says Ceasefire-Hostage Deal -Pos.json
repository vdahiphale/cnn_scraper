And the Russians aresaying this happened in the early morning hours of today, as the general and an aide to the general were leaving that building. I'm going to get out of your way and you can see the actual scene of where all of this took place. And you already mentioned that the entrance to that building where all this happens, the second entrance down from here, was badly damaged in that explosion. And the Russians are indeed saying that they believe that the explosive device was hidden in an electric scooter parked right outside that building and that there were about 300 grams of TNT inside that explosive device. They have already said that they found remnants of that explosive device. And one of the other things that they've said as well is that they believe that it was detonated remotely. Now we do know at this point in time that the Ukrainian Security Services have claimed responsibility for this, a source saying that to CNN that Ukrainian Security Services were behind this. The explosion, despite the fact that 300 grams of TNT might not sound like very much, seems to have been substantial. We can see that there's a lot of workers here, on the ground, investigative committee of the Russian Federation on the ground. Some others have cordoned off the area. But one of the other things that we're seeing as well, Max, if we pan over to the other side, is that the explosion was so strong that it damaged the building on the other side of the road. You can see there that windows have been smashed by this explosion that took place. There was an eyewitness report that we have seen, some of them on Russian media, saying that they thought that maybe some sort of cement truck had unloaded a lot of cement or what something very heavy had fallen down on the ground. So clearly, the people who live in this area very much heard this explosion at it -- as it took place. Of course, at the beginning, not exactly clear of what it might have been. The Russians have launched a criminal investigation into all this. You can see the investigators. And we've seen the investigators on the ground here, not just civilian investigators or from the police authorities but also military investigators of as well. Of course, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, very important for the Russian military, very high up in the Russian military. He was the head of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical defense forces. And the Ukrainians had actually indicted him in absentia. Just yesterday, the Ukrainian Security Services accusing the Russians of using weaponized chemicals in the war in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov for his part, in the past, had accused the Ukrainians of doing the exact same thing. So certainly, someone who was on the forefront as far as that conflict between Ukraine and Russia is concerned, and someone, who the Russians, of course, for their military, was extremely important.

But first Iwant to bring you a video that CNN has obtained from a source with knowledge of the operation. This shows the moments just before the blast. You can see two people emerging from that building. The source has told us that one of those was Kirillov. Now we're not showing the moment of the explosion. You can simply see the dashboard here. But I don't know if we can play that again. And you can see, just by the lamppost, just next to that doorway, is something that looks like a scooter. We know from Russian media reports that there was a bomb, they say, hidden in a scooter, which was responsible for this attack. So I think what this video shows us is a real sense of this being a targeted killing; someone obviously watching, monitoring. We have heard reports from Russian state media that this was a remotely detonated device. So that speaks to the sophistication and, of course, the ambition here, of targeting someone at such a high level. But as I mentioned, we have seen recently an increase in this. There has been, in fact, we believe four. This is the fourth incident in two months where Ukraine has directly or indirectly admitted responsibility for the assassination of a military figure in Russia or in Crimea. In the case of one of them, there was a pilot with the 52nd Heavy Bomber Regiment in Bryansk in late October. Then a senior official with the Black Sea Fleet in November. And just last week, a top designer with a Russian military industrial company believed by Ukrainian source with the security services to be responsible for upgrading cruise missiles used on Ukraine. So this the fourth such incident. This is the highest-ranking military official that we've seen targeted. And I think, look, clearly in the context of this war, as the clock ticks down to Donald Trump taking up the U.S. presidency for the second time, questions around military aid and Russia still inching forward on the Eastern Front. It speaks to Ukraine's rush here to use any means they can to seize the initiative.",

He's also been sanctioned by the U.K. for the use of these sort of riot agents, these choking substances. The U.S. has also sanctioned Russia for the use of these. So they are credible.

This follows my reporting yesterday that an Israeli technical team was in Doha to discuss the parameters of a Gaza hostage-ceasefire deal.

I've been hearing that, you know, there's been a Trump personnel coming in and out of the region, speaking to the Qataris, for example, since late November. So the momentum is there. We know that these parameters that are being discussed at present, because our sources are telling us that, like I say, very similar to the to the deal that was proposed back in May by Joe Biden. Some concessions, it seems, on the temporary stay for the Israeli army, particularly in the south. That was something, it seems, that Hamas may have, at this stage, conceded to.

This would be a temporary ceasefire in the first instance, 4-6 weeks, for example, in the release of some but not all of those hostages as we understand it. There are two things that have changed, aren't there, in recent months. There is the incoming Trump administration -- and Donald Trump himself has said, get a deal done before I get into office. The second thing that has changed -- and I've been told by a number of people in this region that the momentum for a deal has come since the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, since Hezbollah effectively had been taken out of the mix as supporters for a very effective -- supporters, both in rhetoric and in action, supporters for Hamas.

This notion that Hamas has not only lost, you know, its ally in the -- in this fight, that the other militant group that hasbeen firing rockets on Israel, every single, you know, nearly every single day since October 8th -- in this case was Hezbollah. So not only Hezbollah coming out of that fight but also what that means in the broader regional context is what Israeli officials and American officials have consistently pointed out to me, this notion that Hamas had been waiting and hoping that Iran would ultimately step in a much bigger way than they have. That perhaps their attack on October 7th would lead to a domino effect that would trigger this massive regional war that that could, you know, bring Israel to its knees ultimately and perhaps Yahya Sinwar's grandest visions. But instead Sinwar is dead. Iran has been significantly weakened over the course of the last year. Its biggest proxy in the region, Hezbollah, has lost, you know, by some estimates, more than half of its rocket arsenal, effectively conceded to a ceasefire that, for more than a year, it insisted it would not agree to without the end of the war in Gaza. And so that now, basically, Hamas is left in a position where it is fighting a war that it cannot win. Its military structures have been decimated. Its governance capabilities in Gaza significantly weakened as well. And so now Israeli officials certainly believe that this is the moment where Hamas is at its weakest point, where it will make the most concessions. And that ultimately it is realizing that perhaps its grand dreams of a major war that could, you know, defeat Israel is not going to happen. And those are the conditions that Israeli and U.S. officials have pointed to as making now the ripest time for a deal. I do think it is also important to note, though, that over the summer, you know, the deal that was being considered, that was put on the table, that framework from President Biden and the Israelis in July, the deal that we are going to see is likely not going to be all that different from that. With perhaps the exception of some compromises by Hamas on the movement and the timing of the movement of Israeli troops in Gaza. And then lastly, just the notion that this is not going to spell the end of the war, that is something that the Israeli prime minister has made quite clear. It's very possible we see a first phase of this ceasefire and then ultimately the war could resume -- Becky.",

Trump, therefore, has the opportunity that most presidents don't have of starting his second term from scratch. Most presidents are still haunted by the decisions they made in the first term. Even though they get rid of some staff, it's essentially the same presidency. Trump has had time to sit back and reflect on what he wants to change from his first term. He's found cabinet picks who won't restrain him, as some of the establishment officials did back during his first four years in the White House. So he's in a very advantageous position. The question is, can he be more disciplined than he was in his first term? Can he bring more than half the country with him on some of his major policy issues? If, as we saw in the past, that his volatile personality, his easy taking of grudges gets him off track, that could be much more difficult. And we should also remember that, effectively, although he's going to be very powerful when he takes office, Trump will be a lame duck. He only has four more years in the White House. He can't constitutionally run again. So he has a short-term period, I think maybe a year, 1.5 years before the midterm elections start, to really put his stamp on his second term and to leave a very strong political legacy.

It's very important because it also shows us how the future will look like. Are those in power now the decision makers? Will they be held accountable or not? All these are very different priorities. And at the same time, we're talking about millions of people who are still in camps and in tents and they need to go back to their towns. Their towns are destroyed. We need to rebuild them. Those priorities are overwhelming. Syrians do need help but also Syrians are builders. Syrians are -- they know that only them can lead this process and can rebuild their country. And I also see lots of hope going around. It's a very difficult moment but many people still believe that the future should and can be better.",

That is important to you and important to so many Syrians, particularly those who've been away and are -- and are back in and dedicating themselves now to a better future. Ibrahim, it's good to have you. I hope we stay in touch over the weeks and months to come and it's good to see you there. I know how important it is for you to be in Damascus and we really very much appreciate your time today. Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, as part of this program, CNN has partnered with Technology Innovation Institute of Abu Dhabi or TII. Their chief researcher in autonomous robotics, Professor Enrico Natalizio, helped me kick off the CNN Academy simulation with a MasterClass in which no AI-related question was off limits. We talked first about some of the perfect fits for the robotic technology that he is developing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH CHURCHILL, DEPARTMENT CHAIR, HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION, MOHAMMED BIN ZAYED UNIVERSITY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: If you think about health care, computational biology, the new department, human computer interaction. So how do we work with hospitals here? How do we work with teams of medical professionals to understand how I could, for example, lead to a completely different set of, for example, prosthetics? I have a very mildly broken foot. But imagine that we can have prosthetics that are molded for you, that are personalized for your gait, where there's a model that's built for you but also a potential model of how to rehabilitate after injury that could be derived from multiple people's progression for healing over time. So you might actually have your sort of rehabilitation person kind of in your boot, on your foot -- best practices, best learning from AI for what works for people, personalized for you.

Law enforcement sources say she attempted to sneak onto a Canada-bound bus from the United States. Now Svetlana Dali was already facing charges after slipping by security and hitching a ride on a plane from New York to Paris. And you will have, if you're a regular viewer of CNN, you will be well aware of that story. She is expected to be charged with bail jumping and could face up to five years in federal prison. Let's bring in Mark Morales, who is CNN's law enforcement reporter, for more. How is this even possible for a second time? I mean, she was wearing a bracelet, after all, as I understand it. I mean, getting past security on a plane is one thing. But then she was wearing a device, which meant that she shouldn't have been able to move around and certainly not try and leave the U.S. this time around. So what's happening here?",

And as a measure to sort of -- sort of split the difference, they said she can be released conditionally but was not allowed to go to airports, had to be restricted to the area where she was going to be. But clearly she violated that. And this ankle monitor is a very key piece of this because, as part of her conditional release, she was supposed to be staying with a roommate. And it was that roommate that found her ankle monitor on the floor and saw that she was missing. That roommate called authorities and let them know that she had escaped. And it wasn't until they found her on this Greyhound bus that they realized how far she had gone. She was just -- she had gotten to the Canadian border but did not obviously get in. And that's when she was taken into custody. Now later today, she's expected to go before a judge in Buffalo, New York, which is in upstate. And eventually she'll make her way back to New York City. And again, this is where she'll face up to five years in prison, which is a very big difference from being released with conditions -- Becky.",
