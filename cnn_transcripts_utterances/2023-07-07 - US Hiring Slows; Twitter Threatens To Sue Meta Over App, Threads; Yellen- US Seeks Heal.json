Yes, it was up, it was down. Those are the markets and these are the main events. US hiring slowed slightly last month. New data does little to change the picture for the Federal Reserve, though. Twitter threatens to sue Meta over its new rival app. And the Dutch government wins the court battle over reducing flights at Schiphol Airport. More European governments could soon follow suit. Live from New York, it's Friday, July 7th. I'm Paula Newton in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. So tonight, some of the steam came out of the US labor market last month, but not enough, this is key, to curb bets that rates are going up again soon. Two hundred and nine thousand jobs were added in June, that is the smallest advance in two-and-a-half years in fact, and yes, that kind of sounds good, right, if you're a Fed policymaker wanting to cool the economy, but not so fast. This is the key. The unemployment rate continues to fall from 3.7 percent in May to 3.6 percent last month. Where are the workers? And wages rose 4.4 percent in June, from a year earlier. And that points to a still tight labor market. Matt Egan joins me now to parse all of these numbers. You know, we all kind of got a bit intrigued by that number yesterday, which really was a standout. What is the difference? Because people sometimes remind us, right, one data point does not a trend make.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. Well, happy Friday, Paula.Listen, the ADP number yesterday showed that the United States added half a million jobs, private sector jobs in June and that did trigger a lot of fears on Wall Street, because that suggested the jobs market was actually heating up. I mean, that was twice as much as expected. But we know that ADP report, it has got kind of a spotty track record as far as predicting the actual government numbers. Usually it understates growth; here, it actually overstated it, apparently. So it does seem like that ADP report was a bit of an outlier. It didn't really fit in with a lot of the other metrics that we see that suggests that this red hot jobs market is cooling off, but not falling off a cliff. And so I think that was the big takeaway from the jobs report today is that hiring has slowed, but this remains a pretty strong jobs market -- Paula.",

      "sentences": "Well, on the first question about where the workers are coming from, I think that was the big fear here, right? If you had said that theUS economy would still be adding three hundred, two hundred thousand jobs at this point, there was a real concern that that would overheat the economy, because there simply weren't enough workers. But what's changed is that the supply of workers has actually increased for two big reasons. One, immigration has rebounded; two, women are coming off the sidelines. We know that COVID forced millions of people, millions of women, especially out of the workforce, but that has really started to reverse. The participation rate for women aged 25 to 54 is at a record high here in the United States for the third month in a row, so that is very good news, because it allows the jobs market to meet all of that demand. Now on this question about what the Fed is going to do. Investors are still very confident that the Fed is going to resume raising interest rates very soon. At last check, the markets are pricing in a 92 percent chance that the Fed raises interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point later this month. But, Paula, the hope is that maybe the Fed is getting towards the end of this rate hiking cycle.",

We're not in the same situation in the United States, but they are starting to see that in Europe, and that is what they're worried about taking hold. We can't let our guard down, and that is what the Federal Reserve is telling us that even as the job market cools a bit, it certainly isn't chilly. And we're still seeing very good job numbers, we're still seeing good wage numbers. They are just slowing from the pace, the peak pace we saw at 5.8 percent, after reopening to 4.4 percent. Something else the Fed is watching is, where are wages accelerating? They are accelerating most in the service sector and leisure and hospitality. We had two months of a re-acceleration in wages in that sector and that is something the Fed is watching closely, because of course, as we spend more on services than goods, that input on costs could show up as more inflation. But that is what the Fed is trying to hedge against and they are going to be raising rates not only in July, I think we're up for a September hike as well, that said, we are close to a peak in the Fed funds rate, and I think the economy is going to cool as we get further as we get into the summer and fall months of this year.",

That's still almost a year away and that is a long time for financial markets to wait for relief from the Federal Reserve. And remember, if inflation cools, as the Fed hopes it will, that means that real interest rates will actually rise, that is nominal interest rate minus inflation will actually rise over the course of this year and into early 2024 making credit conditions all that much tighter. That is something financial markets do not want to see, of course, unless it really is about snuffing out inflation. And I think there is this sort of this wish out there that the Fed would be able to stop sooner, but the Fed is not willing to do that until they really see a cooling of underlying service sector inflation as well.",

Sweden, however, still has some hurdles to get through. We do know that of course, talks have been ongoing between delegations from Turkey and Sweden to try and clear some of those hurdles.

So, the Dutch government set out very clearly that it wanted to find that balance. Do you think that this will go to other countries, perhaps even principally in Britain, where you are maybe perhaps not by the Tory government, but that there will be pressure that the days of very cheap travel or connections in Europe should come to an end? Because they do not reflect the cost and the environment?",

But the idea, I think, here in the U.K. that we would see anything that would diminish the role of Heathrow, I think, is unlikely. And of course, there is going to be great celebration in places like Istanbul where the new airport actually has just set a record for the number of flights operated from an airport in Europe ever. They have beaten now Frankfurt. So, there's a battle of the hubs going on. And the sense I'm getting from lots of people in aviation is that very frankly, the Dutch have kind of decided to hobble their aviation industry without really knowing what else is going on. And bear in mind, of course, that the Dutch are doing pretty well.
