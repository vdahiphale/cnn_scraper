      "sentences": "And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett in New York on this Sunday night. Our breaking news continues at this hour.The FBI, as I speak, is investigating a second assassination attempt of former president Trump just about two months to the day after Trump was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. Now the former president was not harmed during the incident this afternoon, but there are so many mounting questions tonight about how another gunman was able to get so close to Trump. This time, it was this afternoon, Trump was at his club in West Palm Beach. He was playing golf. He was somewhere between holes five and six, as you can see on your screen, when a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel peeking through a fence. And the Secret Service agent then opened fire on a suspect who was hiding in the bushes. That suspect ran away, got in a car and escape for a while. He is now in custody. At the time of this, though, Trump was 300 to 500 yards away, at least twice the distance that he was in Pennsylvania. But we understand that the suspect had this long rifle, an AK-47, with a scope, which of course would make 300 to 500 yards certainly a shot. Officials say the suspect also had two backpacks and a GoPro with him in those bushes as you can see here. That GoPro, the sheriff said, set to film what the suspect thought would be an assassination of a former president. We are learning that a witness then took a picture of the getaway car and the plates after that Secret Service agent fired and the suspect ran. And it was that witness, though, taking that picture of the car that was so crucial to the suspect's capture. He drove north but is now detained in connection to the incident, and he has been identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, according to sources. A lot more details unfolding as I speak about how this happened and who he is. Initially, we understand that he was not answering questions, but that may have changed here in these past few minutes. So let's start with Kristen Holmes, obviously covering the Trump campaign. And Kristen, you have some new reporting from your sources. I know you were just on the phone talking to people inside the Trump campaign. Campaign manager just releasing a letter to the staff moments ago. What are you learning?",

That's not the case. This man is in custody and he will be brought to account and we are learning a lot about him because it appears that there is a lot to learn about him, which again there really wasn't so much in the Pennsylvania case.

The FBI is working to try to make sure that, you know, whatever charges are brought against him that they can try to make sure that they have all of the evidence before that happens, but in this case right now, you saw at the press conference there, there was the state prosecutors.They say they're holding him for now with the anticipation obviously that the fed, the federal -- the Justice Department, the U.S. attorney's office down there in the Southern District of Florida is likely to bring some federal charges. And as you heard earlier, the FBI is treating this as an apparent assassination attempt. And one of the things that they're doing at this moment is obviously they're trying to go back and see what information they can get from family members, from any social media accounts that the person may have from obviously their devices, their phone. All of that is going to give the FBI a better sense of how long this person has been planning this. And any, of course, any motivation which is something that because you have a suspect or a person who has been arrested, someone who's alive at this point, there's a lot more to learn from that in comparison to the Butler, Pennsylvania, suspect where to this day the FBI still going through some of his devices trying to gain any information they can because that person didn't leave behind any intention. So that's where things are at this hour and we expect that certainly in the next day or so the charges will begin. You'll begin to see these charges from federal prosecutors there.",

      "sentences": "So they're developing a picture of who it is they're talking to. Ryan Routh, 58 years old, as Evan said, and as Randi said, from Hawaii, but was a construction worker in North Carolina. He is an individual who's been living out loud on the social media platforms that we all use. But most interestingly, has been his continual postings about efforts to recruit fighters to go to the Ukraine.He has called out for people to send him their passport copies, their military experience, their resumes, and what other battles they have fought in. He has provided a link for fighters to, you know, populate this information. He has indicated that he's been in theater in Ukraine. So as we kind of cast about for a motive that doesn't mean that the motive is connected to Ukraine, but it is an issue where Donald Trump has been accused of dodging the question about whether he would support Ukraine or Zelenskyy. So it's something that they'll be curious about. As far as him talking and Randi said that might be changing, this is an individual who's been out front on social media, who went to what appears to be an attempted assassination with a GoPro camera attached to the fence indicating he intended to film that. Film it to post where? Film it to stream live? Film it to stream to somebody else or to do something with it later? He is probably not the kind of offender who is going to be able to not want to talk about this. So I think in the coming days we'll learn not only what we find out about him, but what he says. Also the remarkable thing is all the way back in 2002 in North Carolina, he has an arrest. One of his eight arrests, but it stood out to me because the charge was possession of a weapon of mass destruction.",

It was a machine gun that was fully automatic so when you see him today with this -- allegedly with this AK-47 and talking about having been in warzones, his familiarity and comfort with these weapons starts to emerge.",

      "sentences": "It certainly appears that way. And as you point out, you know, there was a case in North Carolina, a man by the same name, right, who was arrested in 2002. Weapon of mass destruction we hear with an AK-47.Evan, also, we find out that the Secret Service agents shoots when they see the barrel of the gun, you know, protruding from the shrub. OK. He has ceramic tiles in his backpack. He had not yet put them on, right, but it would indicate that he was ready for a firefight and would have wanted to survive. He had a getaway car. He gets in it. It's only because there's a witness who takes a picture of that getaway car. It's like something happened. This guy just ran and gone in and here's the license plate. That's our law enforcement. They credit this witness with how they were able to track him down as he drove north. Do you know anything about that, anything about that situation? The car or the getaway or the importance of this witness from your reporting?",

And so having that witness who not only helpfully said what they saw, but they also took a photograph apparently of the -- showing the license plate. They were able to then start looking for that person and they found that person very, very quickly in the highway nearby. And so, you know, Erin, this area where this golf course is located,though, I mean, those streets that surround the golf course are very, very busy in the middle of West Palm Beach. And so it's very hard to have 100 percent coverage if you have a functioning golf course, when the former president is there. I mean, it's very, very difficult to secure because, you know, he is a candidate for president. He's not the sitting president United States. And so that's one of the things that now obviously I think you're asking important questions about, you know, does maybe something needs to change? Because they've clearly added security to the former president. They have a bubble essentially that goes in front of him, making sure the holes ahead are clear, and this appears to still have happened.",

Now obviously in this case, maybe because of Pennsylvania, that Secret Service agent didn't even think twice, right. Saw a thing protruding and shot. OK. And that's -- you know, who knows what would have happened if that had not happened.But nonetheless, that's part of why we are -- now, Evan talks about a golf course. We know that it's really hard to secure a golf course even for a sitting president, it's almost impossible. It's one of the most complicated things because it's so big. But I'm curious, John, as to what you're hearing about how much security Trump is going to get. I mean, it would appear after the fact that he actually got shot in Pennsylvania then they would have really escalated it, but it's still, from what we're learning today, it still was not at the level of a current president.",

      "sentences": "So you've got a couple of things working here which is, one, his protection has been elevated almost to the level of a current president. Probably just below the level of a sitting vice president, which is much more than a former president or even a party nominee for president would normally get. That said, you know, you also have a candidate who, he doesn't like indoor rallies. He likes outdoor rallies.He likes to play golf, not pickleball, not pickleball on the court, so his -- Donald Trump being Donald Trump add some complications and pressures to the Secret Service. There is no such thing as total security. If you're not controlling basically an indoor location where you've got four sides, you can lock down. So I think as Evan talked about, you know, moving forward with this bubble, looking at that detection, and as you mentioned, immediately engaging that. We don't know even as we speak now whether or not they're still analyzing shell casings as to who's with whose, whether or not that gunman got off a shot, it appears he didn't. [20:20:02] But the Secret Service is still saying they're still interviewing people to determine whether he fired a shot or they just engaged him, saw a man with a rifle, and fired because he was pointing in their direction. So we still have some things to learn but, you know, they were certainly, they certainly did not do anything but move forward the minute they saw that.",

You know, I think Kristen Holmes, people who cover the campaign might have a better sense of this, but I don't get the sense that there's a lot of advanced notice of Trump's plans when he's doing rallies and so on. But when he's at the golf course, I'm not sure that there was a lot of advanced notice, so I'm not sure where this person might admit it's possible they were just sitting there waiting for him and waiting for the target of opportunity to emerge.And so we'll learn a lot more, as John points out. We'll learn a lot more in the coming days about exactly how he tried to pull this off and, you know, to John's point real quick, I was going to point out, you know, when President Obama was in office, he played golf, but they almost always took him to Andrews Air Force Base and I remember playing there at the golf course and what they would do is not only would there be a bubble ahead of the president, but they also would be adjacent holes on, you know, on the other side. They would make sure they would hold the golfers to make sure that you are never anywhere near in proximity to the president of the United States. And so maybe that's the next thing that you might see emerge with to protect Donald Trump, especially because as John points out, this is part of what he does. This is life.",

But obviously this was an AK-47 and it was equipped with a scope. We understand, Tim, that the reason that the Secret Service agents saw it was because it was protruding a bit from this chain link fence at the shrubbery, right?

Their presence is known and they want it to be known because it's a deterrent but for a guy like this to be sitting behind his rifle with the muzzle pointing through the fence.

And so Trump, even where he was far away from the shooter, was still within that effective range. I don't know if he was in eyesight of the shooter so he may have been preparing to take a long shot at Trump rather than wait for him to get closer primarily because he's surrounded obviously by more security, and the closer the target gets to the shooter the closer that security gets.And so that 300, 400, 500 yards, whatever it was, is well within a 600-yard range on a rifle like that, and with a decent optic, it's an easy shot to take.",

And units were able to find the vehicle and pull it over. But as far as the police go and the cooperation, it worked the way it should work but there are still questions like how did he get in there.

He was -- the camera was set up. It looked to be affixed to the fence. And I think he probably put the gun somewhere in view and he didn't realize he had done it. I think his attack was going to be much shorter range and they'll be able to find this out because you zero the scope, you adjust your scope for the distance that you're going to fire.And so what they're going to be able to do is take that rifle with the scope and find out where it was zero, where the point of aim is the point of impact. And that will give you a distance that he expected to engage his target and so I believe that we're going to find out, as Juliette said, that this guy is much more sophisticated than we would have hoped. And he was sloppy. You see that football teams today lost because, though they're very good football teams, they made mistakes. He did the same. We are very fortunate.",

      "sentences": "Well, my understanding, according to John's reporting, it was a fully automatic weapon, a machine gun to put it simply. Here's an individual when you couple that with the fact that when going through his social media and his emphasis on Ukraine claiming he was on the ground in Ukraine at one point, he's recruiting individuals allegedly to go to Ukraine to fight. When you put all this stuff together, you're talking about an individual who, one, is familiar with those types of weapons, and apparently, you know, prefers to use that style. I mean, it's an AK-47 which is typically used in that particulartheater in Ukraine, Russia, and so forth, not an AR-15, which is what we normally get here. So, I mean, it's putting all these pieces together. But the key is going to be whether or not he's talking to investigators to really kind of find out exactly, you know, what he was doing, why he was doing it. How did he know the president would be on the golf course? Does he -- I mean, I don't know if this is a routine where he frequently does it. Was he maintaining surveillance of some kind on Mar-a-Lago and looking to see where the motorcade went? We don't know any of that yet. And maybe we'll find out as time goes on, but there are still awful lot of unanswered questions about him and about his motive and the security.",

I don't know, you know, if I were him, I would be pretty angry right now and scared. But I think that a couple of things. One is a recommendation that he doesn't have open events so that the -- and, two, that the Secret Service expands the security zones to ensure that people cannot get close.You're going to have more use of aerial surveillance, probably closed downs or lockdowns of areas where he is having rallies and maybe have them take it or more indoors. All of those things are recommended. But let's be clear, he was playing golf today. This is not a political event. Candidates deserve to have time off. I really, you know, I don't care what you feel about him or who -- or Harris, I mean, you know, this is the expectation that he will be safe. And the reason why this is, you know, in some ways you said how close the election is, the promise, this is a safety issue that is being thrown into a very intense political environment in which the very fact of an assassination, a constitutional moment because it's going to, it would, could have impacted voters, will be used for political purposes and that to me is just -- not as, you know, exceptionally unfortunate because whatever your beliefs are we do deserve to have campaigns that are not part -- where violence isn't being used as either a sword or a shield in terms of what's ahead.

Oran Routh said of his father, quote, and I'm going to read some this right now. \"Ryan is my father and I don't have any comment beyond a character profile of him as a loving and caring father, and a honest, hardworking man.\"He said that he does not know what's happened in Florida, and I hope that things have just been blown out of proportion because from the little that I have heard it doesn't sound like the man I know to do anything crazy much less violent. He is a good father and a great man and I hope that you can portray him in an honest light. Again, those words from Oran Routh. That is the son of the man who has been detained in this incident, Ryan Routh, speaking to CNN just a few minutes ago. Now, we are about 10 to 15 minutes from the golf course where all of this happened. We're just outside of Mar-a-Lago where there has been an increase in the visible security around this property. The Southern Boulevard, which runs -- connects the mainland out to Palm Beach, it remains open at this hour. But if you can make out in the distance behind me here, you can see a number of police lights out here. We're told that folks are not being able to cross over onto the Palm Beach side. There is a small island that you have to cross over that is normally open to the public and so folks are able to park their cars there and get a look at Trump's Mar-a-Lago property. However, that has been closed. Again, Erin, much of these security measures that we've been seeing out here were put in place long before what happened earlier today. In fact, these security measures were put in place after the first attempted assassination of the former president in Pennsylvania.",
