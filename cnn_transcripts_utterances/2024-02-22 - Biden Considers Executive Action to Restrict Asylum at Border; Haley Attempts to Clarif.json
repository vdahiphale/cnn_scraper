In that instance, last night, you'll remember back when he referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as a dictator. But it also comes as the president has really been trying to draw this contrast between himself and former President Donald Trump, who has encouraged Putin to do \"whatever the hell he wants\" to countries that are not meeting their NATO obligations. The president has really leaned into this issue of Russia over the course of the past week, arguing that the presidents -- that Putin simply is acting like a thug, pointing to the death of Alexei Navalny as one example. Now Russia did not respond too kindly to this last night. They say -- they said in a statement that the president's comments were rude and were a huge disgrace to America. But I think it's unlikely that we will hear the president let up on any of his criticism of Putin. Maybe he won't be using such colorful language or references when he's on camera, though.",

Guys, thanks so much for joining us.I thought yesterday was a fascinating capture of kind of the 30,000- foot level of this campaign. You have immigration, which is a huge vulnerability for the Biden campaign. You also have what's happening in Alabama when it comes to IVF, which is a huge issue that Republicans are grappling with right now. We want to get into all of that. Natasha, to start with you, on the immigration issue, there's no question. You can look at poll after poll after poll. This is a problem, both substantively, policy-wise, and politically for the Biden administration. This executive order, does it change the political dynamics? NATASHA ALFORD, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it's better than nothing, right? We're looking at a president who, if he does nothing at this moment, he's going to pay a political cost for this. He's fighting with a party that, unfortunately, with the exception of those who were working on that bipartisan bill, are willing to let this issue blow up in his face for political wins. So many stories have the opportunity to basically convert people who are neutral on the issue to be against immigration, right? Having migrants hosted in schools. These are perfect stories for the right to spin against President Biden. And so, even if an executive order isn't permanent, it is something that he can then point to and say, I tried in the face of incredible headwinds.",

You're trying to kind of mitigate the bleeding when it comes to it. Republicans as they look at this, they've been Machiavellian to some degree.

That did help secure the border more, and it limited the inflow of migrants into this country. The fact that Biden unilaterally took those away led to what it his open border policies and what has led to the crisis we have at the border. And this is now not just a border state issue. This is an American issue, as we have these migrants in countries [SIC]-- cities across the country. And we just showed a number of Americans that are opposed to Biden's policies. A Pew poll shows that even Democrats, 73 percent of Democrats say Biden is handling the border very poorly. So he has got a tremendous political liability in his hands. And look, now that he is saying that he can use these executive actions to go back to Biden -- Trump-era policies, where's he been for the last three years? Why didn't he do this three years ago? I think this is too little too late on this border issue just because he is in a political year. But something needs to get done, and going back to the Trump-era policies is a good start. But also, we do need to have members of Congress on both sides of the all get together to have meaningful immigration reform. Again, Republicans and Democrats to have meaningful immigration reform to secure our national border, because this is a national security issue. But going back to Trump -policies is a very good first step.",

So Natasha, can you just talk about the bigger picture here as welisten to -- let's listen to what Nikki Haley said on CNN last night about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I didn't say that I agreed with the Alabama ruling. What the question that I was asked is, do I believe an embryo is a baby? I do think that, if you look in the definition, an embryo is considered an unborn baby. this case was based on, and should be based on, the rights of those parents for their embryos and to make sure that they have the responsibility with the doctors on how those are handled.

It is very obvious that this ruling is being used to change the definition to advance a political agenda, which therefore, would have a snowball effect in terms of access to fertility treatments. Being able to define an embryo a certain way affecting how people plan their families. And this is super risky, right, because this is not a red or a blue issue. This is about people being able to create the families that they've always dreamed of. If you're, you know, Republican, if you're independent, if you're Democrat, this is something that touches you personally. So she should follow her -- her own sort of stance, which is that these are personal issues, and reflect that in the answers that she's giving.

The deadline for the first tranche of bills comes Friday. And right now, appropriators are still trying to work through a lot of outstanding issues. Chief among them, the fact that Republicans are still pushing for controversial policy riders that typically would have no place in these kind of appropriations bills, but are really important to some conservatives who are pushing Johnson to get some kind of win in this process, because he already has agreed to spending levels that they don't like. That's why Johnson is once again finding himself in the middle. I mean, stop if you've heard me say this before. But you have a newly minted speaker. You have a divided Republican conference.

And so you -- when you have 24/7 conservative right-wing media willing to go with whatever the conspiracy of the day is, the facts kind of don't matter, unfortunately. Now, what the American people will take away from that, we will see.

Does this really matter more than what we are dealing with in our everyday lives?",
