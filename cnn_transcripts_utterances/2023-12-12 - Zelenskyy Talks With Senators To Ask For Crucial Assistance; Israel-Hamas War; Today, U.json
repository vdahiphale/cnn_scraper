What the U.S. wants to see, and again, I'm paraphrasing here, is a winter strategy of basically hold and strengthen for Ukraine.Hold what they have. Strengthen those forces. Make sure that Russia doesn't make any new gains. Ukraine wants to take the fight to Russia. Ukraine wants more of the types of attacks that they've staged on Crimea and Sevastopol over the last several months. What do you make of that discussion?",

Hold their positions on the ground while continuing to strike key targeting areas of Russia, ammunition caches, fuel caches, troop movements, key communication lines.That is going to be what the U.S. generals and the Ukrainian generals are going to be discussing over the coming months as part of a winter campaign. And that is one part I think \"The New York Times\" article did get right. Unfortunately, the couching it in failure was really a bad messaging and incorrect in terms of the description of what's been going on the battlefield.",

Meanwhile, Israel says, two crossings from Israel will open today so that aid headed into Gaza can be screened.CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us now from Kerem Shalom. What have you been seeing there?

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this was once the big -- one of the busiest crossings of aid going from Israel into Gaza, that has not been the case since October 7th. Instead, all of the aid has been going in from Egypt through that Rafah Crossing.What Israel is announcing now is that aid will be inspected before going into Gaza here at Kerem Shalom, essentially doubling, the aid that will be allowed into Gaza. That doesn't mean it will necessarily get into Gaza, but Israel has been very strict about inspecting all the aid before it goes into Gaza. They've only had one inspection point until now. Now, there is this second inspection point. So, throughout the course of the day, we've seen long lines of trucks coming to Kerem Shalom, coming into Israel from Egypt that has now stopped for the evening, it looks like. They were inspected. We saw dogs that were inspecting the trucks. The soldiers were looking inside the trucks. We saw aid from W -- from the World Food Programme. We saw a truck from the World Central Kitchen. And then, Sara, rather than going straight into Gaza, which they could do from this point, those trucks then go back to Egypt and drive up towards the Rafah Crossing. But there's no assurance that even if more aid is approved by Israel that it can get in at the Rafah Crossing, it's a real bottleneck. That crossing was not built for hundreds and hundreds of trucks every day, which is what would be needed right now. At the same time, the bombardment by Israel has created such chaos in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. So many people have fled south that it has become very difficult for aid organizations to distribute that aid. And so not all the aid that is approved can actually get in. And so, a major question right now, Sara, is when will aid be able to go from Israel into Gaza directly, which is what humanitarian officials would like to see. That, we are told, is a political decision that for whatever reason, the Netanyahu government has not yet approved.",

The latest polling out of Iowa shows that he has real work to do. A distant second to Donald Trump who has a 30 plus point lead.In the Des Moines Register poll, you see that part of it, also shows that Trump is leading with a key group of Iowa's Republican base, evangelicals. They're often a consequential voting bloc in the Iowa caucuses. They are key to Trump's support in Iowa past and present. So, can Ron DeSantis or any other candidate chip away at that support now? Joining us now is Tim Alberta. He's a staff writer for \"The Atlantic.\" He also has a new book, it's titled \"The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory: American Evangelicals in the Age of Extremism.\" It's a great book. You, Tim, you base -- the book is kind of a culmination of one, years of reporting, deep reporting, that you have -- that you put into all of your work, but also lived experience. I want to get to lived experience in just a second. But there -- when you see this polling out of Iowa, especially around evangelicals, you see what we know, which is there is -- I'm going to call it, resilience and support for Donald Trump among evangelicals in places like Iowa. From your reporting, what is the why behind that? Why evangelicals support someone whose behavior is really completely against the teachings that they follow.",

That part of it has been dark for me and quite discouraging.At the same time, you know, my own faith and my own relationship with Jesus has never been stronger, which frankly has been surprising to me. I was really worried that my faith would suffer offer as a result of this project, and, actually, it's been the opposite. And I think probably the reason for that is, you know, C. S. Lewis is my favorite author. He wrote that we only know that a line is crooked because we've first seen a straight line. And so, you know, if we believe, as my friend John Dixon says, that Jesus wrote this perfect symphony, every note flawless. But you hear somebody on the street playing their trombone or their tuba or whatever, and it sounds terrible. And you might say, oh, that's an awful symphony. And so, then you say, no, no. It's not the symphony. It's this joker trying to play it. They don't know what they're doing, but the symphony is perfect.
