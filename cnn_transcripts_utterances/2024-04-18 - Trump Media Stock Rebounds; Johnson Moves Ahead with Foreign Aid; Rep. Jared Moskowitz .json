Trump will be heading down to the courthouse where he faces the New York criminal trial. Of course, jury selection will continue. A jury expected to be seated by the end of the week. We're watching closely how much progress is made today. We're also watching closely about a social media post that Trump made about the jury.

A bill has to pass through Rules before it can get a vote on the floor.All leading up to the promised House floor votes on Saturday. A promise that has the right flank of the House Republican conference threatening to oust the Republican House speaker. Joining us right now is Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. He sits on House Oversight and the Foreign Affairs Committees. It's good to see you. Thank you so much, Congressman. You're going to vote on Saturday on these foreign aid bills said Mike - says Mike Johnson. But when it comes to Ukraine, it's been stalled so long. The pleading from Ukraine has turned into rationing ammunition on the battlefield. So, what is the message Ukraine should take from what's happening now? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ, (D-FL): Well, thanks, Kate. Thanks for having me. Look, it's better late than never, obviously. I mean there was a chance that what was going on over the last couple of months because of the politics of this on the other side of the aisle that this may not have happened at all. And so, yes, look, it is behind, right? Ukraine has lost ground because we have delayed, because of the politics of my colleagues across the aisle. But Speaker Johnson now has decided to move. As Hakeem Jeffries, my leader, said, this is a Chamberlain or Churchill moment. And it looks like Leader Jeffries is going to help potentially Mike Johnson make this a Churchill moment for all Americans. Because that's really where we are. We can't let the Freedom Caucus, the chaos caucus, the folks that literally want to see the world burn, the isolationists who would literally let Putin take Europe and would let the ayatollah in Iran take Israel. That's what they would let happen if they got - if they got their way. And so, you know, we are the democracy in the world. We are the greatest country ever on the planet.

That is a consortium of Jewish community officials, security professionals, that essentially work together to share information about threats that they're seeing. We've, obviously, been reporting on a number of threats that have spiked across the country involving the Jewish community, both real threats, as well as a series of hoax threats to Jewish institutions.And Wray told this group that particularly ahead of Passover, the FBI is certainly on alert. He said that throughout his law enforcement career he can't think of a time when so many different types of threats were elevated all at once. And as you mentioned, you know, after that October 7th Hamas attack, Wray said that threats to the Jewish community were already elevated. But after that, the FBI ended open - ended up opening three times more cases involving threats to Jewish Americans and Jewish interests here in the United States. And so you can certainly see just how serious the bureau was taking that. He says that they continue to investigate with, quote, \"full force.\" That force including thousands of FBI agents, analysts, professional staff, as well as task force officers that are on alert around the world. Now, interestingly, Wray also said that they're not just focused on a lone wolf attacks and home grown threads, but since October 7th they've seen what he described as a rogues gallery of threats from overseas as well, from foreign terrorist organizations. He also made reference to last weekend's attack on Israel by Iran using missiles, using drones, saying that the FBI has been particularly concerned about the threat posed by Iran, that they have uncovered plots here in the United States to assassinate the U.S. official, to assassinate U.S. journalists. And so certainly something very concerning. He said that as we go into Passover and even beyond, he's warning the Jewish community, law enforcement across the country to be vigilant, to be on alert, particularly concerning Iran, both any type of attacks from Iran, but also proxy groups that may also stem from some of these recent threats. So, certainly a very serious threat. You have thousands of law enforcement officials across the country on alert, Sara.",

In Florida, you know, a six-week ban, which advocates - abortion rights advocates call nearly a total abortion ban. And so, you know, states are going to take those types of positions. You're not going to get a sort of moderate, compromise position out of a lot of states if you leave it up to them. What you're going to get is this extreme patchwork where in some states abortion is banned almost completely and in other states anything goes. You know, in a lot of blue states, access to abortion has been dramatically expanded since the fall of Roe.So, you know, if this remains - and what - what Arizona Republicans, what some of them are advocating now, is to put some kind of competing amendment on the ballot. We expect that there will be a constitutional amendment on the ballot in Arizona this fall that would ask voters whether they want to basically reinstate Roe and have abortion legal up to the point of viability.
