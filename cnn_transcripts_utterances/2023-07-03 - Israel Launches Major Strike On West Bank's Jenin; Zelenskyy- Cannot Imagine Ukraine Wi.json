The death toll rises and the largest Israeli military operation engineer in over 20 years. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says Putin's power is crumbling. The World Health Organization is taking a closer look at the potentially harmful health effects of the artificial sweetener, aspartame. And Wimbledon gets underway in London. Now, two fast moving developments from Ukraine, at least one person has been killed in a drone strike on residential buildings in the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. That information is coming from the Ukrainian presidential office. It follows a barrage of drone attacks overnight. Ben Wedeman is in eastern Ukraine where there are developments in the battle for the city of Bakhmut. Ben, great to have you on. Look, the front lines, the most contested when you look at what's happening in Bakhmut. Could you take us through the latest in terms of what we're seeing on the ground?",

The fighting there appears to be very intense. So, it's very hard at this moment to get access to that area because of the intensity of that fighting. But what we've seen really over the last week is at best marginal gains by the Ukrainians in the southern area, south of Zaporizhzhia. They've taken perhaps 29 square kilometers, which really brings the total amount of territory they have seized from the Russians since this counter offensive began were now into the -- it's well into its third week, maybe somewhere between 150 and 160 square kilometers. Now, in fact, in the in the round the town of Svatove, which is in the Luhansk region, it's that town is currently held by the Ukrainians. But the Russians apparently are launching a counter offensive of their own in that area. And the Ukrainian troops are under severe pressure in that town. So, it appears that even though our focus now for many weeks, if not months, has been on the plans and then execution of this counter offensive, it appears that the Russians, despite all we've heard about poor supplies, poor logistics, poor leadership, they still are capable of launching counter offensives of their own. So, the situation very ambiguous given that, as I said, the progress has been modest at best as far as the counter offensive by the Ukrainians go. Eleni.",

We've got Elliott Gotkine in Tel Aviv for us. Elliott, great to have you with us. I want to start off with this raid.

And we saw just a couple of weeks ago, Israel using an Apache helicopter to carry out an airstrike there, which itself was the first time something like that had happened in some 20 years as well. So, it's already sees this as the kind of epicenter of this rising wave of militant attacks against Israeli citizens, not just in the West Bank, but in inside the green line as well against Israelis. And that is something that Israel's right-wing government is very keen to try to stamp out. And of course, the other objective of this incursion that we're seeing today is try to reduce the amount of future attacks that can be carried out against Israelis as well. But it is a very densely populated area. And inevitably, there will be some people that are not infinite, uninvolved, who will be either injured or perhaps worse, in this incursion. We don't have all the details just yet. But as I say, it's ongoing. And so long as this operation continues, one would expect the casualty figures to rise as well. (CROSSTALK)",

The understanding is that those who drowned the car into his house may have been trying to set it alight when his wife and two small children were inside. That's why you've got the show support here in L'Hay-les-Roses, and these calls for calm, frankly, with what we saw as a huge escalation on Friday night. And then, little by little fewer and fewer arrests over the course the weekend, until last night, with just 157. But still, a determined effort from the part of the president to figure out what happened, he'll meet not only with those assembly leaders and Senate leaders tonight. But with 220 mayors from some of the towns and cities that have been so badly affected by the violence of the last few days. Perhaps the most important call for calm and we have yet to know whether this will make all the difference. In fact, the Paris police chief has said -- has welcomed the fact that there has been a dampening down of the tension and the fact that there have been fewer degradations and fewer arrests, but still warns that this might not be over yet.

And they're going to look specifically, Eleni, at what is the daily amount of aspartame a person can take that they consider to be acceptable when it comes to potential health effects. So, those are one of the areas where this group is going to assess. And what we know about aspartame, I mean, it's in a several food and drink items like diet sodas, and cereals. But also, it can be found in chewing gum, cough drops, even some toothpaste. So, this is an ingredient that many of us encounter on a daily basis. And we know that WHO assessed the safety of aspartame back in 1981. And the decades since then, there have been several other studies on this ingredient. And here, the United States, the FDA has its recommended limited amount of aspartame to have each day. It says for a 175-pound man, the limited amount would be 22 cans of diet soda, because that's equivalent to consuming about 50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight per day. So, as you know, that's an enormous amount. So, people should know there are questions about the potential health impacts of aspartame, but you really need to have a large amount to see these potential harmful health effects that are being assessed. So, that's kind of the takeaway here. But again, it will be interesting to see what the WHO committee has come out with in the coming days on July 14, when they announced their risk assessment.",

And as we were discussing earlier, you know, that it's not just a question of targeting wanted militants that Israel is after and also destroying some of the infrastructure that it says is supporting these militant groups, in particular, the Jenin Brigades, which is -- which is affiliated with Islamic Jihad, but it's also they say about changing the mindset, changing the way that Jenin is perceived by the militants, as a place of refuge, as a safe haven, as somewhere as a base from which they can launch attacks against Israel. Because ultimately, what Israel is trying to do is to reduce the likelihood, and certainly, the frequency of attacks that are emanating from Jenin. And, but of course, the longer this goes on, not only could we potentially see more casualties, but we can also see the risks of escalation growing as well. We've already seen pictures from Gaza, where some people have burning tires now. There's no sign of that flaring up just yet. But of course, in this region, we know that, you know, things can change very quickly.
