The questions are mounting about how a gunman was able to get so close to Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. The gunman was near the sixth hole when a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through the fence and opened fire in the direction of the gunman. Trump was one hole away, approximately, and was unharmed. Law enforcement sources say that Ryan Wesley Routh has been detained in connection with the incident and, so far, is not speaking to investigators. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm surmising that he's played golf there so many times that there is a package and a deployment plan for that golf course when he plays that they've been using for some time.The biggest thing that could be a difference would be additional personnel spread out more broadly around the course. Perhaps some other technology -- you know, drones or something -- other efforts could be put in place. And I'm sure the Service is rethinking all of that. But it's important to point out that the plan that they had did, in fact, intercept the threat. So I'm sure there's going to be an evaluation that's going to take place.

So the Harris-Walz campaign having a lot of fun with this. The Trump campaign -- I don't think it's the smartest move. But I just will note this is not his first issue with Taylor Swift. Back in 2018 when Taylor Swift had endorsed Democratic candidates that cycle, Trump said I think I like her music about 25 percent less. It looks like that 75 percent has diminished at this point.
