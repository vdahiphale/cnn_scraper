Be proactive about it. In addition, I would absolutely sign up for credit monitoring and do something that not a lot of people know about, which is set up a PIN access to your credit, which is incredibly simple, but relatively powerful. You can basically go online or you can call each of the three major credit reporting bureaus and set up a special PIN or code that only you know, that way if someone does have your Social Security number, they can't just go set up a line of credit in your name, they also have to have that PIN. It is just another layer of security. And then addition to that, just by and large, whenever you're on the internet, you should be practicing good cybersecurity hygiene everywhere you go, which includes strong usernames, strong passwords, and using something called multi-factor authentication, which is another added layer of security that will help keep you safe from breaches like this.",

That's begun to cut up the remnants of the bridge that we can then prepare for removal. The complicated nature of this is we have a ship that is nearly the size of the Eiffel Tower that is now stuck within the channel that has the Key Bridge sitting on top of it, and so this is going to be a long road.

We were only about a hundred yards away from the wreckage and it helped us just appreciate exactly what they are doing and the fact that they have to go step by step in a methodical way to lift every piece off. There are 4,000 tons of concrete and metal that are sitting on top of the front of the ship, and that's going to be one of the most difficult parts of the job because it is all pancaked together in there. They have to be so careful, and all of this is the effort to both reopen the port as soon as possible, but also the recovery of these victims, as you said, there are four families who have yet to recover the bodies of their loved ones.

Officers patrolling the area say they heard several gunshots around 11:30 local time. CNN's Ivan Rodriguez is here with more on this. What are police saying? IVAN RODRIGUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, Indianapolis Police say that they rushed to the scene, found a large group of children, six of them immediately they noticed had been hit with gunshot wounds. They were taken to a local hospital. Those who were injured, and then a seventh child later at a different local hospital. Now right now, all of them are recovering from their injuries, but no arrests have been made so far. Now this map here is showing the locations and dates of all the recent mass shootings in Indianapolis. All of the shootings are within 25 minutes of each other, although they are not connected. On March 16th, a night club shooting left one person dead and five others injured. The following weekend, March 24th, one person was killed, five others, including an off-duty Indianapolis Metro Police officer were injured after a shooting outside a bar early Sunday morning. And now last night, an incident involving youth violence of greater issue, the city of Indianapolis has been trying to get ahead of for the last several months.

There are some allegations out there that there is $6 million in clients' money that has not been recovered and perhaps there is another lawyer involved and prosecutors are concerned that if they enter into a plea deal where he is able to get sentenced with a concurring sentence, that if he is successful with respect to his appeal related to the convictions for murder, that he could have a shortened sentence as a result of that and not serve a natural life, sort of his natural life in prison, and these prosecutors don't want him ever to see sunlight again.

Where we are right now is at a rally for the incumbent mayor of Istanbul, his name is Ekrem Imamoglu. This is a man who is widely considered to be one of the only, perhaps the only opposition figure strong enough and popular enough to be able to take on Erdogan and win in a presidential race and not only has Imamoglu manage to win back his seat as the mayor of city, but he has won it, at least according to results so far, quite comfortably by a nine-point margin. And on top of that, Fredricka, the district within Istanbul where Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, was born and was raised, Beyoglu, also appears to be on track to be won by Imamoglu's opposition and more secular CHP Party. And this is a race that Erdogan has really personally injected himself into, as well. His face is all over banners and billboards in the city and he has come here to Istanbul several times in the days leading up to race. And perhaps, this is not surprising, the win here, because Turkey is really struggling with its economy right now. You have inflation that remains out-of-control. You have interest rates that have hit 50 -- five-zero -- percent right now, and that is really hitting people where it hurts, which is their wallets. One other thing to mention, Fredricka and that is that now that Erdogan potentially has a formidable candidate in the next presidential race, should they both choose to run, there will be more focus on the charges against the incumbent mayor, Imamoglu stemming from the 2019 election for insulting public officials, charges that many has said were politically motivated. They are still winding their way through the court appeals process down. Now, they could come back to really hurt Imamoglu, but of course, now, there will be a lot more focus on what happens inside the court room -- Fredricka.",

It is called The Little Shop of Kindness and it opened its doors in the Upper East Side of Manhattan last month to help address the ongoing migrant crisis and counter any hostility that they may have faced while being there in New York City.Joining me right now is CNN digital reporter, Alaa Elassar. So good to see you. So tell us more about -- you wrote about this cute little shop. Tell us more about how it came to be. Who is responsible for it? And what kind of needs might it be addressing?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. I am really excited to talk about this amazing little shop.So as most New Yorkers will remember, in 2022, Republican governors started busing migrants from Texas to New York City. As a result, thousands of migrants arrived in New York City's Port Authority bus terminal, really confused, no idea where to go, and volunteers with an organization called Team TLC NYC was meeting them, helping them, give them food, water, and one of these volunteers was Ilse Thompson and she recognized very quickly that there was a desperate need for clothes, especially. A lot of these people have been traveling for weeks, if not months, with almost nothing, so she had the idea to start a free little shop of kindness where migrants would be able to walk in to what look like a typical boutique or clothing store, find clothes, shoes, hygiene products, but even little things like jewelry, purses, and children's toys.",

Everybody you see in that shop is a volunteer and everything is donated by the amazing people of New York City, and it is really easy to do so.You know, they have a website. They coordinate donations and it is just a beautiful thing to see the people of New York City come together to take care of the migrants and kind of fight that stigma that they are a burden and that this is a crisis that can't be solved, and it just shows kindness goes a long way and it is the little things that matter.",

They struggled a bit. Crimson Tide Guard Mark Sears starting out the game going, oh for setting then including oh for four from beyond the arc. He actually scored his first points of the game with just over four minutes left in the first half. But then in the second half, the floodgates really started to open, Sears draining shot after shot, finishing with a game-high 23 points with seven threes. Clemson, by the way, had allowed only 14 threes in its first three NCAA tournament game. So Bama Coach Nate Oats, cutting down the net after the 89-82 win sending the Tide to the Final Four for the first time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
