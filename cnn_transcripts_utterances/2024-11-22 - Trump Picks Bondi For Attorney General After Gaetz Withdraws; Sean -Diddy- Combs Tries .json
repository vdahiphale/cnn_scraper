First, he withdrew his name for U.S. attorney general, and today he announced he will not return to Congress despite having won reelection just a few days ago. So what happens with that house ethics committee report about him?

She's President-elect Donald Trump's new selection to be the U.S. attorney general. You could say the gates of opportunity opened up for her when, of course, thank you for the pity laugh over there, when former Congressman Matt Gaetz reading the room, took his name out of contention for the AG spot yesterday. Now, Gaetz today announced that he will not rejoin Congress, even though he did win reelection earlier this month and that unreleased House Ethics Committee report into Gaetz over alleged sexual misconduct, allegations he denies, would have surely been waiting to drop had he decided to return to the House. Now, Bondi does not appear to have that sort of baggage to contend with, so Trump's allies think she will have a much easier confirmation process in the U.S. Senate. She does have a reputation for being media savvy and an effective litigator. She was part of Trump's defense team during the first impeachment trial, for which he was acquitted. She also toed the line on Trump's election lies after he lost in 2020. We'll have much more on Trump's bond with Bondi just ahead. And we're also still waiting for Trump to decide who will fill that last major administration role, treasury secretary. Sources tell CNN that Trump is also expected to offer former Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler the role of the secretary of agriculture. As he contemplates those roles today, Mr. Trump got another win in the legal sphere. The judge overseeing his criminal hush money trial postponed his sentencing. Remember, he was convicted. That sentencing has been postponed indefinitely. Let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes in West Palm Beach, Florida, for the latest on the Trump transition. Kristen, now that Mr. Trump has picked an attorney general nominee, one who is not Matt Gaetz, what is next for Gaetz and what's next for Trump in terms of administration picks?",

The concern is whether she can be impartial in this role that Trump has made clear he wants to leverage to pursue his political rivals.She was a prosecutor in Florida for 18 years before she became the state's first female attorney general. One of her biggest accomplishments while in that role was targeting pill mills, at a time when Florida was considered the pill mill capital of the U.S. But one particular event in her -- her record really has drawn a lot of scrutiny, and that is in 2013. Her office received complaints about individuals being scammed by Trump University seminars. Her political committee received a $25,000 donation from the Donald Trump Foundation in September of that year, and soon after, she dropped her investigation into the alleged fraud citing insufficient grounds. Now, Bondi has denied wrongdoing and she was cleared by an ethics panel, but that is likely something that's going to come up during a confirmation hearing. But since that time, she has been a top Trump surrogate. She defended him in his first impeachment. She also defended him in the court of public opinion over the past several years while he has faced multiple criminal cases. But after Trump lost in 2020, Bondi did push false claims about the outcome of the election and amplified those lies and that's one of the things that people are concerned about. That is an example of why people are concerned about whether she may try to use the enormous power and resources of the Justice Department to pursue priorities that Trump has made clear, including going after his political rivals. So that is probably going to be one of the main questions that she will face during her confirmation hearings.",

I mean, they created a facility only designated to count these votes. They really they really addressed all of the concerns that created the groundwork for those kind of conspiracy theories to foster that, she was propagating and promulgating. They have since been disproved. I mean, we know very clearly after many audits who won Pennsylvania in 2020. So I think what she has to do is answer to the Senate, who won Pennsylvania in 2020 and be clear about the things that she said in because there's a plausible deniability for her. Look, it was a few days after the election. Nobody knew it was before the election had been called. And there was very slow counting and new rules that had been passed in Pennsylvania because of the pandemic. So it's, I think, fair for her to clarify if the statement she made two days after the election at the time when they were still counting the ballots about dead people counting, she still believes to be true, because what we know in the in the fullness of time is that they were not true and that she was spreading conspiracy -- conspiracy theories.",

For the first time, the majority of Americans believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party represents the interests of the of the wealthy and the elite. That is a damning indictment on our party brand.

And then on the -- and on immigration, Democrats were saying everything's fine and -- initially at least. And if you bring up these issues, then you know, you're racist.

The right track, wrong track numbers never really changed, right? This was a change electorate and they were feeling an economic squeeze and they were going to take it out on the party in power, which was the Democrats. That happened all over the world.

In fact, the only time in the history of this country that a president was reelected after hyperinflation was 1972, with Richard Nixon.

Just in the past year. His ex-girlfriend Cassie, who was depicted in that CNN video that we first obtained and put out, she was the first lawsuit back in November of 2023, and since then, there have been more than 30.

His attorneys telling me over and over again that he has never sexually assaulted anyone, that he has never trafficked anyone. But I have spoken to sources who explain that these civil suits could serve as a roadmap of sorts for prosecutors, right? You have the case as it stands right now. It was a three count indictment. But as Kara has reported from inside the courtroom, the prosecutors have said they are continuing this investigation and that they could add more defendants and they could add more charges. I have heard from sources that the grand jury has repeatedly been convening, and they have been hearing testimony from more witnesses. So could this case grow whether it is in, again, more charges but also more defendants? Remember, there are celebrities. We don't know who they are, but there are celebrities who have been accused of participating or being aware in the accusations against Combs and prosecutors themselves in this indictment.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The scramble for the dead or the living horrifically commonplace in Ukraine. Yet this series of homes in Kyiv turned to rubble by something other, not Russian, but a North Korean supplied ballistic missile and made able to fly here to cause this barbarism, killing a man and his 4-year-old son by circuitry from the United States. Ukrainian officials told CNN ballistic missile attacks by Russia were rising fast. 194 so far this year and about a third of them, at least 60, were using North Korean KN-23s. But these crude missiles part of growing aid as North Korean troops also come to Russia rely on a sophistication smuggled into their hermit kingdom.
