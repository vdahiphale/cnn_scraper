In this redirect, they were trying to repair any additional damage that had been done to Cohen's credibility during the cross-examination. Joining us now is a former communications director for Trump, the Trump administration, Mike Dubke. He's the founding partner of the Blackrock Group. Mike, obviously, the goal of the defense was to really ding Michael Cohen yet again. They did it on several occasions. First, last week, when it came to that key call that he said he had had with Trump about the Stormy Daniels case. And then the second time came today when they pointed out that he had stolen money from the Trump Organization. What do you think has been the impact on Cohen's, frankly, already pretty damaged credibility in this case?",

Trump wanted to basically fix a poll that he didn't like from CNBC.

We will have a live report on that coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:41:50] WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: We're also following new developments right now surrounding the death of the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. The country's military has reportedly ordered an investigation into what caused Sunday's death deadly crashed. President Raisi, his foreign minister and seven others were all killed when their helicopter went down in a remote mountainous region. There was very heavy fog at the time. Technical experts and other officials are expected to visit the crash site. Meantime, the bodies of the victims will be transferred to President Raisi's hometown tomorrow, according to Iranian media. CNN's Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann is covering these developments for us. Oren, what are you hearing? What's the latest?",

He said the U.S. has no insights into what possibly caused this crash or what might have happened that led up to the events and the crash itself. He said the U.S. is watching this very closely. But in terms of the investigation of what happened, he said, the U.S. will leave that to the Iranians and wait to see what information the Iranians put forward. Of course, he was asked several times about this at a press conference that wrapped just a short time ago. And he said, look, there is no answer or cause that the U.S. has right now. And he said it could be any number of things, from mechanical failure to pilot error or a number of other possibilities that could have led to this crash. The U.S., at this point, simply does not know. He was asked, point blank, if the U.S. had any involvement or what the U.S. would do if Iran decided to blame it or Israel for being involved in this crash. And he said, very bluntly, that the U.S. had no part in this crash and that's a fact. He made that one of the clearest statements throughout the course of the press conference that the U.S. was not involved in his crash. We saw President Joe Biden was briefed on it in the hours afterwards. But even at that point yesterday, there was no public comment as the U.S. waited to see how this unfolded, what happened and what happened to those on board the accident -- onboard the helicopter. At this point, Austin still keeping his distance and saying were watching what's happening, the U.S. is monitoring what's happening. But at this point, Wolf, no insight into what caused that helicopter crash on Sunday.",

And yet, Iran still uses them. And because of U.S. sanctions, it's difficult to get the necessary equipment and the necessary tools to keep these up-to-date. Could that have played a part? Certainly.

And that includes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for the assault on Gaza. Now the court is also seeking warrants for Hamas' top political and military leaders for crimes against humanity for the October 7th terrorist attack.

Michael Cohen testified on direct examination, being questioned by prosecutors, that on October 24, 2016, at 8I had this crucial call. I called Keith Schiller's cell phone. He was Donald Trump's right-hand man. And then Schiller put me on with Trump or put me on speaker. Cohen didn't remember. And I basically said to Trump, OK, Stormy Daniels' situation is resolved. On cross-examination now, Donald Trump's lawyers got up and they confronted Michael Cohen with a series of texts. And if we look at the timeline, we can see they basically lead up to that 8:02 call and then after the 8:02 call. And what they revealed is that you, Michael Cohen, were texting with Keith Schiller leading up to that 8:02 p.m. call about something totally different, about this 14-year-old who was harassing you with texts. And then you had the call at 8:02. And then right after the call, Cohen sent the phone number of the 14-year-old to Keith Schiller. So they argued, what you were really doing was talking to Keith Schiller about the 14-year-old, not Donald Trump about the Stormy Daniels payment. Now, to the photograph, prosecutors want to show this photograph, which is pulled off of C-SPAN, showing that, at 7:57, five minutes before this call, Donald Trump and Keith Schiller were physically together. Because prosecutors want to argue Cohen could have talked to both of them at the same time, which is a good point for prosecutors. It doesn't really undo the effects of the cross-examination but it does give them a bit of a fallback. I mean, I don't think Cohen would even argue with that. Like, he could have talked to them both at the same time. But prosecutors want to score this point. Schiller and Trump were physically together, could have talked to both of them about both the 14 and Stormy Daniels.",

It's more what their client thinks. And he probably was pleased at the fact that Michael Cohen has been embarrassed. He's been -- he's been outed as a -- as a fraud, a liar, a stealer. But again, overall, the -- the question I guess hanging over this now as we head into this week, is Trump going to testify or not?
