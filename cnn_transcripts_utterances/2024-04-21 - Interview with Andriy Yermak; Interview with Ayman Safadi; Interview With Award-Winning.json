The Senate is expected to pass it this week before President Biden signs it into law. It is the first major aid package for Ukraine in well over a year and it comes at a vital time as Moscow inches forward in the east and Kyiv's forces appear outmanned and outgunned.Last night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the funding would be used to bring a just end to this war, a war that Putin must lose. Joining me from Kyiv is Andriy Yermak. He is a key member of President Zelenskyy's inner circle and heads the president's office. Andriy, pleasure to have you on. First, let me ask you, now that this aid has passed, do you expect to see results in the -- on the field very quickly? I know you were on the frontlines yesterday.",

We're in bad shape, rag-tag army, have no ships. We want you to go to France and woo Louis XVI, the largest, you know, monarchy in the world to support this little tiny democracy that America has just been formed.

But there has been friction over a bid by Japanese firm Nippon Steel to acquire the storied American company, U.S. Steel.U.S. Steel formed in 1901, was involved in building major American bridges and iconic skyscrapers. It helped win World War II by supplying steel for ammunition and ships to land American forces. But over time, the lumbering giant struggled to compete with foreign rivals. It also fell behind domestic competitors who embrace innovation. The most recent figures put it at 27th among the world's steel producers. In December, U.S. Steel agreed to a takeover by Nippon Steel, which offered to pay 40 percent over the stock price. Nippon would inject innovation and efficiency into the ailing American company but the deal is in jeopardy. The Steelworkers union is suspicious of the new management and opposes the acquisition. Prominent Republicans and Democrats have come out against it, including President Biden. The deal could be blocked on national security grounds though it strains credulity to say that a takeover by one of America's closest allies, as President Biden keeps saying, poses a threat. In fact, I would argue the deal is good for national security because it would bring much needed investment and expertise to bolster American steel production. With the merger, Nippon would become the world's second-largest steel producer able to compete with the industry's biggest players who are mostly Chinese. Well, I recently spoke to the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel. And if you watched last week's show, you saw a portion of our conversation already.
