The name of your book gives me a little bit of pause because one thing is, you didn't just write it after this week. It wasn't like it's here right now when you see all that's going on in Congress. It's instead, anytime that it's relevant again, tells me this has happened before, which is very scary to think about. I mean, you heard Tim Burchett, McCarthy's incident, juvenile at best, maybe more nefarious at worst. What do you think when you saw this?",

So maybe part of what I was thinking today was all of this happened in one day. That in and of itself is not typical.But I suppose really what it made me think of is, in a sense, something that I concluded from the work that I did on my book, which is what we're seeing is reflective of the state of affairs in Congress today in the Republican Party and the state of the nation. And by that, I mean, if you think about what political parties typically can do, one of the things that they can do in one way or another is enforce discipline of some kind, party discipline, keep the members in line, keeping them from perhaps punching each other or maybe shoving them in a hallway or throwing out names in a hearing. Another thing that political parties typically can do is they have an agenda or a mission or a policy that draws them together and unites them and enables them to work together and, again, tamps down some of the kind of behavior that we saw today. So, part of what went through my mind as a historian is, well, we're looking at the impact of a party that is not a functional party and without all of the things that a party does, all of the control that it can enforce. We're seeing all of this sort of flying off at all sides as to uncontrolled behavior in Congress.",

A hospital, Israel says, includes a Hamas command center, an allegation denied by hospital officials and Hamas.

So, first of all, what is meant by this, and I'm quoting them, \"targeted and precise operation?\" STEVE ANDERSON, RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL, U.S. ARMY: Well, Laura, what we're talking about here is precise operation in a compound. This is not just a hospital building, but it's a compound. You got 1,500 faculty members, staff members and patients, and there's probably thousands of people living in the areas, in these sheltered areas, in this area right here. So, what you got to do is you got to pinpoint exactly what -- you got to pinpoint these spots and conduct precision operation. That doesn't mean indiscriminate fighting or indiscriminate firing of missiles. It means going in with boots on the ground to take out the bad guys. You physically have to go in and occupy these buildings. And in this case, tunnels, because there's many tunnels as we know underneath here.

They have essentially come across here, they're moving up from the south, they're coming down from the north, they're also surrounding this area, and they've got this noose that they're applying.
