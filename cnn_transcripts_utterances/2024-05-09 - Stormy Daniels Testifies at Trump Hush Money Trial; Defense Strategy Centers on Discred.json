Jake Tapper is outside of the courthouse in New York. He has been inside the courthouse all day and any moment now, a junior bookkeeper who worked for the Trump organization as a bookkeeper, still working for the organization, will be returning to the stand for cross-examination. Earlier, we heard from adult film star Stormy Daniels who's the woman at the center of this criminal case. The defense spent more than three hours questioning Daniels today, pressing her for gaps between what she said in the past and what she said this week under oath, Jake.",

Stormy Daniels pushed back, at times appeared a touch combative, as Trump's attorney tried to establish some of the ways Stormy Daniels has gained financially from going public with her story. Just before court broke for lunch, the defense raised issues with Judge Merchan, including a renewed motion for a mistrial. Merchan said the court's going to review the matters when the jury is dismissed later this afternoon. With us now is CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reed and CNN chief domestic correspondent Phil Mattingly. So, Paula, let me start with you. And let's start with this mystery woman that we don't even have a photograph of her, Rebecca Manochio. Before the break, she testified about, how she handled Trump's personal cheques, how the process worked. Why is she an important witness for the prosecution? She's there under protest. She's subpoenaed. She's giving one word answers. Quite honestly, no offense to her, she doesn't seem exactly like anybody who came up with or hatched any sort of scheme. She's the Fedexer.",

They refuse to even agree that, yes, this is the way the cheques got from the Trump Organization to the White House once Trump became president. That's a defense strategy, right? Bog the jurors down in boring, tedious testimony, random witnesses. So she is not going to make a break in this case, but she is explaining to the jury how these cheques went, again, from the Trump Organization to the White House. As I understand it from this testimony, it's not even clear she is specifically testifying about the checks that eventually went to Michael Cohen, just generally about the process.",

She had obviously been coached that if somebody says you said something and you don't know that you said it, ask to see the quote. That happened at least two or three times. So I thought she was pretty well prepared. But again, I mean, look, I'm not comparing Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump, but they both have brands. They both look for opportunities to make money. They both seek ways to have an edge in public life. And in that way, they were similar. And they certainly portrayed her as that. And she had no problem acknowledging that's who she is.",

Yeah, the Trump side. So I think it's more like looking more at what we're talking about in that context, which is, did we hear anything over the last couple of days that would speak to a motivation that's not a motivation, that's not about the election, right? That's not about protecting a reputation that you feel like could be proactively harmed in advance of the campaign.This is, I mean, not my opinion, but sort of where this prosecution has put us in terms of trying to figure out what we're hearing. So when she's up there, it's not about judging her, right? It's about like, oh, okay, she's saying something that seems so bad, people would scramble around to try and fix it, and then going from there.

But I think, first of all, as we've had reporting here on CNN, they're trying to appease their clients, perhaps political, perhaps personal desires.The other thing is, and this happens in a lot of trials, the further you can drag a case into the muck, the farther you can drag this case away from the actual charges in the indictment almost always inures to the defendant's benefit. Because any time you have the jury going, why are we getting into what did they eat? Who was wearing what pajamas? This is a falsification of business records. The case were five steps away from it.

Our special coverage continuing all hour. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [14:20:09] TAPPER: Court is just moments away from beginning again. A few minutes ago, Donald Trump walked back into the courtroom. Trump's defense team today repeatedly attacking the credibility of porn star and director Stormy Daniels in cross-examination. Especially by targeting her work in the adult film industry and how she has profited from this encounter with Mr. Trump, alleged encounter, I should say. One exchange between Trump's attorney and Stormy Daniels went like this. Susan Necheles Trump's attorney, says, you have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be, and Stormy Daniels responded, Wow, that's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room. The sex is real. That's why it's pornography, unquote. Kristen Holmes is with me now. Kristen, you're the one that broke the story that Trump's attorney changed their strategy and decided to cross-examine Stormy Daniels longer than they had intended to, and to perhaps be more aggressive. Did they succeed?",

That's Susan Necheles set out to be aggressive, to really pin down Stormy Daniels, and that they feel as though she did. And obviously, as we saw, and you were in the room, but as I read through the transcript, there were times when Stormy Daniels couldn't even get an answer out. The judge actually had to intervene. That was Susan Necheles being that aggressive bulldog that Donald Trump wants her to be. Now, it wasn't just about the fact that they wanted to go more into Stormy Daniels, but they were also trying to poke holes in her story. As we've heard Kara Scannell say, often the defense will wait until what they actually hear during the prosecution's testimony or questioning, and then try to reframe their questioning. And that's really what they were trying to do here.You saw Susan Necheles over and over again saying exactly what Stormy Daniels had said in her testimony to the prosecution, and then looking back at old interviews, looking back at old articles, at old speaking engagements, everything that she had said in the past, trying to undermine her story here. Now, of course, the big question is going to be how Donald Trump reacts, because we do know that one of the things that Donald Trump has been frustrated with when it comes to his lawyers in this case, he wants them to be more aggressive, to be that kind of attack dog, that pit bull.

And Stormy Daniels, who'd obviously prepared to challenge the defense attorneys when they said that she had said things that she didn't remember saying, said, where did I say that? Can you show me where I said that? And she brought up a tweet where Stormy Daniels were a fan of Trump, referred to as Stormy Daniels as a human toilet. And she said something along the lines of that's why you need me to flush down the orange turd. I'm just quoting court testimony today. And I mean that. And she said, I don't. I don't see the word integral. I don't see the word jail. Susan Necheles was taking some liberties. I don't know if that might have cost Susan Necheles with the jury.

I think one of the most telling parts to me was in that cross-examination yesterday or Tuesday, when she kind of stepped in when Stormy Daniels was laughing and saying, is this funny to you? Now, if a man had said that during cross-examination, it might have come off as more aggressive than having a woman do that. And that's part of why you choose who you choose to do cross-examination.That was very clear in this line as well. Now, again, in terms of whether or not she crossed lines or pushed boundaries, I did speak to one attorney who said it would have been negligent for her to not go after her story in various ways. She had to go through, she had to go through all of those old interviews, all of those old transcripts. And even this attorney said the same thing, which is, did she do her job for a client? Yes, probably. How does it actually play with the jury? That we just don't know.",
