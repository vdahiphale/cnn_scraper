I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is wondering about long-term consequences.Just days after announcing his controversial decision to send cluster bombs to Ukraine, a weapon his administration once referred to as constituting a potential war crime, President Biden is heading overseas this morning, where he and the larger NATO alliance will face a key test over whether they can remain united as they face down numerous thorny international challenges. Tomorrow, the president starts his trip in the U.K., meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, then visiting with newly crowned King Charles III. Then it's off to Lithuania for what will undoubtedly be the trickiest part of the president's trip, two days of meetings with key NATO allies over Russia's war in Ukraine the refusal of NATO members Turkey and Hungary to welcome Sweden into the NATO alliance, conflicting opinions on curbing China's growing influence. The meeting will require diplomatic deftness, with questions about the endgame in Ukraine and just exactly how committed NATO is to Ukraine winning the war, all while dealing with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's calls to immediately admit Ukraine into NATO. Zelenskyy told my colleague Erin Burnett this week that that decision is entirely up to President Biden. Biden told my colleague Fareed Zakaria that Ukraine is not ready to join NATO. Joining us now to discuss, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas. Chairman McCaul, thanks so much for being with us. So, one of the biggest subjects on the NATO agenda, whether to fast- track Ukraine's push to join NATO. I want you to take a listen to what President Zelenskyy told my colleague Erin Burnett this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The U.S. decides today whether Ukraine will get invited to NATO. This is today's situation, and it's a fact. The majority of the NATO countries support inviting Ukraine to NATO.",

I think, first, they have to win the counteroffensive, secondly, have a cease-fire, and then negotiate a peace settlement. We cannot admit Ukraine into NATO immediately. That would put us at war with Russia under Article 5 of the United Nations. So I think what the conversation is going to be about is, what security agreements can be put in place with Ukraine as a predicate to perhaps NATO -- ascension of Ukraine into NATO? I think it's way too premature to be talking about that. But I do think just to talk about it does provide deterrence against Russia. But we have to be careful in the way we do this. Now, remember, back in the Budapest agreement, they gave up all their nuclear weapons to Russia, and then we threw them under the bus with that agreement. If we do another security agreement with NATO -- with Ukraine -- I'm sorry -- it has to be one that's solid that all of NATO is behind as a security agreement.

They can kill civilians, especially later if they fail to detonate. The U.S. is still spending millions cleaning up cluster bombs in Laos from the 1960s.

We are not a signatory to the Geneva Convention on cluster munitions.Neither is Ukraine. And, by the way, Russia is dropping with impunity cluster bombs in Ukraine, in the country of Ukraine, right now. All the Ukrainians and Zelenskyy are asking for is to give them the same weapons the Russians have to use in their own country against Russians who are in their own country. They're -- they do not want these to be used in Russia. They want these as self-defense to use against Russians in their own country of Ukraine. I don't see anything wrong with that, because, quite honestly, Jake, as you look at the counteroffensive, it's been slowed tremendously because this administration has been so slow to get the weapons in. These weapons would be a game-changer. They are highly effective, and particularly hitting flanks of troops inside of Ukraine. They would be a game-changer in the counteroffensive. And I'm really pleased the administration has finally agreed to do this. But, lastly, ATACMS, my committee,we voted bipartisan to release those ATACMS, longer-range artillery, that can hit the Iranian drones in Crimea. And also the F-16s need to get in country as soon as possible to deliver the Storm Shadows that the U.K. has put in there as well. But it'll take a while to train the pilots.

As a result of this meeting, they're going to cut exports of rare earth minerals to the United States in what would be considered a trade action or a trade embargo. And this highlights the bigger, great power competition we have with China, first semiconductors that I took on with the CHIPS Act. Now we got the rare earth minerals.

What happened right after he withdrew? Zawahiri was harbored by the Haqqani Network, which is al Qaeda, essentially. So, you got Haqqani and the Taliban harboring Zawahiri, al Qaeda, bin Laden's number two guy, in Afghanistan right after the fall. And now he's saying, I was right. The Taliban is helping us and al Qaeda is gone. I just don't really understand it. It's a bit bizarre to me that a president would be so devoid of his own foreign policy.
