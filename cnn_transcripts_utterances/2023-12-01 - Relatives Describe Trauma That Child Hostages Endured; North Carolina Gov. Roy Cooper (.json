SHAPIRA-BERMAN:  So, first of all, very, very slowly and very delicately. I mean, everybody has to have patience with these children and with all the other hostages who are going to be back. It will take a long time -- a very long time. And I think the trauma will take days before the family and then the therapists will only begin to hear the stories. I'm not even talking about -- to begin to understand the stories. I think understanding will take much longer and need a lot of patience.

What do you make of that?SHAPIRA-BERMAN:  Well, it's actually a very common feature of trauma and I expect that to be very common not just with the children and not with just the hostages but also with the survivors of the massacre. It's actually a different mechanism. It's -- the pain is unbearable. To realize what you have seen and to realize what has been done to you and to your family is really unbearable. So what the mind does -- it disassociates itself. And so, sometimes, you can remember the details but the effect is gone, and sometimes you are very emotional and you cannot remember what happened. So -- because collecting the data with emotions is beyond whatever a person can handle at such an early stage. And this is actually what therapy is about -- about slowly, at the pace of the person -- of the specific person to just try and collect all the details together. The story -- again, the smallest details. When you saw someone who was bleeding, to have the patient -- again, at his own pace -- say what he felt. What he was thinking about. And what kind of triggers today -- when he's home and safe, what kind of triggers make this reappear and then making him think about it and be terrified again. And it can take years and years.",
