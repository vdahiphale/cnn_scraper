And four months for years for the better part of a decade, the Republican Party has made the border issue number one. They demanded change, legislation, any kind of fix. And there is, in fact, a crisis on the border, whether Democrats want to admit it out loud or not, and new laws are needed to keep up with the influx of migrants. The problem is, though, Republicans latched onto this issue for political reasons, and there's proof of it. To explain how this border deal died the quickest of deaths, I'm going to use the inverted pyramid to help convey the who, the what, when, where and why Republicans ended up tanking the very type of legislation that they demanded. First and foremost, the who, of course, Donald Trump. The where, Capitol Hill. The why and the when, and while Republicans will tell you that they're rejecting this deal because it doesn't go far enough, even though it's the most conservative bipartisan immigration bill in recent history. But that excuse is just a cover. The main reason that they don't want this bill is because Donald Trump doesn't want to give Joe Biden a legislative win during an election year. It's that simple. Not only has Trump actually admitted this out loud, but so have his allies over on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX): Joe Biden's approval ratings at 33 percent. Why would we do anything to try to help improve that dismal number with a border bill being drafted in the Senate that isn't really serious about border security? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They were essentially holding foreign aid hostage. So, a group of bipartisan senators, the ones actually trying to govern, they got together over the last few months to try to bridge the divide.They reached a deal. It was backed by key players, including everyone, from Mitch McConnell to Joe Biden to the Border Patrol Union. And then in the course of just a week, poof, Trump sabotaged the deal, effectively killing it. Now, by the way, this isn't the first deal, bill or even law that Trump has blown up, threatened many times without any real replacement in mind. There was Obamacare, the Iran nuclear deal infrastructure, the Paris Climate Accord, DACA, the 2020 stimulus. This week, the Heritage Action Group, it's a conservative advocacy group, they went full Orwell or Marty McFly, however you prefer your history to be rewritten, and they said this, quote, senators and the Biden administration can no longer camouflage the truth. They're leveraging the border crisis and the needs of our allies in Israel and Taiwan to extract more than $60 billion in additional unaccountable aid for Ukraine. Well, first of all, Ukraine is an ally of the United States. And, second of all, that's just a lie. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

I think it's, one, a reminder of Trump's clout within Republican circles in Washington. I think that that's real. I think it's a reminder of the weakening grip that McConnell has on the Senate side. I mean, historically, he's had a very strong hold of his membership. And you saw with the way that it fell that hand at least in this deal seemed to be weakening, and that's atypical. But most of all, I think it shows well beyond the fine print of the bill, which is just zero trust on either side. And in fairness to the Republicans, and, again, I'm not a MAGA guy and I'm certainly not a Trump supporter, but in fairness to where those folks are coming from, again, at the membership level, people are saying, well, wait a minute, you know, Biden had the tools. He dismembered a number of policies that were working under the Trump administration. There were far fewer encounters during that time. You know, you can have laws, but if the executive doesn't actually implement them, then they don't do you any good.And I think that the breakdown here was ultimately well beyond the confine to the legislation itself, but to the larger issue of trust, which is, okay, we passed this thing, and what if they don't push it in the last 10, 11 months of this year. And I think that that's probably the most telling of all. I mean, take for instance, this notion of certain triggers being hit after their 4,000 apprehensions per day, you know, for seven consecutive days. A lot of people say that's a giant loophole. I don't want to have 4,000 people rolling across the border with that.",
