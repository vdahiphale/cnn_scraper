Actually, in fact, they had brought one out and they actually removed it before he stepped up there. All he did was take a few notes on a note card.He was all over the place. He aired his grievances. He said exactly, as we had reported, the same messaging he has been saying since before the trial. That it was a rigged trial, that it was election interference, that it was political persecution, something that his team believes is resonating, at least with his base and Republicans. But one thing he said that really perked up a lot of our ears, particularly given us that are following the case closely, is he appeared to violate the gag order. Just a reminder, he is not allowed to talk about any witnesses, he is not allowed to talk about people who are prosecuting the case other than Alvin Bragg. This was the moment in which it seemed that he could not help himself but talk about one of the witnesses Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER US PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: By the way, this was a highly qualified lawyer. Now, I'm not allowed to use his name because of the gag order. But, you know, he's a sleazebag. Everybody knows that, took me a while to find out. But he was effective, he did do work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now she did not say Michael Cohen's name but it was pretty clear when he continually refer to the person as a former lawyer, and a former fixer, so, of course, we'll have to ask our legal experts about that.But overall here, it was very clear that this is going to be Donald Trump's campaign strategy, at least for the next couple of weeks, talking about this, airing those grievances. And it was clear by what we saw that he was rattled, he was all over the place. He felt the need to walk through various parts of this case because it is still on his mind. Now his team says that they again think this will help them in November. We saw that poll yesterday that just among Trump voters, 7 percent of people who said that they were likely to vote for Donald Trump so they will be less likely to vote for Donald Trump if he was convicted. And sorry about this, this is also the finest bus stop outside of Trump Tower that we're part of right now, live TV. But that's a big margin. I know it doesn't sound like a lot but when you're looking at an election like Joe Biden and Donald Trump, where they are expecting whoever wins to win by such a narrow amount of votes, 7 percent of one space could be quite significant. But again, no matter what is said right now, nobody can predict what is going to happen in November. I actually heard someone say this on Donald Trump's team, they were skeptical as to what exactly was going to happen next. He said the people who are going to decide this, are you, you, and me, the country, is what they meant by that. The fact that people will be casting those ballots in November to decide essentially what this means to them moving forward.",

And when US officials came back after the Memorial Day vacation, day off, they were firm in saying that Israel had not crossed the red line. And we, journalists, have been badgering the administration about what this red line is. And John Kirby, the National Security spokesman, summed it up as Israel smashing into Rafah. And as far as the administration is concerned, that has not yet happened, despite the fact that we've seen numerous strikes that have killed scores of people. What we're seeing is this operation from Israel grow in a slower way, initially in the southeastern part of Rafah. Now they're in central Rafah, they've kind of looped around the southernmost part of Gaza and taken over this nine mile stretch on the border with Egypt called the Philadelphi Corridor. So they're not doing it in a major way, at least as far as the Biden administration is concerned. And so, I don't think that we're going to hear the President say anything about withholding any more weapons for Israel. I think what we're certainly going to be keeping an ear out for, of course, is the hostage deal.",
