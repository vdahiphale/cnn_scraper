A woman that right-wing media purports to be the judge's wife used to work for the state AG's office. I'm not sure if it's actually his wife regardless, does not currently work for the state AG.

The jury unanimously agreed -- was asked to unanimously agree, that Trump falsified business records, unanimously agreed that he did so with the intent to commit another crime, which had to be unanimously agreed to be a violation of state election law. What the judge said they did not need to be unanimous on was the so- called unlawful means by which he intended to violate that election law.
