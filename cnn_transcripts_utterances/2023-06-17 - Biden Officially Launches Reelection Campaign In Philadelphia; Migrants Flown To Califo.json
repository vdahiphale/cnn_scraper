He spoke to about 2,000 union members, all of whom were enthusiastic and were cheering him on throughout his speech.And President Biden touched on the issues that these unions themselves have highlighted, including, for example, low unemployment rate, adding jobs, investments in clean energy, manufacturing, and so President Biden speaking to all of those issues which are ones that the union members ahead of his speech were already congratulating and heralding the president on. And when you speak to folks what they say is that President Biden had initially campaigned on this in 2020 and they have seen the follow- through, giving them the momentum and the opportunity to provide that early endorsement of a presidential candidate, in this case President Biden. And he himself heralded himself as the most pro-union president. And of course this is an important group that's coalescing here. It is one that President Biden hopes will mobilize voters and will serve as a key constituency as he kicks his reelection campaign into gear. Not only just for 2024 nationwide but in the crucial swing state here of Pennsylvania. So all of that coming together today as the president kicked off his reelection campaign in earnest -- Jim.",

WILL HURD (R), FORMER TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE: He absolutely could have put people's lives at risk for not returning these documents. And look, when I first read the indictment, it's shocking. The fact that you have recorded audio of Donald Trump saying that he has documents he shouldn't have and it's highly classified, and he is showing it to people. Who else did he show this kind of information to? He hasn't talked about all the people he showed it to. Why is he trying to hold this information or to not let the National Archives know the kind of information he has access to? When you look in that indictment, some of the classification is classified, that is how sensitive this information is. Some of the information is what's called SIG-IN, signals intelligence. This is stuff that the NSA collects, and some of the most expensive and hardest kind of intelligence that we used in order to keep our homeland safe, to keep our troop safe overseas. There were questions about the imagery that we use and there was information in these documents allegedly -- and again I haven't seen these documents, Jim, but you can discern some of the things that were in it based on the classifications.
