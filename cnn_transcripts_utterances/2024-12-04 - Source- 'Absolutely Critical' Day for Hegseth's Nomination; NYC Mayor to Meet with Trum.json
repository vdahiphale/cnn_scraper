A live look at the very, very beginning of the sunrise in New York City. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. It is a make-or-break day for Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of defense. In just hours, Pete Hegseth plans to return to Capitol Hill. He's supposed to meet with key Republican senators, including the next majority leader, John Thune. A senior Trump transition official telling CNN today will be, quote, \"absolutely critical.\" That source also suggesting that Hegseth hadn't been forthcoming with transition officials about his past behavior. Over the weekend, \"The New Yorker\" reported that he was, quote, \"forced out of previous leadership positions for financial mismanagement, sexist behavior, and being repeatedly intoxicated on the job,\" end quote. Responding to those allegations and others, Hegseth has denied all wrongdoing. But amid these developments, a slight change in tone -- It might be slight, but it's significant -- from Senate Republicans, who would need to approve his nomination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): You know, some of these articles are very disturbing. He, you know, obviously has a chance to defend himself here. But, you know, some of this stuff is going to be difficult. You know, time will tell. SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD): I have not met with him yet. I'm looking forward to meeting with him. We'll be asking questions. But look, the president always gets the benefit of the doubt on his nominees. SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): Of course, its concerning, but I look forward to visiting with Pete about it and seeing. I'm interested in who Pete Hegseth is today and who he's -- he is going forward. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): I believe that we need an FBI background check to evaluate the allegations.
