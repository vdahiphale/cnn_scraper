I think it's hard to understate how -- it's hard to overstate how much of a vibe change Vice President Harris represented when she got on that ticket. And this moment, because of that high, feels like such a low letdown for so many people here.One of the things, though, Anderson and Jeff, that I noted in this speech, it was driven, as she said, by the ideas that animated this campaign, which were about democracy, the threat that Donald Trump, she said, posed to this country. But I have to wonder, after the results that we saw last night, voters seemed to say that maybe they get it, they understand it, they think that he doesn't have the best character, but there were other issues that were animating them, and she did not address that.

It comes on the fifth season every four years, and I think this will be an extraordinary moment to see who he surrounds himself with.

And the results last night were not just at the top of the ticket.You've got a Senate that is going to be Republican, and it's already a Congress that is very much more Trumpian than it was when Trump became president in 2016. So he's going to have a long rope to put his acolytes into positions of power. He's going to have a better understanding of the government. And that is the reality of 2024 that is very different from 2016.

Now, clearly it is not a bittersweet moment for President Biden. It is expected to be quite bitter as he delivers this address in a race he believed that he could have won.

And those three schools of thoughts are as follows. The first is perhaps Biden should have just remained the candidate. He had that strong coalition in the blue wall of white working class voters that helped tip the race to his favor in 2020 and that carried Donald Trump in 2016. Perhaps he would have been able to carry that out.Then there's the school of thought that perhaps blame should be placed on former President Barack Obama for anointing Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi, who effectively pushed Biden out of the race this time around, with aides saying that, you know, it was essentially the party's most powerful that told Biden that he needed to step aside. They said that any other Democrat could beat Donald Trump. And clearly they say that was not the case. And then there's a final school of thought that is perhaps they just didn't fully grasp just how unpopular President Biden was. They believed that the data would eventually play out in voter sentiment, that President Biden's approval rating did not accurately reflect how people actually felt on the ground. But Dana, as we know, voters are never wrong. They have this opportunity to speak their mind, to cast their ballots and show where their priorities are. And that is the source of a lot of reckoning for the Biden team in the light of day.",

Listen, we're attracting the best and the brightest this country has. I think the transition team has done a good job, you know, sort of staying behind the scenes in the last couple months and sort of gathering a list of people who want to work in the administration, who want to serve this country in a positive way. And now we're going through the process of reviewing, doing the necessary background searches we have. We're excited to have so many people, so many people excited to be part of this administration and unifying the country. So I think what you're going to see from this transition, you know, is going to be a unified front. And, you know, President Trump and Kamala Harris spoke a little bit earlier. It was a very gracious phone call that the vice president gave, and the president was very clear she thought she ran a strong campaign and she was very tenacious in the process. And, you know, she also mentioned she wanted to work with the president to unify the country. So I think from the transition, who wants to display a unified front, and also from the relationship that he has with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, we're looking to have a unified relationship with the country in January.",

We'll see how it plays out.A couple things to look at from when I went off the air at 4:00 this morning, number one, Donald Trump still leads by 4.8 million votes in the popular vote. There are some Democrats who say, you know, California takes actually sometimes a couple weeks to finish its count because of mail-in ballots. New York State sometimes takes a long time to count. There are some Democrats out there holding out what I guess is a last gap, hope that somehow she might catch up in the popular vote. But 4.8 million is a pretty strong lead. We'll watch and see if that happens. And remember, Donald Trump lost the popular vote in both of his previous runs. So that is a trophy not only does Donald Trump like to have, but inside his campaign, they're already talking about this as part of a mandate, you win the popular vote as well. Look at the map. I mean, your eyes don't lie, there's not really much I have to say. When you look at this map and you see all that red and especially where you see it. All right, those are the blue wall states. Donald Trump flipped them in 2016, that was the wow then. Well, he flipped them back again. Joe Biden got them blue in 2020, now they're back. This is going to be the conversation about Democrats. These states have voted together since 1992. They voted blue in all of those elections except two, 2016 and yesterday. So Democrats are going to have a conversation there. And they have Democratic governors in all three of them. They're going to lead that conversation about how do we pick up the pieces and move forward. But that's big for Donald Trump. And then the conversation has been, well, the demographics are changing in the Sunbelt. So North Carolina, it already was diverse. Now it's becoming more college educated, Democrats should be able to win it. Donald Trump took it back. Georgia, Joe Biden took it only by 11,000 votes, but Donald Trump took it back again. Big black population, Democratic foundation, more college educated voters, more diverse should be able to win it, they didn't. And then we're not finished out here, but Donald Trump gets Arizona back. And even Hillary Clinton won Nevada in 2016. Again, we're not done, but if -- look, I can just go in and take this away and look at where we are in the counts right now. In Arizona, it's 106,000 votes. Remember how narrow that was in 2020 and in Nevada. Again, they take a while to finish the count, but it's 64,000 votes. So if you look at the map, it's incredibly impressive. And if you go county by county and you look -- you can look, you know, inside Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Donald Trump running stronger, those areas are going to stay blue. They're not going to change. But it's just a sweeping victory no matter how you look at it. And so I just want to come into one state, Michigan, right. And you look here, spent a lot of time here in the campaign. This actually came back a bit from last night. Last night we were talking about -- what about the youth vote in places like Washtenaw County where the University of Michigan is, the Democrats as the votes were counted, did come back some, see it's 71 percent right there compared to 73 percent for Joe Biden. So it did get better. It didn't get back to Biden levels, but it got better as the count continued in. But here are the places the Democrats are going to autopsy. And it's actually kind of striking. When I first started doing this, Macomb County, Michigan was home of the Reagan Democrats. Right? How did Ronald Reagan win those union autoworkers? Right? Well, now the conversation is how is Donald Trump not only winning but building support among union autoworkers? That's 2020. You come back to 202, he's at 56 percent in Macomb County. So Democrats are going to have a conversation about how do we appeal to farmers, how do we appeal to people who work with their hands, how do we appeal to all of the people, not only in farm state America and prairie America, but industrial state America? The Democrats have a problem. But let's flip it, Donald Trump won the election and he was right last night to say the American people have given him a mandate. He's going to probably win the popular vote, he's going to be over 300 in the Electoral College, that is a mandate. The question is, what does he do with it? And you know this better than I he'll have a Republican Senate, we're not sure about the Congress, but this is a resounding victory especially after, again, the conversations we were having just after the Biden inauguration were that Donald Trump was done. Donald Trump is not done. He's coming back, and he's coming back with a giant wind at his back.",

Now, what does this all mean and who's leading in which districts at this key moment in the race for the House? Well, Democrats have some advantages and Republicans do as well. Democrats are leading in a handful of states and Republican -- and districts and Republicans are leading in a handful of other districts. But in order to win back majority control of the House, Democrats need to get -- we have a net of four, a four seats altogether. Right now, as you see, Republicans are leading in two Democratic districts. In order to get a full majority in the United States House, there needs to be 218 seats to get that majority. But at the moment, the Democrats have a bit of a fraught path to that majority given the fact that Republicans have picked up a net of six seats so far. They're -- but potentially could pick up a couple more. Democrats may pick up a few as well that may not meet the net four seats to get the majority. Which is why at the moment, Anderson, both the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, is projecting confidence that the GOP will hold the House.

They have offices opened here in West Palm Beach. They are expecting that the entire transition will be run out of here. There will be meetings between Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon that are held at that office. That's where the campaign was set up.

And I think we are going to be living with the ramifications of it for decades looking ahead. In that ruling, the Supreme Court decided that a president has very broad immunity, cannot be prosecuted or investigated for anything he does within his official acts.And they define the scope official acts, both very broadly but also at the same time quite vaguely. Right now, Jack Smith and the judge are trying to go through and figure out what exactly is and is not immune. And so, when Donald Trump retakes office in 75 days, I think if he looks at that opinion, he's going to feel unbound. He's going to feel like pretty much anything he does, as long as he can believably tie it somehow to the office, he is immune from being prosecuted for in the future. And so I think one major guardrail against abuse of office has now been eliminated by the Supreme Court.
