      "sentences": "We're told about 30 tanks will head to Ukraine, one of the most advanced and complex tanks pretty much out there.How soon? This will take time. We've seen the coordination between the German announcement to send its German-made Leopard tanks and other countries to send German made tanks and the expected announcement from the U.S. It will send just about short of 3 dozen of its Abrams tank. In terms of how soon we could see the Abrams tank arriving, that will take much longer because the U.S. just announced its own drawdown of U.S. inventories. It's unlikely that U.S. will do the same with the Abrams. That means the U.S. will have to procure new Abrams tanks for Ukraine and that will take time, months perhaps before we see Abrams enter the battlefield. But Ukraine needs that time to learn how to use them, operate them and the other new systems that the U.S. and others have already announced they will provide.",

That explanation is so critical us because this is a notable shift for the Biden administration.Pentagon officials have said for a while it's challenging to maintain these tanks, to train people to even operate these tanks, not to mention the amount of time, as Oren was talking about, to get these tanks physically to Ukraine. It's impossible to sort of look at this decision, this expected announcement, in a vacuum. You have to look at it in the context of what Germany is doing. German officials have been making it clear for a while they were not willing to send the Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine unless the U.S. was willing to send Abrams tanks. So this is a coordinated effort and probably other European countries as well. We do expect the president to once again talk about how important he believes it is for the Biden administration to make any kind of significant decisions when it comes to Ukraine in coordination with other allied countries, Kate.",

That would be the 30 tanks that Oren is referring to, that we're expecting the U.S. president to announce as being supplied to Ukraine. On the front line, we've been in touch with soldiers on the front line. They're particularly pleased to hear they'll be coming, because they've been running out of these particular pieces of equipment. They've had to capture a lot of tanks from Russia and repurpose them. But they are running low. And they have been particularly useful in the fighting around Bakhmut. Also on the training front, yes, it could take months to training a fresh recruit. But it won't take long to train a seasoned tank fighter. They probably have the most experience in all of NATO in how to drive and fight with a tank. They don't know how to physically drive the Leopards, the Abrams. Ultimately they want to see more help coming through. If you add up all the pledges, between 90 and 100 tanks. They are asking, though, Kate, to get to 300.",

But that's a useful background to then start training on modern NATO battle tanks. This is a war, an aggression. President Putin invading another sovereign, independent nation in Europe, Ukraine, Ukraine has the right for self-defense. We have the right to support them in upholding that right. Because if President Putin wins, it's a tragedy for Ukraine but a danger to us, because the message is that when leaders use power, they get what they want and then the world becomes even more dangerous and we more vulnerable.

She actually said that they were moved over to the building across the street and, according to authorities, they did send an ambulance bus here just as a precaution.

Zhao tried to suffocate his former coworker and roommate over issues around work and pay. And a temporary restraining order was filed. And he would not be able to obtain and buy a gun but that went away in July of 2013. Over the weekend, this mass shooting took place at two separate locations. One was apparently where Chunli Zhao lived and worked. And there were other people who lived and worked there, including children. Governor Gavin Newsom toured Half Moon Bay yesterday. He met with families, community members, who have been deeply impacted by this violence. Kate, I'll be honest with you, he seemed exhausted and really fired up. This was his second mass shooting tour in just days. That first one in Monterey Park over the weekend in Southern California. He quickly came up to northern California to tour another mass shooting site. Listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA):  We need the federal government to do its job. This is on everybody. We've chosen this. This is our decision to live in these conditions. It doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. So we have chosen this. We have accepted this.

A lot of this doesn't have to happen. We know that smart gun safety laws work, whether it's restrictions on the type of weapons made available, stronger background checks. The numbers don't lie. And for the 10 years we have an assault weapons ban nationally, the numbers came down. So the governor is absolutely right.
