The militaryreleased this video showing troops inside Lebanon. Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. And the founder of the humanitarian organization, INARA, Arwa Damon, is in Beirut for us. Let's begin with Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv, Israel. Jim, as Israel is still assessing the damage from yesterday's unprecedented attack by Iran, what more can you tell us about the IDF reporting that eight soldiers have been killed fighting in Southern Lebanon. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Listen, as a reminder, this is a multi-front war, right? In addition to that massive Iranian missile barrage last night, Israel went in on the ground in Lebanon for the first time in 18 years, just in the last 48 hours, and are already suffering significant losses. Eight soldiers killed, two separate incidents, but quite early in their operations on the ground inside Lebanon. And I have to say, having covered the 2006 war, the last time Israeli forces went in to Lebanon in numbers 18 years ago and with deaths. Israeli losses were higher than expected. And then, of course, that war ended with an uncertain outcome. Hezbollah lived to survive another day. It just -- it gives a cautionary tale about the intentions and objectives of this latest operation. Now, of course, a big part of the focus here, Bianna, is on how Israel will respond to this Iranian missile barrage with a range of options, some right up to and including attacks on nuclear facilities, which would seem to bring on the prospect of a much larger war, even with the possibility of U.S. involvement, whether it wants to or not, right? So a very dicey time in this country with big decisions to be made. And as I understand it, lots of phone calls now between Tel Aviv and Washington about that response.",

Fast forward now when you've got Israeli troops making what they call limited and precise incursions into Southern Lebanon.

We have seen theU.S. ever since the start of the escalation, we have seen in Lebanon urge a ceasefire. In fact, they have pushed for a ceasefire across the region for much longer than that. Now, it's even more critical from the U.S. perspective, but Israel sees the advantage it has, knows it will carry out a more powerful attack against Iran than it did in April. So it's a question of how much can the U.S. and Israel get on the same page for what happens moving forward. The administration has made clear from national security, Jake Sullivan, on down, that they want to have these discussions with the Israelis and coordinate, or at least have communication about what the Israeli response will be. Whether the U.S. participates in that in any fashion, from refueling perhaps to intel sharing, that remains to be seen as far as we know. Those might be parts of the conversations about how this all plays out. The U.S. has, however, made clear that its forces remain in the region and will take part in any defense of Israel. We saw that play out last night with U.S. Navy destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea firing about a dozen interceptors to take out some of that Iranian ballistic missile barrage. Those forces and many, many others remain in the region. So we see the U.S. very much working with Israel and coordinated with Israel on the defense and now it's seeing how much -- how much room is there -- how much is Israel willing to coordinate on Israel's response to Iran. At least from what we see now, there is some time for those discussions. Israel didn't carry out its response last night. It's now the Jewish New Year. Israel may wait over the course of this holiday as it tries to calibrate its response. The U.S. will very much want to be a part of that decision making.",

And as you indicated, some went in and hit targets in Israel, including in civilian populated areas. This is a brazen attack on our sovereignty, on our state, on our people, and we will respond. Iran should know, and I think they know, that whoever attacks us, we strike back. How we do it, when we do it, these things are under consideration as we speak.

Vance that we would be looking at in the -- behind the Resolute Desk. And I think most Americans need to come to grips with the fact that this is a duopoly. This is what we've got.

The first from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory showed that global heating caused over 50 percent more rain to fall in parts of Georgia and the Carolinas. And in addition, scientists from Europe's climate found storms like Helene are now about 20 percent wetter, seven percent windier than those which happened decades ago. CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir joins us now. So, Bill, let's establish that hurricanes have been with us forever. But when you see the magnitude of these storms and the frequencies of the size and the ferocity of these storms, if hurricane damage can happen in cities like Asheville, North Carolina, then is any city really safe from natural disasters?",

I have a member of my own extended family. She was a meteorologist in Florida who left there for Asheville to get away and part of hurricanes. And it's this mindset we have that somehow havens are far from the coast. But where it can rain, it can flood. And where it can flash flood, the floods get flashier on a warmer planet. It used to be, as we were growing up, hurricanes would hit land and then have no more energy. They would dissipate over land. But it rained for days before Helene hit land, softening that ground, creating what they're calling sort of a brown ocean effect where the earth is so moist, it creates the conditions to keep a hurricane going longer. And then when that storm hits the mountains, it sort of rings the water out into bowl-shaped valleys like Buncombe County is one giant bowl. And, of course, it flooded there in 1916. This one was so much worse, so much worse. So these aren't your father's storms anymore. And, unfortunately, Bianna, we have a sense in the United States where after a disaster like this, memories are short and a new crop of people will move there thinking this might be safe and maybe repeating this disaster all over again.",

So the equivalent of maybe five to ten Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs, that's how much energy is entering the oceans every second of every day. And all of this has been building up, building up, building up. And it's the kind of experiment you can do in a seventh grade laboratory where test tubes with more carbon dioxide hold more heat. And on a planet that holds more heat, it just picks up a lot more water. In the desert regions, that means there's more evaporation, so the droughts are longer and more intense. And in wet regions, it means there's more water in the sky when that thing opens up overhead.
