      "sentences": "Well, Rudy Giuliani is doubling down the lies that landed him in hot water in the first place, lies that have a mother and daughter fearing for their lives, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, there's a lot going on in the world. We all know this. You've probably been drinking through a fire hose when it comes to all the important news. But let me just tell you, if you're looking for the one thing to take away from all of this, what I think is the one thing? Well, here it is. Rudy Giuliani. I cannot get this story out of my mind. That's why I'm going to focus on it with you right now. Do you realize that somebody who was the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, a very familiar prosecutor, is refusing to stop defaming and lying about election workers, election workers who've been proven, proven to have done absolutely nothing wrong? In fact, the federal judge who was overseeing that case has already ruled that Rudy is spreading false information about Ruby Freeman and Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss. He is falsely claiming, and you remember this, that they were passing around USB drives -- quote -- \"as if they're vials of heroin or cocaine.\" Interesting use of that particular description and analogy, is it not? When in fact, it wasn't a USB drive. Remember, it was a ginger mint being passed between mother and daughter. Now, it's a matter of how much the man who was once known as America's mayor will have to pay for defaming them, not whether he did, but how much he has to pay for having done it, the damages portion of it. But even knowing that he's in court today, this week, in the midst of a trial on that very issue, it's not stopping him. I mean, I remind you, he was the former U.S. attorney. He should know better than this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Do you regret what you did to --",

He knows that quite well. I'm not staying tuned unless I want to hear more about the damages portion of the trial. And there are very real-world consequences to all of this. I mean, it wasn't just a theoretical thing whether Ruby Freeman or Shaye Moss would somehow have been attacked by people verbally, they wouldn't have felt in fear of their lives or their livelihood. Just listen to this example of threatening voicemails left for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. They were actually played in court today. They were voicemails full of obscene and racist threats. I'm going to play some for you, but I'm going to warn you, not only are they disturbing, they were directed at people who just raised their hand to serve the community as election workers.

His plea coming during Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's now third visit to Washington, D.C. since the war, and he came with his own sales pitch.The difference this time? Well, an increasing number of Americans are no longer interested in buying in. You see this purple line? That shows steady growth and how many Americans say the United States is paying too much. And it may not be that surprising when we look at the actual map of Ukraine. The yellow here shows Ukraine's gains in the recent counteroffensive. And you perhaps would not be wrong in asking, is that it? But we'd be wrong, perhaps, to think of it that myopically. Those small gains are now raising big questions like, how much of an impact giving more aid would actually have? Republicans in Congress are holding up a new aid package, as you know, and trying to tie it to increase security at the southern border. Now, regardless of what you believe, the war in Ukraine does have huge implications. It's about determining America's role and what's happening across the world. And what we do or don't do doesn't just impact other countries. It also influences the shape of our lives here at home. I've got just the right guests to talk about all of this because here with me tonight, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. I'm so glad you're here, ambassador. It is such a different, perhaps, Washington that Zelenskyy has now come to. And I want to go right there with the question. There is pushback. If there is no aid and Ukraine succumbed to Russia, what's next? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: So, Laura, that's a great question. First of all, in Europe, that will mean that Russia is right next to Poland and right next to Romania. It's already right next to Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia. But Russia will be that much farther into NATO's area. And if Russia challenges NATO, we're obligated, we're committed, we're obligated to support our allies. People will be asking at that point -- well, I think people will be asking, why did -- who lost Ukraine? Where were the people who were supporting Ukraine at the beginning? As you said, when President Zelenskyy was here the first time, standing ovations in the Congress, and they will say, what happened to that? The Ukrainians have been fighting bravely for like 20 months.",

I want to turn to a Minnesota man who is free tonight after spending nearly 20 years in prison for a crime he didn't even commit. Marvin Haynes was 16 years old at the time. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2005. The police charged him with the murder of a flower shop owner during an attempted robbery. This week, a judge overturned his wrongful conviction on the basis of unconstitutional witness identification. The judge writing in part -- quote -- \"There was no physical evidence linking petitioner to the crime scene. There was no DNA evidence, fingerprint evidence, physical evidence, surveillance evidence, or other forensic evidence.\" Marvin Haynes, now 36 years old, has always maintained his innocence, and he joins me now. Marvin, good evening to you. I can't imagine what you must be feeling to know that it took nearly 20 years. But tonight, you are a free man. Tell me about what that moment was like, Marvin, when you first heard the news. MARVIN HAYNES, RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER CONVICTION OVERTURNED: First of all, thank you for having me on your show. I appreciate you. It was -- it was joyful. I was extremely overjoyed with emotion. I knew this day was going to come, but I had no idea how it was going to come. I got the news on my birthday, on my 36th birthday. So, I'll never forget that day that my lawyer called me and said that my sentence was vacated, and I'll be coming home like an exonerated man. So, I'm just so appreciative of the new administrators in the Hennepin County and my lawyers, the Innocent Project, the Great North Innocent Project. They saved my life.
