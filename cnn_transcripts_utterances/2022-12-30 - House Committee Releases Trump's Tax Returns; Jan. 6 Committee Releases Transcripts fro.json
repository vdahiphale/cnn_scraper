Jim Sciutto is off today.New this morning, House Democrats releasing six years worth of former President Trump's tax returns, giving deeper insight into his personal financial situation. Right now, CNN is sifting through the hundreds of documents that were just released in the last hour. But the former president is already responding. CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes joins me now to break it all down. Kristen, walk us through what we're learning from these tax returns, again the caveat being they just came out an hour ago and there is say lot of data here and also how the former president is responding.",

      "sentences": "So, as you said, we have team combing through literally hundreds and hundreds of pages. But what we've been able to confirm so far is that Trump paid a very low amount of income tax in his first and last year of presidency. We're talking about 2017, he paid $750, 2018 and 2019, it was combined $1.1 million in income tax, in 2020, it was $0.Now, that $0 is important and here is why. What we hope that these tax returns will show is not just the raw data of the numbers but it is actually looking at the detailed documents that were provided to give us some sort of insight into his businesses. Are they really as successful as he has said? And I talked to a number of tax experts who say that that $0, that indicates that there might have been some faltering business. Is it really just strategic accounting, which we know Trump has boasted about for years. He even said in 2016 that it was smart not to pay taxes when he was talking with Hillary Clinton about why he wouldn't release them. But is it actually business losses, which is important when you think about the political ramifications of a man who ran on the fact that he was a wealthy and, therefore, successful businessman. And, of course, Trump is agitated about this release. He has already issued a statement. He said, Democrats shouldn't have done this. And he went on to say, the great USA divide will now grow far worse. The radical left Democrats have weaponized everything. But remember that this is a dangerous two-way street. And he released a video last week as part of the 2024 campaign essentially calling on Republican to start looking into Biden's finances and to Biden's family. So, that is what he referring to there when he talks about a two-way street.",

They hold power and influence unlike any other American, and with great power comes greater responsibility.And, of course, the important thing to note here is that Trump said -- he broke an enormous amount of precedent when he was running for president and then was president, he became the first president in modern history not to release his taxes. This is something he chose to do. And on top of that -- and this is something that, for decades, he has shielded from the public. And one other thing I want to quickly touch on that we're looking for here is foreign entities and bank accounts. That is something we're going through these additional documents for. Does he have foreign bank accounts? Are there any foreign-owned businesses? The reason that is important is because you remember this was a big topic of conversation during his entire presidency. So, that is something we're going to be looking at closely as we go through these hundreds of pages.",

But we also want to bring in CNN Political Analyst Margaret Talev, Managing Editor for Axios, and Steven Rosenthal, Senior Fellow at Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center. Great to have you all here.Margaret, let's start first with you. As I mentioned, the GOP taking control of the House in just mere days, timing everything here, the Democrats releasing these. At the last minute, they kind of could. We know that Republicans are planning for a lot of oversight investigations, but is there any indication, do you think, that they're going to try to push back on this specifically?",

STEVEN ROSENTHAL, SENIOR FELLOW, URBAN-BROOKINGS TAX POLICY CENTER: Well, we just got the documents posted. And I've been looking closely at foreign accounts and foreign sources of income in the last hour. What strikes me immediately is that in 2015, '16 and '17, Donald Trump had foreign accounts in the U.K., Ireland, China and also it looks like St. Thomas. But then in 2018, only U.K. In 2019 and '20, only U.K. And so that is one of the things I'm looking at. And we know from last month's trial of the Trump Organization in New York, that Trump's accountants, tax accountants, said that his presidential returns had to be squeaky clean. So, I suspect that things got cleaned up some later on.",

And it is interesting, and that is a little bit of what Kristen was talking about earlier, too, is that you were saying that it's going to be key about foreign entities, where were the investments, where was the money going, what foreign entities was he involved with.We also know that President Trump was supposed to have a mandatory audit from the IRS and he didn't have one three out of four years. He was always so paranoid around his taxes, as you alluded to earlier. Do you think that there is any appetite to codify this into law from -- it would have to come through Congress. But also doesn't this just speak to just the broader paranoia of Trump's feelings around his money and his taxes?",

      "timeStamp": "10:05:00",

      "sentences": "Yes. And I do think this goes to politics, in general. When you are thinking about Trump, we can always say, is his base going to turn on him for everything that happens, right, any kind of glitch unknown (ph)? And is this something that's going to do that? Probably not.But when you look at Trump, the things that he really cares about are his image and the narrative that he built for the several decades before he ran for president, before he even was considering that level of politics. This is something that he sold his entire life on, the Trump Hotel. It was his brand. And it's associated with success and wealth. So, that is part of why there have been rumors for decades around New York that he might not be as wealthy as he seemed. In fact, I talked to some of his closest associates back from those days who said, they believe he would never run for president because it will be too much financial scrutiny. And they just didn't believe that because he's so private and so invested in not sharing this information publicly, that he just couldn't get through that and run for president. Of course, obviously, he did and he did not release his taxes and broke precedent there. But, yes, this is a big part of how he even ran back in 2016. He said that if he could be the successful of a businessman, that he could successfully run a nation. And that is why we're looking so closely at just how successful those businesses were. And that is why it is so interesting when you look at the fact that, yes, some of this is strategic accounting. This is something people who have this kind of money and these kind resources do. They claim large losses and then they carry over millions and millions of dollars, we already know he carried over $105 million in 2015, $73 million. These are losses. It carries over in order to offset his income tax and pay less money. But when you look at 2020 number, did that actually come from those offsets or was this a COVID number coming at that time where businesses were severely impacted? And so it is just going to be interesting to paint a picture of this because we only know one narrative, and it has been Donald Trump's narrative that he is a wealthy, successful businessman and that is what gives him this power and this strength in this country.",

And it kind of closes that gap, I think, between spin and reality, like he has been one of the masters of our time at spinning a narrative. And this creates a fact check against all of the points in that narrative from how wealthy he is to how successful the businesses are, to where he derives his income, to who he's connected to from a business perspective. And that is all important scrutiny. It's also ammunition for his political opponents inside the Republican Party, as well if he were to be a nominee again in the general election.",

And Christina Bobb, a lawyer for Trump, says to the committee that in this meeting before January 6th, Senator Graham was saying, just give me five dead voters, give me an example of illegals voting, just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion. I mean, Graham obviously was looking for even any hint of election fraud that they then could spread as Trump wanted to do after the election. The lawyers did send him a memo about dead voters apparently. That was in the subject line. Graham's team apparently didn't find it plausible enough, he did nothing with it, ultimately.

She also had some concerns about the campaign and lawyers that were working for Trump. But then we also get some perspective from Donald Trump Jr. himself. His transcript was released yesterday and in a hundred pages over and over and over again, he doesn't recall, he doesn't remember, he doesn't know the answers to many of the questions the committee asked about specific instances, including he has asked why his father did not stay for his birthday party at Mar-a-Lago or New Year's Eve there.

I mean, it would make the speakership unworkable, because anything he does, you know you're going to have a couple of people who don't like it and then run down to the floor and vacate the chair and really make his life miserable on a daily or weekly basis.So, the people who support McCarthy the most I don't think want him to do this. Because, essentially, you're saying, even though 85 percent of the conference wants McCarthy to be speaker and to operate as speaker, we're going to put all of the power in the hands of one, two, three, four or five people. So, it seems like an unworkable thing for the people who are out there saying that they're committed to McCarthy's speakership. So, it is a real puzzle for him because he doesn't yet have the votes.

The fact that you and I are even having this conversation this close and that we're talking about potentially lowering this threshold, what does that mean?

I mean, essentially, it would give him no maneuvering room. And you could get, say, virtually everyone in the Republican conference that wanted to do something. But if you have just a couple of folks who didn't want to do it, they could throw his entire speakership into jeopardy.So, it's really antithetical to the idea of majority rules. The House is kind of a majority body, right? The party that has the most seats gets to pick the speaker. And in the conference meeting, 85-plus percent of the Republicans voted for McCarthy to be speaker. So, a majority of Republicans want McCarthy. But what the people who are holdouts here are saying is, we think the entire 435 body chamber should be put in the hands of five people, which is sort of antithetical to the way the House normally operates.",

So, someday down the road, there will be some information that some Democrat doesn't want it published or a Republican will publish and say, you guys started this. So, I get the feeling it is going to set off one of these tit- for-tat battles between the parties. So, I don't love it, it feels vindictive.
