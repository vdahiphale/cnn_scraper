      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, all essential units have collapsed. Thatis the stark warning coming from the director of the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. In a moment, I will be speaking to one of the surgeons inside that hospital for much more. Then, growing pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring home the hostages taken by Hamas on October the 7th. We'll have the very latest for you from Tel Aviv. Plus, a dramatic government reshuffle in the U.K., and the return -- as you can see there of a familiar face. We'll have much more on that later in the program. But we begin this hour at the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza where all essential units have now collapsed. That is according to the hospital director. The facility, if you remember, is in the north of Gaza. And that's an area that's seen continuous Israeli strikes over the last few weeks. Despite an IDF evacuation warning, doctors at the hospital say they are refusing to leave around 700 at-risk patients, fearing they could die if they are abandoned. Among those in critical need, premature babies, who you can see there, being wrapped up in foil and placed next to a hot water to keep them alive as fuel reserves dry up. On Sunday, the Israeli military said they had put 300 liters of fuel at the entrance to the hospital complex, but that Hamas blocked the hospital from receiving it. A U.S. official says Hamas has a command node under the Al-Shifa Hospital, and regularly clusters around it. In other developments for you, the IDF say they have killed a group of Hamas fighters who were quote, \"embedded among civilians outside a different health facility\", that's at Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza. They say around 21 alleged terror suspects were killed with no casualties on the Israeli side. Now, CNN cannot confirm if any civilians were harmed. And the Palestinian Red Crescent is disputing these claims by the Israelis, saying there are no armed individuals in the hospital, and shots weren't fired from inside the facility. Well, the ongoing violence is putting unprecedented pressure on Gaza's already stretched healthcare system. Nada Bashir has more on that, and a warning, her report contains graphic as well as distressing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (WOMEN WAILING) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): These are the sounds of the final gasp from Gaza's collapsing healthcare system. Medical staff in Gaza city working under near relentless Israeli bombardment for over a month. But now, this chorus of frantic voices seen here working under torchlight tells its own gut-wrenching story. The Al-Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza has now collapsed. It is one of many hospitals in Gaza that are completely out of service, according to officials. Those remaining now on a cliff edge. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There is a direct injury in the head, internal bleeding. And we can't do surgeries, no surgeries, no oxygen, no electricity. We work manually. We are using a manual resuscitator. It is a clear injury that needs an urgent surgery, a life- saving one. He is less than a year old.",

      "sentences": "Yes, It has been described as catastrophic by the people on the ground. The Israeli military says thatit is trying to facilitate the evacuation of that facility, including those newborn babies. They said that they would provide all the assistance that would be needed. It's unclear exactly what that is beyond establishing those evacuation corridors where the Israeli military says that it will not be operating militarily in those areas. We know that yesterday, as well as today, they did establish those evacuation corridors for a number of hours to allow people from Al-Shifa as well as from other parts of northern Gaza to be able to flee south. But what we do know is that some of the doctors at Al-Shifa Hospital, they are refusing to leave at this time and, in fact, the director of the -- director-general of the Hamas-run Ministry of Health said that the reason the doctors aren't leaving is because they are concerned about the patients in those hospitals. Saying if they are left behind, they will die of those 700-some at-risk patients inside that hospital. Now, we know that the Israeli military has really been telegraphing for weeks now that they plan to target Al-Shifa Hospital, alleging that Hamas operates one of its largest commanding control centers below ground, below that hospital. They have also shown what they are claiming is evidence that we can't exactly verify in many of these cases, that Hamas is operating out of several other hospitals in the Gaza Strip as well. But Al-Shifa hospital has certainly appeared to be one of the number one targets for the Israeli military, that they have been building towards in recent weeks. And now it appears that their forces are surrounding that hospital and are actively fighting with Hamas militants in the vicinity of that hospital, very much -- all of this very much putting patients and hospital staff at risk. Some hospital staff have said that they are afraid to go out, to get that fuel, for example, that the Israeli military said it was willing to provide for Al-Shifa Hospital, because they were afraid of being shot or being shelled. We know that there have been airstrikes and shelling in the very near vicinity of that hospital as well. So a very dire and precarious situation for those remaining in that hospital, not only including the patients, the doctors, but also, you know, that there are civilians who have been sheltering there after they were displaced from their homes.",

And we also know that we heard earlier today from a doctor in a hospital in southern Gaza, who say that they are also dealing with major shortages of medical equipment and being able to operate their hospital  fully, and they're also dealing with a new influx of people who are flowing in from northern Gaza. So, I think it's clear whether you listen to the doctors on the ground or some of these international organizations who are expressing concern about the situation, that there simply is not enough in terms of medical facilities, in terms of medical equipment and in terms of fuel to keep all of these hospitals going, given the scale of the humanitarian disaster that is happening in Gaza right now.",

As you know, electricity is a problem, connectivity is a problem and communications also been very precarious. So, we'll try to connect for the remainder of the hour because I think it's important that we get a sense of what is happening inside from this surgeon.

This is a big issue that's incredibly close to the heart of so many Israelis, both the families of the hostages and much more broadly across the entire country. Tomorrow, it won't just be a protest in one place. They'll begin a to try to pressure the government to make some sort of deal or hostage exchange between the 239 held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel to try to force the government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to make some sort of exchange. They'll start marching from Tel Aviv, from hostage square, and head up towards Jerusalem over the course of several days, arriving at the Prime Minister's office on Saturday. Now, this has a tremendous amount of history behind it. Many years ago, when Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was held in Gaza for five years, one of the big elements that put a tremendous amount of pressure on Netanyahu to make a deal for his release was when Shalit's family marched all the way from northern Israel to the Prime Minister's office. And by the time they arrived in Jerusalem, they had thousands of families with them and thousands of people. So, there is a tremendous groundswell of support, broadly speaking, for the families of the hostages and the feeling of a need to get them out as quickly as possible. The military so far has been unable to do that. There's been only four or so that have been released since the beginning of this since October 7th. And it's not clear that the Israelis know exactly where the hostages are. So, the sense perhaps growing here, that a hostage exchange is certainly the best and fastest way to bring them home.",

Those words have not left his mouth in the number of interviews he's done with the foreign media. He has not yet sat down with the Israeli media for a one on one interview despite numerous rounds of interview with CNN and with many others. And that, too, truly angers the Israeli public. The expectation here is that the government may very well collapse when this war is over. And if that's the case, then Netanyahu's political future relies on whatever happens in this war. So, he may keep this going and -- until he can get an accomplishment that he claims his victory for some sort of political campaign that may very well follow this. And that's what's everyone's tracking here as according to surveys and polls here. His popularity is plummeting and many hold him responsible. And I'll point out one more thing, Isa, when Israel started sending millions of dollars of country money into Gaza, and that was back in 2018, Netanyahu was the prime minister, the defense minister and the foreign minister. And that's part of why many people view him as responsible for what happened on October 7th.",

The Pentagon blames Iranian proxies for repeatedly targeting U.S. troops in the region in recent weeks. A U.S. official tells CNN they have been forced such attacks since Sunda. Our chief U.S. national security correspondent, Alex Marquardt, is tracking all this from us from Washington. So, Alex, what more do we know about these latest airstrikes and how concerned are U.S. officials here? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Isa, they are clearly very concerned about the prospect of this war in Israel and Gaza getting larger and to Ben's point, other groups that are backed by Iran from getting involved. And so the goal of these airstrikes by the U.S., and this is the third set that we have seen in three weeks, is to send that message of deterrence to Iran, to send a message of deterrence to the groups that are backed by Iran, to try to get them from stopping -- to stop from attacking U.S. forces across the region and to go after the very weapons that are being used to attack U.S. forces across the region. So, Sunday night, local time in eastern Syria, U.S. forces struck a training facility and a safe house connected to Iran's Revolutionary Guard. This was, again, the third set of strikes in around three weeks, but at the same time, Isa, it really raises questions about whether this message of deterrence is being received, because we have now seen more than 50 strikes since October 17th against U.S. forces in both Iraq and in Syria. Here's a little bit of what the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had to say earlier today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: These strikes are intended to disrupt and degrade the freedom of action and capabilities of these groups, which are directly responsible for attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. These attacks must stop. And if they don't stop, then we won't hesitate to do what's necessary again to protect our troops. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There has been, for the past month since this war broke out of another front opening, whether it is Hezbollah attacking Israel from the north. We have seen escalating both rhetoric and actions by the Houthis in Yemen. These are two major Iran-backed groups that have significantly more capabilities and weapons than the various Iran-backed groups that we're talking about in Iraq and Syria. And so what the U.S. has been trying to do is send a combination of vocal messages and military messages with carrier strike groups in the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, with a guided missile submarine in the region to send that message of deterrence to Iran, but also communicating directly with Iran and with its allies that they and their proxies should not get involved in this fight.
