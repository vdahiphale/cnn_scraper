And it's down to two in the Republican primaries after Ron DeSantis dropped out. Will Nikki Haley be able to put a dent in Donald Trump's bid for the White House? Plus the Indian Prime Minister inaugurates a controversial Hindu Temple. Welcome to the show and we start with emotional scenes in Israel as relatives of hostages held in Gaza forced their way into a parliamentary committee meeting Monday, demanding fresh efforts to free the hostages. A separate group of demonstrators blocked the entrance to the Knesset calling for an immediate election. It comes a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he rejects outright the conditions Hamas is demanding in exchange for freeing the hostages. Meantime in Gaza the longest near total communications blackout of the war is now over. The already isolated people of Gaza spent more than a week not only cut off from the world but also from each other. Unable to even call for help after Israeli bombs hit. The Hamas controlled Health Ministry in Gaza says now more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. Our Jeremy Diamond has been following this war since the beginning, both inside and outside of Gaza. Right now he joins us from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, great to see you, so much happening right now I want to drill in on what we've been seeing happening in Gaza. We know over 25,000 that is the death toll right now, big focus over the weekend on hospitals for the IDF as well.

      "sentences": "It really is. And President Biden told reporters that he will continue to try to convince Israeli PrimeMinister Benjamin Netanyahu to support a two state solution even as so far Netanyahu has shown no signs of budging on that. As you mentioned over the weekend, he posted on social media saying that he will not compromise and that there needs to be full Israeli security control in Gaza. This episode really highlights the latest tension point between Biden and Netanyahu as several of their disagreements have now spilled into public view, most recently around this case about what to do in Gaza once the conflict ends. Now, Biden and Netanyahu spoke on the phone for about 40 minutes on Friday. And a source says that came just one day after Netanyahu had appeared to publicly push back on the idea of a Palestinian state. A source says that in his call with Biden, Netanyahu did say that his comments were not meant to rule out the possibility of having that outcome in the future. And the two men spoke at length in serious detail official says about the possible attributes for a Palestinian state that would need to be negotiated. One thing that Biden Administration officials have been speaking about is the future of a possible demilitarized Palestinian state that is an idea that has intrigued President Biden. After his call with Netanyahu, Biden told reporters that he does still believe it's a possibility that a Palestinian state could reemerge. But it simply remains unclear how that can happen, especially right now when you have Netanyahu are putting up these verbal roadblocks to the possibility of a two state solution. Now, it all really speaks to the challenges President Biden is facing in this moment, as he's trying to apply pressure on Netanyahu on several fronts while the U.S. has very publicly supported Israel. There has been some frustration bubbling up behind the scenes with the fact that Netanyahu continues to push back on these American ideas and proposals. And it comes as Jeremy was outlining at a time when Netanyahu was facing a lot of political pressure back home when it comes to securing the release of hostages as well as how he is waging this campaign within Gaza. So it really highlights some of the difficulty President Biden is facing in this moment as he is trying to pressure Netanyahu not just on the path forward for the war in Gaza, but also what comes after and specifically this U.S. belief that there needs to be a two state solution.",

They will again be face to face inside this courtroom. And this is expected to be the last day of E. Jean Carroll's case. She's going to rest her case, after she calls her final witness. This would be her former boss at Elle Magazine, where she wrote the advice column for nearly three decades. She is also expected to play excerpts of Trump's videotaped deposition in this case, where he repeats a lot of the denial saying that he never raped Carroll, that he didn't know who she is. In the deposition video he though, mistakes her in a photograph for his second wife, Marla Maples. Now they also heard Carroll's attorneys also said that they may play some other out of court statements that Trump has made just in the past few days, because Trump is continuing to speak about this case denying he knows Carroll. All things that the previous jury is you know that already found him liable for. So they want to play that for the jury to consider when they think about how much of any damages they will award E. Jean Carroll in this case. Now, once she rest the question will be does Donald Trump take the witness stand? His attorney said that he may, but the judge has made it clear that Trump's testimony is going to be limited. He can't say he didn't rape Carroll. He can't call her a liar. And he can't make up you know suggest that she came up with this allegation for impure motives. The judge has said all of that is off the table because the jury can previously found him liable. So he will have to walk the tightrope of what testimony he can give without running afoul of the judge's orders. And as we saw last week, he's already clashed with this judge in court. So this will be a real testament of -- the judge keeping controls the courtroom and Trump not getting himself into trouble with the judge, Eleni.",

I'm not sure if you can see all the mobile phones that are out everyone's here taking videos. Everyone's phone is out. Everyone wants to record this moment. And back to us here, while these fireworks are going on, you can still hear me. Like I said about 12 hours ago, there was a consecration ceremony, the Indian Prime Minister presiding over it. It's controversial because in a secular country critics say it's not right for the Indian Prime Minister to be presiding over religious ceremony. There were 7000 guests that were present. This was broadcast across India. And of course, Hindus around the world also tuned in for the ceremony. But opposition leaders boycotted the event. They said that this is turned into a political event that should be left to religious event. And that's why they will not be attending. Now, quick word also on what this means for the Indian Prime Minister, who is seeking a third consecutive as the leader of India, just letting you know that the firecrackers are still on. But for him, it's a big moment, because it's part of his 2014 election manifesto as part of his 2019 election manifesto. He had promised that he will get the Ram Mandir constructed. And here we are. We've seen that happen today. For him it's a big moment, because it helps him consolidate the Hindu God base here in India, just to have a huge election that's coming up. But there's a certain community, the Muslim community, which is a minority community here in India that is not too happy with the consecration. Because a lot of them that we spoke to here in Ayodhya, we spoke to Muslim people who have lost their family members back in 1992 where the community clashes took place, when the mosque was destroyed. And they said that they'd be watching the celebration from a distance perhaps from inside their homes on TV, perhaps not because it reopens all routes for them. It reminds them of the violent past. Some of them are yet to accept that a mosque cannot be built here because in 2019, according to the Supreme Court ruling, at that point, the Supreme Court had said that they will be granted the land to the Hindus and they've given a separate land to the Muslims. Once again just taking you back to those visuals of the fireworks that are on and continue, it will continue for a while as celebrations here in Ayodhya will be on for the next few days. The temple office for the general public tomorrow, we're expecting thousands of people to throng the temple for one visit and one -- just to see blessings from Lord Ram.

Jean Carroll is seeking $10 million in damages for defamatory statements made by Trump, while he was President. The verdict is likely this week. Relatives of hostages held in Gaza forced their way into an Israeli parliamentary commission, the committee session rather demanding more action to free their loved ones. A separate group of demonstrators blocked the entrance to the Knesset calling for an immediate election.
