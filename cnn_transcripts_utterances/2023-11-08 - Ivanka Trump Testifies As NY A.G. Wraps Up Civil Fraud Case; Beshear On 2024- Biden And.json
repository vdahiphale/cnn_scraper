The Union representing tens of thousands of actors has just reached a deal. When could your favorite shows return? Plus, Ivanka Trump, on the stand, for hours, as the State's final witness, in her father's fraud trial. What she said, under oath, as well as what she didn't? And the Democrat, who defied the odds, once again, winning reelection, in a deep red State, with abortion rights, helping drive that victory. Governor Andy Beshear is here. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We start with breaking news, tonight, because after 118 days, Hollywood actors have just struck a deal, with major film and television studios. It would end a strike that shuttered production, across the entertainment industry, for nearly four months. The SAG-AFTRA President, and former star of \"The Nanny,\" Fran Drescher, posted, just moments ago, on Instagram, quote, \"We did it,\" touting a deal, she says, is three times as big as the last contract. A spokesperson, for the Union, also just confirmed the deal, telling CNN that that strike officially ends at 12:01 AM Pacific Time. Joining us now is Axios Media Reporter, Sara Fischer, who's been following all of this closely. Sara, what is the -- do we now have an idea of the shape of this deal, what the terms of this? Tentative deal still has to be ratified, actually, it looks like?",

But there are some clues.For one, we know that this deal is going to definitely stress artificial intelligence. That has been the big sticking point, for actors, over the past few weeks. They wanted to ensure that protections, for their actors, were built into the contract. We also know to the point about this being three times as big that there's a lot of improvements, on wage negotiations. One of the things that actors have been pushing for is to ensure that they are going to get paid out, on streaming residuals. So, for episodes, that air later on, actors will get that payment. But we don't know the precise details yet. That will come likely in a few days, once the actors have to ratify the agreement, essentially vote on it, to ensure that it goes into effect.",

She was very composed, when she answered these questions, today. And she was on the stand all day long. Now, she was once a defendant, in this case. She is no longer. So, she was just there, as a former employee, testifying about her role at the company. And the questions by the Attorney General's office, today, really focused in on some loans that she was involved with. Because remember, the allegations in this case is that the Trumps have provided inflated financial statements, to get better terms on loans. So, she was presented with some of these loan documents, involving the golf course, Doral, in Miami, Florida, as well as the Old Post Office Building, in Washington, D.C. And so, Ivanka Trump was testifying about how she had become the relationship person, with one of the bankers, at Deutsche Bank, who financed these loans. And she said she was involved at a high level. But she said she didn't recall a lot of the nitty-gritty details of the loans, and wasn't even involved that much in it, so distancing herself from the loans and negotiating them. Now, she had been asked questions, about the personal financial statements, of her father. Like her brothers, Don Jr. and Eric Trump, who testified last week, she said she didn't prepare them. She didn't know how they came together. She didn't input any information, into the values, for certain assets. So again, distancing herself, from these very financial statements. And in one example, today, they had presented with her, an option, she had to buy a penthouse apartment, here in Manhattan, in one of the buildings her father owns. And the listing price that she had for this was about $8.5 million. On Trump's financial statements, for that same year, it was about two and a half times higher, at more than $20 million. She was asked about that. She said she wasn't involved in it. She didn't know how they came up with it. So again, creating -- trying to create some distance, between her and the actual statements that are the center of this case, Kaitlan.",

But they're very working very closely with the Trump Organization team, and the team for Donald Trump. She has brought in different counsel, to represent her, in this. And she was able to actually argue and get herself removed, from this case, as a defendant. Part of that had to do because she left the business, in 2017, to join the White House team. So, she was not around when some of these claims were still continuing. And that allowed the Appeals court, to drop her from the case. It was a smart legal move, on her part, to separate herself, from them legally, and instead had her here, not as a defendant today, but as a witness.",

A big question, tonight, for the Democratic Party, is did they win big, in spite of President Biden, not necessarily because of him. The party has certainly been capitalizing, on the momentum that was built, ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. In Virginia, it helped Democrats hold the Senate -- hold the hold the Senate, and flip the House in that State legislature that the Governor Glenn Youngkin there, was hoping to change. And in Ohio, which we were watching closely, last night, it became the latest red State, to make sure and to guarantee a right to an abortion, in the State's constitution. Also, there was this race that everyone was watching last night, a Democrat, winning reelection, and going back to the governor's mansion, in Kentucky, with abortion as part of the central message of his campaign. Governor Andy Beshear beat his Trump-endorsed opponent, the very popular, in the Republican Party, Attorney General in the State. That's a State that Trump, I should note, held and won by 26 points in 2020. And joining me now is the Kentucky Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, who just won reelection. Governor, last night, you won by a bigger margin than you did in 2019, both in urban and rural counties. What should other Democrats learn from you, about how to win in red areas that are considered, generally, to be Trump country? GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): Well, I think it's all about doing your job, and doing it well. And your job, as governor, is to get things done. That means you can't be chasing whatever issue of the day there is, in D.C., but be focused on where people live their lives. People don't wake up thinking about President Biden or President Trump. They wake up thinking about, \"Do I have a good job, where I can provide for my family? Can I afford to take my kids or parents to a doctor, when they're sick? Do I feel safe in my community? Are my kids getting the best education?\" So, stick to the things that matter most to people, and then have a plan. Be running for something, not against someone.

But the abortion issue, I think, did play a role. Kentucky does have a restrictive law. But what we lack is the exceptions for rape and incest. That became a huge part of the Beshear advertising campaign. And they stayed with it for two solid months, or more, on the air.

So, they both picked two different lanes.I think he's probably -- it's probably a little too soon, a little too raw, to do too much, issue analysis like that. But, I think, when you look at the level of advertising that was run on the topic, in Kentucky, and in other States, you saw it made a difference. And I also think we found the limits of Donald Trump. I mean, Trump played a big role in this campaign. He's a big supporter of Daniel. He got him the nomination, when he endorsed him. And Daniel used Trump, to help close the campaign, at the end. But it didn't quite get him, over the hump. And there are still voters, out there, who would love everything, about Daniel Cameron, except they don't love the influence of Trump, on our politics. They turned out last November, in the midterm.

He will be. He was really good in crisis responses. He talked about, in your interview, you just had with him, about how he dealt with mass shootings. I think one thing, on the Daniel Cameron front, though, there was this belief that because Daniel Cameron was Black, in some places, that he would get some of the Black vote that might be leaning towards Donald Trump. But a lot of Black people also remember, Daniel Cameron was a person, who did not prosecute the Police officers, who killed Breonna Taylor.
