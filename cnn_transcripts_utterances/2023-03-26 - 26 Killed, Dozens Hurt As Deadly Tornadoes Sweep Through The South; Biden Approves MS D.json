The Russian attempt to take that town has been going on now for seven months, and slowly the Russians have been gaining territory, despite this claim by the Ukrainians that they've been able to push the Russians back from that one remaining road, allowing Ukrainian forces access to Bakhmut.We spoke this morning with an official spokesman with the Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country who said that essentially the Russians do not lack for artillery shells and seem to be using them quite indiscriminately. At this point, we understand that there are just 4,000 civilians somehow surviving in that city. I was there earlier this year and the situation was bad then, and you can only imagine how it is now that things have gotten so much worse. It does appear that the focus of Russian efforts maybe switching to the city of Avdiivka, which is about 35 miles south of Bakhmut, where we understand that the Russians are using -- are intensifying their use of aircraft, airstrikes against Ukrainian positions in that town and that they've been able to cut some of the supply routes. Now it's important to note that Avdiivka is relatively close to the city of Donetsk, which has been under Russian control since 2014. So it's very accessible to Russian supply lines.

It could be, what we're seeing is a tactical tip for tat playing out on the ground. But there has been a pipeline of sophisticated weaponry going from Iran across Iraq to these Iranian supplied groups inside Syria.And basically, this is a place where Iran can fight back against U.S. forces where it can't in other parts of the world. To, sort of, strike back in what we call the gray zone beneath the threshold of actual all out declared war and make the U.S. feel some pain for the pain the U.S. is inflicting on Tehran in terms of sanctions and continued economic measures to make that country stop its nuclear weapons program.",

The group says, it tracked 1,269 challenges last year, the highest number in the 20 years that it's been keeping track and nearly doubling the attempts in 2021. The majority of titles facing challenges were written by about or -- about members, I should say, of the LGBT community and people of color. We're joined now by, Deborah Caldwell-Stone, she is a director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.Thank you for being with us. I want to start here with the genre and then we'll broaden the conversation. The fact that the majority of the books are about the LGBT community and people of color suggests what to you about the motivations of these challenges to books. DEBORAH CALDWELL, DIRECTOR, AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S OFFICE FOR INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM:  I think what we're seeing is effort to establish a status quo that existed maybe 50 years ago or maybe later. A message of exclusion for those in the community. Libraries are community institutions, whether they're school libraries or public libraries. And when your books are taken off the shelf, when people tell you that those books are inappropriate or wrong, it really sends a strong message that you're not approved of, that you're not part of the community. And I think that's an element of the message about why these books are being challenged as a means of expressing disapproval. Stigmatizing the books and stigmatizing the persons whose lives they represent and ultimately advancing both the political and moral agenda that represents the beliefs of the challengers.",

An effort to really go after a large number of books that don't meet a group's political approval, moral approval and wipe them from the shelves, sanitize the library of those titles to reflect their views, their beliefs.And it also does mean, as you said, that they're not reading the books. They're going after these books because of the fact that they expressed viewpoints they don't agree with, reflect lives that they don't agree with, and ultimately, you know, just a campaign to impose one viewpoint on an entire community, take away the choice to read from an entire community.",

Saying that if this bill became law, it would provide book banners another tool and leverage point to censor materials in libraries.
