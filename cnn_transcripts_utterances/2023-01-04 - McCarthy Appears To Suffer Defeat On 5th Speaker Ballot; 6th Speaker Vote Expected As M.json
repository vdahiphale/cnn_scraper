I'm Jake Tapper in Washington where if you believe in functioning government, it is a frustrating day.United States House of Representatives remains speakerless, without speaker. (Inaudible) speaker, Kevin McCarthy failing again on a fifth ballot to capture the necessary number of votes, the number of opponents among House Republicans has actually gone up from 19 to 20 to 21. And now Republicans are looking for a way out, an exit strategy. Is that tossing McCarthy to the curb? Is it brokering a deal with Democrats to lower the vote threshold? Is there some way to get these 20 rebels on board? CNN's Melanie Zanona is reporting this out for us. Melanie, Republicans are now talking to Democrats? What's happening here?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it really speaks to just how desperate they are right now. Republicans are really searching for an off ramp as it's becoming clear that Kevin McCarthy's efforts to win over his opposition is just not working. I am told that Republicans have begun to approach Democrats on the House floor and try to feel them out and see what would it take for you to either vote present or not show up.Now, we're told that these are very informal conversations. It's still early. Democrats also insist that they wouldn't bail out McCarthy but that they would perhaps be willing to talk about something like a consensus candidate. We'll have to wait and see. But just the fact that the Republicans are even thinking about going that route really speaks to the moment, it is a far-fetched idea. And GOP leadership at this point, Jake, is not involved. I do know of one lawmaker, a Republican lawmaker, who did go up to McCarthy on the floor and float this idea. I talked to another Republican who said they're going to give it another week before they try to encourage McCarthy to look at other options here. And all of this is also coming as I'm learning about one of the demands that one of these critics made of Kevin McCarthy Monday night, Matt Gaetz, he was in McCarthy's office for a brief meeting on Monday. I am told that one of the asks that he made was a subcommittee gavel on the powerful House Armed Services Committee. McCarthy flatly rejected it and when other members learned of this the next day, they were furious, because they said this shows that some of - at least some of these critics are just trying to get things for them personally, and that this isn't about some big procedural stand, as some of them are making it out to be. And so you just get a sense of where things are right now, Jake.",

The President is not one of those individuals, while White House officials were keenly aware of kind of the figurative opportunity for a split screen, when the President arrived in Kentucky with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to talk about one of his bipartisan achievements of his first two years. They certainly didn't expect a literal one. You could see it on our air, the chaos on the House floor as the President stood with Leader McConnell talking about the $2 billion going to the Brent Spence Bridge. And while they certainly liked that contrast, they didn't expect it to be just as dramatic as it is, as we are now in our second day here. And the President was very blunt when he was asked about this by reporters. He said no, he did not enjoy what he was seeing, despite it coming from some of his fiercest critics.

It sounds like they're going to have a sixth vote and then vote to adjourn. Do you think McCarthy is going to continue to shed votes? RODNEY DAVIS, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: I think it's very interesting right now that he did not roll right into a sixth vote. They're doing somewhat of a conference meeting on the House floor without having to do the motion to adjourn. I think if they go right into this sixth vote, the key vote you want to look at is Ken Buck. Is Ken Buck going to stick with Kevin McCarthy on this sixth vote or live up to what he said just a few minutes ago on air with you and vote for someone else. If he votes for someone else, then I would expect a motion to adjourn and I would expect Republicans to sit down and talk about these things. It's interesting that you're starting to see the conversation that played out on the House floor come to fruition. And when you looked at some of the conversations that were happening in the background, just now on the House floor, yes, McCarthy allies like Gary Palmer who are talking to those who voted no. What are they talking about: I would suggest they're talking about what do you need? What type of rules change do you need to make sure you can get to yes? This is the last effort and I think every McCarthy ally knows it's very important. But here's the key, Jake, the key is Ken Buck doesn't speak for a majority of those 200 Republicans who were sticking by Kevin McCarthy and are they willing to stick it out even if you lose Ken Buck and maybe a few others.",

Maybe the number who wants substantive changes is like six or seven, that's not enough to get him there.So the number really matters a lot. But it's interesting to me, because we just talked to Congresswoman Spartz, we just talked to Ken Buck, both of them think that negotiation is a path forward. So those members who are in the chamber right now still think that there is a way to have a conversation that moves this forward and that it's not just fully personality. I think for at least four members, their heart knows, Kevin McCarthy is never going to get them. But we still don't know what the other number is. That's hugely important in this moment. Even Byron Donalds who started out in the McCarthy camp is now entertaining something that I think a lot of members, I would say the vast majority of members, that was crazy, which is going back to a one person motion to vacate. He's talking about that now too. So I think a lot of members are actually coming back to this idea that maybe negotiation is a path forward. I just think that none of them still to this - as we sit here now - know how many members negotiation will actually mean. JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm going to push back on that a little bit. They came on TV and said that. They also know that Kevin McCarthy and his allies are seeing them say that.

The changes to the rules of this place and how it functions have been overwhelmingly positive in the last few weeks. Legislation stands ready. It is time to unite, roll up our sleeves and get to work doing the people's business. Gentleman, my friend, Kevin McCarthy from California has done more than anyone in this chamber to secure a Republican majority. Many of the people who are members here today are quite frankly here because of his leadership, because they have trusted him and he has gone out of his way to make sure that every single one of us has had a voice at the table. Furthermore, every single returning Republican in this chamber who cast a vote two years ago in the last Congress voted for Kevin McCarthy as our leader. We were united then. And we must unify now. That's the only way to start the people's business. The very reason that we're all here, it's to unify and get to work. Because we must commit to unity instead of division because we owe it to the American people who sent us here. We must choose to lead in the face of a liberal Senate and Obama's JV team in the White House. We owe it to the American people. The American people sent a conservative majority to govern this body, but we cannot even begin to govern because heck we can even swear in as members of Congress. I've traveled the country for the last two years as the youngest Republican woman in the 117th Congress helping to secure a majority of members who are on both sides of today's Republican vote. Diversity of thought is a good thing. It's one of the things that sets us apart from our friends on the other side of the aisle. Yes, diversity of thought is a good thing. But they want us divided.
