I think that it's -- at first, it's amazing that this thing is still going on, regardless of the fact that Netanyahu suspended the legislation which means that the protesters don't believe that he's serious. That's number one. Second, it is still going on while the security situation is deteriorating. And the reason for that, one of the reasons for that is that the main achievement of the protest is the fact that Netanyahu had to backtrack on his decision to fire minister of defense Yoav Gallant.It just happened two weeks ago, we feel like it was 10 years ago. It's only happened two weeks ago. And people now are saying -- the protesters are saying that with the current violent escalation, if they did not protest against the firing of the minister of defense, Israel would have been in a much more serious and difficult security situation.",

Some of them are even supporting, offering -- the offering of sacrifices on the Temple Mount near the al-Aqsa Mosque.And in previous years when those people said that, they said, well, those people are on the fringes. It's not important, they will not be able to do that. But right now, they have backing from ministers and lawmakers within the coalition.

The most recent documents surfacing on Friday covered everything from U.S. support for Ukraine to information about key U.S. allies like Israel.CNN's Kylie Atwood joining us now from the Pentagon. Kylie, great to see you. So, what do we know about this investigation? The documents that have been released? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. Well, listen, it's pretty early in terms of the investigation which DOJ just announced yesterday. They are looking into this matter of this apparent trove of classified documents from the United States that have leaked onto social media. And as you said, there are a number of these documents and they are from recently -- recent months from February and March of this year. And they cover a wide range of topics. So, the initial trove that caught attention earlier this week had to do with us support for the war -- for Ukraine for the war, obviously, that is ongoing. But they also cover a wide range of other topics like regarding allies like the U.S.-Israel relationship. And then there are other topics that have to do with the war in Ukraine, such as South Korea's concerns about potentially providing ammunition to the U.S. to be given to Ukraine for use in that war or the ties between the UAE and Russia. Just a wide range of topics here, Fred that are covered. Now, we don't know -- we cannot independently verify if these are all legitimate classified U.S. intelligence documents and that they haven't actually been altered. What we do know is that the first trove that caught attention, that's regarding the U.S. support for Ukraine earlier this week, officials did say that those did appear that they were legitimate documents. And it's pretty surreal to look at these documents, Fred, because they appear to be photos that someone took have crinkled up pieces of paper and those pieces of paper that hold this information on them. Many of them hold top classification levels, markings of top secret on them. Some of them also have the markings of the Joint Chief which is the office at the Pentagon that advises President Biden. Now of course, we don't know the source of these leaked documents. DOJ, as you said is open this investigation and the Pentagon tells us that they are looking into the matter. But of course, this has really rattled U.S. officials across government, particularly at the Pentagon.",

In these 67 pages, he really rips apart the FDA's approval of this drug saying that they did not consider the risks to women and girls.But let me take you to some of those points because in this order, the judge says that the FDA's refusal to impose certain restrictions on this drug, \"It resulted in many deaths, and many more severe or life- threatening adverse reactions. Due to the FDA lacks reporting requirements. The exact number is not ascertainable but it is likely far higher than its data indicate.\" It goes on to say whatever the numbers are, they likely would be considerably lower had the FDA not acquiesced to the pressure to increase access to chemical abortion at the expense of women's safety. Now, leading medical organizations have been pouring in with reaction. Criticizing this judge for this order and the language used in this order. Let's remember here, this judge is not a subject matter expert. This judge is not a doctor. So here are the doctors reacting to this. The president of the American Medical Association issuing a statement saying in part that this ruling, \"flies in the face of science and evidence and threatens to upend access to a safe and effective drug.\" Goes on to say, the courts disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation. Now, there's no question, Fred, that this judge was sympathetic to the plaintiffs in this case. And from this order, it's clear that this judge ignored a lot of the arguments from the FDA that were made which included that this drug was safe. Fred?",

Preparing for the possibility that this Texas judge would rule in this matter. Now, President Biden has vowed to fight this decision every step of the way. And that started last night as the Justice Department moved to appeal this decision with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which some consider to be one of the country's most conservative appeals court. Now President Biden in his statement slammed the decisions and also talked about the national ramifications it would have. He said, \"this does not just affect women in Texas, if it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state.\" He added, it is the next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican-elected officials have vowed to make law in America.\" The President also talked about the larger repercussions this could have when it comes to prescription drugs in this country.

He's a professor of sociology and psychiatry, and the director for the Department of Medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.He's also the author of \"Dying of Whiteness, How the Politics of Racial Resentment Is Killing America's Heartland.\" Dr. Metzl, so good to see you. I mean, based on the research that you have done over your career, and for this book, let's look at what maybe you know, one of the roots of the expulsion of these black lawmakers. I mean, one of our previous guests touched on it, saying, \"A majority white body with a cultural agenda wanting to lock into its rulings that are favorable to a white majority.\" Do you see it this way or in another way? How do you assess this? DR. JONATHAN METZL, PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY &amp; DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY &amp; AUTHOR: Well, I'm so glad this story is getting national attention, that we're really debating the real issues about what's happening in Nashville. I will say that even though people are kind of waking up to this now, it's been months and months and years of just trying to find some kind of balance between gun rights, on one hand, we have a Second Amendment -- a lot of people are gun owners -- and something that will keep people safe in schools and workplaces. We've seen months and months of mass shootings. A mass shooting, of course, started this -- this whole issue right now. But we've had months of school shootings, kids getting killed by accidental shootings, all these factors. And really what people are asking for is some kind of common ground. I really don't think it's too extreme to say let's give families red flag laws, the ability to highlight of one of their -- one of their relatives is spiraling. Let's have background checks. The way we do when we -- really, you know, a car or anything you buy that has a has a risk. You have some kind of process to get it. But instead, what we've seen is not just rejection of that particular agenda, but really a doubling down. So over the past couple of months, Tennessee legislators have -- have tried to expand open carry of A.R.-15s to people who are 18 years old and older. They have tried to do away with really every regulation on public carry. And so really, what we're seeing now is a bubbling up of a frustration. Because people don't feel safe. And they don't feel like their politicians are really doing anything about it. And I think that's the voice that that you're hearing now. [13:35:00] WHITFIELD: I mean, you saw people of all ages -- they were children, they were adults, there were teachers, there were students -- who were, you know, protesting, who were yelling during the expulsions, you know, yelling at the well. And yesterday, you know, I spoke with Representative Gloria Johnson, the white female Democrat, who was spared from the House expulsion. And listen to how she views what happened to her colleagues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE REP. GLORIA JOHNSON (D-TN): So when I was standing there, you know, I just started to walk off of the floor, just like Justin did after he was expelled. And they're like, no, you they you won the vote. You won the vote. And I was like, I can't you know when all that started saying but that's not ok because of Justin. And so, for me, I took no satisfaction at that point for winning because I was so concerned about Justin Jones, who had who had gone before me. His -- his resolution went before mine. And just broke down in tears because it just mortified me. He made such a beautiful defense. And, you know, after his, I was like, oh, my goodness, I can never be that eloquent that articulate, that, you know, powerful. What a powerful speaker. And then -- and Justin Pearson after that. But when you heard the tone of the questioning in there on how they were questioned and how I was questioned, it was clear what that was about. It was so clear. And -- and -- and the thing was they were so good at pinpointing it out and hitting it directly. I was so proud of them.

That's why it led to that. You know, Johnson herself, you know, said following the expulsions, that -- that she was spared because of the color of her skin. So will that stand in the way of the process, in your view, Dr. Metzl, that could -- you know, if there's a reappointment of both Justin Pearson and Justin Jones, do you see that it is going to be the color of their skin that might stand in the way of that process?",

And what I found in that book was not just about guns but about education, about health care, all these factors. Instead of saying, hey, look, there's a new reality brewing right now, and we're all better off if we join together, the people I interviewed in my book, and the data I found in my book showed that people were basically willing to forego their own health care rather than create a system where everybody would rise. And certainly, we're seeing in the south that there is really a south that's different than people in the north might imagine. Many people are moving to the south right now. There are many different constituents. And the amazing Tennessee Three really represent liberal constituencies, constituencies of color, who feel like the ways of the Old South are just not working anymore, and they and they want a voice. And so I really think it's a -- it's a battle right now in a way. And I hate to use that word. I don't think it's a -- it's a Civil War. But this has been going on for a long time. And I don't think it's going to go away. So whether they appoint the one white person and not the two black people, I just think that these issues really are ones -- and again, my research shows that we're all so much better off by creating health systems and safety systems and education systems that work for everybody. Instead of what the GOP is doing right now in Tennessee, which is trying to suppress all people from benefiting from the systems that -- that really creates prosperity in the south.",
