The men are seen wearing blindfolds, kneeling on the ground. Some packed into the back of a military truck. An IDF spokesperson telling CNN that the men are members, or suspected members of Hamas. They were undressed to make sure they were not carrying explosives. I'm joined now by Eylon Levy. He's a spokesperson for the Israeli government. Eylon, thank you for being with us. What more can you tell us about this? (CROSSTALK)",

      "sentences": "During Israel close- quarter combat against Hamas fighters in Gaza, we have been detaining many Hamas members. Some have surrendered, some we managed to get our hands on. The men we are seeing in those images are suspected terrorists.Let's remember that these are military aged men that were found in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated over one month ago and where we have seeing close-quarter, dense urban fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters. I want to tell you a bit about how that fighting is progressing because Hamas fighters have not only been dressing as civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law, they have also been operating from inside of in civilian infrastructure. Just today, for example, terrorists in a school tried to draw our soldiers into an ambush. When our soldiers killed the terrorists in that school, they found a tunnel shaft inside one of the classrooms. Just today at the Al Altso (ph) University, we found a tunnel shaft inside of the university courtyard, right there in the yard! That tunnel led a kilometer away to a mosque. We are dealing with an area where Hamas has laid ambushes for our soldiers. Trying to draw them into these ambushes. We have to be very, very, careful to try to get those terrorists and get our hands on them. Otherwise, there is a very high risk to our forces that they continue to launch attacks against our people.",

That would make them easier to identify then. But when Hamas dresses up as civilians, fight within civilian areas, they make it very difficult to find them. As a result, when we find military aged men in areas that we have been ordering evacuations of for over a month, because these are Hamas strongholds where we have seen intense open fighting, we need to apprehend those people, work out who the terrorists are. If there are people there who are not, in fact, terrorists, they will, of course, be released. Hamas does not walk around, as I said, with signs on their chest saying Hamas. When we find people who could be Hamas, in Hamas strongholds, where there has been intense urban fighting going on, we have to get our hands on them.",

If you are calling for this war to end with anything other than the destruction of the army of terror that perpetrated the October 7th massacre, you are intervening to ensure the survival of the Hamas terror regime. That is telling us that they want to perpetrate more October 7th massacres over and over again. We think the real threat to international peace and security was Hamas's October 7th massacre.

And why we fight this war, to bring the October 7th monsters to justice.We are taking unprecedented measures to keep civilians safe. That is why we gave so much time for the evacuation of northern Gaza before we began a ground offensive. It's why our troops have been on the ground securing safe passage for Palestinians to leave while our men are putting their lives at risk, coming under fire from Hamas' RPGs. I do not think that during the war against ISIS, we saw British, American troops on the ground protecting civilians, leaving hospitals while ISIS was firing RPGs at them. We are taking unprecedented measures to keep civilians safe. It is heartbreaking that Hamas continues to shoot from inside civilian areas. Hamas is human shield strategy has gotten so bad that they started shooting rockets at us from inside the humanitarian zone. Israel designated a humanitarian zone where Hamas doesn't have operations because we want civilians to find safety there. Hamas has decided to shoot rockets from inside what is supposed to be a safe zone. We are going to continue to go above and beyond to keep civilians safe despite Hamas's best attempts to sacrifice them, in their words. It is sick, it is disgusting, in their words, to sacrifice them and use them as human shields. We know the United States sees eye to eye with us about the objectives of this war, about the need to continue fighting in order to topple the terrorists.",

Almost three-quarters of the country, 73 percent, says, yes, we should do what has been promised by this administration to cut those by half by the end of this decade. And if you look at it by party, it's 95 percent of Democrats, 76 percent of Independents, and even 50 percent of Republicans right now support this. It is worth mentioning that Texas now leads the country in clean energy just because of the economics of it, despite the politics and all of that. Solar and wind are the two cheapest forms of energy humanity has ever known and it's sort of starting to bear its fruit, as we see in these polls here, along with how obvious the tragedy is, the hottest year ever, $25 billion disasters.

The Democrats, going to 74, and 11 percent of Republicans agree with that. As a result of both the United States pumping so much oil, whichdisappoints a lot of the Democrat fans of the president, as well as there is the old story about climate change on the partisan breakdown. But when it comes to the responsibility pieces, as well, you see this 77 percent of Democrats say humanity in general shares the responsibility, only 42 percent of Republicans. And it sort of breaks down along those big spreads there. What's really interesting there is you see the Chinese government is the biggest -- you know, is the biggest culprit of this when it comes to the GOP. Again, it is the story around climate change as opposed to actually the science and what is happening.",
