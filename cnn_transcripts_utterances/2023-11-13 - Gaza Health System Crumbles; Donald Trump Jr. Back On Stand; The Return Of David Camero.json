It was important that a US official substantiate what Israel has said about the hospital, that it is used by Hamas. Now, interestingly, Israel has decided to this point not to go in. We've heard essentially from the IDF itself, and from Palestinians in the hospitals there and the officials there, that Israel is right outside. But that key question is here, do you risk going into the hospital? That's a decision Israel has to make. Go in at the risk of a tremendous loss of civilian life inside, at the ability to prove your point that this was used by Hamas. That's a decision the IDF has to make.

So the defense calls him back as their first witness to give that sort of leverage and talk a little bit more broadly as they start to begin their case, which we expect to last for a month. Now listen, I'm turning ahead, because he actually just walked outside the courthouse, Don Jr. He is done testifying for the day. He's already did his testimony on the stand and he's actually speaking to the cameras there behind me. And the whole day, three hours on the stand for Don Jr., mainly, was talking about the portfolio of Trump properties. The defense attorneys went through each and every property about the Trump's own and talked sort of glowingly about how they were transformed by the Trump family. Don Jr. basically alluding to his father as an artist in the real estate industry, how he could see a property and make it into what it is today. And so, really, this was to show that they believe that these values are of -- I mean, sorry, these properties, rather, are of high value. They also talked about the fact that they pay millions of taxes in the properties' locations, but they employ hundreds of people. So they're really trying to sort of paint this glowing picture of the Trump portfolio, not really getting into the nitty-gritty of those financial statements, which is the heart of this case and what the states, rather, got into when Don Jr. was on the stand. I want to say this though, Richard. When they wrapped up the testimony, Don Jr. was asked about the future of the Trump organization, and he said this, \"I guess a lot of that depends on what happens next November. Will probably be put on hold for a little while, and sued into oblivion for the foreseeable future.\" So I can imagine that's pretty what he's talking about to the cameras there behind me. But like you said, this is the first witness for the defense. We're expecting a full month of this. We expect Eric Trump to get back on the stand, possibly even Donald Trump to come back to the stand, and then some expert witnesses within the real estate industry and also bankers as well - - Richard.",

It's taken a very strange turn in British politics, as Clare Sebastian reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A relaxed stroll that belied the drama of this moment. A shock return for a British prime minister who's seven years earlier left Downing Street after Britain voted to leave the European Union. DAVID CAMERON, THEN-BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years and to serve as leader of my party for almost 11 years. SEBASTIAN (voice over): David Cameron, who had led the campaign to remain in the EU, resigned from government after the 2016 Brexit referendum. Now, he's back on the political stage as foreign secretary, tasked with managing the country's relationships abroad. His appointment coming amid a cabinet reshuffle, which ousted hardline Home Secretary Suella Braverman, accused of finding social tensions and undermining the police ahead of a pro- Palestinian demonstration in London this weekend. That proved the final straw. (CROWD chanting in a rally.) SUELLA BRAVERMAN, THEN-BRITISH HOME SECRETARY: It's the coalition of chaos. It's the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati, dare I say, the anti- growth coalition. SEBASTIAN (voice over): A tenure already marked by confrontational rhetoric towards migrants, protesters, even the homeless had sparked more rifts in the already fractured conservative party, which has seen a recent revolving door of prime ministers, and an array of outrage, including a lobbying scandal that embroiled both Cameron and the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak.

Wrong for many, many years that we were trying to accommodate the Hamas, we were trying to leave with the commerce. This is predating. This is a probably 15-year-old. I think the military failure, the miserable, the, you know, incomprehensible military failure of, you know, Israel is such a mighty country with an amazing superpower military but we simply failed in staying the guard. All this has nothing to do with the judicial reform. However, I think the fact that country was divided, I think the fact that country was torn, I think the fact that some of our international investor started to lose faith in the country and in the institution was very dangerous. I do believe and I do -- and I'm very confident that after this when this war is over and if and when we are -- not if, when we win against Hamas, Israel will be rebuilt. I think we're more united than ever. I think that judicial reform is that - - I do think that the Israeli public will hold everybody. And I mean, everybody. The military, the political leadership who were responsible for this terrible failure, they will -- we will hold them accountable. And then the Israel is a democracy and we will let the electorate decide who the next leaders of this country are. But I'm sure the next leaders of this country will be rebuilding the country. Will strengthen the institution and Israel will continue to thrive.",

But what we're absolutely seeing is that the fight over government funding playing out now is mirroring exactly what happened with Kevin McCarthy leading up to that September 30th deadline.
