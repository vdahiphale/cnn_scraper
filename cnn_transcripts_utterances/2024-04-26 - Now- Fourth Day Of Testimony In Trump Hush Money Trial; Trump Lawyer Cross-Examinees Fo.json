They're not being nasty. Trump's attorney has actually been quite polite and trying to be charming in front of the jury, as you would expect. But he is certainly trying to say, well, you told investigators this -- and this year, and now you're saying this, you're publicly. David Pecker has stood up for himself and saying, I remember what I said. This was what was said to me. This is what I heard at these meetings. Right now, they're in a bit of confusing line of questioning where Emil Bove Trump's attorney is questioning David Pecker about that agreement that he struck with the federal government that provided him immunity and is the reason he's on the stand right now and doesn't face any kind of jail time potentially as a result of this.

So, they're talking about the things that's different from an admission, right.So, what's happening here is they're drawing attention to this non- prosecution agreement that Pecker and AMI, the company that owned the National Enquirer entered into where they -- you know, they did acknowledge campaign finance violations for paying Karen McDougal to suppress her story. And so, they're trying to get at the fact that Pecker was under a lot of pressure to close this deal. We're trying to kind of take some of the bite out of this agreement in the eyes of the jury.

Story from a doorman, who falsely accused with of having a child out of wedlock.Karen McDougal, who allegedly had an affair with him, suppressing those stories. Until we hear is about a woman named Stormy Daniels. And he says, I want nothing to do with that. And there are a lot of reasons. But then he hands that off to Michael Cohen. So, he is really a polygamist that the prologue to the story because at the heart of the criminal case here, right. So, now the defendant's attorney is noting that David Pecker provided a signed declaration that stated that he sought legal advice related to the Karen McDougal that that payment I was just talking about to suppress her story. And he's asked her lawyers relied on a sworn declaration to argue to the FTC -- FEC that there wasn't a violation. He says, yes. Now this is significant because when he was buying Karen McDougal story, he consulted -- Pecker consulted with lawyers and said, hey, is this a campaign finance violation? Are we going to be in trouble? And he's testified today -- here that they've said no, you will not. But this is not the criminal conduct that is charged, right? This is setting the stage for Michael Cohen to learn Stormy Daniels is selling her story at a critical time in the campaign. Access Hollywood tape has just come out. And then the way that payment is handled and reimbursed. They are charged with a campaign finance violation. So right now, getting into the weeds of David Pecker's non-prosecution agreement, it's not necessarily going to make or break the case. But it is an important detail to get across to the jury.",
