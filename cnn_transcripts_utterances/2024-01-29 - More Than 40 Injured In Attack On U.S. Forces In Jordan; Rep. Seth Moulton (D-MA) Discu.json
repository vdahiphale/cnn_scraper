Also, she walked through the investigation that Central Command is doing on exactly how this took place, talking about how a high number of troops were impacted by the attack because the attack happened early in the morning and it attacked living quarters where some of these service members were. She also was asked repeatedly about who was responsible and she said that this has the fingerprints of Kataib Hezbollah, a group that is backed by Iran, who she says the United States will hold responsible.I think the biggest news to come out of this is that she laid out exactly who was killed, the three service members that died.",

So they were part of an activated reserve unit that was out of Fort Moore, Georgia, which is near Columbus, Georgia. And they were there serving as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. This particular place, Tower 22, has been really critical in that mission to combat ISIS. Of course, so much of that work has been done, but continues to go on in the region.

Was it simply blind, dumb luck that this drone came at the exact same time or roughly the same time as a U.S. drone or is this something the militia groups have learned to try to do to be able to sort of sneak through as other drones return to U.S. bases throughout the Middle East.

What should the United States do? REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): I mean, we clearly need to send a decisive message that this kind of behavior is unacceptable, it won't be tolerated and we're going to strike back. But starting a war would indeed play into our enemy's hands. I mean, we have had these Iranian proxies attacking U.S. troops in the Middle East for 20 years. Let's not forget this has been going on for a long time. When I was on the ground in Iraq, Iranian-made weapons in the hands of Iranian proxies in Iraq were killing literally hundreds of Americans every single year. Deterring that is hard, but through Democratic and Republican administrations, we have known that we want to deter without starting a war. These militant groups are trying to start a war. That's what they want. They're not attacking U.S. troops to strike a trade deal here. They want a war. We don't want to play into their aims. We want to stop a war, not start one.",

While at the same time, some of the forces like the Quds Force that are directly supporting these militias in Iraq and around the Middle East, they do actually want a war.There is this great divide in Iran between the hardline forces that want to attack the West and the forces that actually want to reconcile and reform that country for the better.

But I'm confident, just as President Biden has said, that he will respond.But to say that we should never have any diplomacy, especially with the elements in the Middle East that are allied to our interests, that's ridiculous. And many of these Republicans served in Republican administrations, some of them before coming to Congress, that faced the exact same problem and had the exact same dual-pronged approach. I mean, let's not forget that under President Bush, when we were in Iraq with Dick Cheney as his vice president, we were losing dozens and dozens of American servicemen to Iranian-backed attacks. But at the same time, that Republican president did not want to start a war with Iran, just like President Trump. President Trump wanted to hit back at Iran, but was very careful not to start a war.

But even without a deal in hand, we are seeing some very strong pushback from Republicans, particularly in the House. Speaker Mike Johnson already put out a letter on Friday saying the deal, at least as he understands it, is likely dead on arrival in the House. And today he put out another statement railing against one of the reported provisions in the deal.I want to read you what he wrote on social media. He said, \"Any border 'shutdown' authority that ALLOWS even one illegal crossing is a non- starter. Thousands each day is outrageous. The number must be ZERO.\" Now, that is a reference to a provision in the Senate bill, which we have learned about that would automatically shut down the southern border if average daily migrant crossings reach over 5,000 during a one week period. Other provisions that we're told have been agreed to include a provision that would speed up the process for those seeking asylum at the southern border, as well as provision to grant more work permits. So some pretty significant concessions there from Democrats. This likely is the most conservative immigration deal that has been discussed on Capitol Hill in decades and yet this deal is facing major headwinds in the GOP. And a large reason for that, Bri, is because of Donald Trump. He has been privately and publicly urging Republicans to reject this deal in a large part because he wants to campaign on this issue and he doesn't want to hand Democrats and President Biden a win. And so what you're seeing is many Republicans eager to follow his lead and that has really left not only border security, but also aid for Israel and Ukraine hanging in the balance, Brianna.",
