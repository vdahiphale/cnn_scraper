Judge Tanya Chutkan has paused the case because she says she recognizes that she does not have jurisdiction while the court of appeals considers whether or not the former president has immunity. This move could push back Trump's March 2024 trial a bit further and further into the 2024 campaign territory.CNN's Zachary Cohen is joining us now. Zachary, Trump's team called this a huge win, but this is a judge looking at the realities here and saying, okay, the appeals court needs to speak, and we know Jack Smith has also gone to the Supreme Court to get a decision as well.

And, you know, the judge acknowledges in her order that these two fundamental questions need to be resolved by an appeals court before a trial could even happen.And the first one of those issues, it deals with double jeopardy. And whether or not Trump could even be tried because he was acquitted in his Senate impeachment trial, that needs to be resolved by a higher court. And as you said, too, the second issue is this issue of presidential immunity. Does Trump have some protection over alleged crimes that he committed while in office? Does the status of being a president and actions you took while president protect you from prosecution once you leave office? So, we're going to see what kind of timeline we're on. As you said, too, Jack Smith has asked the Supreme Court to jump in and effectively expedite this process. You know, Trump's team on the other side doing everything they can to slow this process down. But the reality is, too, that the March 4 trial date still holds, even though this pause could delay or push that date back. At the moment, March 4th is still the scheduled trial date. We'll have to see what effect this pause ultimately has. But as of right now, we are still moving toward that time. And even if it's delayed a few more months, we'll see how close it bumps up to the campaign schedule.",

He was going to be the only defense witness in this case. And, Sara, the way this has played out over the past couple days in front of this jury here is that they have heard deeply emotional testimony, really gripping and scary stuff from voicemails that were sent and left on the voicemails of Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman, those two Georgia election workers, in the days after the 2020 election, while Rudy Giuliani was saying publicly things about them that just were lies, racist comments, things that were very scary, things that made them feel as if people would come to their house and potentially kill them. Yesterday, we also heard a 911 call from Ruby Freeman. She had called the police in early December of 2020 and told them that there were people banging on her door at her house. And then after that, she had to flee. She felt homeless. She could not go to her home. She couldn't go to any of her friends or family's homes. That testimony really had everyone in the courtroom listening quite intently, including the jurors. Rudy Giuliani had very little reaction to it. And actually, his lawyer didn't even have any questions for Ruby Freeman after her time on the stand. And so now, Sara, there will not be much of a defense case at all.

TIM HEAPHY, FORMER LEAD INVESTIGATOR FOR JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE:  Yes. It really is no legal significance. Congressional committees have the power to enforce subpoenas. And if a witness defies a subpoena, there is a process by which they can be referred to the Justice Department for potential contempt prosecution, there could be civil contempt pursued by the committee. So, this vote doesn't really enhance the congressional process in any way. That's why it seems, and the White House is making this allegation, like more of a political step than one with legal significance.

There's the mutilation, alteration of a document or otherwise impede, obstruct or interfere with a joint session.The Department of Justice says that or otherwise is a very broad catch-all any way a person interferes with an official proceeding, this potentially implicates that statute. The defendant in this case says the otherwise relates to the first provision involving the documents. There needs to be some sort of document issue in order to trigger Part B. I think with respect to the former president, it just doesn't matter because there's evidence that the submission of the fake electors, there was sort of a false document used in the scheme. So, regardless of which way the court rules, those counts pending against the former president maintain. They have big impact on the blue collar, the defendants that were not involved in the fake electors but were simply at the Capitol rioting, committing acts of violence, breaching the barriers. Their convictions under 1512 are directly impacted by this. But the former president's, I think, arguably, there's evidence that he implicated either provision of 1512.",
