Many people have spent another night outside now and the frustration and desperation is building, especially in some of the hard hit and remote areas.

However, some villages have not received anything, especially in the mountainous areas with dangerous roads. I hope that the authorities and civil society will show more solidarity in these areas.

CNN's Sam Kiley with more from one heart hip down.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): People here in Asni in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains have taught that when this earthquake struck, and it did this, they didn't so much feel the tremors as feel that they were being caught up in some kind of war. And that is exactly what it looks like. They didn't feel the ground shaking under them. They said they felt and heard the sounds of explosions, explosions from within and without their own homes and explosions up in the hills. And 25 people were killed in the town of Malai Abrahim (ph) which is just about three kilometers a mile and a half or so from here. This is normally a tourist paradise, not just for foreigners, but for locals too. Some of the victims still being left buried under the rubble because it's too dangerous to get them out, or actually Moroccans who were up in these mountains, enjoying the cooler temperatures in the summer. Everybody we're talking to here, though, is got a complaint that the central government is really nowhere to be seen in their words. We have seen some evidence of their help with these yellow tents offering temporary accommodation here in Asni. That's a commendation for 1,200 people who've lost their homes, or whose homes are now uninhabitable, the dangerous. This area has been struck in the last 24 hours by at least four aftershocks. Local people tell us and they're saying they're just not getting the help that they need. Inevitably there is always going to be a level of frustration from people hit with this cataclysmic event but there are dozens of these villages all over this region and for that reason, it is the hardest hit region in all Morocco where the death toll continues to climb well over 2,000 now.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES (voiceover): More boots on the ground. A Spanish search and rescue team arrives in Marrakesh to assist with relief operations in Morocco. The help coming just in time as rescue has faced blocked roads and mountainous terrain as they search for survivors in some of the country's hard to reach villages. But the specialized unit of Spain's Armed Forces has faced challenges like this before having deployed in previous disaster zones like Turkey, Nepal and Haiti. The Spanish defense ministry says the team has four dogs with them, as well as tools that can cut through concrete.

In the wake of the kiss, Spain's players refused to play again for the national team until Rubiales quit or was fired. Since then the team's entire coaching staff has resigned in protest. And last week, the head coach Jorge Vilda was fired. He was succeeded by the team's first female coach Montse Tome. It remains to be seen what happens next. But the players have been calling for a systemic change in a football culture that they believe is deeply flawed. Will the departure of Rubiales be enough? I guess we'll soon find out. Back to you.

And they have been working 36 hours straight at the moment that our team arrived.What we're trying to do then is to see ok, they've got lacerations, they've got broken bones, you've got cranial injuries. You also know that when people are pulled out of the rubble they may have sustained more severe injuries for example crush syndrome where your limbs are basically compressed so much that it risks all the circulation that could have, infections that are deadly. And so there's always this very tense situation where you tried to save the limb but sometimes it ends up with amputation. So the more severe cases have been moved by ambulance and transported as they are taken out of the rubble to referral hospitals in Marrakesh. So that is good so far. But what our teams are pointed on the ground is that the Moroccan medical staff, at this clinic were exhausted. They were using the supplies that they already had on hand. And were beginning to run low. And so our goal is to assess how can we help them, make that offer to the government in a formal way which is required in Morocco. And then hope that the Moroccan government, the emergency commission, the authorities that are now taking care of how to wrangle all this aid offer will give us the greenlight to be able to deploy more substantially, whether it is earthquakes, specialized logistics staff, medical staff, you know what to do in situations like this. Whatever they need, essentially, from that medical humanitarian perspective. We are there with our offer. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Ukrainian ministry of defense says that they work with an organization called Road to Relief, which provides aid to civilians on the front lines. Two other volunteers from Germany and Sweden were injured in the attack. A top U.S. general is praising Ukraine's counteroffensive gains, but he is warning there are just a few weeks left for the Ukrainian forces to capitalize on the good weather before winter approaches. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his forces have made advances on the southern front this past week. And he claims there is what he describes as movement around the beleaguered city of Bakhmut in the east. The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff says Ukraine has made very steady progress in the counter offensive so far. And he predicts that momentum will continue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GENERAL MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: There is still a reasonable amount of time. Probably 30, to 45 days worth of fighting weather left. So the Ukrainians aren't done. This battle is not done. And they haven't finished the fighting part of what they're going to accomplish. So we will see.

This now means that when they go to the polls next June, Mexicans for the first time in the country's history will likely choose between two women when voting for president. Xochitl Galvez, the candidate for the main opposition coalition described the passing of the baton ceremony as a circus. The 60-year- old senator described the ceremony as an act of authoritarianism of the Mexico we want to leave behind, from a weekend president who urgently needs to inherit his mandate due to lack of results. This is not the first time Mexico has seen a woman running for the presidency. In fact before Sheinbaum and Galvez there had been six other female presidential candidates. But with the two major political coalitions naming women as their candidates, this is the first time it's practically a given that starting in December 2024 Mexico, a country previously known for machismo, will be ruled by a woman.",

And then obviously, externally, whatever happens is in God's hands. And when he passed away with his daughter three years ago, you know, my heart broke. And you know, I was extremely sad, as well as most of the world of sport because his legacy will live forever.
