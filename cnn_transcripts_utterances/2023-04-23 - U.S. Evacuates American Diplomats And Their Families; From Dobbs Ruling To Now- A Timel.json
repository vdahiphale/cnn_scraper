Three Chinook helicopters took off from Djibouti, some 750 or 800 miles away from Khartoum, flew into the country, landed, secured the embassy and then brought out all of the embassy's staff and their family members. A group of just under a hundred people, according to U.S. officialswho briefed reporters on the operation and what happened around it during the operation and afterwards. They were then brought out to Ethiopia. Again a distance of some 750 or 800 miles. So the operation itself took several hours and consisted of about 100 troops all of them special operations forces with the embassy staff successfully pulled out of the country. It is the temporary closure of the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. U.S. officials said they do hope there is an opportunity here, a ceasefire that holds a resolution between the two warring parties there and an opportunity to reopen the embassy. But that is an enormous question as the fighting there enters its second week. The U.S. was looking for a window of opportunity, a ceasefire that holds essentially to be able to evacuate the embassy itself. And the weekend brought that opportunity with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. The two warring parties committed to the ceasefire even though there were reports of violations of that ceasefire. In the end, President Joe Biden made the decision to go ahead with the operation to evacuate the embassy. Now, a large question what about all the U.S. nationals, the private citizens who remain in the country, and there are thousands of them, many of them dual citizens, Sudanese, American. Right now they have no help at the embassy with the closure of the embassy. But U.S. officials did say they are considering options for land routes there. If that's the way out of the country for any of these citizens. Defense officials said they are considering surveilling the land routes out and setting up perhaps a naval option, a maritime option at Port Sudan and are looking at creating deconfliction lines so that to assist in the evacuation of U.S. citizens there. Who are trying to make their way out of the country. Again, that under consideration, a very difficult question with the fighting continuing. But as we learned on Saturday night, the successful evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. Under 100 people there, the diplomatic staff and their family members brought safely out of the country via helicopter. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.",

Nearly a year since overturning Roe v.

Because you recall when we saw this initial ruling from Judge Kacsmaryk in that federal district court, in Texas we actually got a near simultaneous ruling from a federal judge in Washington State that allowed mifepristone to be continued to be sold and kind of pushed back these attempts to limit this abortion pill. So when you have two conflicting rulings like that, oftentimes they do end up back to the Supreme Court on its merits.So I think we're in for a very long legal battle ahead.

That's been described to me as a fortress like structure. It has taken some time to get all of the personnel into that facility. The roads in Khartoum are extremely unsafe. And so that was sort of a process that took place over the last several days. But we did hear from the State Department earlier today that all American personnel were accounted for and were in a safe location. We also did hear from an official with the National Security Council earlier today that said that they had made clear to both sides of this conflict, both of the warring factions, that they are responsible for ensuring protection of civilians and non-combatants. So certainly everything was sort of building up to this moment. But we should be clear, the U.S. says -- has said that those preparations were for American diplomatic personnel, people who worked for the American government, government only. This does not include private citizens, private American citizens who remain in Khartoum. And the U.S. has said that they has given ample warning to private citizens who may remain in Sudan that it is not safe, but that it does not have the resources at the moment to facilitate a broad scale military evacuation of private citizens.

Within three minutes, he had three buckets and an assist, and before you know it, the Lakers were up 35-9. The 26-point margin tying the biggest lead after a first quarter in NBA postseason history.But look at this third quarter, yeah, taking it to another level. A lower level is Dillon Brooks hitting LeBron where it counts. He said he likes to poke the bear. Maybe that's what he was talking about. Brooks was ejected for that. And LeBron responds the only way knows how, rising to the occasion at 38 years old. Look at that reverse dog. Incredible. Anthony Davis, meanwhile, scored 15 points in the third, finishing with a team high 31 as LA cruises 111, 101. And they take a 2-1 series lead. Now, Phoenix versus the other LA, the Clippers Kevin Durant dropping a team high 31 points for the Suns and young stud Devin Brooker dropping 30 as well. Phoenix was up five entering the fourth when Chris Paul takes over, accounting for 19 of the 29 points in their final frame. He was so in his own, Kim, that he didn't even realize the shot clock had reset here, so he thought he had to throw up, basically. A Hail Mary fade away. He still nailed it. The Suns pull away, winning 112- 100, taking a commanding 3-1 series lead. James Harden in the 76ers first team to reach round two. They pull off a clean sweep of the nets and they didn't even need their MVP candidate, Joel Embiid, to do it. Total team effort led by the Swiss Army Knife, so to speak, A-K-A Tobias Harris. 25 points, 12 rebounds for him in a 96-88 win. This means Embiid is going to get about a week's rest for that right knee sprain that he has. Philadelphia plays the winner of the Celtics Hawks series. You have to see this NHL playoffs. Scary moment early in the third. Toronto's Ryan O'Reilly shoving Tampa's Brayden Point into the wall. Kim, there was no penalty call. Well, if this start flying, even their two biggest stars in this game, Auston Matthews and Steven Stamkos. They're dropping the gloves and going at it. The leaves, they would end up rising in overtime, rallying to take a 2-1 series lead. All right, Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney they bought struggling Welsh soccer team Wrexham AFC two seasons ago. There's a show about them called welcome to Wrexham. Well, spoiler alert Season 2 is going to have a very happy ending. Wrexham becoming a ted lasso like story. A momentous win Saturday meaning a promotion up to League Two. Fans were all over the field rushing. It celebrating after languishing in the sports fifth-tier for 15 years before their Hollywood takeover. Their owners are in tears knowing just how much this means to the community. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RYAN REYNOLDS, ACTOR &amp; CO-OWNER OF WREXHAM AFC: I'm not sure it can actually process what happened tonight. I'm still a little speechless, know that one thing that's running through my head over and over again as people said at the beginning, why Wrexham? Why Wrexham? This exactly why Wrexham happening right now is why.",
