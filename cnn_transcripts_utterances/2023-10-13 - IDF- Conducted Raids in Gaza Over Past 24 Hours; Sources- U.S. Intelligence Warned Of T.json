And that's why there's so much emphasis right now diplomatically on trying to negotiate a humanitarian corridor so that these Gazan civilians and some of them are U.S. citizens as well, the citizens of other countries as well. They can get out of the war zone. They can get themselves out of harm's way into the safety of a humanitarian enclave if that's to be negotiated or even better out of the Gaza Strip altogether into Egypt across the Rafah Border.

I mean the whole region is filled with Palestinian refugee camps, with millions of Palestinians who left their homes in the in the '40s or in the '60s or in the '70s and have never managed to get back again. Hamas and Palestinians in general don't want to see that happening in the Gaza Strip as well, but also militarily, you're right.I mean it's much more complicated for the Israeli military to be carrying out a military operation in the Gaza Strip which is densely populated with civilians. If all the civilians clear out and it's just Hamas and Islamic Jihad and the other militant factions there, that makes it much easier for the Israelis and much harder for those militants including Hamas to defend.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson. So what we've learned is that there were three separate intelligence reports that were kind of circulated inside the U.S. government really in the week leading up to this sort of devastating attack on October 7th. One of them, the first one, an intelligence - a U.S. intelligence assessment from September 28th based on multiple streams of intelligence warned of the possibility that Hamas was poised to escalate with cross-border rocket fire into Israel.A second October 5th intelligence assessment from the CIA warned sort of more generally of the possibility for kind of a sudden eruption of violence in between Hamas and Israel. And then a third Israeli report that was circulated amongst some members of the U.S. government in the day before the attack indicated some unusual activity on the part of Hamas fighters and Hamas leaders kind of the day before the attack. But I think as you mentioned, Anderson, what's really important here is that of all of these three reports, none of them offered a very specific picture of the scope, the scale, the sort of specific plotting that went into this attack that, of course, wound up being so massive and so devastating, right? So it offered what the intelligence community thinks of as strategic warning that tensions are rising, there's a potential for an outbreak of violence here. It did not - none of these reports offered sort of what they think of as tactical warning, individual details of the exact planning of this attack.",

      "sentences": "We should point out we don't know, obviously, the source of this intelligence or the methods by which it was collected. But you made the point in our last hour that the U.S. often gets a lot of its intelligence from Israel in this region, particularly related to what's going on in Gaza. So would Israel have had this information as well?",

      "timeStamp": "15:10:01",
      "speaker": "LILLIS",
      "sentences": "Well certainly as we understand one of these reports was in fact an Israeli report. But in terms of the two U.S. assessments, yes, a lot of the intelligence, the sort of raw intelligence reporting that the United States has on the sort of activities of Hamas and in particularly kind of what goes on inside of Gaza which is this very sort of closed space to U.S. intelligence collection, a lot of that raw reporting comes from the Israelis.   Now, that doesn't mean that the United States just sort of takesIsraeli assessments at face value and says, okay, yes like this is what's going on. They kind of take that reporting and then they sort of feed it through the United States' own sort of assessment and sort of analysis process and they draw their own conclusions about sort of what the United States intelligence community thinks is happening. But certainly, yes, in terms of the actual information much of it is - the sort of underlying information - much of it is coming from Israel itself. And so for some of the sources that we spoke to, the idea that the United States would have sort of turned around and handed Israel back kind of its own information doesn't make a whole lot of sense, right? Israel itself to the United States wasn't necessarily raising any alarm bells that they thought that sort of the - these kind of strategic warnings of potential violence were maybe anything different than sort of what had been seen in this region and in this conflict over the course of years, right? So some sources that we spoke to pointed out that, look, warnings about potential violence in between Hamas and Israel are kind of a regular feature of U.S. intelligence reporting. They show up in sort of hot spots reports that go to senior leaders of the U.S. government just about every day. And so for I think many Israeli intelligence officials as well as many U.S. officials who were reading these reports, they were viewing this as likely part and parcel of what we've seen for many years, nothing on the scale of what they saw.",

The longer they wait, yes, more civilians get out and that's in everybody's best interest.The longer they wait, Hamas gets to trap people just like ISIS did in the Battle of Mosul where they trapped 800,000. Trap them there and prepare for their use and prepare their defenses. With the hostages too, it's a paradox. If you wait longer, more cost. If you go faster, more cost. And I know the U.N. said this is impossible.
