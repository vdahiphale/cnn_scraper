I consider this a great privilege. I'm grateful for all the regular viewers.Quick story, back in 2006, after I'd been appearing regularly on CNN, usually as a legal guest, the network told me they liked my work, but they didn't know what to do with me. Do you have any ideas I was asked. As a matter of fact, I do, I replied. I think the network bras were surprised when I then pitched my idea, hosting a weekly Book Club. I envisioned an entertainment show featuring author interviews and discussion of the best in long form journalism. The network was intrigued they decided to go ahead and order a pilot. We filmed it beginning with me back at home on Market Street in Philadelphia. I remember being so nervous, and having to do many, many takes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They make you feel respected known, lit up. They can see the world from your point of view.So the story I'd like to tell us about a woman named Jennie Jerome, who later became the mother of Winston Churchill. But in the 19th century, she's in England, and she seated at dinner next to William Gladstone, who's the prime minister. And she left that dinner thinking that Gladstone was the cleverest person in England. Then later, she's seated at dinner next to Gladstone's great political rival, Benjamin Disraeli. And she leaves that dinner thinking she's the cleverest person in England. So if you can make other people feel clever, smart, funny, you've got something going on.",

And so I just collect some tips on how to be a really good conversationalist. So one of them is be allowed listener. I got a buddy when you're talking to him, it's like talking to a Pentecostal church. He's like, yes, yes, I agree. I agree. And I love talking to that guy. Another one is don't be a topper.

The amount of time we spend with our friends is down 60 percent. The number of Americans who rate themselves in the lowest happiness category up 50 percent. So it's just like a social disaster, it's hard to have a strong democracy on top of a rotting social fabric.And so I think we absolutely can change what's happened in the past. But we have to get good at these skills. We have to get good at knowing how to ask questions of each other, knowing how to disagree across difference, knowing how to sit with someone who's depressed.

She's here to tell her remarkable story. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:38:50] SMERCONISH: Before Oprah, there was Sheila Johnson, the first female Black billionaire. In 1979, she co-founded the cable channel Black Entertainment Television with her then husband. They sold it in 2001 to Viacom for $3 billion. The following year, they divorced ending a 33-year marriage. Since then, she founded the Salamander collection of hotels and resorts, became a stakeholder in D.C.'s NBA, NHL, and WNBA teams, and having served as executive producer for Lee Daniels' \"The Butler,\" staring Forest Whitaker, founded an annual film festival in her small Virginia town of Middleburg. Along the way, she has encountered racism, lost a child, suffered emotional abuse in her first marriage. It's all here in her recent autobiography \"Walk Through Fire: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and Triumph.\" Sheila Johnson joins me now. Was Oprah bummed that you beat her to that list? SHEILA JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"WALK THROUGH FIRE: A MEMOIR OF LOVE, LOSS, AND TRIUMPH\": I have absolutely no idea. And, you know, I admire her in everything that she has done.
