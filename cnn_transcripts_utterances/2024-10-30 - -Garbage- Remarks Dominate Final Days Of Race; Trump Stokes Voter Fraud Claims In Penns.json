Plus, Trump spreads claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania even though officials say the election is secure. Team Trump and Team Harris are here to respond. And the governator (ph) gives his endorsement. Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't want four years of bullshit and true lies. Tonight, on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, we are just six days out from the election. And tonight, the two campaigns find themselves overshadowed by a single word, garbage. This evening's backdrop, you got rival rallies in battleground Wisconsin. Donald Trump in Green Bay, riling up his crowd with a roleplaying stunt. And Kamala Harris in Madison, back with some pretty major musical star power. Gracie Abrams, Mumford &amp; Sons, Remi Wolf, The National, all performing to help energize young people to get out to the polls. But Harris is also dealing with a different kind of musical act, a chorus of attacks from the right, trying to tie her to President Biden's garbage gaffe, the one where he appeared to insult Trump supporters. He says it was aimed at the comedian, a Trump supporter, at Madison Square Garden, and the rally who made the so-called, well, hate to even say, joke, but he thinks it's a joke, about Puerto Rico. But Harris is making clear where she stands. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that the president has explained what he meant. But I've said it earlier. I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. And I've made that clear throughout my career, including my speech last night, before I think this all happened, which is I intend to be the president for all Americans, and including those who may not vote for me in this election.

Yes, Joe Biden has had many gaffes. But it is not his gaffes alone that Republicans arrive at this conclusion. It's when they're being called deplorables, when every single Republican was labeled an insurrectionist, when we have people saying that every single Black person that supports President Trump should be looked at quite strangely. All skin folk are not kin folks. So, there has been a permission structure that has been created in this country, in the media, that permeates the political left, that does allow for Republicans to be disrespected. So, we are not going to be having a conversation about reaching the high ground of civility over the next six days. It's not going to happen. We need to have it over the next 10 years.

And I think the American people need to understand that whoever is in the majority of the House will be the speaker on January 6, whoever wins the majority on Tuesday, and if we are to have a peaceful transfer of power and lawful certification of the election according to the states, then we need to make sure that Hakeem Jeffries is the speaker of the House for the Democratic Party.",

I want to get to all the endorsements in just a moment, but I do want to give you a chance to respond to your House colleague, Dan Goldman, who was just on. He made the statement that Speaker Johnson, and I'm paraphrasing here, could be plotting with Trump to help overturn the election results or not certify them if Trump loses. What's your response? REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Well, frankly, that's ridiculous. And I would point Representative Goldman to the ranking member of a committee we both sit on, of the Oversight Committee, Jamie Raskin, who was asked if he would accept the election results and certify them, and he said if it's free and fair and honest, then he would accept them, but then he followed it up and said that he doesn't expect President Trump to have a free and fair and honest election and expects him to manipulate it. So, basically gave himself an out to not certify the election, which is quite ironic amongst many ironies. I mean, look, I think the biggest irony of all is the chairman of the January 6 committee, Democrat Representative Bennie Thompson, didn't certify the election in 2016 and repeatedly said the Russians selected President Trump, that he was selected and not elected, and he was an illegitimate president, but yet, somehow, he had the credibility to then investigate January 6. So, this is a long history of people not certifying elections when they have issue with them, all the way back to '04 when they said the voting machines -- Democrats said the voting machines, including Nancy Pelosi, in Ohio malfunctioned and swung that then swing state towards President Bush. So, let's not pretend like this started in 2020 and let's not pretend that the Democrats haven't repeatedly not certified elections and are even giving themselves an out to not certify this one.",

But look, you have someone who has revolutionized multiple industries, has done things that no one said could be done, had literally created efficiencies, whether it's SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter, and I hope, including the federal government that has become bloated and is not serving the American people in a way that it should, and if there's some economic turmoil, if we have some type of close election, I guess that's what you're saying he said, perhaps. But what we're seeing in reality is I think the market is starting to trend because as President Trump has gained momentum, people believe he has a great chance of winning, that is being increasingly baked into the market. And what it's also reacting to, the thought of doubling capital gains, which if you built and enslaved over a small business and finally build it up and you want to sell it, and now they're going to take half of your proceeds, which is a very real proposal if you're seeing tax gains or tax increases, which is also a proposal that's on the table, because all of the tax cut and jobs act are on the table next year to be negotiated. I think you're seeing the markets could react to that, too.",

He became a republican because he believed that was the party of the American dream. He's from that Reagan optimistic right of center commonsense economics tradition. And everything about Donald Trump offense that, the name-calling.I mean, if you listen to a Trump speech, for the first 30 minutes, he goes through the enemies' list, who he wants to get even with. The second thirty minutes are a couple of crude insults, and then he runs down the country where the garbage can were terrible, we're the worst country ever, everything is going wrong. That is -- that's so offensive to somebody like Arnold who sees America as a shining great thing, not to be trashed. So, you know, Arnold reflects that tradition, which is why other Reagan conservatives like me, who aren't liberals, but we know Trump's got to be stopped, so we're for Harris.",

And, you know, then we can have civil debates again about policy, not name- calling and toddler tantrums and, frankly, dangerous friendships abroad.
