The senator says he's not running for reelection. So what will he do? Plus, Israel just announced a new evacuation window for Gaza. How many will escape the war zone in the coming hours? And the FBI investigating suspicious letters sent to election offices in six states. Who's behind it and why? Good day to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is Friday, November 10th. Happy Friday! It is 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, where Democrats are nervous after West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin announced he will not run for reelection. That will be a tough blow to his party's hopes for holding on to the closely divided Senate. Democrats can only afford to lose one seat, and West Virginia is now a bright red state. The chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Steve Daines, immediately released a statement saying: We like our odds in West Virginia. The other reason for Democrats to worry, this line from Manchin speech on Thursday saying he won't run for reelection. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV):  What I will be doing is traveling the country and speaking out to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together.

She's national politics reporter for \"The Washington Post\". Hanna, good morning. I'm very grateful to have you here. Manchin has said repeatedly that he'll never run as a spoiler, but I've talked to a lot of people around Manchin over the months, and it's very, very clear to me that he is seriously entertaining doing this. And we can talk about the Senate implications in a second, but I really want to start here, which is that he is going to spend the next couple of months really stoking speculation and I think that's going to generate a lot of concern in the White House.

Well, so, my colleagues talk to someone involved with this kind of mysterious committee that popped up today just before Manchin made his announcement called a draft Romney Manchin committee. And they say they have no affiliation with these candidates, and Romney and his team kind of pushback on that.But, you know, clearly, there have been groups interested in drafting Manchin. Manchin has been considering this. He's very much not ruling that out here, and yet, he's likely looking at a week with so much anxiety for Democrats about Biden and how he would fare in that likely rematch with Trump. And this just ratcheted up.",

Doing that is an incredibly difficult and expensive.But we really have, seen all the polling shows that frankly, voters are looking for somebody that's not Donald Trump or Joe Biden at this point. I mean, Jill Stein announced she's going to run on the Green Party ticket. There were reports out there -- I mean, I covered Hillary Clinton's campaign, and they named her as a spoiler back when she ran in 2016. And there was reporting that they've been talking to the White House about that. I was just so many dynamics. Let's talk about the Senate, though. The reality is it is incredibly narrowly divided Senate, right? And for a while there, it was 50/50. Then, obviously, that shifted slightly further in Democrats favor. But it's easily the case that control of the Senate could come down to the fact that there is no longer, it seems, almost entirely possible that one Democrat could get elected in West Virginia. What was Mitch McConnell's role in getting Joe Manchin to make this decision, and how is Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, handling it?",

Just in now to CNN, Israel has agreed to a six-hour humanitarian pause in northern Gaza today.On Thursday, the White House announced that Israel's agreed to daily humanitarian pauses of at least four hours. Already, over the last few days, Israel has been pausing the violence so civilians can evacuate south. The move announced Thursday by the White House appears to add Israel's formal commitment. The White House called the daily pauses a positive first step in the easing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

      "sentences": "I think there's a recognition, Kasie, that Netanyahu is doing this because of pressure from the White House, because we've seen the pressure that the Biden administration is coming under to do more. But Netanyahu is also under pressure, not just from people within his own governing coalition, but from Israelis as a whole. There was a poll that came out just this morning from the Israeli Democracy Institute, which is a nongovernmental organization, showing that 38 percent of Israelis don't want the fighting to stop, but do want negotiations to take place to try to free the 240 or so hostages that Hamas and militant groups are holding, which they abducted on October the 7th.So Netanyahu has broad domestic support to continue fighting. And I suppose by doing this, what they're calling a tactical localized pause. You can call a humanitarian pause or whatever you wish. By doing this and enabling Palestinian civilians in the northern parts of the Gaza Strip, where Israeli operations are, focused to have this safe corridor, which today is going to be open for six hours, in which the White House says will be open for four hours every day now, by doing so, the White House says this is one step in the right direction. But it still falls short of what the White House would want, which is a longer humanitarian pause, perhaps of a couple of days or more. And it's way short of what Arab leaders, we have the Emirates and Qataris calling for an immediate cease fire, international aid organizations, and many of the international community calling for a cessation of hostilities. But Israel's position is unwavering. And that is that there can be no cease-fire until those hostages are released. And that latest released by the small militant group of Islamic Jihad of two Israeli hostages, an elderly wheelchair-bound Israeli women, the other, a 13-year-old boy, speaking to the camera, saying that they missed their family and, friends and if anything happens to them, it will be on Netanyahu's head, I don't think it's likely to soften the will of Netanyahu and his government. If anything, it might harden it, Kasie.",
