These hearings will continue today to determine whether the D.A. has a financial conflict of interest. That's really the key point there.There will be more hearings starting tomorrow. Now, these, we're not going to see on TV. These are going to be behind closed doors because the judge is going to have to get into some privilege issues that could impact the ultimate decision here. And then we may get a ruling later this week. The judge may want further briefing. He's really left that sort of open. The ultimate potential issue here is will the D.A. be disqualified. Is there a concrete financial conflict of interest in this case? If the D.A. is disqualified the entire D.A.'s office is off the case. The case will then go into a sort of purgatory from which it may not recover. I don't think -- based on my opinion from having seen this is I don't see the concrete conflict of interest just yet. But keep in mind there's things happening behind closed doors with the judge that we're not privy to. So we'll have to see how that one comes out.",

Essentially, a submarine drone.Now, the U.S. military saying that this is the first time that they have seen the Houthis employ one of these underwater drones since they -- the group first started launching attacks against commercial shipping and U.S. military ships in the region in October. But at this point, we don't have a whole lot of details. We don't know how the United States was able to identify this target. We don't know how many of these systems the Houthis may have or where they are obtaining from -- or also, how significant of a risk they might pose to both U.S. forces and commercial shipping in the region. Presumably, an underwater drone would be more difficult to detect and destroy. So this may be a shift in Houthi strategy because they have yet to be successful in striking a U.S. Navy vessel. Now, the Houthis -- this Iran-backed militant group that controls large sections of territory in Yemen has been carrying out dozens of attacks against commercial shipping and American vessels since the onset of hostilities in Gaza in October in what the group says is solidarity with the Palestinian cause. But they have yet to be successful in striking an American Navy vessel even though they have had some close calls. The question is does this system get them any closer to that?",

Meanwhile, Russia is richer than ever before. Our Nick Paton Walsh explains why. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Blue, tranquil -- a world away from Ukraine's front lines. We headed out to where Russia may be filling its war chest to a record high. Crude oil tankers sometimes engaged in opaque, secretive transfers. These two under sanctions-busting suspicions in the past. The big one from Russia's Black Sea coast, transferring crude to the smaller one, which also came from Russia.",

And so they've been heavily associated with what we call the Dark Fleet, which is these tankers that are servicing Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and other sort of sanctions concerns.So the smaller one actually has an interesting history itself. It was once owned by a sanctioned person. WALSH (voice-over):  Russia is richer than ever before. Last year's budget was $320 billion, about a third of which it spent on its invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions were meant to dent oil paying for war. But instead, India has stepped in and is now buying 13 times more Russian crude oil than before the war, worth $37 billion last year, says one estimate exclusively given to CNN. India buying Russian crude isn't sanctioned but it's buying so much Russia might need to dodge some sanctions to ship it all. We asked an artificial intelligence firm, Windward, to analyze all global shipping last year for direct shipments between Russia and India, and they found a huge 588. A separate analysis by Pole Star Global, for CNN, revealed over 200 other ships that left Russia last year and did a ship-to-ship transfer off the Greek coast to another boat that then went on to India.",

But there's a complication for the West here as India refines the oil and sells those products on. And the biggest buyer of products from Russian crude last year, according to exclusive new data obtained by CNN, the United States -- over $1 billion from India and way more if you add what U.S. allies also imposing sanctions on Russia also report.",

This Indian port and refinery, Vadinar, sent an estimated $50 million of refined products to the U.S. last year. And guess who owns nearly half of it?
