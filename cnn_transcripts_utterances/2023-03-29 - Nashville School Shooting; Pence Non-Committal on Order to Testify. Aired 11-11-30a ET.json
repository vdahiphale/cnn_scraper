At this hour, Nashville reckons with the latest spasm of gun violence in America, guns legally bought and used to kill six innocent people.Former vice president Mike Pence will have to answer the special counsel's questions in its January 6th investigation. And the FAA says enough is enough, telling airlines they must do more to prevent close calls as a spring travel -- spring break travel season heats up. This is what we're watching AT THIS HOUR.

I'm Amara Walker, in for Kate Bolduan.We begin in Nashville, where we're learning new details about the shooter who killed six people inside a private Christian school. Police say they don't know exactly why 28 year old Audrey Hale opened fire on Monday morning. But what we do know is that Hale was able to legally purchase a total of seven different firearms and was under a doctor's care for an emotional disorder. In another troubling sign, we are hearing from the shooter's former art instructor, that Hale had a breakdown on the first day of college. We're also learning more about the three children and three adults who were killed in this attack tonight. The city of Nashville will hold a victim -- a vigil for those victims. Let's get straight now to Carlos Suarez live outside the school in Nashville. Hi, there, Carlos. What's the latest you're hearing from police this morning?",

Today we know that authorities were still spending a good amount of their work and their effort taking a look at the 28 year old's social media as well as cell phone records.They were also trying to get more information on the revelation that the shooter was being treated for a mental disorder. As you mentioned, coming out to me here, CNN has been able to talk to an art teacher at Nossi Art College. Here in Nashville, Tennessee. The teacher says that, back in 2017, she taught the shooter for two semesters. And she described an incident on the first day of class, where the shooter became frustrated, was overwhelmed with trying to set up a password for a student portal. The teacher says that, at some point, the frustration grew to the point that the teacher asked the shooter to leave the classroom. The two of them, it appears, remained friends on Facebook. And apparently, in the last year or so the teacher said that the shooter posted about grieving the loss of a former basketball teammate. And that at some point after that, the shooter said -- that the shooter wanted to be referred to as he and him when it comes to pronouns.",

The family said he was known around school as Big Mike. And we also heard from a family pastor here who knew one of the members of the family that were impacted by this. The pastor knew the Dieckhaus family. Little 9 year old Evelyn is among the three kids that were that were killed in the shooting. Here is what the pastor told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a really, really tough question, Amara. But for red flag laws to work, it's -- there's -- you need much more than just having that law on the books.You need family members or community members who see that a person is struggling and then proactively reach out to law enforcement to put that process in place, in which the guns are taken away from the individual. And there's a series of kind of legal hearings to determine when and if they get them back. So red flag laws are great. But they don't do anything to protect us if the community and the family and the coworkers, who know the person struggling, don't initiate the process. That's really why they're not more consistently applied to people who could probably use that sort of attention.",

You know the ability to think about where you want to go, to plan out the attack, to acquire weapons over a period of time, to become trained and proficient with those weapons, at least go to the range and practice how to use and function those weapons are all things that we see here.And quite frankly, we see in many -- most mass shootings. Here, you can tell by the way that she carries the weapon; there are times when she puts the weapon up to her shoulder and some of the ways that she moves her body and scanning different rooms that she's entering, this is clearly someone who has watched this happen before. Whether that's in formal training or just watching videos and things like that on YouTube, she has put some time into thinking about this, thinking how she would go through it. It's very organized. And all of those things make mass shooters more lethal, that's why they're able to accomplish these objectives to some to some degree and really take lives.",

And we need to think of them as that way so our community is prepared and emergency responders and civic leaders are ready to take fast action, to really help their community through what can be some of the most difficult and darkest and helpless times that a community goes through. I think you have to make sure, as a mayor, that you're thinking of the victims first and always in those first 24 hours, something that Mayor Cooper was dogged on, and move forward to make sure that police can do their job as well.

DOJ subpoenaed Mike Pence.And then they got hit with two separate legal objections. First, Donald Trump, not a party to the subpoena but he came in as an outsider and he objected based on executive privilege. The court rejected that. They said basically executive privilege, usually what courts will say is that it does not apply in the criminal context. It's meant to protect legitimate conversations between presidents and advisers. So that one lost. Separately, Mike Pence invoked this speech and debate clause, which as Katelyn says, protects members of Congress from having to testify about their legislative activity. And the court made an interesting ruling that, as vice president, Mike Pence did have this limited role as Senate president. So he can't be asked about what he did when he was standing on that dais, serving as Senate president while the votes were being counted. But he can be asked about things leading up to that, including his meetings with Donald Trump, which I think is going to be really important for prosecutors.",
