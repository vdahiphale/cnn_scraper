Then he was told she might be alive.And then, of course, the moment he hadn't dared to even dream of, that moment when she was finally released after more than seven weeks in captivity, he told us that she was not held in the tunnels, as many people -- many of the hostages were, that she was constantly moved from house to house in her captivity and that she referred to Gaza as, quote, the box, talking about her captivity there, said that her physical health was relatively okay, but the psychological wounds, of course, are much deeper. I want to play you this clip, though, Phil, where he talks about that first moment of being reunited with his little girl after an agonizing wait. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) THOMAS HAND, NINE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER RELEASED BY HAMAS:  She said, she'll be here in a couple of minutes. I was like, oh, don't believe it. And all of a sudden, the door opened up and she just ran. It was beautiful, just like I imagined it running together. I squeezed. I probably squeezed too hard. So, only when she stepped back a little, I could see her face was chiseled like mine, whereas before she left, it was a chubby, curly, young kid face. Yes, she's lost a lot of body weight. And the color, I've never seen her so white. The other and the most shocking, disturbing part of meeting was she was just whispering. I couldn't hear her. I had to put my ear on her lips like this close and say, what did you say? And she was like, I thought you were kidnapped.",

He said that she is getting stronger, she is eating well, she is smiling more, and psychiatrists at the hospital have been very optimistic about her progress.But still it is a long road ahead. He is so keenly aware of that. He described to us how last night, without indicating why, she just had hid underneath the covers and started crying for an hour and didn't want to be comforted and didn't want to talk about what it was that was upsetting her so much. And he said that the staff at the hospital had said it's very important not to try to coax things out of Emily at this stage, after what she's been through, but to allow her in her own time to naturally process and begin to share more details of what she has gone through.",

The sort of working assumption, I think, had been that most of the hostages had been held underground in this network of tunnels that Hamas has built, but Emily says that she was held, along with some others, including 13-year-old Hila Rotem, who she was basically her best friend, the girl she had gone for a sleepover with, that's how she came to be separated from Thomas in the first place.And Hila's mother, Raaya, who was expected to be released with them, he said that Raaya had become like a second mother to Emily during captivity. And then at the last minute, for reasons that we still don't fully understand, Hamas separated Raaya from Hila and Emily. But during the vast majority of their captivity, he says that Emily told them they were moved from house to house, that there was bombardment, obviously. She also said that they did not undergo any kind of physical abuse of any kind but that she had learned the word now in Arabic for, be quiet. And you heard him talking about the whispering as well, that they understood that they were not allowed to speak very loudly at all. The only activities that they were allowed to do were quiet activities, like drawing and playing cards to pass the time. And one thing that also just stuck with me so much, when he asked her, do you know how long you were held for? She -- understandably, she's a little girl. The passage of time can be hard to mark, let alone when you don't have a clock or a watch or a calendar. She said she thought it was a year that she had been held in captivity. Of course, it was actually 50 days, Poppy.",

And he talked about seeing Hila's brother every day and the pain of knowing that he was so lucky that Emily is out and, of course, they're lucky that Hila is out but the pain of knowing that Raaya is not.And he feels this enormous debt of gratitude to Raaya because she was a mother to Emily during that time in captivity. She treated her the same way she treated her own daughter. She hugged her and provided comfort to her and stroked her hair. And that debt of gratitude that he feels the only way that it can be repaid is in person and by having her out. And he really had such a strong message on that front not even just for Raaya but for all the hostages that the world can't forget and shouldn't forget and must continue to push as hard as humanly possible for their release, Poppy.",

      "sentences": "He is -- I mean this is something I asked him about because he talks so much about how Emily is doing and what Emily is going through. And when you ask about his own well-being, I think there's an element of guilt there that he's not being able to overcome fully, which is, of course, irrational but I think any of us as parents can relate to it, the idea that you were separated from your child, that you weren't able to rescue them.He says that when he found out that she might be alive, that he would fantasize in his mind about trying to sneak into Gaza to rescue her. And he knew it was absurd and it was impossible but he was so consumed with this desire, this need to do everything in his power to get her back. And what kept him going during that time was the adrenaline, being on the road traveling to New York, traveling to London, raising awareness, giving interviews. And now that that has sort of passed and that Emily has been freed, he really suddenly felt every ounce of energy just drain from his entire body. He is completely exhausted, and yet the only thing that really gives him the strength to keep putting one foot in front of the other is, firstly, to continue to campaign for the release of the other hostages but, secondly, to do everything within his power to help Emily on what is going to be a very challenging, challenging journey. And he said that starts out with giving her a beautiful Hanukkah. He said it's going to be a big Christmas. He said we've got to get her weight up, get her smiling more, get her playing more. And he understands that it will take time and he understands that he has to be patient and I think he understands as well we try to impress upon him how important it is for him to care for himself as well and to make sure that he also is getting all of the emotional support that he needs. Because indeed it's not only the hostages who have been through such a trauma but also their loved ones who have been on the other side waiting, agonizing and now grappling for a still challenging journey ahead.",
