First up this hour, Israel's temporary truce with Hamas and the expected release of hostages held in Gaza is delayed. Israel now says the process will not start before Friday. Now that update came just hours before a humanitarian pause in fighting and the initial release of 50 women and children hostages was expected to begin.Both U.S. and Israeli officials point to logistical details. That was for the delay, while one Israeli official says Israel has not yet received the names of the first hostages to be freed. Now, ahead of the expected truce, Israeli forces continued ground and air operations Wednesday, striking parts of northeastern and central Gaza. But Palestinians say areas further south were also hit. Meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed confidence the deal would soon go into effect and made clear the war. Listen.

How long do you spool that out?Because remember, we think that even after the 50 are out, there will still be nearly 200 hostages. And then the third question, and maybe the hardest one of all, is if you're the Israelis, how do you restart the bombing?

We know that some have reopened. And we also know that there's extra security measures that were taken at the airports in that area. And, even, really in some U.S. major cities in the Northeast. But, we know some of that has been tamped down. But certainly, heightened security is the theme here as we head into the holiday. And that was the case even before this incident happened. But, again, the headline here that it does not appear to be a terrorist incident. I'm Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York. ' (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The comment that, quote, \"We should think about how to stop this tragedy,\" though, is more unusual.But it's not clear that Putin is overtly calling for peace talks here. Ukraine ruled out peace talks with Putin last year after Russia had a ceremony, illegally annexing four occupied regions in Ukraine, nearly a fifth of the country. And Putin has repeatedly used that to accuse Ukraine of getting in the way of peace. This seems like more of that rhetoric. But it's also clear that this is a moment when Putin may feel emboldened. Ukraine has not liberated any significant amount of territory in a year. Russia still has more manpower and industrial capacity, despite the efforts of Ukraine's allies. And it will, of course, be keenly aware of the paralysis in the U.S. Congress over funding and some signs of fatigue among Ukraine's European allies. Ukraine, for its part, is unwavering on its stance on peace talks. In a recent social media post, the foreign minister calling Putin a, quote, \"habitual liar,\" saying no one can seriously use the words \"Russia\" and \"negotiations\" in the same phrase.
