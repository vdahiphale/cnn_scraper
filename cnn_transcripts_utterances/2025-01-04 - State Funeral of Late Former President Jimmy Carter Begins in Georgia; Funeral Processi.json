But it would not have happened, of course, without Georgia and Atlanta, where he served, as you said, as a state senator and as a governor. And it was his work as a governor, also ahead of his time at that moment, that led him to the presidency.And his life will be celebrated, I think, quite appropriately, through the chapters in which he lived. We will see him going, obviously, from Plains, his small town, here to Atlanta where he began his rise. But I do think the Carter Center behind us here represents his largest work of all, the post-presidency where he lived, the longest living president, stretching over nearly five decades of time. But when he came back to Georgia in his defeat, there was a choice facing him. He wasn't sure at first, but then he decided, along with the Rosalynn, of course, to open the Carter Center, that really when you walk through it, it just celebrates and documents all that he has done. And it's not a history museum. It was a very active center where he was across the world, as you know, doing election work, obviously, humanitarian work, peacemaking work. So it is inside the Carter Center that really is his largest legacy. BLACKWELL:  Active for 40 years post-presidency. And what we'll see today is how the early years of Carter's life informed his work, not only in office but after his time in office, starting at that farm, that boyhood farm where he wrote in an hour before daylight about some of the lessons that he learned there that informed his work as president and some of his priorities.",

What I found to be interesting is there are so many people with personal stories about meeting even the former president on a Delta flight. You know, he would walk through and shake everyone's hand.

I mean, really up until the last few years, he's been traveling around the world eradicating guinea-worm, fighting for fresh water and other things. But I think, politically speaking at least, and again, his life will be discussed in chapters this week as he goes to Washington, both parties sort of used him in their own ways. Donald Trump during the presidency used him to mock Joe Biden. Democrats have not always embraced him at all. I remember during the Obama administration, Barack Obama did not want to be compared to Jimmy Carter. So I think his important work was he was ahead of his time in the presidency, there's no doubt about it, from putting solar panels on the White House back in the 70s. Reagan, of course, removed them.

Thank you all for being here, appreciate it. Kai, you are a biographer of the of the late president, and I was just reading something that you wrote back in 2023 when he went into hospice, which, by the way, just speaks to the entire the strength of this man that he was in hospice for so long, where you write, among other things, \"Mr. Carter remains the most misunderstood president of the last century.\" Why? KAI BIRD, AUTHOR, \"OUTLIER, THE UNFINISHED PRESIDENCY OF JIMMY CARTER\":  Well, he was an outlier in everything from his childhood growing up in Archery, where he was the only white boy virtually in this hamlet where all his playmates were African American children, to when he became governor and then declared on his, in his very first day in office that the time for racial discrimination was over. He was an outlier -- well, let me tell you this story. His first day in office, he came in and he signed a proclamation issuing amnesty for all Vietnam era draft evaders. His second decision was to hire Mary Prince, an African American woman who was a convicted murderess. And she he brought her out of penitentiary in Georgia to the White House and put her in the third-floor bedroom, and she served as his daughter Amy's nanny for the rest of the of his White House years. And she continued to work for him until the day he died. This is a very unusual man who was driven by his faith and his desire to do the right thing. He was a very unusual president.",

And it is extraordinary that both Rosalynn Carter and Jimmy Carter were so ahead of their time. They thought that Mary was unfairly convicted. She was a black woman in Georgia, at a time when racism was rife. And they did something about it. I think with this video, you see that they were in such a small, tiny town, less than 700 people in Plains. And when I went to interview them, I was just struck by how normal they were.

His father, of course, held very racist views, as did a lot of people during the time. His mom had more progressive views, but he brought that to the country, this idea that America could be better than its racial past, it could get over its racial history.

He was very proud of his service in the Oval Office. And he accomplished actually, legislatively speaking, more than any other president in the 20th century. The list of laws he passed -- seatbelts mandated, airbags mandated, saving 10,000 American lives every year to this day, deregulating the economy, allowing middle class Americans to fly in airplanes for the first time in large numbers. He transformed America domestically. He saved Social Security. He passed the first major immigration reform bill in decades. He, on foreign policy, he passed the Panama Canal treaty. He did Camp David, bringing peace between Israel and Egypt. He passed the SALT canal, SALT II treaty on arms control. It was just an extraordinary record, and it's all been forgotten.",

Right now, the Carter family motorcade is en route to the late president's boyhood home that is in Archery, Georgia. We just saw the former and current Secret Service agents who protected Carter during his very, very long lifetime escort his casket to the hearse in a very somber ceremony.And soon at Carter's boyhood home, the National Park Service Honor Guard will salute and ring the farm bell 39 times as a tribute to Carter being the 39th president of the United States. The motorcade will then head to Atlanta for its next stop at the state capital there. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp will be there to lead a moment of silence. Victor Blackwell is at the Carter Center in Atlanta where there will be a private ceremony for former late President Jimmy Carter later today.

The motorcade there at Archery, Georgia, the boyhood farm where he spent most of his childhood. Earl Carter, his father, took ownership of that farm in 1928, when Carter was just four years old. He was there until he left for college, and it really shaped a lot of his views, especially as it came to civil rights, which he called human rights, not just civil rights or black rights, but human rights. And that's what I want to bring in CNN's Jeff Zeleny and take a deeper look at the former president's approach to human rights of Americans and people around the world, because you mentioned this just a few moments ago, that 1971 inaugural declaration that the time for racial discrimination is over in Georgia.

But that was the first, really a signal of what his governorship would be like, but also his presidency would be like. And not far from here in Ebenezer Baptist Church, he also spoke because he was president. He said the only way to overcome unequal history is to promote and defend equal opportunity. That was sort of the anthem of his life as a public servant, equal opportunity. But he did see that as human rights. And you're right, it started right here in archery because of how he was raised.",

He joins us now, CNN contributor and Carter's former chief White House domestic policy adviser. Mr. Ambassador, good morning to you. And as we watch the National Park Service and those who work there at the boyhood farm, what goes through your mind about how these moments and those early experiences informed his views and choices as president? STUART EIZENSTAT, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  So thank you, Victor. The arc of his life goes from that farm that we're going to see, which had no insulation, no electricity, no indoor plumbing. They got their water from a windmill driven well. And their connection to the outside world was a battery-powered radio. And the fact that he could come from that background to the White House is remarkable. But also, he lived in a county that was 60 percent black. His childhood playmates, with the encouragement of Miss Lillian, his mother, were black. And so he understood in ways that other Democratic candidates didn't when he ran for president. I was his policy director at that time. They were talking about new programs, and he connected with black voters because of the shared experience that he had that really let him see personally the discrimination, the lack of opportunity. And when he went on the school board, Victor, he went into a black school, and he saw in a high school that the seats were for five and six-year-olds. It was impossible for a kid to do. And he said, this is the kind of discrimination we can't tolerate anymore. So he saw this from the ground level up. It was very personal to him. When Andy Young took him to the Black Caucus in Congress to try to convince them to support him, there was great feeling. Why are we seeing, as Charlie Rangel from New York said, this Georgia cracker? Well, when he started talking about his background, his feelings of what happens when you see discrimination, it totally transformed the whole caucus. So his connection with black voters and with black Americans and with all of the under-trodden was important.",

And he could not have lived his life any more differently. If you speak to people here, they often celebrate his modesty, the way that his small-town roots really informed his entire life.And so that is what people will remember most. It is often said that he treated everyone just the same. And I'm just watching here. It seems like the vehicles are coming through now. We see people waving the American flags.

BROWERthis, a nostalgia for an earlier time when politicians were more authentic. I mean, he was born between World War I and the Great Depression, right?

Walter Mondale, his vice president, told me you would never make that argument to him, because that would be the minute the decision he wouldn't do, he wouldn't make, because he wasn't about getting reelected.
