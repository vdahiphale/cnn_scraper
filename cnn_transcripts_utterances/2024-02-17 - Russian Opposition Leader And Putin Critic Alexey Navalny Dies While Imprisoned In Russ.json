Navalny's team says his mother and lawyer arrive at the morgue today where officials told them his body was being examined only to be told his body was not there. And a growing number of countries, including the U.S., are blaming Vladimir Putin for Navalny's death.There are also security concerns about Russia's plans for space, CNN learning exclusive new details about the Kremlin's attempts to develop a nuclear weapon capable of destroying satellites and paralyzing global communications. Leaders in Munich are also laser-focused on the wars in Israel and Ukraine. Today, Vice President Kamala Harris held a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. She pledged unyielding U.S. support despite deadlock in U.S. Congress for supplemental security package. Lawmakers are now on a two-week recess even as Ukrainian forces make a major retreat from the front lines. We begin with the world reaction to the death of Alexey Navalny's, starting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Speaking to CNN's Christian Amanpour at the Munich conference, Zelenskyy said this is just another example of why the world needs to stand up to Vladimir Putin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But at the most generous interpretation, a man in very frail health was sent to an Arctic Circle prison and clearly not looked after by the authorities day. His mother, according to Navalny's team, Lyudmila Navalnaya, went to our I.K. Three, the Polar Wolf prisoner that's called up near the Arctic Circle to try and get more information, to perhaps try and retrieve the body. She got a telegram confirming his death, was told to go to a morgue where the body was. The morgue said the body wasn't there. And so Navalny's team being quite clear that the circumstances of the investigation as opaque as the circumstances of the death. They'd been told, they say, initially that nothing quote, criminal has been assessed, but they have absolutely no confidence, I think it's fair to say, in those results. Still, the death of Navalny, tragic and awful as it is, has provided a very different backdrop here to that which potentially 48 hours ago might have been the case. There were concerns this key annual meeting might've been clouded by former President Trump's comments about how the U.S. might not necessarily uphold its commitments to NATO in the future and even goad Russia to attack what he referred to as delinquent members. Instead, that's been pushed aside by the very clear threat Russia has posed to its own dissidents, but also, too, that's been echoed by Ukraine here as a reflection of the threat that they also face. Now Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on stage today. His official view of the death of Navalny as a reminder that simply Putin cannot be trusted. He cannot be negotiated with, trying to push aside the idea that diplomacy might have a role in the months ahead. And instead, Zelenskyy, too, having to unveil, tolerate, explain the first real results, I think, we're seeing of the freeze or the slowdown in western aid. Remember $60 billion have been held up by Republican dysfunctionality in Congress. Today, he had to say that Avdiivka, a key town in the east where weeks, months of fighting have lost thousands of lives, Ukraine had to withdraw from that this morning, or announce its withdrawal. That's the first sign, I think its fair to say, of Russia moving forward since May last year when they took Bakhmut. It's certainly a reflection of the slowdown in western aid. Zelenskyy said, look, we only lost one soldier for the seven, for each seven, Russia lost. Those figures, confirmed or not, show, I think how, much Moscow is willing to exhaust its own human resources for minor gains here, and I think a reflection of how acute the threat is, clearly seen now here in Munich, a dark couple of days of, frankly, European security going forward, Fredricka.",

That was when the White House released its national security supplemental request, sending that to Congress. It included, among other priorities, $60 billion for Ukraine. Now that has remained stalled amid infighting in Congress. Now, this week there was some progress with the Senate passing a foreign aid package that includes those $60 billion for Ukraine. But the House is now on a two-week recess, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled that he has no plans to move this package forward on the House floor, which puts this all into question and the future of this aid remains unclear. Now, in her remarks today, Vice President Kamala Harris said that this was not a time to play politics, essentially taking a swipe at House Republicans.

And the question moving forward is whether that changes the calculus, because front and center to all of them when talked about by the president and the vice president is not ceding any ground to Russia.

And there are many, many things that the supporters of Alexey Navalny are asking the west do right now, but foremost among them it is to continue to support Ukraine in its battle against Russia.Right now, of course, that is a very uncertain thing here in Washington, where I'm sitting. It's remarkable how quickly American political support among Republican elected officials has been tangled up in our election year politics. I think the issues of the war itself and of the national security challenges for the U.S. and Europe have been lost in a lot of heated rhetoric that has little to do with the war. And certainly, it was something that Alexey Navalny believed very strongly even from prison. He spoke out about the horrors of Putin's war in Ukraine and what it was doing to Russia as well.",

The message from Putin, conversely, is that he somehow thinks this project strength. But what kind of strongman needs to murder someone who was already languishing in his jails?

What kind of reassurance can the U.S. really offer Europeans until Election Day and the prospect of Trump returning to office is known or not this week has also in addition to Navalny's murder, seemed Donald Trump doubled down on not only questioning the value of the NATO alliance, but even seeming to invite Russia to do whatever it wants to those NATO allies who, in Trump's view, do not contribute enough to their own defense. This is a remarkable statement, and I don't think there's any words that can possibly be reassuring from the vice president or the president until the election tells the world whether America is going to go down that kind of a course again with Donald Trump.",

I first met them more than 20 years ago when I was covering the South Carolina primary. My now wife and I watched the Super Bowl at the Governor's mansion in 2004. Mark going awol, reading poetry and the Bible while on a weeklong solo hike, that frankly, seemed totally believable. So when folks begins speculating about seedy possibilities, I wrongly wrote it off as the worst kind of sensationalist journalism. And when it was proven true, I felt dumb.

He survived being found guilty already on two different trials, and there are several more to go. And he's been even kicked off the ballot. And yet he continues to do better and better as time goes on, because in the end, it's not in a vacuum. It's Donald Trump versus Joe Biden.That said, I believe donors will be annoyed, angry at the fact that their money isn't going to his presidential campaign, but it's going to his legal fund. Now, make no mistake, Trump's supporters are willing to follow him to the ends of the earth. He has greater intensity of support that any candidate I've ever seen in my professional career. But the idea that this is going to lawyers to pay off guilty verdicts, that may be the beginning, and I'm so careful about saying it, but in the end, I do know that some voters will resent that, will oppose that.
