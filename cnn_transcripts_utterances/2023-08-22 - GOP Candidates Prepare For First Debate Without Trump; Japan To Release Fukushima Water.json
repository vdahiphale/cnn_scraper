      "sentences": "Yes, Danny. I think -- look, if the purpose of these drone strikes -- which, by the way, Moscow says it prevented -- are to sow disruption and chaos to some degree. Then I think, to some extent, it's working.We've seen airport restrictions come in several times over the past few days. This morning, the state media are reporting that nine flights had to be diverted. That's on top of 45 passenger flights and two cargo flights that had to be diverted on Monday morning in the early hours due to other attempted drone attacks. And you can see here some damage to a building in the town of Krasnogorsk, which is just to the west of Moscow. That is also the town where the government of the Moscow region is headquartered as well. Not a lot of damage and no casualties. But again, this looks like an attempt -- and Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility, but it looks like an attempt to sort of crack that propaganda facade to bring it home to the Russian people that this is -- this is not, in fact, a small-scale special military operation, as Russia calls it. And I think you have to view separately from these the attacks that we're hearing about -- two separate incidents at Russian air bases -- one that Russia has admitted to that happened on Saturday at an air base not far from St. Petersburg, and a second one on Monday at the Shaykovka here -- the Shaykovka Air Base just to the west -- southwest of Moscow where Ukraine says it damaged a Russian plane. That looks more like specific military targeting trying to ease the pressure on the front lines. But I think the bottom line here is that the volume of these drone attacks within Russia now are increasing with very startling regularity and it speaks to the expanding tactics and scope of this war, Danny.",

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Top Republican presidential hopefuls are gearing up for the first primary debate Wednesday in Milwaukee without GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Should I do the debate? Maybe we'll do something else. HOLMES (voice-over):  The former president announced Sunday he would skip the first debate and possibly others, citing his advantage in primary polls. CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He's a coward. HOLMES (voice-over):  The former president's rivals calling out his decision -- RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think he owes it to people.

That's when you're going to start to see people really focus in on different candidates and look at what their options are. We feel really good going into the debate. HOLMES (voice-over):  Trump's decision not to attend the debate comes as a new Iowa poll shows the former president with a commanding lead in the critical early nominating state. Forty-two percent of likely Republican caucusgoers say Trump is their first choice, more than doubling the support of his nearest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. While no other hopeful reached double-digit support, a majority of those polled said they could be persuaded to back someone other than their first-choice candidate. And for those contenders who will be on the debate stage, that's the opening they're hoping to capitalize on. DOUG BURGUM, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're excited to be on the debate stage -- the least known candidate on there. HOLMES (voice-over):  So far, eight candidates have qualified for the debate and signed a loyalty pledge vowing to support the party's eventual nominee -- a step Trump has refused. In Trump's absence, DeSantis is set to be the leading candidate on stage. His campaign circulating a memo to supporters and donors says the Florida governor is prepared quote \"to be the center of attacks.\" Over the weekend, DeSantis sparking backlash from Trump's backers after these comments.",

I know that Asa Hutchinson has also been one of the few on the list that has been very vocal against the president. But if you look at Mike Pence, who really was targeted on January 6, he's said the former president shouldn't have done these things. The former president should have not pushed us to this point. But he hasn't really used the indictments in his favor, so I don't expect to see a lot of that. I know that Ron DeSantis -- if you read that memo and if you kind of see where that memo that his allies posted is going to, it says he's not going to pile after Trump.

But also the fact that this grouping, despite their vastly different political and economic models, these leaders -- they are bonded over their sheer desire and, some would say, grievances against a U.S.-led global order. So that's why they'll be talking about potentially expanding this group and relying less on the U.S. dollar -- all of which, of course, could benefit China at a time when tension remains very high between Beijing and Washington with a lot of chatter about the coupling. But also, benefits -- this could also benefit Xi Jinping himself as he cements his leadership role in this grouping. But let's not forget Xi Jinping arrived in South Africa at a time when the Chinese economy is facing its strongest headwinds in decades. He's facing a myriad of problems at home and that means he is perhaps seeking new markets for Chinese exports in the -- in the emerging markets. But also, he may face more constraints when it comes to what kind of projects China may be able to invest and finance across the so-called global south -- especially in Africa. That's why some experts say we are seeing this shift in strategy. They are adopting a more low-cost, high-impact strategy by bringing more African military officers to China for training, for example. But also, expanding its soft power through cultural investments and the propaganda. One thing they are doing, Danny, is launching a show called \"Classics Quoted by Xi Jinping.\" So I'm sure they hope that's going to be a hit in Africa -- Danny.",
