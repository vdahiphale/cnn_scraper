What we understand from Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia, and I think what we heard from her today was probably the clearest indication we've had so far, that in the wake of her husband's death, she intends to carry things forward herself. She'd never really sought the limelight until now, but it was a nine-minute video message in which, she really called on Russians not to let the death of her husband go in vein. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, WIDOW OF ALEXEI NAVALNY (through translator): I ask you to share your rage, anger and hatred with me towards those who were daring enough to kill our future, and I address you with Alexei's words, which I believe it is not ashamed to do. It's not ashamed to do little, but it's a shame not to do anything. It's a shame to make yourself intimidated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That show the great courage, the fortitude, the resilience that he showed right up until the end. And there was little suggestion that he was going to make it out of this Penal Colony. But that the end should have come as suddenly as it did, of course, raising so many questions not least amongst those members of his party's surroundings who are now outside the country. We've been hearing from his spokeswoman who says that they've now been told they won't have access to his body, Lynda, for 14 days. So, of course, plenty of time for what? Yulia, his widow, has suggested, maybe the Novichok to be -- to leave his system. But that certainly is the fear amongst those around him, that the body is being kept in order that any signs of what might have caused his demise will disappear. What the authorities say is that this is an inquiry that is ongoing, and we will learn more once they've had a chance to examine the late opposition leader's body. Lynda.",

It's been described as a gateway to the Donetsk city that is in Russian hands, and has been since 2014. Ukrainians have defended it because of what it meant for its supply lines and what it meant also for Russian, Russia's ability to strengthen its positions around Donetsk and bring reinforcements beyond. And what is left of the city is now in Russian hands. That is a blow to Ukrainians. And of course, as you say, it comes at a time when they've desperately been asking for more help for their fight against these forces that have so often over the course of the nearly two last years, proven to be stronger in numbers, stronger in equipment and outgunned and outmanned the Ukrainian attempts at defending places like this town that has just fallen. So, a blow to them that it has come back on Russian hands, and I think it is no surprise that what you're seeing on state Russian media is not only the usual entertainment channels, very little about Alexei Navalny and a great deal about the fall of this particular eastern Ukrainian city and what Russia believes it might mean.

The White House saying that the president directly spoke about the fact that Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from a key town due to the fact that they don't have enough ammunition, they don't have enough military assistance coming into their country. The president himself said that he could not completely rule out whether other towns in Ukraine could also fall as they are facing these ammunition and weaponry shortages. But even as the president is trying to ramp up this pressure on House Republicans, he's running up against the political reality that there is still a small group of Republicans who do not want to see this aid package come up for a vote. The president said he's willing to talk with House Speaker Mike Johnson if he actually has anything to say. But it really   remains entirely unclear if the president will be able to get this aid passed or if Republicans will simply just dig in, in the wake of these latest situations.",

It comes in the wake of Ukraine's retreat from the eastern city of Avdiivka. It is the first big gain since Russia took a Bakhmut nine months ago. Well, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has the details on this pivotal moment in the war, but I must warn you some of the images in his report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A sight not seen for a while, a Russian flag going up over Ukraine. But Ukraine's withdrawal announced on Saturday from Avdiivka means more than the loss of a town bitterly fought over since Russia first invaded a decade ago. It is perhaps the first sign a delay in U.S. aid spells death and loss here. These images released of their last defenses rushing into support under fire. From a resurgent Russia, who President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says sent seven Russian troops to die for every dead Ukrainian. This is what it was like in the basement defending down to the last, treating the injured in the darkness, yet aware their options, their ammo, their chances were ebbing. \"Shelling, endless, it spoiled my drink.\" This soldier complains, a commander clear Monday why this happened. \"We didn't have enough people,\" he says. \"We didn't have enough shells. We didn't have enough possibilities to throw them back.\" Russia's Ministry of Defense released images of their final onslaught on that coke plant and what they claimed were the casualties inflicted on Ukrainians as they tried to flee in the dark. Other images and reports emerged Monday in Ukraine of the fate of their wounded, one of whom called home in his last moments. Allegations that, in the horrifying rubble here, both the wounded were left behind by Ukraine but also shot dead in cold blood by Russian forces. Russian drone images of their spoils released again displaying their odd pride over the rubble. Zelenskyy may have to get used to more of this, putting on a brave face, as he visited troops in the likely next Russian target, Kupyansk, just outside Kharkiv. \"Although there are different political sentiments in the world,\" he said, \"different flashes of problems that distract attention, we still, all together, do our utmost to have the world with us, with Ukraine.\" Words no longer enough, not in Avdiivka and certainly not in the West, where $60 billion in missing aid now means Putin can slowly edge further and further West.

So, some of thematerial resources are coming from the U.S. Others have not, you know, the ones who have not lived up to their 2 percent goal of the GDP have made decisions not to financially support the kinds of stockages and stockpiles that they need to sustain a very long war. We are learning lessons from this conflict in Ukraine. We are learning that it is intensive, that it doesn't just stop in a short war scenario. I think we were misled by some of the actions in Desert Storm in 1990, thinking that all future conventional fights were going to be quick and precise. And that's not what the history of war teaches us. Sometimes war lasts a very long time using imprecise weapons and we have to continue with a strong will to counter all those things.",

There's no question people were on the move domestically, 474 million trips according to the government up from pre-COVID days although international travel was below pre-pandemic levels, but you can look at this at its face value. CNN calculations based on official data show the average tourism related spending per trip was below pre-pandemic. This most recent holiday season took place over eight days from February 10th to February 18th which was one more day than previous periods. China's economy is dealing with many challenges. In January, consumer prices fell by their fastest pace in 15 years marking a fourth straight month of decline and the property sector remains sluggish while the job market is still under pressure. Perhaps a sign of people trying to escape all the gloomy news, movie ticket sales reached a record of more than $1 billion during the holiday. The end of the holiday marked the opening of the Chinese stock market with the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Index seen modest gains. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.",

It's the annual eventin London where movie royalty mixes with actual royalty. You can see there Prince William making an appearance on the red carpet. But all eyes were on Oppenheimer the bio epic about the man who helped usher in the nuclear age which got 13 nominations and won seven awards. The winner for Best Documentary was 20 days in Mariupol and is about the war in Ukraine. And the plight of women living under Taliban rule is highlighted in a 2023 short film called Yellow. It showcases the changes women in Afghanistan are increasingly forced to confront starting with wearing the burqa. Take a look. Well, the film follows a young woman buying her first burqa right after the Taliban restrictions come into place. The film by Elham Ehsas qualified for an Oscar and was nominated for a BAFTA. CNN's Isa Soares sat down with him. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

ELHAM EHSAS, DIRECTOR, BAFTA-NOMINATED FILM \"YELLOW\": It is really interesting you asked that because I have been asked that question before. How hard was it to tell a story from a female perspective? I did it -- I said it from a male perspective that Afghan women and girls who are being treated as second-class citizens right now, we feel their pain. They are our Afghan sisters, our Afghan mothers, our Afghan family members.

And I'm very proud of the film, I'm very proud of my team who helped me bring it to life. This is a tiny film that we did with almost no budget and just a bunch of friends who are passionate about this story and we thought this story was important to tell and to tell it in a way that isn't preachy, that isn't heavy, but that makes you think and makes you actually question there is no reason for Afghan women. Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls are banned from an education after the sixth grade. They do not have access to gyms, they do not have access to parks, jobs, and there is absolutely no excuse for the Afghan government to do that. The Afghan government needs to be questioned on their intentions with half of their population.",
