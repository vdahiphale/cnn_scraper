The balance of power in Washington is in a state of limbo. In the House of Representatives, the Republicans need nine more states to clinch a majority while the Senate has come down to just three states. Arizona is too close to call, so is Nevada and it could be several days until the final results are in. And the race in Georgia was so close that the candidates will face a runoff next month. The outcome between the incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger, Herschel Walker could determine which party controls the Senate. CNN's Eva McKend joins us live now from Atlanta. Eva, good to have you with us, Georgia going into a runoff for the Senate. What exactly does that entail?",

She is not a journalist who's worked with them.

The vast majority of those candidates lost. The American people are tired of talking about the past. They want to focus on the future and their own lives.

An Australian man already sentenced to life in prison for sexually abusing children has been given an additional 129 years in prison by a Filipino court. He raped and trafficked children as young as 18 months old. This case has thrown a spotlight on sexual exploitation of children in the Philippines.
