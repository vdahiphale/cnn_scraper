But this is a unique conference. You have so many world leaders concentrated in one place. So, when this news broke and when it was reported by official Russian sources, it just rocketed through the crowd. And it's really all anyone has been talking about since that broke just a few hours ago.Now, Vice President Harris was essentially first out of the gate. She was kicking off this conference. Everyone looking to the U.S., you know, at a time of major stories around the world and for, essentially, Harris to reiterate the U.S.'s place on the global stage. But she took that opportunity at the very beginning of her speech to make those comments about Navalny's death. Still calling them reports, not that that's skepticism, but certainly the U.S. wants to make their own assessment, which we have not yet heard. But making clear, John, as well, that no matter what the circumstances of his death, that it is Vladimir Putin who is personally responsible. We have also heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who I've been traveling with for the past few days. He's been meeting with world leaders throughout the course of the day. And when asked about Navalny's death, he did say that it underscores the weakness and the rot in the heart of the Russian system. Here's what he had to say earlier today in Munich. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  His death in a Russian prison and the fixation and fear of one man only underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built. Russia is responsible for this. We'll be talking to many other countries concerned about Alexei Navalny, especially if these reports bear out to be true. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But in Russia, it is almost impossible to protest. I mean, you will be arrested immediately. And people have been arrested for, you know, standing there with a blank sheet of paper or liking something on social media.So, I think that if anybody does that, they know what will happen. That does not mean that they won't do other forms of protest. Some of the video I've seen is people coming to memorials for the victims of repression over the years in Russia, Stalinist repression. That's a way to do it. But I do think that we are looking at, in Russia, and unfortunately, you know, the Russians are looking at a lot more repression.",

The ATF working through the bullets, the bullet fragments, as well as the shell casings to figure out which firearms that were recovered at the scene injured which patients, and further, if there are any other pieces of ballistic evidence that would suggest that one of the firearms, they did not recover here is still outstanding.So, if they can't match all of the ballistic evidence to the firearms they have recovered, that would lead a new investigative thread where they have to go out and figure out if there is another person responsible for the shooting out there. So, those are all the things that Kansas City Police and federal law enforcement are working through at this point. We know, fortunately, that several of the victims of this case, there were at least 29 people who were injured. Many of them have been discharged from the hospital. Sadly, John, half of the shooting victims were children. Here is one of their stories. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
