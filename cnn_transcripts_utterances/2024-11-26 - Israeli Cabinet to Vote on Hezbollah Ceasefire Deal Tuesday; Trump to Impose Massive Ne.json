The Israel Defense Forces also says Hezbollah fired about 20 projectiles from Lebanon Monday and warned rocket fire into Israel could ramp up ahead of Tuesday's vote. The spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not give details of the potential agreement but said it was expected to pass when the cabinet meets for the vote. But not everyone is on board. Israel's far-right National Security minister says the deal would be a historic mistake.

      "sentences": "Yes, it really does seem as if that ceasefire deal is going to happen, getting much closer, according to a Lebanese official with knowledge of the process saying that it should happen within 24 hours, which would be late on Tuesday. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, holding a cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon to decide that same thing.Look, there are pressures on him. We have to be clear about that. There are things that Israel wants that it may not be able to achieve. We don't know the language so there are some concerns going into this final phase. Israel wants to be able to have the right to respond to Hezbollah if Hezbollah breaks the terms of the ceasefire, the right to respond immediately. And it's not clear what sort of language is going to be put around that. But the prime minister today heard from Itamar Ben-Gvir, the National Security minister, and he was very, very clear. He said publicly that he told the prime minister this is not the time to quit in the fight with Hezbollah. This is the time, while they're weak, to continue to crush them. He said his words were for the prime minister were continue, continue, continue. Now the prime minister will have Tuesday morning to meet with the leaders and the parties that make up his coalition, so he will have time to try to convince Ben-Gvir of why he should vote in favor of the ceasefire. So the prime minister has got time but his office does seem to indicate that they feel confident that this is going to pass. What will happen? Well, there'll be a 60-day ceasefire is what we expect. Hezbollah will pull back 30 miles, 45 kilometers north of the border. Israeli troops will begin to pull back and pull back entirely into Israel. And then in principle, the U.N. and the Lebanese army sort of fill that military vacuum along the border to make sure that Hezbollah don't come back south and get on the border with Israel. That's the principle of it. But in the meantime, both sides have been really increasing and ramping up their strikes, missiles from Hezbollah, bombing raids by the IDF at Hezbollah targets inside of Lebanon. So until that ceasefire is signed it seems that the intense military operation, that's going to continue, it seems, until the last moment. Nic Robertson, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There is an immediate ceasefire, as Nic Robertson, your correspondent, accurately mentioned. It's supposed to be 60 days or at least designated 60 days, after which begins phase two, which includes Hezbollah retreating from Southern Lebanon, north of the Litani River, which is not that big of a river, but nonetheless it's a natural barrier.Then there's the third phase, which is Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, and then the Israeli government are expected to negotiate the demarcation national border. But that all leads to the problematic clause which you just commented on. And that is that Israel maintains the right to operate militarily if it, Israel, deems that Hezbollah violated or transgressed the agreement, and that is supposed to be supported by a letter, an addendum to the agreement, a letter signed by the president of the United States. Now, the question is who's going to enforce all of this? And that's why the durability issue is so critical.",

And on the 8th of October, 2023, a day after the Hamas terror attack in Gaza, both Hezbollah and Iran said we had nothing to do with this. We did not coordinate this. We had no prior knowledge of it. But then Hezbollah got Iran involuntarily involved in the war by escalating its own skirmishes with Israel.And Israel then responded massively against Hezbollah and there were two exchanges of missiles between Israel and Iran directly. So from an Iranian point of view Hezbollah may have turned from an asset to a liability by dragging them into an unwanted and unsolicited conflict. That's the reason one. Reason two is that if you look at the makeup of the Iranian leadership, you know, the new president, the new foreign minister, the new national security adviser, they seem to be intent on engaging the U.S. in a -- I'm not saying that's going to happen, but they seem to be intent on engaging the U.S. in a new nuclear deal.

      "sentences": "Yes, Anna, you just heard their spokesman and their embassy in D.C. saying that there is no winner in any trade or tariff war. But he also said that China has been working with the U.S. on a fentanyl issue and that any suggestion that China has been deliberately allowing fentanyl to freely, freely flow into the U.S. is simply not true.And I think Beijing officials here could also probably use some clarification from Trump and his team about this so-called additional 10 percent. Remember during the campaign, Trump had repeatedly threatened to impose 60 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports. So is this 10 percent on top of that? Or is this just the first phase leading to a bigger tariff rate later? But historically, the Chinese tend to react to the actual situation instead of preemptively. But that's something of course they've been preparing for months to deal with. And interestingly the sentiment I've been hearing here in Beijing tend to be sometimes contradictory. Those in charge of diplomacy, putting on a more brave face saying China is capable and willing to fight back while those with an economic portfolio tend to be a bit more cautious and even worried because of the sluggish Chinese economy at home. That's of course something that would impact how they respond as well according to many experts we talked to. They say the Chinese response is likely to be more targeted and asymmetrical, meaning they are going to target certain U.S. companies and industries that they already intend to squeeze out of the Chinese market anyway, and also something the Chinese have been doing in the past few years of course is trying to diversify its export markets and trying to reduce its reliance on the U.S. and its allies. But on the fentanyl front, though, it's very interesting because recently we got rare access to China's National Counter Narcotics lab, where officials there have told us that the recently resumed bilateral dialogues and exchanges on this issue actually have led to some progress with their regular communication. It's actually helping both sides identify and trace new chemicals used to make fentanyl and with the tips provided by the U.S. leading to law enforcement actions in China. So the irony here is if Trump's new tariffs actually lead to another free fall in this overall relationship, that could actually negatively impact this very issue Trump is now linking to his new threat in terms of tariffs on China -- Anna.",

And you've seen this outrage culminate in a crescendo of the images that we are seeing right now. So, and really when it boils down to it, there are three main demands that protesters who are on the streets.Have the first one, the central one in the introduction of this story, they are calling for the release of the former prime minister, Imran Khan, from prison. He's been behind bars since August of 2023 on charges which his supporters say are bogus, and his supporters, Anna, are also demanding the release of people whom they deem political prisoners. So that's point one. Point two, they are demanding the repeal of an amendment to Pakistan's constitution. Amendment 26, which makes it easier, essentially for the government to appoint superior court justices and handpick those judges and justices in cases that deal with politics. And then the third matter they also are calling elections this past February a, quote, \"stolen mandate.\" They have all of these seats in the parliament that they are saying to those in power, hey, we won these seats fair and square. They are saying that the elections held this past February were not free and fair. So they are asking for a return of the, quote, \"stolen mandate.\" So the government is rejecting all of these demands. They are trying from their point of view to maintain law and order and look at what we have been seeing since essentially Sunday. I think some of the most striking images, Anna, are big containers that you would see on ships at ports, on the backs of giant trucks blocking many of the main arteries in and out of Islamabad. Cell phone service, mobile phone service also cut. internet service cut to many swaths of the city gatherings of more than five people have also been banned for at least two months,. So we have at least one police officer whom our reporting has been able to confirm dead so far. A local hospital told our CNN team on the ground a few hours ago they received five bodies, but we're being careful with that. Four of those bodies from law enforcement, one civilian. The circumstances around their deaths remains unclear right now. But, Anna, you know, as the sun begins to come up over Pakistan and another day of protests is right, you know, imminently approaching us, we're waiting to see if these clashes escalate what will be the response of the government?
