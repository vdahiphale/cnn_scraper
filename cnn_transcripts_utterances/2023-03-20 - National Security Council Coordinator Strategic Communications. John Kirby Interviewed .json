They don't like playing by the rules that the world order has in place, and they want to challenge U.S. leadership. This is a marriage of convenience, not of affection. These are two countries that don't have a heck of a whole lot of trust between one another, but they find common cause in pushing back on the west and pushing back on American leadership. So again, we'll see what they decide to do when they come out with this.And as for Mr. Putin's visit to Mariupol, Mariupol is far away from the front lines of the fighting in the south and in the east. It was a convenient excuse for him to go in advance of Xi's visit to show that he's still the commander in chief, that he's still in charge, and that his military still has occupied territory inside Ukraine. There's no doubt that he could see for himself, or we would hope that he would see for himself how badly his military is actually doing where the fighting is actually occurring, and most of that is right up now in the Donbas, near a town called Bakhmut.",

His name is Rob Costello, he represents a lot of Trump allies, Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon. He's going to go in there and speak to Cohen's credibility. And that's significant in this investigation, because, of course, Cohen is a star witness here. It is possible that Cohen could be called to rebut his testimony. We know he will also be there at the courthouse today. So he could potentially be called as a rebuttal witness. But we'll see if the grand jury wants to hear from him as well. Now, Costello told me a few moments ago he's handed over hundreds of documents to the Manhattan district attorney's office, hundreds of e- mails about his former representation of Cohen, and some contemporaneous memos he made of key events during the time he was representing Cohen, and Cohen, of course, waived attorney-client privilege, which Costello says is really unusual.",

I don't know that the American people are as deeply concerned about what he did with/for/to Stormy Daniels, and around that, then some of the other charges like the one down in Georgia, and what he really wants to do is color this as a series of political prosecutions. I will say this, if I were his lawyers, and I were defending against the investigation about the insurrection, I would not be thrilled about the e-mail that he sent out or the post that he made over the weekend suggesting that people get out in the streets and take the country back because that is part of the pattern that they are investigating in the other case.   And my guess is, they're saying, well, this is -- this only supports what we believe happened back on January 6th. So I don't think he helped himself there. But what he did do was send a dog whistle to Republican politicians, and some of them reacted in Pavlovian fashion, including the Speaker of the House, and this is what Trump ultimately wants.

There are ties to every kind of economy in every kind of industry, so it's a really big deal to be bought by UBS.Essentially, it's a rescue purchase of this company with all kinds of backing from the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss government to make sure it goes through. It had its own problems, right? A lot of problems getting up to this point, but it is the current period of fragility and a lack of confidence in the banking system that kind of tipped it over the edge.",

Credit Suisse has been a mess for years, but regulators basically forced UBS or strongly persuaded them to do this. I mean, this would be like Roger Goodell, trying to get the New England Patriots to buy my beloved New York Jets because they just keep losing and it's bad for the league. Right? And the Patriots say, sure. The Patriots say sure, but you guys have to sweeten the deal because we don't want to lose money on it. That's kind of where we are.",

I talked to an economist today who used to run TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the bank bailout from, you know, ten, twelve years ago, she said, this is going to take weeks or maybe even months to sort out.

It's a vote of confidence, but also showing that Central Banks, all of those Central Banks are going to be available to make sure that the plumbing is working in the banking system. You know, we've seen that that facility that the Fed opened, a lot of money has been borrowed, and we won't know who those banks are for some time, for obvious reasons, right?

It's really about what this does to the economy.Because more fear in the system means more expensive loans, right, harder to get a mortgage, harder to get a car loan, more expensive small businesses, and all of that can slow down the economy and the worry is that you know, this banking crisis could be the spark for the next recession.
