Now, Republicans claimed that this inquiry gives them more power to collect testimony from witnesses like Hunter Biden who today traveled to Washington.

So, Ryan, Trump's campaign is saying this decision by the judge, Tanya Chutkan, is a big win for President Trump and our rule of law, that's the quote from them.

Is it a possibility that this whole thing doesn't happen until after the election? RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Yes and yes. So it is a win. It does pause the trial. It might mean the March 4th date does not get met, and it might in fact mean that the March 4th date doesn't met get met because the Supreme Court takes forever to start decide the issue when it goes to the Supreme Court and then time has run out November 2020 for his past. That said, it's not a complete victory because it actually then incentivizes the court of appeals and Supreme Court to decide quickly. Is he or is he not immune from trial? And then let's go. And that just happened within hours of her opinion just a few minutes ago. The court of appeals said we're going fast. We're going to decide this basically before the second week in January.
