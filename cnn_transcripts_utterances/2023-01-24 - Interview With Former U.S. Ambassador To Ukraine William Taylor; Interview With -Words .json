Here is what's coming up.President Zelenskyy purges his own officials in a major crackdown on corruption, just as his country looks set to score some German made tanks from Poland. I discuss all the latest with the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. And, a chilling report from China on the quite rounding up of citizens who protested the state zero-COVID policy. Then, from John Grisham to Hillary Mantel, we meet the book publisher behind some of the world's best writers, Stephen Rubin. Plus.

Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, may be the world's most famous wartime leader. But his ability to mobilize his country in the fight of its life was not what got him elected. His pledge to fight corruption did. Well, Zelenskyy is walking that walk now, today purging his own government in a growing scandal linked to the unlawful procurement of wartime supplies. Historical corruption, of course, is a primary reason that Ukraine had not been admitted to the E.U. The major government shakeup in Kyiv is also happening as the U.S. now says it is finalizing plans to send U.S. made Abrams tanks to Ukraine, that is according to three U.S. officials. Joining me now from Washington is the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. So, Ambassador Taylor, it's quite an exciting day, if you want to talk about movement and news. First and foremost, what do you make of all this drip, drip, drip on the tanks? Will they or won't they? And now, it appears even, you know, a senior state department official, Wendy Sherman, is saying that you will see relatively soon this tank issue being resolved. WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR UKRAINE:  Christiane, this has been, as you say, this has been a long-time discussion and there have been concerns in various parts, of both the United States government as well as European governments, but there is a strong pressure, a strong need, a strong sense that providing these tanks is really important for the Ukrainians to be able to take the offensive to push the Russians out of their country. They need the tanks to supplement and compliment the long- range artillery and the heavy artillery that the western allies, NATO allies, the United States and others, have been providing. The artillery is there. They've got the infantry. They've got the infantry fighting vehicles. These so-called Bradleys that we've been hearing about. Now, they need the tanks. And this discussion has been going back and forth between the Germans and the Pols and the Americans. And I am so glad to hear that the -- that finally the United States is going to lead again with providing these heavy tanks to Ukraine.",

But itlooks to me, and you're the diplomat, that there's a bit of, sort of, chicken and egg going on between Europeans led by Germany -- or other Germany, and the United States. Who goes first? Is that what all of this boils down to? Because even U.S. officials have pointed out Germany's, obviously, historic association with tanks rumbling around Europe.",

Obviously, things are moving in that direction on the tanks. And we also spoke to a very senior Polish official advising the president on these issues. And as you know, the Pols are very, very gung-ho, along with Finland, along with the Baltic States, and they absolutely want to send all of this heavy armor to Ukraine because they believe, like you do, that a victory can happen if Ukraine is properly armed up. America doesn't seem to believe that. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, has said that it's not in the cards for this year.",

We've seen a whole load of resignations and sackings from the presidential cabinet at deputy levels and others. So, you know these people. You know President Zelenskyy. I don't whether you know Defense Minister Reznikov, but how is this going to affect all that we are talking about now? The prosecution of this war and the defense of this country?",

Let me just ask you, because you also know the history as I mentioned inthe introduction, that one of the things plaguing Ukraine's entrance to the E.U. and other institutions has been historical corruption. And just in 2021, that's like not even two years ago, a report by Transparency International claims that Ukraine is, \"The second most corrupt country in Europe after Russia\". And we can see with our own eyes the corruption in Russia has translated itself on the battlefield, they don't even have everything that everybody thought they did to prosecute this war. But can Kyiv get on top of it, as you say they're doing that right now, but really on top of it as it's trying to, you know, wage war at the same time, or defense?",

They know that inorder to win this war and really to win the peace afterwards, they need to have a country that is -- that trusts the government and that trust the institutions to fight corruption. I mentioned the journalists who were doing an extraordinarily good job of uncovering corruption. That is not true in Russia. So, the perception, which is what Transparency International measures, perception of corruption, yes, is high in Ukraine because the journalists are doing their job. Most of their corruption in Russia is never turned up because there is no journalism there. But you're -- but the question you ask is the right one. The Ukrainians want to win this war. Ukrainians want to join the European Union. Both of those things require that they be on top of this corruption question and defeat it, not just fight it, but defeat corruption.",

But I wanted to ask you also in terms of, you know, prosecuting this war, there has been some conversation about the Americans sending officials, including Wendy Sherman recently, to President Zelenskyy to talk about a potential strategic shift. To stop acting as if, you know, Bakhmut is the be all and end all of this war. And to think about maybe repositioning armor and infantry and basic, you know, warfighting capacity to liberating parts of the south, which is very important for them as well.

And so, I would be surprised if Wendy Sherman, or any Americans, we're giving that kind of advice. That said, Christiane, I do believe that the International Community is supportive of Ukraine's intent to strike the Russians before they can strike. That is the Ukrainians, I'm sure, are preparing to preempt this Russian offensive that we heard a lot about. And I imagine that Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman was there to demonstrate and provide evidence for strong of the United States for all of what Ukraine is doing, but in particular for those kinds of efforts.",

Surprisingly, she -- Jackie, could also be very insecure. We once were scheduled to have a conference call with the formidable Maya Angelou, and as we prepared for it, Jackie suddenly demanded that I ask all the tough questions. Why? I responded. She scares me. Jackie said forthrightly. Maybe you scare her, I said. No way, Jackie said in her signature whispery, campy, unmistakable voice. Why was Jackie Onassis scared of Maya Angelou?",

And I was worried about our internal divisions that were getting in the way of our ability to enact necessary legislation. I worried about civil disorder on a significant scale in the United States.

If everyone just focuses on rights, we obviously come into conflict. Absolutes don't lend themselves to compromise. So, I try to think about, well, what's missing here? And here we are, 240 years into this experiment and what I thought was getting lost for our obligations, first of all, Walter, to one another. One citizen to another. And then secondly to the country. Almost in the spirit of JFK, about asking not what our country can do for us, but what we could do for our country.

Here we are, we're awash in information. The problem is, we're also awash in misinformation and conspiracy theories. And in many cases, people don't seem to have the skill sets or the ability to discern between, say, facts, opinions, recommendations, predictions. So, one of the things we've got to do is focus much more on how to build this kind of literacy in America so people can discern what is a fact and what isn't. And One of the things I recommend is that people in -- to get informed is they don't single source their information. They multi-source it. So, maybe you listen to several networks, or read several -- more than one newspaper, and do not rely on social media. The key word there is social. Social media is not necessarily a place where you get informed. It's more of a place where you get reinforcement, but that can't be good if the reinforcement is not based upon facts.",

And I think you've got to be able to discern between what our basics and what are things that you can and should be prepared to compromise. I think it's gotten more difficult simply, again, because of media. The glare. People focus on not what you get, but often on what you have to -- had to have to give up. I think our politics tend to award the extremes, the endzones, if you will, who again are opposed to compromise. One of the things, I think, to fix that though is to get more people involved. We just had a historic midterm election in this country. Less than half the eligible voters voted. The people who tend to vote in things like midterm elections, despite the stakes, tend to be often people who are more concerned about political extremes. If we could simply increase by a few million votes, the Americans getting involved, and people were basically going to say, hey, I want to send someone to Washington who is prepared to compromise, to get things done. I've learned one thing in my life in Washington, Walter, is that politicians, at the end of the day, they may not always be responsible, but they are always responsive. And we have to set up a penalty and reward system for politicians where they are encouraged to do the right thing. The best way to do that is to go out and vote.",

To use an old phrase, what we need is in some ways is a silent majority to get involved, almost a radical center. To go there and say, I want people to go to Washington to get things done. We have so many pressing problems. And I'm not into -- I'm not arguing it from a partisan point of view, but we obviously have a problem at the border. We obviously have a problem with inflation. We obviously have a problem with our schools, our health care, inequality. It's a long list. But these challenges are not being met.

If you were measuring democracy, clearly the last decade or two decades there has been, to use the phrase, backsliding.Democracies have lost altitude, there's slightly fewer of them, and those that exist are less robust, less democratic than they were. I think it is because some of the economic problems that we are seeing in the world, and we've seen a certain stagnation of incomes. And when people are angry or unhappy, they often turn on the system that is in power at the time. It's a bit of a throw the bums out sort of thing. Also, democracy is hard. Democracy is just hard to make it work, to deliver. And people often get seduced, I think, by more authoritarian promises. The only good news is we're seeing the authoritarians struggle -- the authoritarian system struggle even more. Look at China, look at Russia, look at Iran, and so forth, they don't hold out any real hope. So, what I'm hoping is that people see the flaws in the alternatives. And while recognizing the flaws in democracy, don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. I'd say probably one other, Walter, I don't think we've done a very good job educating people about the historical value of democracy. Democracies delivered pretty well in our country. If we look at, you know, how we've gotten wealthier most of us, how we've gotten healthier as well, how we've had the rule of law. It's a pretty good record. Not a perfect record, but a pretty good record. We have been able to change. More Americans have the right to vote. There is much less discrimination in our society.
