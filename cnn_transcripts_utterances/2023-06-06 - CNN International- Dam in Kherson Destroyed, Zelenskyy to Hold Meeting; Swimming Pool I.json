A Ukrainian official earlier today said there was basically a five-hour window for the water levels in the river would rise too high and cause flooding further down stream, of course, in the Kherson Region.We're now hearing from the ministry of internal affairs of Ukraine that more than 700 people have been evacuated. That's really a small amount considering how many people are thought to be in the danger zone. Another Ukrainian official saying 16,000 people on the west bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson Region are in what he calls a critical zone. The important thing to understand about this is that Kherson is partially occupied by Russia. So the Ukrainians can't actually access the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to try to evacuate people there. And in terms of what we're hearing from the Russian side, they seem to be slightly playing it down a little bit and officials -- a Russian official in Kherson saying earlier that there was no threat to life. But the situation on the east bank of the Dnipro was under control. But I think it is fair to say that the flooding has already started, according to Ukrainian officials and there is a real threat from this volume of water coming down stream. Not to mention, of course, that the reservoir provided water to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is upstream of the hydroelectric dam. We are hearing from the International Atomic Energy Agency that right now there is no eminent threat to nuclear safety, but Ukrainian officials are also warning about that.",

Of course, is much harder to drive tanks or armored vehicles across flooded land. So, that is one thing.And this is something that Ukrainian officials are really hinting at. Mykhailo Podolyak an adviser to the Zelenskyy regime explicitly saying that the Russians are deliberately hitting the residents of the occupied Crimea. A reference to the fact that Crimea gets its water supply via the north Crimean canal from that hydroelectric power plant. He said they exchange them for certain opportunities to deter the offensive. Essentially saying that Russia is prioritizing efforts to deter Ukraine's counteroffensive over the well-being of the people of Crimea. So, that's the hint were getting from the Ukrainian side. Of course, the Russians having initially, by the way, call the whole idea of dam being damaged nonsense and are now calling it a terrorist attack by Ukraine.",

They all met at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. along with a career official from the Justice Department who also sat down with Trump's lawyers.This is the sort of meeting that appears to be coming at the final stage or in a final stage of this criminal investigation around the former president and around what happened at his estate in Mar-a-Lago and potentially other places throughout his business empire. We don't know exactly what happened at the meeting at this time, but it is quite significant that people in the Justice Department would agree to meet with Trump's lawyers whenever they had requested this. And so, there are potentially some additional people who could be brought into a grand jury investigation. We do believe one witness is going to be speaking to a grand jury in south Florida this week. There may still be things happening in this investigation, but this is quite a significant moment for the Justice Department and for Donald Trump's legal team as they prepare for the possibility of a federal indictment against the former president. And then also, we at CNN were able to understand a little bit more about the obstruction of justice part of this criminal investigation. That's because we have learned and we're able to confirm a flood that happened at Mar-a-Lago, at the resort in October of last year. That flood flooded a room because there was the draining of the pool at Mar-a-Lago and the water from the pool went into a room that stored IT equipment including some of the videotapes and the surveillance system of the property. The obstruction of justice investigation has looked at a lot of things the past year, but one of the things that they had pursued -- that the prosecutors had pursued was what was happening and how was the Trump Organization or Donald Trump himself responding to multiple requests for surveillance tapes. And we do also know that the maintenance worker that decided to drain the pool at Mar-a-Lago and then caused this flood in the room, that person was captured on surveillance tape moving boxes. And so, it is a moment that prosecutors have been asking about as they ask about many different things that have happened surrounding the surveillance footage and also the moving of boxes at Mar-a-Largo in this ongoing criminal investigation.

And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he is willing to push this to a full floor vote. This comes after on Monday senior FBI officials came to a secure room at the U.S. Capitol and showed Comer, as well as the top Democrat and House oversight Jamie Raskin, an internal FBI document that Republicans say shows these unverified allegations that Joe Biden while he was vice president was involved in some kind of bribery scheme involving a foreign national. Now here's what the top Democrat and Republican had to say when they came out of that briefing.REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): At the briefing, the FBI again refused to hand over the unclassified record to the custody of the House Oversight Committee. And we will now initiate contempt of Congress hearings. REP. JAMES RASKIN (D-MD): I'm just surprised that my colleagues want to try to litigate this in public much less hold the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in contempt for complying with their request when there was a whole process. MURRAY: Now Comer had subpoenaed the FBI for this document. It's clear he still wants a hard copy. The FBI says they've been very accommodating in allowing the lawmakers to view this. Saying it contains uncorroborated information and that it's unwarranted for this committee to move forward with contempt proceedings. The White House has said this is all a political stunt that's designed to hurt Joe Biden. One thing was clear after this briefing though, Comer and Raskin came out with very differing views on whether the allegations in this document could still be part of an ongoing investigation. Comer says he believes some of these allegations could still be part of an ongoing Hunter Biden criminal investigation that's based out of Delaware. Jamie Raskin said when the allegations first came to the FBI, they were checked out while Bill Barr was Attorney General and the FBI could not corroborate them and essentially that was that.

And already the railroad has been reopened and we can see what looks like a brand-new modern train moving down the tracks here. That is even as scores of people are still looking for their missing loved ones from the accident that took place on Friday night. Now the initial accident authority say was caused by a switching malfunction. So, a passenger train was moved on to a track where there was a parked freight train loaded with iron ore. And that crash sent some of the train cars into the other track where there was an approaching passenger train coming from the other side. So, that mistake led to absolutely catastrophic results. As you can see, the railroad here has been reopened. We have another train moving through right now. And the railroad system in India, it dates back in origins to when this country was a British colony. And it is essential to this country, more than 13 million people a day move around on trains in India. So, that's part of why the authorities have worked so hard to reopen the rails after the train crash. I'm going to show you over here.
