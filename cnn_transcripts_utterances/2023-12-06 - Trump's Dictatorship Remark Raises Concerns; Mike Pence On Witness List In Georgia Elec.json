Like many allies of Donald Trump, there is a concern overall that some of Trump's ramped-up rhetoric is not going to play well outside of his loyal base, say, if he were to be the nominee and there was a general election. So, this was a close ally giving him not one, but multiple opportunities to categorically deny that he would be a dictator, that he would abuse power.And instead, what you got was this non-answer. It was non-substantive and it was really this tongue-in-cheek, you know, I'm going to be a dictator in order to drill and do this. But what else this does is it gives another opening to Biden and his allies. Because what they have been trying to do is that if this is a rematch between Trump and Biden, they want to paint this as a rematch or a choice for voters between authoritarianism and democracy. So, this is just another opening there. Now, of course, as we know, the former president has tried to turn this argument around to say it's actually Biden who is against democracy and anti-democratic because of all of the legal battles that Trump is facing. Those are just Biden trying to send in his Department of Justice to turn the tables, to go after a political opponent being Donald Trump. But again, that's not really an argument that seems to be resonating outside of his closest group of supporters. So this would have been an opportunity for him to just say, hey, that's not happening.

      "sentences": "So just about an hour from now, the Colorado Supreme Court is set to begin hearing oral arguments in a closely watched case that aims to keep former President Trump off the ballot in that state. It centres on the U.S. Constitution's ban on insurrectionists holding office. A Colorado district judge found that Trump engaged in an insurrection on January 6th, 2021. But they argue that the ban does not specifically apply to those running for the presidency.  The case was brought by Republican and independent voters in coordination the liberal-leaning watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. Representative of that group joins us now. Noah Bookbinder is the group's CEO. He's live for us in Denver.Noah, thanks so much for being with us. So, I want to bring up the specific section of the Constitution where this comes up to sort of illuminate for our viewers where the disagreement is. It's Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Essentially, it says that if you've engaged in insurrection, you're prohibited from becoming a member of Congress, other positions, even an elector of the president but it doesn't specifically say you can't run for president. What is your counter argument to the judge's decision in Colorado that sort of highlights that argument? NOAH BOOKBINDER, PRES. CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBILITY: Well, quite simply, as our team is going to be arguing, as you said, in about an hour in front of the court, the provision clearly says that you can't be an officer of the United States. And we think that the law is quite clear, the Constitution is quite clear in many different places that the presidency is an office of the United States, and that makes the president an officer of the United States. And it seems really pretty incredible to think that the president of the United States would not be considered an officer or that this provision that was meant to protect the republic from those who had attacked it, those who had engaged in insurrection, would cover every position in the federal government, a whole lot of positions in state government, except for the most powerful one. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. And we think it's not supported by the language of the Constitution or the history, the documentation of what people, how people viewed this at the time.",

And after all that, made this really incredible judgment that as a matter of law, Donald Trump had engaged in insurrection. And so, in many ways, the hard part of the case already came in favor of our clients. We think on this, this is a narrow legal question.We have heard in recent weeks experts across the political and ideological spectrum who agree with our take on that. That ranges from a legendary conservative judge, J. Michael Ludig, Professor Lawrence Tribe, Federalist Society professors, Michael Stokes Paulson and William Bout. So a lot of really major voices saying, we've looked at this, we've studied this in some cases for years, and we think it's clear that the president is covered by this provision. And so, we think that there's, you know, obviously, this is ultimately going to be up to the Colorado Supreme Court. They're going to hear argument today. But we think there's a real possibility that they accept this judgment that the district court made on evidence about Donald Trump's engagement in insurrection, but that they end up feeling like on this narrow legal question of where they're considering it anew of whether the president is an officer, that that decision was not correct.",

If this does make it to the U.S. Supreme Court, I will simply say that the U.S. Supreme Court has, has been very fair on issues of checks and balances and potential abuses of power by the former president. That we think there is a strong originalist argument for the 14th Amendment applying in this case. That is a type of argument that the Supreme Court tends to be interested in.
