The interview is standard as part of the pre-sentencing protocol. And it will be virtual.CNN's Brynn Gingras is joining us right now.

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. Well, let's underscore here. This is part of the routine after the defendant has either pleaded guilty or someone is found guilty like we are having here in the case of the former president. What's different here, though, is that it's happening virtually. Usually, the probation officer will meet face to face with that former defendant and go over a whole list of questions as it prepares a report for a judge.Some of those questions include what is your background? What's your family background, your criminal history? Do you use drugs? Do you abuse alcohol? Your employment background? These are some of the standard questions that they basically would try to get answers from. What's also different here in the case of the former president is that his attorney will be president. Now, the judge in this case, Judge Juan Merchan has allowed that. So, that is why the former president, he is in Mar-a-Lago. He's going to be having this interview via, you know, not Zoom, but virtually to answer all these questions with a probation officer. And then, of course, a report will then be compiled. And this report will be given to the judge to take a look at it before he actually sentences Donald Trump. It's just one aspect of the sentencing package that that judge will receive. Now, we did reach out to the former president's camp. And they said that you know, he and his legal team are already taking necessary steps to challenge and defeat, as they say, the lawless Manhattan DA case. Of course, we know an appeal is on the horizon. But we also know that the sentencing date, Wolf, is on July 11. Wolf?",

But again, that in undecided segment, that sits in the swing states, right? We know they're the ever-important demographic. But these are the folks that it's just not worked with so far.And so, what he continues to do is defy logic. And I think his campaign team is probably going to grow pretty tired of him using again, a certain line of reasoning. It's not reasoning, we know that. It's not logical. But at the rallies is where he feels emboldened to take it a step further. It's just not going to work. We're almost in July. We're almost at the convention.

But for him to say to his rally -- it's one of the few times when he's told the truth, he has said to them, I don't care about you. I just want your vote. I don't care about you. That to me, is indicative of everything that voters should know about in terms of Donald Trump. A president should be focused on what he can do for the American people. That is what Joe Biden has been focused on for the last four years. That is what he will be focused on for the next four when he gets reelected. It's the case that he's making to the American people. And frankly, Donald Trump just now helped him make that case because voters don't want to hear that it's all about you. They want to hear, what are you going to do for me? And Donald Trump has made it very clear that he is only in this to stay out of the prison, especially now that he is a convicted felon 30 times over -- 34 times over.",

All they were doing is protesting a rigged election. That's what they were doing. So, when we get in, it's going to go very rapidly, we're going to do a lot of things. We're going to look very strongly at J six, those people. There's never been people treated more horrifically than J six hostages. What a setup that was. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And therefore, you see the elected officials at the highest perch not break away from him because they also feel that they are victims in a way.And that's just something that's so unusual in this -- in this era. I've never seen anything like it in the years that I've been in doing politics, for two decades now. There's been a sense that we will talk about the kitchen table issues every four years. We will be disciplined. That message discipline is not there because these people on Capitol Hill also feel some kind of victimhood, which is just bizarre, because on January 6, 2021, we all know how they acted. They were all scared. They all push back on Donald Trump. They said that he was the problem. He could write the course. He hasn't decided to do any of that. And so, by again, saying that these J six defendants, hundreds of them that have met the law and have faced the consequences, have gone behind bars by saying that they are victims too, I don't see who is winning. And that, again, is a political problem of the moment. He's got to get on board with what his consultants want him -- want him to do. They don't want him to do this. They need him to turn around and stop trying to court the base to turn out because they're going to turn out for him no matter what in November. He needs to turn it around.",

The Gold Star families who have given the ultimate sacrifice. This is a slap in the face to them. And especially now when we do have so many things going on around the world, and our military is the best in the world, the most prepared in the world, but we have to honor them. And this is something that Joe Biden does better than anyone. He was over in Europe talking about D- Day focusing on the massive service and what families gave up in order to keep us safe and in order to keep our democracy, something that is thriving. That is going to be a huge contrast going in to this coming election. Because the more that Donald Trump focuses on denying that he insulted Gold Star families and our military members, the more that Joe Biden is going to be able to make that contrast between somebody who is a massive threat to our democracy.",

That he knew he was struggling with drug addiction.He knew he was struggling with crack addiction. And he went and bought a gun in October of 2018. And they believe that based on all of the evidence, all the text messages, the photographs that show him with drug paraphernalia that around this time in October of 2018, that there was plenty of evidence to show that he was using drugs. Now. the defense believes that based on what you've seen so far, that the -- you can put -- you can place Hunter Biden using drugs in September of 2018 and in November of 2018. And so that's the point they're going to drive home with the jury to try to sow some doubt that at the time that he filled out the form to buy this gun that he knew he was addicted to drugs. Wolf?",
