So did she make the right choice? Then the presser pivot -- Donald Trump faces reporters as he hones his attacks on Harris. But was it enough to regain momentum or was it meandering? And the medal moments, the panel votes on the Gold Medal winning highlights from the Paris Olympics. Everyone is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first with the V.P. pick behind her, Vice President Kamala Harris is barnstorming the country with her newly minted partner as the Trump campaign lays on the attacks and questions swirl about what Harris needs to do next.

He served for years past when he could have retired. And his decision to serve that additional four years shows his commitment to serving his country. And so the notion that this is somehow stolen valor for doesn't really, I think, land, right? I grew up on a military basis. My parents served in the military.

But the reason we want interviews, as members of the media, is not because were greedy. It's because we represent people. We are there to inform the public. And there are a lot of questions that actually she needs to answer. If I'm a strategist, I would say no, of course not. She shouldn't be giving interviews, because at this point she has a lot of goodwill, and what's going to happen in any interview that she does, that's going to be clipped, it's going to be pushed up by the opposition, and right now, she's riding a wave. So if I was a strategist, I understand why they're not sort of running towards that. But as a journalist, I mean, we don't know her positions on, I don't know, the Supreme Court. We don't know her positions are on statehood for D.C. I mean, just because I happen to live here, I'm curious.

She's been putting out statements through aides, background quotes to the press. But she needs to put this in her own words, tell us where she stands.As Lulu said, I reached out to the campaign last week. She endorsed this idea of Supreme Court term limits. Now, that could be an idea that's a constitutional mammoth that would take three quarters of states and bipartisan buy-it.

The leader there, Nicolas Maduro, essentially stole the election. That is the general consensus from most democratic countries. And what has happened is there have been hundreds of arrests. And the reason Americans should care about this, which I just do not see them really engaging in this in the way that they should, is that Venezuela has been over the past decade the largest push of migration in the region. Over 6 million people have fled that country. A huge portion of them have come to the United States. It is a regional crisis. It deserves a lot of attention.

They're biased against us. They're not actually contacting our people. That has now begun. Now with a new batch of polls in the last week or so showing Vice President Harris either tied with or slightly ahead of Donald Trump in many of the battleground states, you've begun to see the Trump campaign put out memos trying to discredit individual polls that say, even things like alleging that the race is tied. And so now it's just fascinating to me to watch how the tables have turned. Those who said that the polls were all flawed, you can't believe them, now suddenly buy them, and Republicans are now the ones saying it's all broken.",
