      "sentences": "But I will say that the other side, Donald Trump's team, very much thinks that this could help him in a race that is razor thin margin.They are looking at the people who potentially were supporting RFK as people who would come to Donald Trump. Those were votes, they believe, that were being taken, at least some of them, from Donald Trump. Particularly, this became important as Kamala Harris went to the top of the ticket. It was a little bit more unclear when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket where those votes we're coming from. But when we saw Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, there was a sense of urgency among Trump's team that eventually RFK was going to drop out and it will be very important for Donald Trump to secure that endorsement so that he could get those supporters. And I do want to mention one other thing. Do they believe every person who is going to vote for RFK is going to vote for Donald Trump if he endorses him? No, they don't. But again, they believe that this election is going to be determined in the margins. And they believe any single vote that they can get is important for Donald Trump.",

I'm thinking that I was going to wake up, thinking this is my way to get out of this non-real reality. And I reached up and I grabbed it and I pulled the levers. What I thought is, this is going to wake me up. I know what those levers do in a real airplane, right? And I need to wake up from. It's 30 seconds of my life I wish you could change and I can't.

Because they do not have, they believe, the evidence at this point to charge him with murder, but they do believe beyond a reasonable doubt they can prove concealment of a body. His arraignment was today. He's being held on no bond. But Mamta Kafle Bhatt is 28-years-old. She has a 1-year-old daughter. And within that complaint, it does state exactly what authorities believe happened to her.And we want to show you. It says, \"There was evidence in the residence indicating the body was inside the residence and dragged out of the residence.\" They have been doing so many searches, so much forensic testing in that home. And these are their conclusions at this point. But the timeline shows us that there has been quite a bit of time where she has been missing. First of all, on July 27th, that was the last time that she reported to work at the University of Virginia Health Prince William Medical Center in Virginia. She was a part of the surgery unit. The last time they saw her there. On July 28th, that was the last time that she spoke with a friend. Then her husband says that the last time he saw was at the dinner table on July 31st. And then on August 5th, finally, is when he reported her missing. But it also says in the complaint that they believe that he murdered her on July 30th, the day before he says was the last time he saw her alive. I want you to listen to one of her very close friends who spoke out because the Nepalese community there in Virginia is supporting her, backing her, and they want to know the truth. Take a listen.

The filing\" -- the filing in Pennsylvania -- \"was made by an attorney and not reviewed by the campaign.\" A campaign adviser, Del Bigtree, then told CNN that he was not aware of the filing and said, quote, \"I'm surprised to see that.\" Again, this comes as, in a not very far away venue from where RFK Jr. is in Phoenix right now, Donald Trump is expected later tonight. And they've been touting a special guest. And over the last two days, Trump has made statements seeming to appeal to some of the more out-there rhetoric of RFK Jr., on vaccines, on conspiracy theories about September 11th. So this pushback from the campaign comes at a strange time. We are obviously monitoring his remarks. We want to go to CNN's Alayna Treene, who is at the venue where we're expecting President Trump later. Alayna, a bit of confusion here about, will he or won't he? But it seems like the writing is on the wall and we can expect what's coming later tonight.",
