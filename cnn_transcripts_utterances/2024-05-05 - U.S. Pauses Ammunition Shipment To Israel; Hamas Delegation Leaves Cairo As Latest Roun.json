      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, and we begin with breaking news.CNN has learned the Biden administration has paused a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel. It appears to be the first time the U.S. has stopped a weapons shipment to the Israeli military since the October 7th Hamas attacks. And it comes amid growing tensions between the U.S. and Israel over the war in Gaza. Tonight, we're also following the fallout from the high-stakes negotiations in Cairo over a potential hostage and ceasefire deal. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is here with us right now. And Priscilla, what more are you learning about this ammunition that has been held?",

      "sentences": "Well, I talked to a source familiar with this decision and they could not disclose any details as to how this decision was made. But here's what we do know. It is not linked to a potential Israeli ground invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza Strip were more than a million Palestinians have been displaced and are sheltering. And that has been a top concern for the White House. So this not linked to that.Second thing, it is not affecting other shipments. This is one shipment that was paused. We don't know exactly why. That's unclear. But other shipments and military security assistance continues to Israel. To that end, the National Security Council spokesperson told me the following, quote, \"The United States has surged billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel since the October 7th attacks, passed the largest ever supplemental appropriation for emergency assistance to Israel, led an unprecedented coalition to defend Israel against Iranian attacks, and will continue to do what is necessary to ensure Israel can defend itself from the threats it faces.\" So just from that statement alone, you can tell U.S. is maintaining its policy here. U.S. officials have done so. This does not signal any type of change in policy toward Israel. We should also note because it has mentioned here in the statement that supplemental appropriation, that was $26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict. That was part of the supplemental package that Congress passed and that the president signed. But the takeaway here is we're still learning or trying to learn why this shipment was paused, but U.S. officials maintaining that there is no change in policy here toward Israel.",

When he has been dispatched in the past, it's usually during the quite intensive phase of the negotiations. We know that it has been intense over the last few days.In fact, President Biden speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last weekend over this exact topic. In fact, the majority of their call was on the hostage deal. So all of this is fluid and to your point, this has been ongoing and it's unclear when the deal will be reached. If it's reached, all U.S. officials have kept this front of mind. It is a priority to them, especially when you talk to those in the White House. But they don't know when it will -- when the plane will land until it does. So all of that still very much ongoing and the CIA director staying in the region tomorrow.",

We know that 40 rockets were shipped that were fired from Hezbollah and the north at Israel. We know that Israeli soldiers were killed today and we know that Hamas has walked away once again from talks.And so Hamas continues to have Americans and others as hostages, including one of my constituents, Edan Alexander. We know that Hezbollah continues to fire rockets from Hamas, from Gaza into Israel, and we know that other Iranian proxies continue to fire rockets and attack Americans, as well as our allies. So none of those facts have changed and that's what I'm focused on. How do we make sure we get the hostages freed? How do we continue to surge humanitarian aid and actually get it delivered into the region without Hamas blocking that humanitarian aid getting to people who need it? And making sure that we do everything we can to crush Hamas. Well, of course, until Hamas surrenders.",

All students from any religion or background, and making sure that everyone is safe, that they can go to graduation, they can go to class, that they could study.

And, you know, I think we have to make sure we're very clear that we all want that -- speaking out is a key right in our country and one that I support, and so is protesting, but protesting in a safe way as the president talked about last week, and making sure that when if you're going to call out to support Hamas, which is a foreign terrorist organization, which continues to threaten Americans and has Americans hostage that you understand what you're shouting about and who you're supporting. And that's part of what concerns me. I don't think people -- that students understand that they are actually supporting, as they scream out rallying cries for Hamas, that they're actually supporting a terrorist organization that is using innocent Palestinians as human shields.

And Hamas is seeking -- continues to use these innocent Palestinians literally as human shields, and as they continue to try to do everything they can to hurt America, to weaken our position in the world.

We all remember when that leaked, and Hope described what the chaos and she called it a crisis in the aftermath of that leak. She said yes, she was concerned that that leak could in Trump's presidential bid at the time. And so that sort of set the scene for future witnesses who will then talk about how this effort to suppress Stormy Daniels' story and the concern at the time in Trump's camp about the Stormy Daniels story coming out. Now Hope Hicks also was asked about this 2018 interaction that she had with Donald Trump. It was in 2018 when these stories about the payment to Stormy Daniels first started to come out and she says that she didn't believe Michael Cohen and Trump at the time, when they said that Cohen essentially paid Stormy Daniels on his own volition and that Trump didn't have anything to do with it. She also talked about how that Trump emphasized or heard that he was glad that the story came out in 2018 when he was already in the White House and not before the 2016 election. There was a part of her testimony where she said, I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the elections, sort of speaking to Trump's potential motivation. Now, we'll see who they call next when court resumes on Monday, but Hope Hicks was setting the scene here for prosecutors to move into the alleged crimes part of this trial.",

What do you think of Trump's recent comments that are calling the Biden administration the Gestapo? RUTH BEN-GHIAT, HISTORY PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: So this is straight out of the authoritarian playbook because one of the oldest talking points to authoritarianism from Mussolini onward is that democracy is the real tyranny. And when Trump, you know, calls the Biden administration as something similar to the Nazis and talks about the Gestapo persecuting him, he's activating that talking point. It also plays into the strongman cult of victimhood, which Mussolini and others had as well. And so it makes him and all those who, for example, participated in January 6th, who are now -- he calls them political prisoners. And so Marjorie Taylor Greene often talks about the Biden regime.

It is -- when I was traveling around for the 2024 primary, you talk to people and they absolutely believe that the election was stolen even though there is no evidence of that happening, even though that absolutely did not happen. Joe Biden was rightfully elected president. That is just the fact. But what do these types of things do to a democracy?BEN-GHIAT: Well, it's absolutely devastating and actually, you know, Trump has pulled off something that I as a scholar of authoritarianism I've never seen. He has gotten tens of millions of people to believe that, you know, he won the election. It's easily verifiable that he didn't. And he did it working in a pluralistic media environment in a democracy. And one of the reasons is the GOP and everything is about loyalty performances. And that's what Miles was describing. But it has a chilling effect and so all of the people who want to be, you know, vice president, for example, they have to constantly compete against each other to be the most loyal. And in dictator world, this is called divide and rule. You pit people against each other, make them compete to be the most loyal, and right now, the talking point is, will you, you know, accept the results of the election, and they cannot answer. They cannot say they will because that will boot them out. So this kind of loyalty is actually very devastating to all of our institutions of democracy, including the idea of free and fair elections.",

He said if everything is honest, I'll gladly accept the results. I don't change on that. If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country. So again, there he is just underscoring this. He's telegraphing where he is. He gave that \"TIME\" magazine interview as well, saying that he might actually deport millions of undocumented migrants by using the military.People say, yes, don't listen to him, he's just blustering.

I mean, remember when Donald Trump said stand back and stand by to the Proud Boys, and people were up in arms, and everyone said, oh, come on, you're misreading it. Well, we later found out that the Proud Boys literally thought they might be able to stage an armed invasion into the Capitol and start a civil war.That was their language, not mine. That they were planning for a civil war. And now it seems like the theme of his campaign is stand back and stand by. He's trying to tell these potentially violent elements to be ready should he decide to oppose the results of the election if they are not in his favor. We are playing with fire here. This is worse than what we saw with the rhetoric in 2016, worse than 2020. We need to be ready for it and again, I always go back to this isn't a political issue. I'm still a conservative. This is a national security issue. The way he's handling this and the potential powder keg that's being created in our political system right now by Donald Trump and his allies.",
