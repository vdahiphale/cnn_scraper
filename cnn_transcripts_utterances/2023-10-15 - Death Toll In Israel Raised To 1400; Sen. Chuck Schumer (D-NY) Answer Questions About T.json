Several major new developments to tell you about this evening.Today, Israeli Defense Forces raising the death toll from the attacks carried out by Hamas to more than 1,400. Israeli armored vehicles are now staging near the border with Gaza in anticipation of what Israel calls significant ground operations. That invasion expected to happen at any moment. The IDF confirms Hamas still has more than 150 hostages eight days after their attack. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes continue to pound parts of northern Gaza. The IDF says it killed a Hamas commander as it shelled 250 targets today. Tens of thousands in Gaza are still scrambling to find safe passage to the south. But the Rafah border crossing into Egypt remains closed at this hour. Refugees waiting for authorities to open the gates for days now. Today, U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken promised that the border will open as the U.S. appoints a new special envoy to coordinate aid into the Gaza enclave. But let me go first back to my colleague, Erin Burnett, live on the ground in Tel Aviv. Erin, I understand you were able to catch up with a bipartisan U.S. senate delegation. that was on the ground in Tel Aviv with you. What did they encounter and what did you find out?",

Obviously, we've only shared one at this point with our viewers, but today we're shown pictures of a group of children that they say were burned alive.This sort of -- they had no words to describe what they were actually confronted with and what they saw today. But they did have those meetings today. And in addition, as you mentioned, the Secretary of State is going to be coming here to Israel again tomorrow in sort of a desperate effort for diplomacy throughout this region to try to get some of the other players involved. I had a chance after this meeting to speak to Senator Schumer, of course the majority leader in the Senate, to have a conversation with him about what happened here and what's next in that U.S. carrier strike group.

He is trying to play a bigger diplomatic role in the region.He undoubtedly will be pressuring the Egyptian president to take a more conciliatory and softer role about the possibility of opening that Rafah border crossing to allow Palestinians out of Gaza into there. Yes, it's a contentious issue. Yes, there's a lot of historical baggage for Palestinians with that. But I think there will be a lot of that in there. And I think, let's not forget the hostages. You know, behind the scenes here, efforts will be made, a lot of efforts will be made to try to get those hostages released. And we can believe that some leaders, like Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and others in the region, will be making their best efforts to help that happen. So, I think Secretary Blinken, being in the region, it signals not only to Iran, not only to Hezbollah, that the United States is here, it's behind Israel, but it tries to sort of keep that diplomatic, behind the scenes movement on all fronts, on broader stability, on the long-term goals of the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, and on the possibility of hostages. It tries to keep all those alive, but of course, as you and I both know. and Senator Schumer was hearing (ph) from people, there is a will here to settle the score and really reduce the risk from Hamas at the moment.",

Should the U.S. be contemplating this idea of sending troops into Gaza to help free Americans being held hostage there? Presumably those would be special forces type troops. But what are your thoughts?REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): We got two things about that. First of all, if we had a situation where we knew where our hostages were and we felt that there was, you know, a plausible plan for our special forces to go in and get them out, we would do it. It's just highly unlikely given how Hamas has built the system of tunnels and hiding places throughout Gaza. I forget the name of the Israeli soldier, but they held an Israeli soldier for years without Israel being able to know where he was and rescue him. So, if that situation presented itself and we felt, yes, our troops could go in and get out an American, clearly, we would do that.

And this is part of Hamas's plan. They put civilians in harm's way. They take supplies away from humanitarian aid for civilians and keep it for themselves. They want the civilians. They're blocking civilians who are trying to leave.So. Israel, the U.S., and a lot of people in the region are trying to figure out how can we, you know, deal with the threat from Hamas and protect civilians. They're trying to open up humanitarian corridors. Certainly, the one in Egypt is being talked about. They are, you know, still hopeful that they could potentially have one into Israel. But how can we do that safely and what will Hamas do to block it? Look, I mean, and I know this is an incredibly emotional issue. People are suffering horribly on both sides of this fight. But there was one thing I hope people will keep in mind. Hamas literally does not care about human rights or civilians or about protecting life. Israel at least cares. You know, they don't always do everything we would like them to do, but they are fighting a determined enemy, and an enemy that's determined to wipe Israel off the face of the map. It's a very difficult situation, but I think what's happening is people are trying to wrestle with that conflict. How do you stop Hamas while minimizing the incredible humanitarian catastrophe that's going on in Gaza right now? ACOSTA: And I guess, what are your thoughts on the second aircraft carrier being sent to the region, I suppose to deter folks like Hezbollah and Iran, I guess, presumably, from sticking their fingers in this.

In, you know, Israel's case, they're worried about weapons and supplies getting in to strengthen Hamas within Gaza.

And, you know, there are doctors in hospital saying, you know, we can't shut down these hospitals and move these kids. They're on ventilators.

Your weather would have said it was clear. It was a monsoon. I mean, it was -- our tents were blowing. It was extremely severe thunderstorms. I mentioned it because the weather forecast right now where we are is for similar storms really over the evening hours now all the way through tomorrow. Very, very heavy storms that the meteorological service says, you know, could impact aircraft as well as marine vessels. So, things like that when all of a sudden, you're talking about a ground invasion and 360,000 troops on the Gaza border matter. And by the way, the forecast is for half an inch or maybe a little bit more of rain around Gaza. A lot of that is desert. So, these sorts of things all of a sudden may start to matter. But today, Jim, it was 250 targets in Gaza. The IDF says that they struck, and they do say they took out another Hamas commander. So, they have said several of those have been taken out in the past few days. And these, of course, are in the onslaught of strikes. I mean, 250 in a day, right?",
