Yesterday, they managed to shoot down barely a quarter of the incoming fire. And the difficulty Ukrainians say is the type of missile that Russians are actually using. These are missiles that are normally meant to sink ships.And because of the speed that they travel at and trajectory and altitude, they are extremely difficult, sometimes impossible to shoot down they say. And today's strike on that grain silo is a perfect example of that as well. They say -- the Ukrainians say that it came in at such a low altitude that its air defenses didn't even detect it, sirens doesn't go off until basically that missile was actually striking its target. Ukraine says that the patriot air defense system made by the United States could detect and could shot down these types of missile, but they only have two and they are not all that mobile and they're not easily moved. So that's why President Zelenskyy says frankly his country needs a lot more of them. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",
