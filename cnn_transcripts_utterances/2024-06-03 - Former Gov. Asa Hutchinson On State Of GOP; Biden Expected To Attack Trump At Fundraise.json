We begin tonight, keeping them honest, with what looks to be the shape of things to come as the leader of the Republican Party, the self- proclaimed rule of law party faces a July sentencing date for 34 felony convictions. Increasingly, that means Republicans are attacking a criminal justice system they've long claimed to support, threatening to investigate and defund it, even threatening to defund the entire federal government, all because a jury of 12 Americans did what juries are entrusted to do, listen to evidence and reach a verdict.

Now let's remember, this was a state trial, not a federal one. And there's no evidence the federal Justice Department had any role or whatsoever in it, let alone the attorney general, let alone President Biden. Yet from the beginning, the former president has, in almost a literal sense, tried to make a federal case out of it, a notion his supporters now fully embrace. Now, Speaker Mike Johnson, for one, last week he said the Supreme Court should get involved. Now he's saying Congress should with all its got. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Listen, we are the rule of law party. Chaos is not a conservative value and we have to fight back and we will with everything in our arsenal.

ASA HUTCHINSON (R) FOMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I have a high regard for the justice system in America. It is a hallmark of our democracy and the strength of America. I don't like to see it undermined by anyone. And whenever you look at the Republican Party right now, they're in a bind. And the bind is that you've got a presumptive nominee that's going to get the nomination of the party, that's going to the fall election and he's been convicted of 34 felonies. That's a problem for the Republican Party. And their answer to it is to say they're bogus, that the charges and the convictions are not legitimate. That's a hard case to make to the American public. Even though they might see the start of that case in New York as partisan, they have confidence in what the jury determined. And that varies by party, of course. But the polls show that a slim majority of Americans have confidence in what the jury found. And so they're going to sort this through. And we've had mistakes in prosecutions before. Our system has made the corrections that are needed, either through the jury system or through the appeal system. So let it work. Let's don't undermine what is so great about America in this justice system.

He's not a paid staffer on his father's campaign. He's not involved in any way. And secondly, we know, and I can tell you, as somebody who was helping run the Biden campaign in 2020, one of the most significant moments in the debates, one of the moments that really got the most traction, was the moment when, you know, Joe Biden stood up to Donald Trump, who's trying to make Hunter Biden a line of attack and said, you know, I love my son like many people in this country who have dealt with addiction. You know, I think families across the country can understand what we've been through. And the president was very direct about being completely unflinching, about allowing, you know, Donald Trump to come at Hunter Biden in that way. So, no, I think what we've seen politically is that people admire that Joe Biden stands by his son. They relate to it. Everybody has got someone in their family, has either struggled with addiction or mental illness. I mean, this is an incredibly relatable thing for people all across the country. And I think seeing Joe Biden's humanity is a good thing for him politically, to be quite crass. So, no, I don't think that a conviction is going to have a political impact here.",

This afternoon, Republican Congressman John Rose of Tennessee was giving a five-minute speech condemning the felony conviction of the former president when his six-year-old son sitting behind him stole the spotlight.Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOHN ROSE (R), TENNESSEE: Regardless of one's opinion of the current Republican nominee, we'd be well served to remember the long and cherished tradition we have in this country of settling our political differences at the ballot box. For nearly two and a half centuries, our nation's elected leaders have properly resisted the temptation to oppose their political rivals through the weaponization of our justice system. Equal justice for all. And an overall trust in our justice system is fundamental to who we are as Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
