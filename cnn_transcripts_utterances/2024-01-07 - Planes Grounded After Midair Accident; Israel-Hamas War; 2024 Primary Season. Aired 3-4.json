I'm Laila Harrak.Planes are grounded, flights are canceled after a terrifying midair accident forced a Boeing 737 MAX to make an emergency landing. Israel says it's ready for any possible threat, even as Washington's top diplomat shuttles through the region hoping to prevent a wider war. Plus, we're just days away from the start of the 2024 primaries and the first verdict from the voters on the presidential candidates. It's any air passengers' nightmare. A hull burst suddenly in the side of your plane while you're traveling far above the surface of the Earth. And that's what happened on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. A piece of the plane called a door plug came off shortly after takeoff on Friday, leaving a hole and causing the cabin to rapidly depressurize. Incredibly, the craft landed safely with only minor injuries among 177 passengers and crew. While now most of the world's Boeing 737 MAX 9s are grounded and the U.S. National Transportation Board is investigating. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER HOMENDY, CHAIR, U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: We have the safest aviation system in the world. It is incredibly safe. We are the global gold standard for safety around the world but we have to maintain that standard. We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic.

Sir, thank you so much for your time. You know, what's so mystifying is that this plane was basically -- not basically, but was brand new, lost a chunk of its body. I mean, that's anyone's worst nightmare. Has it ever happened before, or is it rare for something like this to occur? ALAN DIEHL, FORMER ACCIDENT INVESTIGATOR FOR NTSB, FAA AND U.S. AIR FORCE:  Well, in terms of this type of plug door, it's been around since 1996 on predecessor 737s. I don't think there's a long history of failure, but, yes, you do seem to have failures when planes are brand new and when they get very old. So, it's not surprising. And there was some talk about the fact that they were having problems pressurizing this aircraft. This particular vehicle apparently may have had some kind of leak. Now, the NTSB will have to carefully determine whether or not this leak was around that plug door or not. That door can be opened by mechanics from the outside. Obviously, it's not intended to be opened from the inside, but we were sure lucky that this happened at a lower altitude and nobody was sitting in the two seats directly adjacent to that plug door.",

HELLYER, SENIOR ASSOCIATE FELLOW IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES, RUSI:  The efforts for bringing this conflict to an end, have sort of skipped the end of it, as it were, and are trying to look beyond. I think this is entirely regrettable, quite frankly, because it's very clear that in terms of Israel's plans for moving forward, they don't really see much need to think about the day after, and they are far more intent on prosecuting the war, and they are very clear that in spite of international public opinion demanding a ceasefire as a result of so many civilian casualties in Gaza as a result of the Israeli strikes, they will not listen unless the United States engages in a far more serious fashion. And what we've seen so far is this shuttle diplomacy, but also an awareness on the Israeli side that the United States won't do more than simply talk. There's no suggestion, for example, that there will be the halting of arms, or the reduction of aid, or anything that is substantive enough that will hold the Israelis back from not only prosecuting this war further in Gaza but also risking the regionalization of it and the spreading of it to places like Lebanon and elsewhere.

Instead, it will issue these statements to engage in a shot to diplomacy. But when you compare what the United States has done previously in other conflicts in the 1980s and so on with the Israelis, where they engaged much more heavily, but with leverage that the Israelis respected took seriously, and as a result, corrected their behavior or deviated from their plans. At the moment, that simply isn't the case. And as a result, the Israelis have become more reckless, especially in the past few weeks. And I think that's very regrettable and dangerous.",

People are starving, infectious diseases spreading in shelters, women giving birth in chaotic situations. He says, Gaza has, quote, simply become uninhabitable.

And a key part of that was responding to a speech that Biden gave on Friday where he accused Donald Trump of being a threat to American democracy. Trump, as we've seen him do time and time again, try to flip the script and argue that Biden is actually the threat to democracy, and pointed to the series of indictments that he is facing as proof of his argument. Now, Trump also spent a lot of time this week in attacking Nikki Haley, something that's really interesting. As someone who has covered the Trump campaign for quite a bit, I can tell you that these are some of the sharpest attacks we've heard from Donald Trump on the campaign trail so far.

He's facing a lot of discontent three years into his presidency over the economy, over immigration, over crime, although the crime statistics are moving in the right direction, and a lot of doubts about whether he is too old for the job.And in the face of all that, in many ways, the most important asset for Democrats in 2024 is that we have seen over the last three elections a powerful coalition of Americans who are reluctant to turn over the country to Trump's vision of what America should be, no matter how discontented they are with Biden or other Democrats. And Biden underscored the historic threat to democracy that Trump has presented since the, really, you know, throughout -- at parts during his presidency, but certainly since the November election in 2020. Trump, you know, in his speech tried to turn it around and say, well, Biden is the real threat to democracy because he is trying to throw me off the ballot. And there's no indication that the White House is behind those state efforts and that he is, you know, pursuing prosecutions against me. You know, Trump has been able to make all of this work for him, as you know, Laila, in the context of a Republican primary. Republican voters have basically bought his argument that he is being targeted as an attempt to silence them. But the polling, I think, is very clear that in a general election, the story could be very different, particularly if he is convicted on any of the serious charges that he is facing. So, in many ways, it is a presidential election defined by the vulnerabilities more than the strengths of the two likely protagonists. But as we saw in 2022, even voters who are unhappy with the way things are going in the country have been more willing to stick with Democrats than we've seen in the past because of their concerns about Trump.",

I believe that this is the first time since the Democratic Party of the 1840s and 1850s was dominated by the south, that the dominant faction in one of our two major parties is no longer committed to democracy, as we have understood it.I think Trump, in ways large and small, has shown that he is willing to shred American democracy if that's what it takes to achieve power. And a substantial portion of his party is willing to let him do it. But in polling, pretty clearly, a majority of the country is not in that camp. And even a substantial minority of Republicans, somewhere between a fifth and a quarter of Republicans in polling consistently say they understood what happened after the election in 2020 was wrong and dangerous. So far, they are sticking with Trump, and that's really what makes him electorally viable. But as I said, despite the substantial discontent, the very real discontent with Biden's performance and the doubts about whether he's too old to do the job for another four years, a lot of voters in that camp still view Trump as a threat to their values, their rights and to democracy itself. And so we are headed for just kind of an unprecedented situation. I will say that as a long-term proposition, American democracy will not be stable if only one party is willing to stand up for it, because in a two-party system, there is never going to be possible for one party to win all of the time. And if the Republicans who say that they do want to defend democracy, as we have known it, are not willing to stand up more to Trump, when he threatens it, we are in for some really rocky road ahead.",

Mr. Austin sought treatment on New Year's Day following complications from an elective surgery. Five days later, the secretary released a statement addressing his lack of transparency with the public. Mr. Austin said that he, quote, could have done a better job. And he also says he's on the mend. They said it was impossible, but after 34 years, someone has finally beaten Tetris on the Nintendo Entertainment System. And to make it even more remarkable, it was this 13-year-old boy. It took Willis Gibson 38 minutes to reach a level no human has ever reached before. And just look at that reaction and to play the game until it glitched out and hit its kill screen so far. The only other player to beat the game was A.I., which got to level 236 by manipulating the game parameters. And I got to speak to the legend himself. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
