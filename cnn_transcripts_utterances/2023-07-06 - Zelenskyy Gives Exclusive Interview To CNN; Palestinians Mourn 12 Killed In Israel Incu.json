As dawn breaks over the city rescue teams are working to find residents leave trapped beneath the rubble and debris from the badly damaged building.At least eight people are reported to have been injured in the missile strike. Reacting to the attack in a telegram post President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there will definitely be a response to the enemy, a tangible one. In eastern Ukraine, Moscow-backed officials in occupied Donetsk say a Ukrainian missile strike set an oil depot on fire in the industrial city of Makiivka with 68 injured from Ukrainian shelling in the region on Tuesday, a sharp increase in recent days, according to officials there. And Ukrainian military command says Russia continues to focus its firepower with dozens of Lyman, Makiivka, and Marinka in the past day. Fighting continues around the battle city of Bakhmut, with Ukrainian forces feeling positive and optimistic about progress after claiming to have retaken territory from Russian occupation. And according to the Ukrainian president, Russia is preparing to launch a possible attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. He says Russian forces have been laying what appeared to be explosive devices on roofs in around the facility. But the International Atomic Energy Agency is not yet convinced.

I also visited the Ukrainian Navy Institute, which used to be based in Crimea. So everyone shares the same feeling of definite victory. Definite returned to Crimea.

Is there anything that would change that speed dramatically? Is this something when you say F-16s are necessary or ATACMS are necessary, would that make a difference to those infantry walking through fields? ZELENSKYY (through translator)Will this accelerate our moving forward? Yes, 100 percent. Because in some directions that will give us opportunity to start the counter offensive. In some directions, we cannot even think of starting it as we don't have the relevant weapons, and throwing our people to be killed by Russian long range weapons would be simply inhumane. So we're not going to do it and ATACMS is definitely our priority. We also have shortages in artillery. We cannot hit all the targets because of the absence of the quantity in our own artillery. We gather some units in the priority directions, but we cannot divide it between many. We lack quantity. This is a fact. As to F-16s, I emphasized on it many times. It's not even about the Ukrainian advantage in the sky over the Russians. This is only about being equal, F-16s helped not only those on the battlefield to move forward, it's simply very difficult without a cover from the air. We've got losses of lives and slowing down. However, let's look at F- 16s a very important humanitarian mission. We've talked about it many times the Green Initiative. Erin, we are today in Odessa, the grain corridor extremely important for the whole world is happening just here. It's important for Africa, Asia, for the countries of Europe, et cetera.

He will make everything in order to break and nullify the Wagner rights fame and everything they were doing. He will be distancing himself from all that.

I can tell you, he rarely comes out to the street. We see him in his offices, et cetera. But we never see him out and about. Where did he go? He leaves his bunker only when it's extremely needed. He went to the town of Durban and the Dagestan Republic, if I'm not mistaken. The stats show that Putin's popularity is the lowest in Dagestan. A lot of locals died whom he sent to the war to die. And Prigozhin is very popular there. So he's behaving like a political animal. He goes to Dagestan.

They are scared to lose their jobs. But he doesn't understand and doesn't control the middle layer of the Russian military, nor the lower rank officers and soldiers. Sometimes we see it quite clearly, when he's talking about some towns or villages that they are under the Russian flag. But in reality, all of them are under the Ukrainian control. It means he just doesn't get all the understanding what's happening, as he's only being fed some positive information. He doesn't want to hear bad news. I reiterate the aging autocrats don't want to process negative emotions. We are dealing with reality. They are in a bad situation. That's why their commander started supporting Prigozhin. For us, he's a terrorist, whereas for them, he's someone who is with them on the battlefield. And he was with the Wagner rights with those murders, but he came to the frontline sat in the trenches and so on. That's where he got his support from. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And while the Israeli military says the raid was successful, many feared the cycle of violence and retribution is now set to become increasingly violent. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Chants of anger and defiance ring out in the city of Jenin. The morning after Israel's military withdrew, thousands filled the streets to bury the dead. The Israeli military says that all 12 killed in its incursion were combatants, and that its operation aimed to dismantle terror networks here. But this father said he is proud. His 19-year-old is what he calls a martyr and was a fighter for one of the Palestinian armed factions killed in the incursion. My son told me he didn't want to get married or have a family, he says. He said all he wanted to do was to dedicate his life to Palestine, to fighting the occupation. (on camera): This funeral is quickly turning into a demonstration of resistance. Many of the armed Palestinian factions are here to show that they are unbound, unbroken by Israel's reign. (voice-over): For many Palestinians, Jenin is a name and place synonymous with suffering and resistance. But this battle has come at a heavy cost. In the aftermath, the camp's residents were left without running water, electricity, or basic services, and families returned to destroyed homes. Hanaa Shalaby says she and her three daughters were caught in the crossfire. Our home, all these material things, they can be replaced, she says. But how can I rebuild the psyche of my little girls? How will they ever feel safe again? She takes me upstairs to show me what's left of her daughter's room. My youngest, she's only seven years old, she tells me. She says she wishes she was never born. She says I should never have birthed her into this horror. Israel's military says it's achieved its operational goals, wiping out weapons depots and command centers in Jenin. But it has also deepened the hatred and motivated the resistance in a city notorious for always fighting back. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, Jenin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

On a normal year, some cool water gets pushed off and we don't have warm water along the west coast of the Americas. When El Nino comes in, all of a sudden, that water -- that warm water spreads out. So there is more warm surface area under the satellite as it rotates around and around and around measures all of those temperatures.

First off, it is northern hemisphere summer so this is typically the hottest time of year for the planet. We then have the El Nino weather pattern, which we know causes global temperatures generally to be higher than average. But those are two natural factors. And the real unnatural factor here, is the human caused climate change that decade over decade, is driving our temperatures up. So it is really that human caused climate change that is causing us to smash all these temperature records. That said, we know that the last hottest year on record was an El Ninon year. So it does have a significant impact on our temperatures. But without that human factor, it is unlikely we will be setting the records that we're seeing this week. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
