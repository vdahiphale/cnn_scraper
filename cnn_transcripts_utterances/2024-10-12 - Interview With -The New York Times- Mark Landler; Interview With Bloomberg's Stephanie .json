I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.It's probably no exaggeration to say that practically the entire world is looking at the U.S. election, now less than a month away. The sitting president and incumbent Democratic candidate made the unprecedented move of stepping aside. History was then made with the first woman of color replacing him on the national ticket. The Republican nominee and former president survived assassination attempts and contributed mightily to the deluge of disinformation thrown at American voters from every direction. It comes from the depths of social media and online from inside America and from enemies overseas. The polling is so tight that predictions at this point might be a fool's errand. Now Democrats are showing signs they're anxious about the outcome in key swing states. With me to discuss the race and how disinformation is shaping it are journalists Stephanie Flanders, head of economics and politics at Bloomberg, and Mark Landler, the London bureau chief for \"The New York Times\". Welcome both of you back to the program. So first of all, the atmospherics. I'm right, right. I mean, everybody asked me, they must all ask you as Americans, who's going to win the election. MARK LANDLER, LONDON BUREAU CHIEF, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes. And I'm glad you said fool's errand a moment ago because that's what we're mostly asked to do, which is offer prediction. And at this point, it seems crazy to do so. As you said, everything is such a razor's edge. And what you think is going to happen bears a lot on what you think the polling is showing or failing to show. So I think the best answer is to say you're not in the crystal ball business.",

The hurricanes are a very good example of this. So here we are less than a month away and these very destructive storms go through key swing states. I mean, that's the important thing to remember. It's North Carolina and Georgia that we're talking about. Florida to a lesser extent.

FLANDERS: And then as ever, it is also a Trump aspect to this, I mean, the uniqueness of him as a candidate. It isn't just surrogates who are going out. It's not just sort of influencers and shady forces on social media who are propagating the misinformation. It's Donald Trump on the stump saying these things and he's got good reason for it.

So let's just talk about the foreign government therefore which have such a huge interest in this. So House and Senate races are also being targeted according to U.S. intelligence by foreign governments. Moscow targeting candidates who support Ukraine aid. Russia does support Trump's reelection. China targets candidates in both parties. Iran apparently opposes Trump's reelection and Cuba apparently is likely to mount a campaign in favor of any candidate who'd be more supportive of lifting those sanctions.

It's controlled largely by local authorities. So trying to infiltrate that process is perhaps not worth the effort. But I think what they have concluded is if they can get out enough message that raises questions about voting irregularities, you kind of sow dissent, division in the society, which is a fundamental goal of any disinformation campaign. And as you say, you do it in the service of one candidate or another. And it's actually a fascinating way to look at the issues in a perverse way by which government is most interested in helping which candidate. Presumably Iran supports Kamala Harris because they assume that a President Donald Trump, who after all, you know, ordered the assassination of a senior Iranian general would be tougher on them, perhaps than she would.",

There will be grownups in the room.And others saying, hang on a minute. All those grownups have gone, none of them are supporting him anymore.

And of course now we've had quite a big interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, the Central Bank. And some pretty good jobs numbers recently. Their hope I guess would be that that will start coming through in the polls. But actually, as you know we're actually seeing the opposite, if anything. We're seeing those polls continue to be extremely tight. And Kamala Harris, actually, if anything, losing her lead in some of those swing states.

So there's all these other structures that we could find a sense of collective justice that we no longer have. So we have pack justice and I think vengeance and retribution, they're are understandable, but they're very different things to actually what I think is what at the heart of justice.
