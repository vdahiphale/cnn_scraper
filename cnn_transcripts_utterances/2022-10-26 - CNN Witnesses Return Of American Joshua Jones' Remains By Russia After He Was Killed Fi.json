Brand-new video, you'll see, right here, for the very first time, in just a few moments. It's, really, I have to tell you, an incredible story, one that only CNN's Clarissa Ward can tell, taking place, during a rare ceasefire, in Putin's brutal war, giving two hours of cover, for this dramatic scene. CNN crews, shuttled by Ukrainian Intelligence, as Russia returned the body of an American, an American killed in Ukraine, while fighting for Ukraine. His name was Joshua Jones. He was 24-years-old, a U.S. Army veteran, from Tennessee. He was killed in August, while fighting Putin's forces, alongside the Ukrainian Military. Now, this handover happened, after months of negotiations, in a dangerous area, known as No Man's Land. It's in the Zaporizhzhia region, between Ukrainian-controlled Ukraine, and Russian-controlled Ukraine. And Jones' body will now head back, here, to the United States, to his family, who have been longing, for his remains, to return, to his final resting place, to home. Now, this rare moment of detente takes place, during an incredibly tumultuous time, in this war. Today, Russian President, Vladimir Putin, led Military training drills, which the Kremlin says include practice missile launches. And then, Putin said this, earlier today.

A dirty bomb is a traditional explosive that can also contain radioactive material. Now, to be clear, we know of absolutely no evidence that Ukraine is developing or planning to use one of these weapons. And if the Russians did, they should turn it over to the United Nations. But Western and Ukrainian officials worry that this could be a false- flag operation, by the Kremlin, that Putin is just trying to distract, from his own plans, to use a nuclear device. Though, his Ambassador to the U.K. denied that to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREY KELIN, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.: Russia is not going to use nukes.

That so far has led to an influx of brutal attacks against innocent Ukrainian civilians, and increased attacks, on critical infrastructure, aimed at taking out power, and water, things needed to live.One of the latest such attacks in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro, where a gas station caught on fire, after a Russian missile attack overnight. And local officials say, two people were killed, a carwash operator, and a pregnant woman, who was trapped in her car, and burned alive. In a different example of Putin's desperation, he's turning to another brutal regime, for help. Today, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy claimed that Russia has used 400 Iranian drones, to specifically attack Ukrainian civilians, escalating attacks on innocents, innocents, who have been targeted, by Putin, and his army, since this war began. All of that is what's fueling these fears that a nuclear option is not off the table. Considering Russia's despicable, inhumane actions, against the Ukrainian people, it's hard to imagine any form of civility between the two sides. But this war has seen at least some brief moments of cooperation, when it comes to prisoner exchanges. Two American Veterans, fighting in Ukraine, who were captured in June, were released, last month. Part of a prisoner swap, partly brokered by Saudi Arabia. They were recently reunited, with their families, back here in the United States.

His passport, and Ukrainian Military ID, showed up on Russian social media channels, soon after. But his body was never recovered.

A makeshift white flag is put together, for the moment of transfer. And we're off again, this time, to No Man's Land. A rare two-hour ceasefire has been agreed by both sides, and time is of the essence. WARD (on camera): So, we've just arrived at the meeting point. They're waiting, now, for the Russians, to arrive, with the body. WARD (voice-over): A team of forensic investigators get ready, for the task ahead. This is as far as we are allowed to go. Actual handover will happen, just beyond the hill. Waiting for their return, it is eerily quiet. Only the bravest dare come out in these parts. One of the transfer team, captures the moment, Joshua Jones' is brought back, into Ukrainian territory, as Russian forces look on.

The number of people experiencing homelessness, in Los Angeles, also increased, in the same period.Congresswoman Karen Bass wants to be the next Mayor of Los Angeles. She's a Democrat. She's in the middle of a tight run-off with developer Rick Caruso. And Congresswoman Bass joins us now. Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining us. Why have things gotten worse? Why is crime and homelessness worse, in Los Angeles, now? REP. KAREN BASS (D-CA): Well, let me just tell you, homelessness really exploded a couple of years ago, right before the Pandemic, and certainly through the Pandemic. But you know what? I just don't even imagine - I can't even imagine, what L.A. would have been like, if we did not have the American Rescue Plan. So, all of the resources, around COVID, allowed us to do an experiment that I hope that we keep, which is doing master-leasing of motels, and hotels, where you lease out all of the rooms. And you put people, who were on the streets, in the hotels, and motels. We've been able to get thousands of people, off the streets. And this needs to be expanded, tremendously.",

They just can't afford the rent, because L.A., over the last few years, has become extremely unaffordable. And in terms of evictions, that was something that was certainly a big issue, before the Pandemic. We knew it took place, during the Pandemic, even though there was an eviction moratorium. So, I'm actually worried that homelessness is going to spike again, at the end of the first quarter of next year, because the eviction moratorium will go away, and some of the resources that were for COVID will go away. So, we're going to need to appeal to the state that has $100 billion - $100 billion surplus, to extend the contracts, so people can stay in the hotels and motels, for several more months.",

If you don't deal with the substance abuse, and mental illness, they'll be right back on. And so, you have temporary housing, but you also have permanent supportive housing. I did a press conference, yesterday, with carpenters, on a vacant lot that is owned by the city. And they can build housing there, in the matter of months, and it's significantly cheaper. So, there are solutions. But what Galperin was talking about, is that when we pass propositions, we loaded everything in, everything that we wanted to see. That's the perfect, and we can't do that anymore. We need to get people off these streets, as soon as possible. Three or four of them die on the streets, every single day.

My opponent calls for hiring 1,500 Police officers, and makes a commitment to do that, when he knows that we can't even fill a class, now. If we were to hire 1,500 Police officers, the city would go bankrupt. So, what he is proposing are programs and examples of things that he absolutely knows are not achievable. And I think that's disingenuous, and it's just a way of conning people. And I don't think that's the right thing to do, right now, when the city is in a crisis, at all.",

You said you think this is more than just an issue, with auditory processing, which is what some reporters, in the campaign, seem to be suggesting that he hears the words, but he's just having trouble computing what they mean. It takes him a couple seconds. You say he also has expressive aphasia. What is that? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Yes. So, he's had an injury, to his brain, in the area that helps someone process speech. So, most people have thought that Mr. Fetterman's injury was how he processed - how he processed sound, which is why they gave him the prompter. But what was really apparent last night was that he has expressive aphasia. It's a really common injury, in people, who've had a stroke. It's estimated about 30 percent of people who survive a stroke, will have some difficulty with speech. But the particular problem that Mr. Fetterman has is expressive aphasia, from an injury, to a part of the brain, in most people, on the left side, towards the front of the brain, in the temporal lobe, probably called Broca's area. And people with expressive aphasia had difficulty, putting together complex sentences. They have difficulty, processing spoken word, in complex sentences.",
