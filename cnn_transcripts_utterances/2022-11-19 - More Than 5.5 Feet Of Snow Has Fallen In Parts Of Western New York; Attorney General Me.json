But this is on the borderline of historic.GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Absolutely, Martin. And not only that, but it is actually quite dangerous, and you heard it from the county executive. They are asking people to stay home and out of the roads, unless they absolutely have to go out there. Just take a look here behind me. You can see the stop sign almost covered all the way half halfway to the top. The area here in downtown Buffalo has been getting hit for several hours to south towns pummeled yesterday. And now, we are beginning to see the effects of this lake effect snow. Now, overnight, several rescues from people who were out on the road dozens of vehicles had to be abandoned. And more than 300 tickets were actually issued to motorists who went out there when the driving ban was in effect. As the county executive said, if you are out there right now you are only adding to the problem. There is cleanup crews that are trying to keep up with the effort here. You know the snow has not stopped falling yet. So, this is going to take a while. And this snow. It is not only extremely wet, but it is heavy. It is packed. There is ice underneath it. So, if you do not need to be out there right now. Stay home. Wait it out. The county executive also just said, know your limitations, if you are going to be doing any cleanup. Unfortunately, two people have died as a result of the storm suffering cardiac episodes while they were trying to clean up. So, if you absolutely do not need to start cleaning up. Just wait it out, let the professionals handle it. And just wait it out. The storm is not over yet here downtown Buffalo, we are expecting to see more snowfall over the next several hours. And although Buffalonians are quite familiar with this, it's still extremely disruptive. Things very much at a standstill right now.",

They want to clear it out while they've gotten a little bit of a break. But be careful when you do that. Because again, this isn't just two to four inches of snow, it is two to four feet of snow. And so, you don't want to be rushed in that process. Again, know your limits. Right now we're getting a little bit of a break in Buffalo. That band is just off to the north side. But look, it's not the only state. New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, all looking at ongoing snow right now. It's just going to shift back and forth. So, we talked about the break in Buffalo. It's expected to shift back into the city tonight and continue through Sunday morning. So, it's a very narrow window there, folks. This is a look yesterday at Buffalo where the cameras located. It's not snowing, but you can see just about a mile or two off into the distance, it's coming down in blankets. And again, it was coming down at three, four, even five inches an hour at some point yesterday. Buffalo itself picking up just about 14 inches. That is a daily record. But again, here's the thing, you look at that narrow line, it doesn't shift all that much, but even a few miles makes a huge difference. We've just got some new totals in now. Take a look at this Natural Bridge in New York, just shy of six feet. 70 inches of snow and it's still snowing in a lot of these places. Orchard Park, Blasdell, Hamburg, all over 60 inches. So, you're talking five and almost six feet of snow. For those unfamiliar with where those cities are, they fall in these pink highlighted areas here. So, you've got two separate areas, both for areas around Lake Ontario as well as Lake Erie. But it's not just those Lakes, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, you're also dealing with some pretty significant lake effect snow as well, not just for the last 24 to 48 hours, but for the next 24 to 48 hours. So, as we go through the weekend, we can expect more. Most areas when we talk about additional snow, we're going to be talking in the range of about six to 12 inches, but there will be some spots, especially up across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario where 20 to 24 inches on top of what we've already had is not out of the question. And so, again, Martin and Amara, I mean, it's just it's kind of mind boggling to think about two more feet on top of four to six feet already.",

So, you're going to have some of the same prosecutors working on the case, that's not going to be different, that we already know, people from the Justice Department is sort of move in over to the special counsels team. So, those things will go on, the question will be what does he need to do to get up to speed? What does he need to do to feel comfortable if he's going to make a recommendation?

And so, now, after the investigation is going on, after they conducted a raid, and apparently approved a raid on his residence, after they came in, and they've been talking in court, and I've got a special master looking at documents. And after we've had grand juries in Washington, talking about the January 6 events and other obstruction about the 2020 election. It's just an unusual time. And a special counsel, is generally like Mueller was, you're brought in to start the investigation so that the investigation looks clean from the outset. And that's not what happened here. And so, I don't know. I mean, there have been other political cases we know about, and you hadn't had special counsel. This seems a little different to me. You know, we don't want to second guess everything Garland does, and that's not that wouldn't be appropriate. He might know stuff, and certainly does that we don't know. But to say it's because suddenly Trump announced he was going to run. And the Joe Biden is saying he's going to run. That seems like not the strongest answer I might give on the question.",

But a separate date will be set to determine restitution, a possible $800 million.Holmes was convicted in January on four counts of defrauding investors, but found not guilty of defrauding patients. She had at one time been an icon in Silicon Valley for being a young female entrepreneur, starting the company Theranos, and claiming her technology could use just a few drops of blood to conduct a variety of tests. But that technology didn't work. Prosecutors said when faced with failure, she chose fraud. A separate trial earlier this year found Theranos' second in command Sunny Balwani guilty on 12 counts on fraud. Holmes has to turn herself into custody next April, and that may have something to do with the fact that she is currently pregnant. Her pregnancy and her 1-year-old child with partner Billy Evans were brought up by some of her supporters when they wrote to the judge, stating how one must consider very young children growing up without their mother. There were more than 100 letters written in her support. Holmes had a chance to speak for herself on Friday before the judge read her sentence. She was emotional and telling the court, \"The people I tried to get involved with Theranos were the people I loved and respected the most. I am devastated by my failings.\" Her team is expected to appeal her conviction and sentence. Amara and Martin, back to you. WALKER: What a fall for Elizabeth Holmes.",

So, a lot of empty promises there that they campaigned on. The other thing I would say is you got to watch these moderate House Republicans, who came to Washington again, talking about inflation, they have no interest in the spotlight turning to an investigation of Hunter Biden. And, in fact, worried that that could have a blowback for them politically. And with McCarthy having such a slim majority, that could really cause a problem for him. He's going to see a very divided conference where you have members like Comer, and Jim Jordan, the top ally of Donald Trump, who want to have these very aggressive investigations. And then these moderate Republicans who are saying, wait, this is a total distraction, we need to be focusing on the issues that we ran on, to try to, to try to keep our seats, frankly in 2024.
