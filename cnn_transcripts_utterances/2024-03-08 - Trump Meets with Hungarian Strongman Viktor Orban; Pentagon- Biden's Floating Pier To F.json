We'll tell you how he did it and the question is can he do the same for the other nearly half a billion-dollar judgment? And a day after President Biden committed to building a port to bring aid into Gaza, look at just how long that might take in corresponding course of wars. Confrontation with Israelis trying to block any aid from getting in. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight keeping him honest with how President Biden and the man last night he called my predecessor, spent their day after the State of the Union. It was a study of contrasts. President Biden went on the campaign trail speaking this evening at a suburban Philadelphia middle school, hitting many of the themes he laid out last night. But with one difference, he named his opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Jean Carroll defamation trial he lost and appealed the judgment, more on that shortly. He also installed his daughter in law as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.The former president closed out his post-State of the Union day at Mar-a-Lago just in the last few hours, hosting Hungary's right-wing authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a strongman for which the former president doesn't seem to be a pejorative.

The source described them as friends and the meeting is friendly.Now, I was told we were going to get a actual readout of this meeting and photos from it, but we have not seen anything like that. They had described to me as a social meeting, simply saying that the two men were going to sit down with no agenda. But, of course, if you have the leader of Hungary, Viktor Orban and Donald Trump, it seems strange that there would be no agenda. But you have to remember one thing, Donald Trump, for all intents and purposes, is a civilian. They are not obligated to give us any sort of readout or discuss anything, take notes, take any kind of transcript with a leader of another nation. But it does give us some insight into whether or not Donald Trump would align himself with the Viktor Orbans of the world if he were to be re-elected to the White House, which is, of course, what he's seeking to do. He has routinely praised Orban on the campaign trail. He has said that he's a strongman, but that countries need a strongman to lead. They also are almost exactly politically aligned when it comes to immigration. They have both talked about building a wall. They have both lashed out at a free press, calling it fake news. So again, part of the significance here is the fact that Donald Trump himself, this might give a preview as to what it would look like if he were re-elected to the White House in November.",

I mean, Donald Trump is out there continuing to spread lies about January 6th, about Ukraine, about everything else and the President had to do this.

I think they have both used messaging about immigrants that has been widely criticized as echoing fascists and so it's not surprising that that they're meeting. I don't know that there is some greater aim for Trump other than what he's been doing all along.

If this is our attempt to get suburban women, good effing luck with that. I thought both the SOTU and the rebuttal were unwatchable. We continue to have a woman problem, just keep shooting ourselves in the face.\" And meanwhile, another senior GOP aide told me that it was difficult to watch, but also noted that these things are notoriously tricky. They said, \"It's an impossible task. The pro-tip is just never do the State of the Union response. It never goes well for anyone.\" But there were plenty of other Republicans and even some Democrats who had nothing but praise for Katie Britt and defended her performance. Take a listen.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:30:00] COOPER: A remarkable report now from our Clarissa Ward, about aid to Gaza. President Biden today told reporters Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu must allow more of it, where millions are in need of food and the medical system is near collapse. Airdrops are providing only limited assistance. Today, the Pentagon said that the floating pier the President announced during his State of the Union address to ferry aid in to Gaza could take 2 months and 1,000 troops to actually build. With those developments is a backdrop, here's Clarissa's report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They march with determination to the Kerem Shalom border, as they have for six weeks. Their mission, to block international aid from crossing into Gaza. The border police are waiting for them. \"There's a danger of sniper fire and projectiles, the officer warns. I ask you to leave this place.\" But the protesters are undeterred, made up mostly of hostage family members, former reservists, and settlers. They ignore the order and change course to move closer to the crossing. WARD (on-camera): So you can see the trucks with aid over there. The police had been trying to stop the protesters, but then they've just cut through this field, and they're pushing ahead.",

Previously, they've managed to block aid trucks from crossing. But on this day, the police had been given their orders, and no one is getting through, prompting anger from the crowd. You are confused. Go deal with the war, this woman shouts. We came to help you. Unable to cross here, the protesters try their luck in another area, but the authorities are just as quick to stop them. WARD (on-camera): So the police are now really starting to lose their patience. They've been trying to push these protesters away for hours now, and still, they're not leaving. The crowd on this day is small, but their sentiment is shared by the majority of people in the country. A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 68 percent of Jewish Israelis oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza. On the other side of the border, the situation could not be more dire. 7 year old Fadi Alsant (ph) is suffering from severe dehydration and malnutrition. Doctors at the Kamal Adwan Hospital say they don't have the resources to properly treat him. Fadi's mother says she's already lost 2 children, she doesn't want to lose him. According to Gaza's health authorities, at least 17 children have died of dehydration and malnutrition already. And with the U.N. warning that famine is just a step away, there is hardly room for debate. More aid needs to get to more people as quickly as possible. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I think this poll really underscores something that maybe a lot of people aren't talking about, which is that the majority of Israelis do have some sympathy with this opinion that aid shouldn't get into Gaza, because they believe that is only going to take away some leverage that they have for getting the hostages safely out, Anderson.",

Their home was burned down. So here they are hoping to have found what would have been a safe refuge. But he says not even this is safe. Feel better. Okay? CULVER (voice-over): Chaos now grips much of Haiti, especially the capital, Port-au-Prince. For the first time, a Haitian security source tells us rival gangs are now working together, launching a wide scale series of attacks against the government, going after the airport, police stations, and prisons.
