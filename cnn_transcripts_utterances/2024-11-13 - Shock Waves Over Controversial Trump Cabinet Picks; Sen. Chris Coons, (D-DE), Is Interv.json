Fierce critic of the Justice Department, frequent target Matt Gaetz is poised to lead the Justice Department pending Senate confirmation or a recess appointment. President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz as the next U.S. Attorney General.Gaetz is, of course, no stranger to controversy. He continues to face a House Ethics Committee investigation over allegations that he may have, quote, \"engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct,\" unquote. Matt Gaetz vociferously denies all of the charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): They lie about me because I tell the truth about them and I'm not going to stop. So when you see the leaks and the lies and the falsehoods and the smears, when you see the anonymous sources and insiders forecasting my demise, know this, they aren't really coming for me.

So he was right that the reports of his demise were premature.To note, the Gaetz had sought a preemptive presidential pardon from Trump over a Justice Department investigation. That is according to a Trump aide who testified at the January 6 hearing. The Gaetz pick comes as President-elect Trump and President Biden met for the first time today at the Oval Office as the president-elect, his cabinet is taking shape. That's the first time Biden and Trump were in the same room since June 27 at the CNN debate. And we all know how that ended up changing history. Let's go right to CNN Anchor Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, Matt Gaetz as U.S. attorney, Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence, Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense. One of the things that I can discern in this is these are people who have -- who are, A, good on television, all of them, and B, have been vociferous defenders of Donald Trump's, especially on Fox.",

And you're starting to see the reaction on Capitol Hill to the people that Trump was always inclined to pick, people who he strongly is aligned with and that are fiercely loyal to him. And really that has been the number one qualification, not necessarily experience or concerns about what that position is going to look like or even whether or not they can actually get confirmed. Which if a nominee can't get confirmed in this Senate, Jake, for a Republican president with 53 Republican senators, it's really saying something. And so that is going to be the next step here.I will say one thing I've heard as I've been reporting on this out is that maybe this is a chess move by Donald Trump to put some of the more fiery picks out there to where the other picks can all get confirmed, maybe not all of these.

Even Senate Republicans weren't willing to confirm him, it looked like. And so he withdrew his name. Trump then put Ric Grenell, his former ambassador to Germany, in that position in an acting basis and it essentially freaked out the Senate Republicans so much that by the time his acting stint was done and they put John Ratcliffe back up as the nominee, he was confirmed.Now, it was a sharply divided partisan battle, one that you don't typically see for the DNI position. John Ratcliffe was announced the other day in what he's going to be doing in this position in the CIA and it's not even really mentioned. It's like an afterthought. That just shows how much the spectrum has changed and how different Washington is about to be in 68 days from now when Trump retakes power.",

Of course, the Senate does have an advice and consent role.We also asked Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Our colleague Morgan Rimmer caught up with him, and it was really interesting because Cramer said that he doesn't really know Gaetz well, but he does have some pause about the fact that Gaetz really orchestrated that effort to bring down Kevin McCarthy just a little over a year ago. He said he still has some questions about that. So, yes, there is a strong majority in the United States Senate.
