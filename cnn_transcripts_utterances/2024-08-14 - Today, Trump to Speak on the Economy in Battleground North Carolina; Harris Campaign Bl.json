I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Today, former President Donald Trump is back in a battleground state for the first time in nearly two weeks, stumping this afternoon in North Carolina for the third time this year. This was the scene at the venue this morning, his supporters already gathering outside. The Trump campaign is promising that today's event will focus on the economy. But the big question, of course, is whether he will stick to those economic remarks or revert back to his familiar outlandish attacks that we've seen in recent days on right wing media. His allies are begging for him to get back on script. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We appreciate it.I want to begin by showing the front page of the morning's Asheville Citizen Times newspaper, a great newspaper there in your hometown. It asks, why is Donald Trump rallying in Asheville? I think maybe the answer to that question is it is a pretty hotly contested battleground state this cycle. And I'm just curious, I mean, some of the recent polling that we've seen has shown kind of a shift from Trump to Kamala Harris. Are you hearing some of that from your constituents? What are you picking up on? MAYOR ESTHER MANHEIMER (D-ASHEVILLE, NC):  Well, first of all, thanks for having me on this morning. I would say what I'm hearing is a lot of excitement from Democrats, this has completely generated a lot of urgency in the campaign. We know there's less than 90 days until the election, and so a lot of excitement. And, you know, seeing Trump come to Asheville to me speaks to the fact that North Carolina is in play. This is a state that went to Barack Obama in 2008 and something like that could happen again.",

Meantime, the Harris campaign is taking former President Trump to task over his economic agenda, saying in a statement, no matter what he says, one thing is certain, Trump has no plan, no vision and no meaningful interest in helping build up the middle class.Let's discuss now with Harris-Walz Campaign Spokesperson Michael Tyler. Michael, thanks very much for being here. Good to see you. The vice president is set to roll out her agenda for the economy later this week in North Carolina. We're just talking to the mayor of Asheville. North Carolina is going to be a battleground. What can we expect to see from the vice president when she rolls out that economic plan? MICHAEL TYLER, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN:  Yes, well, good morning and thank you so much for having me. The vice president will obviously speak to this on Friday, so I'm not going to get too far out in front of her. But you can expect her to talk about the ways in which she wants to move this economy forward and lower costs for middle class families. She understands that for too many families, prices remain too high. She wants to make sure that the American people understand the ways in which we can grow our economy and make sure that everybody has the opportunity, not just to get by, but to get ahead as we move forward here. And I think that will be in stark contrast from what we see out of Donald Trump today, regardless of what he actually says. The man has one track record when it comes to the economy. He's the only president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered office, right, given the way that he bungled the COVID response. But we also know that his Project 2025 economic agenda would be nothing more than an across the board tax increase for middle class families, and folks like Moody's and other economists are saying that his economic policies would likely cause another recession into 2025. So, when it comes to the economy, we're going to have a very stark contrast for the next 80 odd days here between Kamala Harris and Tim Walz who are fighting an economy that actually works for working people and middle class families and Donald Trump who is working for an economy that only works for folks like himself.",

So, yes, she supports no taxes on tips wages for actual service workers, but she also understands, but Donald Trump doesn't understand that. That's not enough. That's why we have to increase the federal minimum wage. That's why we have to actually lower costs for middle class families. That's why we have to create an entire economy that actually works for working people.Donald Trump's entire economic approach is only built to benefit people like himself. It's more tax cuts for the ultra wealthy, more giveaways for corporations, absolutely nothing that would actually benefit working people in this country.

And that was Donald Trump, because he's not actually interested in solving for the border problem. He's interested in serving himself. He's far less interested in border security. What he wants is made very clear in his Project 2025 agenda, it's mass deportation. It is the return of family separation. It's doing nothing to actually solve the problem.

When you look at inflation overall is the fact that we now have sub 3 percent inflation, consumer prices up by 2.9 percent year-over-year. That's better than expected. And look at that chart. You can see the trend here, right? Things have really improved.Just about two years ago, this metric was at 9 percent Yes. We had 9 percent inflation. Of course, that's when we had record high gas prices and price spikes on a whole bunch of items. Now, I want to be clear. We are not saying that prices are plunging across the economy or that we're suddenly back to 2019 prices. That is not happening as much as we wish it would. But what is happening is that prices are going up at a more gradual pace, and that is very encouraging. On the food front, we are seeing that supermarket prices have increased 1.1 percent year-over-year. That is encouraging as well. Some items are still getting more expensive. The Custard Grilla Hamburger is more expensive because ground beef prices are up. My kids are not going to be happy to see that hot dog prices are up 10 percent or egg prices are up 19 percent. But some items are actually falling in price. We saw a 1.6 percent drop for seafood, a drop for potatoes, apples are plunging almost 15 percent. So, all of that is encouraging. One other item I want to call out here, Jim, is the price of men's suits. We've seen that fall 12 percent. I know that you're going to be happy to hear about prices falling for men's suits. And, look, when you put all this together, it does suggest that the Fed is going to be able to cut interest rates in September.
