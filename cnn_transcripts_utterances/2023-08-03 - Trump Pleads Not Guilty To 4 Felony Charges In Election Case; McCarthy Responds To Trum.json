I'm Erin Burnett, along with Wolf Blitzer in Washington.And you are looking at live pictures of former President Trump now making his way back to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump's trip home caps what has been a historic day. The former president earlier pleading not guilty in a Washington, D.C. courtroom to four criminal counts tied to allegations that he conspired to overturn the 2020 election. And that courthouse where he was is symbolically so crucial. Just blocks from where Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6th. You see the Capitol from there, an insurrection fueled by what the indictment calls Trump's pervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud, Wolf.",

Defense attorneys in court today, they did raise some concerns about how long it will take them to really understand how much evidence they have to review in this case. But it appears that she wants to move this along swiftly. This courthouse has overseen hundreds of January 6th related cases. At this point, it's just impossible to say if this case will definitely go on before the 2024 election. One thing that could really impact a potential timeline is if there are additional charges or additional defendants added to this case.

You know the a little, has been dimmed greatly by Trump. But it's a little brighter tonight because as a country, we've shown that we are going to stand up for the constitution. That we are not going to tolerate unconstitutional criminal behavior and that we will apply that law you know to the highest offices in the land. So this could be an inflection point.

His trial is March. That's creating space, and that window. And I think that's the right window.

Certainly Bernie Kerik is not one of these alleged coconspirators. We are being cooperative.

Here they are, just the two of them highlighted for our viewers arriving in New Jersey with Trump after the indictment.I want to start, Tim, with Boris. \"The New York Times\" says there are signs that Boris's coconspirator number six in the indictment. He described -- that person is described as a political consultant who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors. Now, you know Boris well, do you think he's involved? Do you think that he would turn on Trump or that he would have -- I don't know what the right word would be, but the fortitude to not?",

One interesting thing to remember is that Boris is represented by Todd Blanche, who is also an attorney for Donald Trump. So, for Boris to flip requires his own attorney to turn against his other client.So, there is an interesting conflict there that would complicate any cooperation or flipping by Boris.",

Our reporters say he flew down with him.A source familiar with the matter tells CNN he is cited in the indictment as a senior campaign adviser who spoke with the defendant on a daily basis. Now he is not coconspirator, right, but he -- that is where he would appear in the indictment. And, you know, what's fascinating that in the indictment, it says that he informed Trump on multiple occasions at various fraud claims were untrue, and it quotes him in an email saying that the Trump team was 0-32 on legal challenges to the election, because there was noting to back the claims of fraud and says that the email continues to say, quote, all of the hustle to help on all fronts but it's tough to own any of this when it is all just conspiracy expletive beamed down from the mothership. Interesting, Tim, if this is all true that he is with Trump all day today. To some, that may seem strange, but this is Trump world. Do you think Trump and Miller should still be spending time together like they clearly were today?",

He's been criticizing Washington, D.C., arguing that he was forced to appear in court today. But his team did have a decision to conduct this arraignment and to participate in this arraignment remotely and via Zoom. But they chose to do that in person. I am told that there is strategy behind that was to try and gain more media attention, drum up more attention on his in-person appearance.They're also arguing the strategy there is to act like he was taken off the campaign trail and forced to appear for that court appearance. And they think that gets to their arguments that's this entire indictments is taking him away from the time on the campaign and interfering in the 2024 presidential election. I also want to point out, Wolf, some things I found in my reporting several days now, I know Donald Trump is privately very frustrated by these indictments. And you can also kind of see that in his demeanor today, both when he was inside the courtroom, but also when he was speaking with reporters. He did not take reporters questions, he did not put on that pot and that we often seen when he talks about these charges in public. He was not defiant. But, then again, on truth social you saw him go back to using the bravado that he likes to use in these certain cases when he is talking about these charges that he is facing. So, I think it's very interesting to note how he is feeling behind the scenes versus what he's putting out there publicly. One thing as well that I am also picking up on is that, Donald Trump as much as he is concerned about this indictment, he is also very worried about his legacy. I've covered Donald Trump for years now, and they know his legacy is something that he thinks a lot about. So, that has really been weighing on him today, Wolf.",

So, if Trump becomes president again, he can wipe out Fani Willis. He can wipe out Alvin Bragg. He can get rid of the state cases. He can get rid of this case. And where is the country then? They'll have someone who has demonstrated his willingness, his ability to simply disregard the election returns and conspire with the number of, so far, unindicted coconspirators to submit fake electoral flakes and pressure (INAUDIBLE).
