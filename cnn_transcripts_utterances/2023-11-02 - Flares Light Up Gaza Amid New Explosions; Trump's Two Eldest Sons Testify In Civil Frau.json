We were hearing detonation, seeing rockets fired and hearing artillery being fired into Beit Hanoun. It appeared to be the sort of illumination and the sort of smokescreen, you would expect troops on the ground to be using if they were maneuvering to be going into this urban environment. Beit Hanoun has been bid hit very heavily over the past few weeks by Israeli airstrikes and artillery. The IDF has been warning the civilian population to leave the area.Many civilians have been caught up killed and injured in the fire in Gaza according to the Ministry of Health, the Hamas led Ministry of Health there. More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed, more than 22,000 injured. But in Beit Hanoun tonight, it appears as if there is a significant IDF offensive underway. The other thing that we're learning from the IDF is that just a few miles south of Beit Hanoun the much more densely populated Gaza City the IDF says is now surrounded, that they are using direct and intelligence led fire, precise fire on Hamas targets there. The commanders of the IDF have been warning their troops that they are now in enemy territory. And we know that Hamas has been using shoulder launched anti-tank weapons, anti-tank rockets that have been penetrating some of the heavily armored tanks and armored personnel carriers. So this is a very dangerous fight for the troops in there, dangerous for the civilians. And that's why it appears the illumination is being used, smoke screens are being used to allow the IDF to advance or take control of certain positions down there in Gaza around Beit Hanoun. We don't know precisely because the IDF doesn't get precise details. We can't see precisely what's happening underneath all of that illumination. But we can see there have been significant explosions was also seen Hamas fire rockets, at least two rockets out of Gaza this evening intercepted by Iron Dome as they flew north from here, Wolf, towards Central Israel.",

But what they are also showing with this fighting is that it is ongoing in various parts of northern Gaza. Even if they say that they have Gaza City encircled, they clearly are still fighting on the outskirts of Gaza City as well. Beit Hanoun is the northeastern most city in Gaza. And this battle that we are watching now tonight, which has clearly kicked into a higher gear, it began earlier today, Wolf.As we were standing in Sderot, not far from where Nic is today, we watched all day as there was a small arms fire, there were mortars being fired inside of Gaza, very likely by Hamas fighters and also artillery being fired from Israel into the city of Beit Hanoun and into other neighborhoods, other areas of Gaza, including it appears of the Jabalya refugee camp. And so, it's very clear that Israeli officials know that as much as they can encircle a city because of the network of underground tunnels that Hamas maintains, they also still face the danger of Hamas fighters popping up outside that city as well and in different areas. And clearly, they have not cleared all of the territory from the border with Gaza up until Gaza City. That act of fighting in Beit Hanoun tells us exactly that. And so, even if they are in Gaza City, they are clearly still dealing with Hamas fighters outside of Gaza City as well.",

Sources tell CNN that the Israeli airstrikes on the Jabalya refugee camp this week was particularly concerning and jarring to President Biden and some of his top aides, and that there is a growing recognition here at the White House that Israel really has limited time to continue its current operation in its current form before the outrage and the uproar about the humanitarian suffering reaches a tipping point. And to that end, we are told President Biden and some of his top national security officials have been urging their Israeli counterparts about what they see as this new reality with growing bluntness. We are also told that some of Biden's advisers believe that there are weeks, not months before the pressure on the U.S. government to publicly call for a ceasefire actually becomes untenable.Of course, we saw some of this playing out last night when the President himself was confronted by a protester at a private fundraiser. But for now, Wolf, U.S. officials are publicly refusing to call for a ceasefire, saying that what they would like to see are humanitarian pauses.

They've been firing into Israel, Northern Israel for the last several days consistently every day, but this was the highest pace we've certainly seen. In fact, our team witnessed the Iron Dome missile defense system take out two of those rockets above our heads, though one of them came down and hit the main street of Kiryat Shmona, one of the communities up here as well. And if those missile strikes, those rocket strikes from southern Lebanon were intended to warn Israel away from more aggressive ground operations in Gaza does not appear is what you're witnessing. What we're witnessing down the south tonight does not appear that that warning held or is holding Israel back.Another sign of Israel's preparations, we found ourselves in the midst of a Special Forces exercise today, live fire exercise in the north very close to the Syrian border. Some of the 70,000 IDF forces now deployed to the north to defend the northern border, participating in this exercise, in effect to keep their skills sharp, prepared to defend in the event of a greater incursion, greater involvement from Hezbollah. And I think you could also read that as a signal to those forces in Lebanon and Syria that Israel is ready if they do come. The final thing I'll say, Wolf, is a great deal of attention focus tomorrow on the words of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, he's going to be speaking to his followers in Lebanon, and around the region tomorrow for the first time since the start of these latest hostilities. Question many Israeli officials, U.S. intelligence officials are asking is, will he order his forces in effect Hezbollah to intervene in this war more aggressively than they already have? Those rockets we saw today, perhaps a sign, but we're going to be listening to those words very closely tomorrow.",

General Clark, when you see these extraordinary images coming in of this intense Israeli aerosol, the new ground incursion into Gaza, what do you think is taking place right now? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Oh, they're moving to an escalatory phase, Wolf. They're going to go deeper in, they may insert by helicopter to seize more ground. They're getting targets. They're not just bombing buildings without targets. So they're collecting communications. They're watching movements that they have targets, and they intend to get this over with. It's not going to be like Mosul, where would they take nine months, they're not going to do that.

Don't expect this war to go on just a few more days or even a few more weeks. They're thinking about months in order to get the job done. Their mission right now is twofold, they say. The first mission is to destroy Hamas as much as possible. Second mission is to get those hostages out safely from Gaza right now.Colonel Leighton, let me get your reaction to these incredible scenes we've seen over the past 45 minutes or so live here on CNN. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Wolf, I think the -- you know, what you're seeing is what exactly what General Clark describes what's the also be the precursor to some more ground movements. Nic Robertson mentioned a lot of smoke and we can see some of that here in these images. It looks to me like they might be using the cover of smoke to move some of their infantry forces into areas around Beit Hanoun, which is that northeastern town in Gaza. So, that might be a way for them to move forward, take care of that pocket of Hamas fighters, which are supposed to be in Beit Hanoun and then move from there into Gaza itself. We know also that they've surrounded Gaza at least or at least in the process of doing that. And if that is correct, then it seems as if these movements are part of a campaign that is designed to move forward very, very quickly. And in, you know, in spite of them preparing people for a long war, which is actually the right thing to do, they are also moving as quickly as they can on the military front in order to gain as much territory as possible and destroy as much of Hamas as possible.",

And immediately the Attorney General's Office, homed in on these financial statements that are at the heart of this case. They asked Eric Trump if he had any involvement in preparing the statements. He said he didn't. He said he wasn't even aware of them until this case came to fruition.Well, then the Assistant Attorney General asking the questions spent an hour and 15 minutes showing Eric Trump e-mails going back to 2010, showing him clips of his video deposition that was taken earlier this year where he was asked about these financial statements, trying to get him to concede that he had known about these statements. And then he did respond to questions from the company's controller about how to value some of these properties. An e-mail was shown with Eric Trump saying to put a value of about $200 million on a golf course. Well, Eric Trump dug in becoming agitated at one point visibly frustrated, raising his voice and saying that he fully understood that they had financial statements, but he said I had no involvement nor ever worked on my father's financial statements. So trying to draw a distinction between any financial information he might be providing, but these actual statements that are at the heart of the case that the judge has already ruled to be fraudulent. Now, his testimony is going to continue until tomorrow. And that's because at the end of the day, as the Attorney General's Office was about to ask him about his take -- his asserting his Fifth Amendment rights during a deposition several years ago, his lawyers objected. And one of Trumps attorneys Chris Kise had mentioned something to the judge referring to his clerk. And this is the clerk that has been at the center of the gag order where the former president has been fined for making references to her. Well, the judge got irritated by that suggested that Trump's attorney was misogynist for referencing her and said he might even expand this gag order. But Trump's lawyers said that they needed to make a record that they thought there was some bias in the case, because the judge was conferring with this law clerk.

And again, I think all of that, Wolf, is not really going to go as an effective way of lessening the sanction that may occur, because it's really still trying to litigate liability, saying we didn't really do anything wrong, even though the judge has already found fraud. So unless Trump is able to really get at this notion of we were involved and we made some honest mistakes here, and fine, you found this fraudulent, but we shouldn't be hit, would the heaviest of the fines or punishment.
