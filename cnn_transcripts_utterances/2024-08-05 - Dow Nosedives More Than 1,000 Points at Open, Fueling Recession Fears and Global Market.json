      "sentences": "Good morning, everybody. You were live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin on Wall Street. Just moments ago, the Dow opened down more than 1,000 points, fueling fears of a recession amid a global market meltdown. They could stop trading on Wall Street for the first time since the pandemic. Because of all of this already, Japan's stock market suffered its biggest one day loss ever, nose diving 12 percent. Joining me now to talk about this is KPMG Chief Economist Diane Swonk. Diane, fill us in. Why do you think this is happening right now? I mean, a lot of this, I guess, is a reaction to the Fed not cutting interest rates, a lot of impatience with that. But this sounds -- it looks a bit more serious than that. What's going on?",

      "sentences": "Well, uncertainty is our worst enemy and panic is the ultimate uncertainty out there, and that's what we're seeing. The Fed did discuss a rate cut last week when they met after that July employment report came out. My guess is they're feeling a bit remorse that they didn't pull the trigger on that rate cut in July.That doesn't mean we necessarily will go into recession. I think it's important that Chicago the Fed president has already come out, Austin Goolsbee, pointing out that the Fed has room to cut rates right now, and he thinks that rates are actually restrictive. That's important. It doesn't mean we'll necessarily get an intermediate move, but I think the financial markets do have it right that the Fed now finds itself in the worst case scenario for the moment, and that is that they've overtightened at this stage of the game. They can undo that without us falling fully into a recession, even though, technically, we saw the world triggered with that unemployment rate increase in the month of July.",

And the talk was, you know, perhaps the Fed was aiming for a soft landing. Now, it looks like it could be a hard landing. We just don't know. As you said a few moments ago, there's a lot of uncertainty. Is it possible the Fed could decide to do an emergency rate cut, to do some sort of, you know, emergency room-type procedure here?",

This is not a luxury the Fed has had in recent years, to be able to cushion the blow of this uncertainty. And right now, we still don't know that they'll actually do that, and I'm not betting on it, but it is an option for them. And you've got to believe they're willing to discuss it at this point in time, given the news that we've gotten since then.The Fed has been trying to hit its mark on a soft landing, and I think that's still very possible, given how much room they have to cut rates.

      "sentences": "I think there's significant fear across global markets. This is not just about the United States. You don't have a 12 percent drop in Japanese markets overnight without seeing a significant shakedown in the United States. This also began days before we got that jobs number on Friday. Remember, we saw a shakedown in tech stocks. A lot of the things that have been holding markets up for the whole year have seen a lot of profit-taking and people taking money out and concerns about that story.Then add in the fact that this is summertime. A lot of people aren't trading today, so that makes things a lot more volatile than it might have been too. I'm not taking attention away from the concerns about the U.S. economy, but there are a lot of different stories at play here. And I didn't hear what Diane was saying, but I do think the silver lining here is that the conversation has gone from if the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September to simply how much. And we have heard from one Fed member today who said, look, if we see excess volatility in the markets, and that's not this, by the way, he did say that the Fed will fix it. So, they are clearly watching this and will stand in support. But this is not just about concerns about the U.S. economy. It's a conflation of lots of different things. Keep that in mind. And, Jim, I will point out that we are several percentage points away from those circuit breakers being triggered in financial markets. So, while there is palpable fear out there, I'm hesitant to use the word panic even at these levels.",

But we'll keep an eye on it.Julia Chatterly, Diane Swonk, thank you both very much. We appreciate it. Other news, a lot happening this morning, today, Vice President Kamala Harris is facing the most consequential decision of her presidential campaign. Who will be running her vice presidential running mate? Tomorrow, Harris and her V.P. pick are expected to launch a week-long tour across seven key battleground states starting in Pennsylvania. At this hour, sources tell CNN, there are three frontrunners, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. And joining me now to talk about this is the founder of the Warning Podcast, Steve Schmidt. He served as a senior advisor to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, helped select former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate at that time. Steve, great to see you. I really appreciate you doing this. As I'm sure you're watching all of this with a lot on your mind, you know how important all of this is. What do you think is happening right now? STEVE SCHMIDT, SENIOR ADVISER, JOHN MCCAIN'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, you have two people that are getting ready for a huge disappointment and the other person is about to go through a portal that will profoundly change their life, their family's life for the rest of their lives. Whomever joins the ticket, if you are to read the polls tomorrow, for the first time in a long time, if the election were tonight, Kamala Harris would be president-elect, be 47th president of the United States. So, this is a monumental choice. Fate strikes people, George Herbert Walker Bush being picked as Ronald Reagan's vice president set in motion a chain of events that dominated American politics for decades. So, these choices matter, they're big and we wait and see whether it's Beshear, Shapiro or Mark Kelly, the astronaut.",

It is remarkable to see, as you were just saying a few moments ago, the way this race has changed in just the last week or so.

And I have to ask you Steve, because, I mean, I remember covering that 2008 campaign and I remember all too well what took place when the market started to crash in the middle of that cycle. We're seeing the stock market go down right now. John McCain made that comment. The fundamentals of the economy are strong. There was all of a sudden a momentum shift. I mean, things were looking good for Barack Obama, but they really started to look good for Barack Obama.When you woke up this morning and saw this business with the markets, what did you think? SCHMIDT:  Well, I think that was a housing market collapsing. That was something deeply structural in the economy. That's not what this is. This is an overheated stock market. On that day, when McCain was up by five points, we learned for the first time, at least I did, what a credit default swap was, and that's not what the issue is right now. The economy is strong.

What's your reaction to what's happening right now?REP. AMI BERA (D-CA):  Well, Jim, thanks for having me on. I think, you know, Steve said this is probably a market correction. You know, we forget that it's been an incredible run over the past few years, particularly the past decade. So, I think this was a market correction. As one of your speakers said, the Fed does have room to play around with interest rates, lower interest rates, and I think that's a good thing. So, they've got some tools to help soften this.",

BYRON DONALDS (R-FL):  This is really a phony controversy. I don't really care. Most people don't. But if we're going to be accurate, when Kamala Harris went into the United States Senate, it was A.P. that said she was the first Indian-American United States Senator. It was actually played up a lot when she came into the Senate. Now, she's running nationally. Obviously, the campaign has shifted.

She represents the United States and with this diverse nation of different cultures, religions, ethnicities. That's who we are and that's what makes us great.

I bet that is also factoring into some of the concerns about what's happening geopolitically around the world.So, let's calm things down. Let's try to avoid a regional conflict.

That's that sign and symptom of climate change that we keep tracking again and again.These warm ocean temperatures fueling stronger winds, is fueling more of that onshore flow. Look at the water. This is the Steinhatchee River, and it has just been aggravated, really just moving and sloshing up against these docks coming inland as well, or rustling through those trees. Now, a lot of these docks here are brand new, because they were destroyed and rocked around last year in Idalia, which was a Category 3 hurricane, but it made landfall only nine miles from here. So, locals were incredibly worried about what this could do as far as the storm surge because they literally just finished putting the bow on all of the kind of preparations that they did just from the last one with the new docks. And they have a couple of condos here that were totally flooded and up to even up to like the light switches. And they just gutted those out and fix those. So, something that we've been watching very closely is that storm surge and the incredibly heavy rain.
