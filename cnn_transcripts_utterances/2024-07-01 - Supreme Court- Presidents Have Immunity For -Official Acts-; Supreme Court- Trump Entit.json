Today the justices ruled that Donald Trump is entitled to some level of immunity from criminal prosecution for the actions that he took in the final days of his presidency. The decision was split 6-3 with the court's liberals dissenting.Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion saying, quote, \"The indictment's allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct. The president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law.\" That is the end of the quote there. Justice Sotomayor writing a scathing dissent on behalf of the court's three liberal justices saying, quote, \"Under the majority's reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy's SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold on to power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune, immune, immune, immune. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\" Today's decision is likely to shape not just Trump's legal and political future but also the presidency itself and it could have huge ramifications when it comes to the election in November. Joining us now is CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst, Joan Biskupic. And Joan, we also just got some reaction from the White House. All right. I think - Joan, can you hear me?",

So the case will go back to the trial judge here, Judge Tanya Chutkan, who at one point, Brianna, had wanted to hold a trial in March. That is not going to happen. She's eventually going to have to have a hearing and it would be a preliminary hearing before the trial to actually start separating out what of the conduct alleged by Special Counsel Jack Smith against the former president could be deemed part of his official actions or non-official.Now, the justices themselves did not parse those categories, but they gave some indications. For example, former President Trump is accused of talking to the Department of Justice and federal officials about coming up with his various fraud allegations, his ideas that there should be a new slate of electors, just all sorts of efforts to affect what was going to go leading up to January 6th. The majority suggested that conversations with federal officials are part of his official duties. But, however, some conversations with state government officials, remember, you know, dealing with the Georgia state officials, might possibly fall under these categories. I have to say, overall, though, they set a pretty high standard and said that a trial judge, in this case, Judge Chutkan, can't look at the president's motives at all, just try to divide the conduct and err on the side of finding official acts, Brianna.",

      "sentences": "They are. And so the big thing for them is that this is a success for them because now they likely won't have to go to trial before November. I mean, remember, they didn't actually win the argument that they were making. Donald Trump has said time and time again, it's actually a core thing that he says in rallies, that he believes presidents should have blanket immunity.They did not rule that presidents should have blanket immunity. They said for official acts, they should have immunity. And for unofficial acts, they should not. So what does this mean? Well, going forward, it means likely this case, the January 6th case, Judge Chutkan, is not going to be able to come to trial before the November election. This was really the last piece that they were worried about in terms of Donald Trump's legal issues and seeing them in trial before the November election. Obviously, the case in Florida is moving very slowly. That's the documents case. The case in Georgia has been completely halted. And we already saw the case in New York go through trialing - trial. That sentencing is next week. So this was the lone holdout. They know that Judge Chutkan had been really pushing this forward, that she wanted this to happen before the election. And just to give an understanding here, blanketed, of why they want this to not happen before the election, is that they believe if Donald Trump is elected, he can get rid of not only this case, but the other federal case in Florida. So that is why they were really hoping to push this forward. It also gives them more of this narrative that Biden's, quote-unquote, \"DOJ,\" Department of Justice, \"is out to get him.\" And in fact, he did have immunity all of this time. And this is the political argument that he's been saying that Biden is trying to come after him. Look, it turns out the Supreme Court ruled in his favor. And I would actually argue that politically, the stronger case for them is on Friday. And that's what we saw when they ruled that the DOJ had overstepped with some of the people who participated in January 6th. That actually helps them less legally. But politically, as they paint this big portrait that Joe Biden is in charge of all of Donald Trump's legal issues, which obviously there is no evidence of that at all, that that case goes more to that argument. But this legally helps him not have to face trial before the election.",

It's just not clear at this point, so the dust will have to settle. But this is a radical ruling that a president is immune, which is nowhere to be found in the Constitution or our history.

What he - what's not addressed in the opinion and what Nixon raised is what does his staff do in carrying out his orders, are they too immune now?

But for now, for the most part, most elected officials, Democrats, are staying quiet because they want to see data and polling. They want to see what kind of numbers come in, what kind of research comes in that shows that the president could potentially be harmful for down-ballot races. This congressman I spoke to said Congress is our firewall and that if data comes in that shows that he's just not going to lose the presidency, but he's going to lose the House, that's the point where the dam could really break and we might start seeing more Democrats saying, yes, it might be time for us to move on to plan B. I think this is just a reminder that this debate performance that was such a shock to so many Democrats was not just about control of the White House, but control of government overall.

He played Donald Trump. Anita Dunn is his longtime communications advisor. Ron Klain, of course, prepared him for the debates. But we are told the President has expressed support for them.
