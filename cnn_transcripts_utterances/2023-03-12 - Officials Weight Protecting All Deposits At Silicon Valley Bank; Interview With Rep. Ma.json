I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now federal regulators are scrambling to prevent a sudden bank failure from triggering a wider financial meltdown. CNN has learned that the FDIC has prepared to step in and operate Silicon Valley Bank to ensure its account holders can pay their employees in the wake of Friday's sudden collapse of that bank. That's according to a source with details on briefings between Treasury officials and lawmakers. It's just one scenario being floated at this hour with just hours left until financial markets reopen for Monday trading. Last hour I spoke with a woman who uses Silicon Valley Bank to run her small business. She says she hasn't heard yet from any bank or federal officials about the status of her money. Here's what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But there are also other steps that are officials are considering at this moment. And that includes trying to find ways to protect the uninsured deposits. The FDIC only insures currently up to $250,000 at a bank. And the large majority, more than 90 percent of the money held at Silicon Valley Bank is above that threshold. Now one thing that officials are talking about is the potential to use the FDIC's systemic risk exception. There other items that are also on their plate currently being weighed.

But they are interested in making sure that the depositors are OK, customers of the bank are OK, because those are customers that are often small businesses. They might be payroll companies that service small businesses who didn't even know that the service that they were using was funneled through this now troubled bank.

I want to read you a bit of the statement which said that, after consultation with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and also President Biden, quote, \"Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors. \"Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13th. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.\" The statement goes on to say that they are extending the same protections to those depositors with money at Signature Bank, which is banks in New York, and additionally, they said that shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders will not be protected nor will be senior management at this company. Now this comes as they have really been trying to seek this resolution to the issues that depositors are facing in the wake of the closing of Silicon Valley Bank. About 90 percent of depositors had money over $250,000 which was the previous limit that the FDIC insured leaving many questioning what exactly they would do and how payroll would be met heading into this week.

More rain is expected to his the hard-hit Pajaro River in the coming days. That could make the situation there much more dangerous. The county says those new evacuation orders could come sometime today. There have been close to 200 rescues from flooding in that area. About 15 million people remain under flood watches in California and Nevada.In Bakhmut, Ukraine, a brutal standoff continues as Russian and Ukrainian forces battle for control of that area. The head of the Wagner Group, the Russian private military company admits that Ukrainian forces are fighting fiercely for every meter. A commander for the Ukrainian army says logistical routes in and out of Bakhmut are still functioning, meaning the supply of ammunition remains open for defending forces. Joining us now with more on all of this is retired U.S. Army Colonel Eugene Vindman, brother of someone you also recognize Alexander Vindman. There they are right there. But Eugene Vindman was born in Ukraine as the twin brother as I said of Alexander Vindman, whose central testimony was part of Donald Trump's first impeachment trial. Eugene is now investigating war crime in Ukraine as part of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group created by the U.S., U.K., and E.U. And Colonel, great to see. I know you were just in Ukraine for the United for Justice conference in Lviv. COL. YEVGENY \"EUGENE\" VINDMAN (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Hey, Jim.",
