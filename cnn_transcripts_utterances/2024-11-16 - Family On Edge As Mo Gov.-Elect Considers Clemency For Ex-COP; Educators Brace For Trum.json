I mean, the true meaning of staying woke is a call to be mindful of institutional racism and discrimination in the U.S. The DEI stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. But now there are a lot of conservatives who use them as negative catch-all phrases for progressive values they just don't like. Do this. Google News articles mentioning \"woke\" and you'll see two types headlines. The claim that Democrats lost the presidential election for being too woke, and the president elects cabinet picks vowing to end wokeness. One of those picks is Pete Hegseth. He was a Fox News anchor a week ago. He's also an army veteran who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. And now he's President-Elect Trump's pick to be Secretary of Defense. I want you to listen here to his message. This is from an interview released last week. It was recorded before the election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And since the military became an all- volunteer force in '73 black service members have been overrepresented compared to the civilian labor force.Now there are disparities. CNN looked at Department of Defense data from 2020. The stats then showed that black service members were disproportionately underrepresented among military officers. And they represented 19 percent of all enlisted personnel, but just 9 percent of officers. It was only in 2020 that the Senate confirmed General Charles Q. Brown to be the chief of Staff of the Air Force, that made him the first black service member to lead a U.S. military branch ever more than 70 years after the services were desegregated. He spoke about his role in history before being confirmed and in reaction to the death of George Floyd that same year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GEN. CHARLES Q. BROWN, U.S. AIR FORCE: I'm thinking about how my nomination provides some hope, but also comes with a heavy burden. I can't fix centuries of racism in our country, nor can I fix decades of discrimination that may have impacted members of our Air Force. I'm thinking about how I can make improvements personally, professionally, and institutionally so that all Airmen, both today and tomorrow, appreciate the value of diversity and can serve in an environment where they can reach their full potential.

Is there a case, and if so, make it for diversity not as, you know, opponents of DEI characterize it as some sentimental social justice, warm fuzzy, but as reinforcing the strength of the military?CAPT. MARY TOBIN, VETERAN FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY: Absolutely. Good morning, Victor. Thank you for having me. I think the case has already been made for the strength of diversity. We see throughout our military history, thousands, millions of minorities, those who would be considered a part of the woke crew serving in the military, and not only support positions, but also those in combat units, combat situations. I think of my fellow women, my sisters in arms, who have been trained as rangers, who have been trained in Naval special warfare operations, who are right now serving at various levels within our military with valor and distinction. I think of my West Point sister, Captain Lindsey Heigler, who received a award for valor supporting special operations in Afghanistan. And I think of my own service being the only woman in field artillery units and combat aviation units. And so the case has already been made, and I would hope that Mr. Hegseth would consider how he speaks about over half the population of our amazing country serving and what that would imply if you would take us out of that equation. I think our service is too valuable. It has already been demonstrated, and I think that it demonstrates a commitment to our country, and we need to ensure that we do not lose that national security imperative.",

There have been amazing studies done by Rand around the importance of women and minorities serving in our now complex military scenarios and operations around the world. Women, frankly, have elevated our ability to collect intelligence, to connect to communities, diverse communities around the world, and have served as effective warfighters.I think that Mr. Hegseth, should he be confirmed, will have access more access to that information. And I hope that as a leader of over 3 million employees in the world's finest military, that he will consider the impact of his statements not only on morale within the ranks, but he will consider his impact on our national security. I think the military is an incredible vehicle for not only commitment and patriotism to this country, but also as a way to demonstrate that we are all Americans and we are all a part of this experiment and we should all take responsibility in that commitment.",

So, as you noted, my last project was called \"James &amp; Nikki.\" It was highlighting conversations between James Baldwin and poet activist Nikki Giovanni. What we have been finding in the industry and through the strategic partnership I did with Golden State Entertainment, which is a wing of the Golden State Warriors, young people that were receiving James Baldwin and Nikki Giovanni as entertainment and curriculum with what we're doing with music outside of the walls of the schools, they weren't getting that culturally relevant curriculum inside the walls of many of the schools, which you duly noted, our schools are in Chicago, 47 percent Latino Hispanic, 34 percent African American. I wanted to make sure that culturally rich curriculum that, you know, from \"Glory\" to \"Jesus Walks\" to \"James &amp; Nikki,\" this is what children are interested in when it comes to education, music, quality, arts, which is always the first thing to get cut in a budget.
