      "sentences": "All right, welcome back.CNN has learned that authorities here in the U.S. have obtained intelligence in recent weeks about a plot from Iran to try to assassinate Donald Trump. A development that led the Secret Service to increase security around the former president. And this was ahead of that Saturday rally. It's important to note that there is no indication that there would-be assassin who attempted to kill Trump on Saturday was connected to this Iranian plot. But the existence of the intelligence threat from a hostile foreign agency and enhanced security raises new questions about the security lapses at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and how a 20-year-old man managed to get access to a nearby rooftop and fire those shots that injured the former president. Joining me now to discuss, the former U.N. ambassador, Trump's former national security advisor, John Bolton, who also was the subject of an alleged Iranian assassination plot. Mr. Bolton, good morning.",

He was a terrorist. He had killed Americans. He deserved exactly what he got. The Iranians, in response, decided that they were going to take some measure of retaliation. They've specifically mentioned Trump and a number of others of us since - since Soleimani's execution in January of 2020. So - so, this is - this has been a continuing problem. It - it's kind of surprising to me at least that it's arisen now.

And unfortunately for them, fortunately for me, they were talking to a confidential human source of the FBI.So, this is - this - these threats by Iran or not internet chatter, this is - this is the real thing.

But I can't remember an election where the numbers have been this bad for an incumbent president, this close to an election. The approval rating is sort of low to mid to high 30s. That's historically an area where presidents never win re-election. The thing about the president though is, he has always overcome the odds. So, that may be something that's playing into his own psyche when he sees this and his belief that he can still beat Trump.And the other thing to say is that Trump nationally is also very unpopular. It's not like there is a younger, new Republican candidate that is surging to public attention. Everybody knows what it was like to have Donald Trump as president. So, I think that maybe some of the things that are factoring in, but this, you know, this close to the election it looks terrible.",

It's almost immaterial at this point because the pathways for the president or so limited versus the pathways for the former president, Donald Trump.So, I mean, I just think about this in terms of optionality. And the - the Trump campaign's challenge, in my view, is going to be figuring out, where do they allocate resources? There's so many places, if you look at the polling now, where they could put points on the board, versus for the Biden campaign, it really does still come down to those midwestern states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. If they're unable to clear through those states, I just don't know where else they can go at this point. So, the conversation about places like Minnesota is interesting. But ultimately, like whether they win Minnesota or not is not the issue. Because if they're winning in Minnesota, they're winning everywhere else. So, I just think it's about pathways.

In the last two cycles, there's been one, Susan Collins in Maine.
