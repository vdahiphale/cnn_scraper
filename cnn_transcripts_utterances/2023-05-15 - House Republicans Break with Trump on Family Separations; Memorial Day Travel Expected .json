And it was just one of many indicators on very controversial policies that the former president has not changed from where he was. And it's also a reminder that, you know, a lot of Republicans, we hear, well, I really liked Donald Trump's policies, but not his -- his sense of chaos that comes with a Trump candidacy or a Trump presidency.

Here's what she said is sort of the reality as she sees it for the American people.Let's play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For a national standard, I think we have to tell the American people the truth. In order to do a national standard, you'd have to have a majority of the House, 60 Senate votes, and a president. We haven't had 60 pro-life senators in a hundred years. So, the idea that a Republican president could ban all abortions is not being honest with the American people, any more than a Democrat president could ban these pro-life laws in the states. So, let's be honest with the American people and say, let's find national consensus. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You mentioned that one lawmaker, Representative Tricia Cotham, she's from here in Mecklenburg County, who switched from Democratic Party to Republican Party last month. There are four lawmakers, though, that the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, has basically put in the position of this public full-court press he has going against them in this pressure campaign, attempting to get their constituents to email them, go out and speak with them, try and get in contact with them to ask them to sustain the governor's veto that he signed over the weekend.Now, those four lawmakers, one is a state senator, Senator Michael Lee, and three members of the house, Representatives John Bradford, Ted Davis, and Tricia Cotham. Now, Senator Lee and Representative Bradford have already come out basically refuting this pressure campaign from the governor, saying that they don't think their past positions are in conflict with this current bill. But the other two lawmakers, Davis and Cotham, haven't really spoken about this. In fact, when CNN tried contacting them, Cotham didn't get back to us and Davis said he had no comment. Davis is important because, Kaitlan, he did not vote for the bill. He was absent the day that happened. And, of course, Cotham, a former Democrat, before she switched parties, was a proponent of abortion access. So much so that she was actually a sponsor of a bill earlier this session, just a few months ago, that would have codified Roe v. Wade into law here in the state of North Carolina. Now, the governor has said that even though Republicans have pitched this as a compromise bill, that there is so much in the bill, beyond just banning most abortions after 12 weeks, that it would essentially make it extremely difficult for people to obtain first trimester abortions, not to mention, of course, afterward. Now, there are those exceptions for rape and incest victims up to 20 and 24 weeks. But there's also other things in there, including additional paperwork, additional regulations, and reporting requirements that they say would make doing -- performing abortions in North Carolina extremely difficult.
