Bye.Now, walking down the streets of New York City -- imagine this -- and then you hear, move over, Mr. Mayor, we're here for your cellphones. That's tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" So, it's America's largest city and running it comes with, well, a lot of attention. Maybe more attention than New York City Mayor Eric Adams even bargained for. A federal investigation into campaign fundraising now appears to be inching that much closer to the mayor of New York. And by the way, in a very dramatic and a very public way. CNN learned the FBI agents seized Adams's two phones and iPad, not today, but several days ago, on Monday. Sources telling us that agents approached the mayor on the streets of New York, asked his security detail to step aside, climbed into his SUV with him, and then took the man's devices. This is all happening days after the FBI, as you well know, raided the home of Adams's chief fundraiser. Now, investigators are trying to determine whether the mayor's 2021 campaign received any illegal donations from Turkish nationals or the Turkish government. Now, for his part, Mayor Adams insists that he has absolutely nothing to hide, and his attorney is out with a statement, saying this -- quote -- \"The mayor has not been accused of any wrongdoing and continues to cooperate with the investigation.\" Now, if anyone knows the law, should be Eric Adams. Remember, he himself is a former police captain. And earlier this week, the law applies, he said, across the board. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A week after somebody who dealt with fundraising for him had her home actually raided. He is now, of course, trying to distance himself from the investigation.

They could have asked for him to surrender the phone rather than stop him. They could have subpoenaed him instead of stopping him and surprising him in such a manner.

Why do they go running in to, you know, Mar-a-Lago to take Donald Trump's things, but the mayor, they allow him to cooperate, they allow him to -- when he feels like it's hand things over? So, I think it could be an optics issue. The government, we have a very robust federal government.

This investigative technique was used to see who the mayor would reach out to or who was reaching out to the mayor, obviously, with respect to the information now knowing that multiple search warrants were executed against his chief fundraiser. And so, we would always be interested in seeing who would be burning up the mayor's phone or who he would reach out to. Or given the execution of those previous search warrants, they then were able to obtain additional credible, verifiable, and corroborated evidence directly related back to the mayor, and this is why they executed this these search warrants against the mayor of the city of New York.
