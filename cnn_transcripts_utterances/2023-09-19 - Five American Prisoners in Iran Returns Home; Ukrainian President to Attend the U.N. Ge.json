Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi were both arrested on espionage charges in 2018. The two other freed Americans haven't been named.

So on the one hand, this was an effort to push forward a larger piece of diplomacy, and it came down to this deal. Now, the United States has been very reticent in the past about dealing with and paying to get people back. It has done it. This has been, this has happened before. Jason Rezaian was one of those $400 million the Iranians got their hands on, which was their money that they paid for weapons, but the same sort of point in case. And if you take that example, Jason Rezaian and four others several years ago, 400 million, this time five, six billion, yes, it is absolutely correct to say that if you give hostage takers money for hostages. They will think that they can do it again and that they were up the odds. But there have been plenty of cases where the United States hasn't done that. Look at ISIS with those captive NGOs and journalists in Syria. The United States didn't pay for their release and some of them died. The French hostages held there were released and the understanding is that their payments were made. And France typically does pay in these cases. So it is a poison chalice, but it does appear that in this case, despite what the administration is saying, there is an effort to sort of to try to improve or reset the relation in a certain way, even though more sanctions have gone on yesterday even.",

Both leaders are among those delivering remarks today. U.S. President Joe Biden is also set to hold a bilateral meeting with the UN Secretary General. World leaders will be discussing a host of issues, from climate change to the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be attending the annual meeting in person for the first time. The leaders of Russia and China won't be there, but Russia's foreign minister says the two countries will continue well coordinated work at the UNGA. The Ukrainian president is set to address the General Assembly in those coming hours, and he'll be seeking more support for his country amid the ongoing war with Russia. On Monday, Mr. Zelenskyy visited Ukrainian soldiers undergoing treatment and rehabilitation in New York. He also honored some soldiers with awards. As Ukrainian President Zelenskyy visits, visit does kick off in the U.S., Ukrainian military officials say they're still gaining ground back on the battlefield, breaking through Russian defenses in some areas in the east. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ground combat in a place reduced to a wasteland by months of relentless fighting. Ukrainian forces released this video saying it shows their troops advancing near Bakhmut on the Eastern Front. They're coming, cover me, the soldier says, as machine gun fire rings out and later mortars rain down. The Ukrainians say their gains here are small but important. Firing heavy weapons at the Russians, including rocket barrages from combat helicopters, Kyiv trying to show they have the upper hand, a presidential adviser tells me. Let's not forget that we are talking about the army that everyone was afraid of only yesterday, he says. Today, we're talking about a Ukrainian offensive in different directions. The Russians eager to show they are holding on. Russian state media releasing this video of Putin's soldiers in the ruins of Bakhmut claiming they'll hold off Ukrainian assaults. We can see them in the forest line. They're trenches. We're working on those targets, he says. We shell them with our mortars. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy embarks on his visit to the U.S., both for the U.N. General Assembly, but also to meet with President Biden and members of Congress, the Ukrainians are urging the U.S. to keep up its support, saying, aside from the longer-range ATACMS tactical missiles to hit Russian supply lines, they urgently need a lot more artillery ammo, as their forces are heavily outgunned even as they try to advance. Speaking to \"60 Minutes,\" Zelenskyy highlighting the sacrifices Ukraine is making. We're defending the values of the whole world, he says, and the Ukrainian people are paying the highest price. We are truly fighting for our freedom. We are dying. A tough and slow grind on the ground as Kyiv's military tries to inch forward, vowing they won't stop until they've ousted the Russians from all of Ukraine's territory.

And while Zelenskyy has been projecting that some of the reasons the counteroffensive may not be making the progress at the pace some would like. It's because of weapons and a lack of aid and the fact that they need more aid, more weaponry.Clearly, we are also seeing a lot of political reshuffling back home in Ukraine. And that may speak to a tacit acknowledgement, almost, that perhaps there is something in the Ukrainian leadership that they have not quite got right in this counteroffensive, given they are reshuffling all of the people that you mentioned, everyone but one of the deputy defense ministers has been dismissed. That's quite a lot of the ministry to be reshuffling and to be taking this ministry in its future direction. And again, as we're seeing Zelenskyy arriving in New York now projecting to the world confidence Ukraine making progress in the counteroffensive. They're listing these villages recently that they've recaptured from the Russians. All of this is a projection that they have been making a lot of positive progress. And yet clearly the leadership is clearly under some questioning. And it's interesting that while we're talking about all this weaponry we've seen in the last day, Germany announcing EUR400 million worth of aid going into Ukraine and also for weaponry not those long-range terrorist missiles that they wanted. Likewise, we still don't have word on whether the U.S. will be giving the missiles Fred mentioned earlier those attack homes that they desperately want. Clearly, Zelenskyy's message mantra here is we need certain weaponry and that weaponry will help make us make more progress in this counteroffensive particularly as we head into these winter months, but clearly back home the leadership is under some question. And it's worth noting as well that as we head into these winter months, it's not just that the weather gets colder and this weaponry is needed and the direction of this military is important. It's also that Russia may be going to target again the energy infrastructure. And that is the primary concern. We saw this last winter. If they target that, that is going to have a huge impact on civilian and civilian life in Ukraine this winter as well.",

They partially blamed for the scope of the damage from the recent deadly flooding. Residents blamed government officials for not giving enough warning to residents to evacuate in time. Critics are also highlighting the fact that experts knew that as early as last year, the city was vulnerable to floods and the dams' required maintenance.Reuters reports Libya's acting Prime Minister in eastern Libya dismissed all members of Derna's municipal council and is called for an investigation. Meanwhile, volunteers are working to dig large mass graves to handle the thousands of bodies found since last week. Derna's hospitals and morgues were overwhelmed in the days following the floods, with more than 2,500 people buried. Close to 4,000 people have been reported dead, according to the World Health Organization, and thousands more are still missing. One of the three cemeteries dedicated to burying flood victims took in more than 1,000 bodies just last week. They had to drastically increase the size of the graves due to the decomposed and bloated state of some bodies. Now the European Union has released EUR5.2 million in humanitarian aid for those affected by the flooding in Libya. In a statement on Monday, the E.U. said the funds will be channeled through partners already active in the country to lend more assistance with shelter, food, water, hygiene and more. Eight member states have contributed aid to Libya so far. The E.U. says they've allocated nearly EUR6 million in aid in the wake of that disaster.
