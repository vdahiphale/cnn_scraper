And that's what you see. And we can point to our early vote totals, where we -- let's look in Nevada. We just saw that being covered recently. For the first time in history, Republicans lead the early vote in Nevada. That's never happened since the early vote started in Nevada. Let's look at Arizona, where we had a tremendous early vote lead in Maricopa County. We have a 22-point edge in Maricopa County, Republicans, with respect to their early vote. Let's go to Pennsylvania. Republicans have made up a 20-vote gap on early vote against the Democrats from four years ago. So when you look at the data, you know, we have confidence that the organization is winning, that the outsourcing was the right decision.

They would essentially have to run the table and have very few pickup opportunities. Really just Texas is the one opportunity, and that's to be seen as a long shot. Just to keep the Senate at 50-50, that's very difficult. The House is an interesting situation as well. Because there are so few true toss-up districts in the House. Maybe eight, maybe a dozen or so. A lot of them are in New York, in California, and the suburbs and the like. Typically, House races go with the presidency. But given where these are and how few there are, perhaps there's a split verdict among voters, where the president may not have a House in his or her same party.
