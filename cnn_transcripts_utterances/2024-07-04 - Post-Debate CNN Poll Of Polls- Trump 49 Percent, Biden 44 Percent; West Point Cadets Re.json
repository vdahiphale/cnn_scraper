Democratic lawmakers and people close to the president tell CNN that the Biden campaign is asking for time to digest incoming polling data to figure out their path forward if there is a different one to take.CNN's new post-debate poll of polls shows Trump with a five-point lead nationally, 49 percent to 44 percent. That's the widest margin that he's had all year. Joining me now is Republican pollster Frank Luntz. Thank you so much for being here. Happy Fourth to you. You track the numbers, you do focus groups. What are you seeing right now about the reality of the way that people who are the most likely to vote and have the most impact view the race right now?",

And, obviously, we're looking at a reset of the environment right now. And the question is, how low does the president go?We had a change of about 3 percent overall. And it's not that Trump went up, it's that Biden went down. I think that that is what's most significant. That Trump's numbers are staying relatively stable. And Biden's numbers have weakened. The question I have to ask is, would anyone do any better than him? And has everything now been baked in with the two of them sitting side by side that basically it's going to stay this way to the end of the election? I can't answer that right now.",

A source say -- mentioning to me that she has joined many of these calls between Biden and Netanyahu in the past. But, of course, it's interesting given the current political dynamics at play here in the U.S. But this call between President Biden and Netanyahu comes at a time when Israeli officials have indicated that there could be some positive movement relating to getting to a hostage deal. Netanyahu has told his team that negotiators should be entering into conversations to talk about the framework for this plan. It comes at a time when you'll remember back in May, President Biden said it is time for this war to end, and he had laid out this three part proposal for Israel and Hamas to pursue. Talks had stalled out for a bit. [12:45:10] But over the weekend, I'm told, the U.S. presented some language that they had hoped might bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas. This specifically focused on the gap that exists between phase one and phase two. Phase one would call for a six-week ceasefire and the release of some hostages. And while in that phase one phase, they would begin negotiations to try to get to phase two. Our understanding is that the language that the U.S. proposed specifically tried to deal with the scope. And what the -- those negotiations and phase one would cover. So we will see what else emerged -- emerges from the Israeli side, as well as Hamas. At a time where this is a significant movement, there is no guarantee that a deal will finally be reached. There is a possibility that the two sides through their mediators may be beginning in negotiations in earnest. Of course, this all comes as President Biden is fighting for his own political survival back here at home. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has been a source of tension with some members of the president's party, especially when you think about young voters who are displeased with President Biden's handling of this conflict. So we will see what else emerges in this coming days as Israeli officials have expressed some type of cautious optimism following this latest response from Hamas.",
