      "sentences": "Hello and welcome, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we begin with the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Iranian-backed Houthi militants are now warning they will retaliate after the U.S. and the U.K. launched huge strikes against the group in Yemen overnight. The western allies say they hit more than 60 targets spread over 16, different locations in response to months of attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea. It is important to note this all links back to October the 7th. It's been almost 100 days since the brutal attack by Hamas in Israel, which is, you know, led Israel to launch a full-scale offensive inside Gaza. Well, that offensive prompt to the Houthis to begin attacking ships with any connection to Israel in the Red Sea. What they say is a sign of solidarity with the Palestinian people. For weeks now, countries around the world have been demanding an end to this Houthi aggression, warning there would be consequences. And that brings us to today, military action by the U.S. and the U.K. Reaction has been pouring in from around the world, which we'll get to later in the show. But these were the scenes early on the streets of Yemen's capital, as you can see there, Sana'a. Thousands are showing their support for the Houthis as well as the Palestinian people. To unpick all of this, I want to go to our diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, who joins us this hour from Tel-Aviv. And Nic, before we even start talking bigger picture here, just tell us first of all about these strikes and the targets in Yemen.",

The Houthis say that five military personnel were killed and six injured in those strikes. There haven't been any reports of civilians injured in these strikes. More than -- well, the Houthis say 73, there were 73 strikes that U.S. and U.K. say there were about 60 different targets at a number of different sites. We don't have, if you will, and sort of military pilots that battle damage assessment from the U.S. and the U.K. about their success or not, but the Houthis have made it very clear they will respond.",

While leaders across the Middle East have beencondemning the U.S. and U.K. attacks, of course, Iran, which backs the Houthis, you heard Nic say there, quote, \"strongly slam the strikes\", saying they \"breach Yemen sovereignty and territorial integrity\". Saudi Arabia, which only in recent months engaged in peace talks, if you remember, with the Houthis after years of war, urge restraint and to avoid escalation. And Kuwait's Foreign Ministry says it's following the developments in the region with quote -- excuse me, \"great concern\". For a closer look at the developments in the region, I want to bring in Colin Clarke; he's a Senior Research Fellow at the Soufan Center, where he focuses on terrorism, international security as well as geopolitics. Colin, welcome back to the show. Let's start on these strikes, both U.S. as we've heard and the U.K. say there were -- strikes were in self-defense. But they appear to have been designed at least from what I think -- to try to degrade the Houthi capabilities with a secondary objective of trying to impose some real costs on them.

Leaders across the region have criticized the strikes from Iran to Kuwait to Jordan. Massive crowds have gathered to demonstrate in Sana'a, as you can see there. That's a rebel-held Yemeni capital. By contrast though, European leaders have thrown their support behind the Western strikes. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the strikes were predicated on self-defense, blaming the Houthis for targeting shipping vessels. Germany's foreign office echoed that sentiment describing the Houthis attack in Red Sea as illegal. They call the British and American strikes an attempt to prevent further attacks and to stabilize the region. Belgium's foreign minister expressed her support, too, though she was careful to note that all parties need to work, \"to avoid any spillover.\" For more on the view from the U.S. and the U.K., Natasha Bertrand joins us at the Pentagon, as well as Matthew Chance for us in London. Natasha, to you first, the Houthis are vowing, as we've just mentioned at the top of the hour to retaliate. In a statement, they said, \"We will confront America, make it kneel down, and burn its battleships and all its bases and everyone who operates it -- with it, no matter the cost.\" That was a statement from the Houthis spokesman. How is the U.S.? How is the Pentagon, Natasha, preparing for this sort of retaliation? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's clearly very strong language. The question is whether they actually have the capabilities still to back up that strong language. The U.S. says that they did do significant damage to the Houthis infrastructure. They targeted command and control nodes, they targeted weapons, depots, and they haven't been able to provide us with an exact percentage yet of just how much of the Houthi infrastructure they destroyed, but they said that it was notable. Now, the question is, is the U.S. going to conduct these kinds of attacks every time we see the Houthis kind of regroup and launch missile and drone strikes on Red Sea shipping? Because they have indicated, as you said, that they are not going to stop doing this, that they are doing this in solidarity with the Palestinians. And then basically, as long as the U.S. and the Western world continue to support Israel, then they will continue to launch these attacks. That is not something the U.S. has addressed at this point, although they have said that they reserve the right to continue these attacks if the Houthis also continue theirs, but at the same time, they say that they want to avoid escalation. And so it's really tricky balance that the U.S. has to conduct right now, especially because the Houthis are backed by Iran. And one of the big questions is whether Iran is going to get involved in a more significant way if the U.S. and the U.K., for example, continue attacking Houthi infrastructure and Houthi targets in the coming days and weeks.",

But I think that the United Kingdom was the only other country, apart from the United States, that sent warplanes on this attack. And so it was very much a U.S.-led operation with participation in the air by the United Kingdom and some support for some other countries as well. At least four British warplanes took off from a British air base on the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean. There was a fuel tanker that took off as well, because it's a long way. It's a couple of thousand miles as a roundtrip to these targets in Yemen. And so the warplanes had to be refueled on the way. But because it was a U.S.-led operation, the British are very much, you know, kind of echoing the U.S. line, which is that this was a strike that took place, it was a series of strikes that took place in self-defense. Rishi Sunak saying that, the British Prime Minister saying that during a visit to Ukraine earlier on today. There's also been a little bit of criticism, quite a lot of criticism actually in Britain, from opposition parties here, because this was a decision to stage this military action that didn't involve parliament, the whole government. Opposition parties are saying that the parliament should have been recalled, and there should have been a discussion in parliament before military action against another country in the Middle East involving Britain was launched. In defense of that, the British government, Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, saying that these strikes were carefully targeted and they were limited. They're also saying, British officials, that there aren't any further strikes that are planned at the moment. Although, as Natasha was just saying, both the U.S. and the U.K. are reserving the right to carry out more military action if the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea continue.",

And Bahrain,we know, is one of the countries that ultimately decided to support the U.S. in these strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. And so while at the same time, the Secretary of State was trying to contain the conflict when it comes to Israel and Gaza, he was also trying to build this coalition of countries that would support the U.S. and ultimately the U.K. in this operation to degrade Houthi targets, because while they don't want this conflict to escalate and broaden and include new fronts, for example, with other Iran-backed groups, particularly Hezbollah joining the war, they view this Houthi situation a bit differently. They view it within the context of defending international trade, global commerce, defending commercial vessels in the Red Sea. And particularly, the U.S. revealed something new last night, which is that they do believe that the Houthis began directly targeting U.S. vessels on Tuesday. And that was really one of the last straws here that prompted the U.S. to respond. So, all of this is very carefully framed within the context of self-defense. But I think that you're going to see that continue to be challenged as the Houthis regroup and continue to launch their attacks.",

In the last few minutes, we've heard Iran condemning the airstrikes that have been carriedout by the U.K. in Yemen, the permanent mission of Iran to the United States raising a statement saying this unwarranted war violates Yemen's sovereignty, international law, the U.N. Charter and Security Council resolutions, jeopardizing regional peace, as well as security. Goes -- it goes on to say the foreign minister here, instead of a military attack on Yemen, the White House should immediately stop all military security cooperation with Tel Aviv against the people of Gaza and the West Bank so their security returns to the entire region. Now that I've still got you both, Natasha, let me pick up on that with you if you're still with us. How does -- how -- the fear I'm guessing right now is bringing Iran into the fold. How much of a concern is that to the United States, given that these are Iran -- the Houthis are Iran-backed?",

This is not something that the Iranians have simply been standing by and not been involved in. In addition to providing the Houthis with weaponry and equipment, they have also been actively giving them tactical intelligence, which has allowed them to carry out these strikes. And so the U.S. is concerned that that role could actually expand even further, of course, if this conflict continues to escalate -- the back and forth between the West and the Houthis, kind of this tit for tat retaliation going on now. So, it's definitely something that they're weighing every day.",

The -- there has been advice from maritime security companies for vessels to pause transits for three days. The INTERTANKO, the world's representative group for independent tanker owners, have recommended that transits are paused. And I'm hearing from ship owners that vessels laden with oil that's destined for Europe, they've been asked to pause at the deviation point where they make a decision whether to go around the Cape or whether they go through the Red Sea. And so really everybody's waiting to see what if any retaliatory action is taken. Of course, we heard about three hours ago that the Houthis did make another missile attack unsuccessful at a nearby tanker, which we've been able to identify. It's actually carrying Russian crude that was loaded in Ust-Luga and it was heading for Asia or China. So, either the Houthis are indiscriminate or they have wrong information because this tanker, Khalissa, was sold by the U.K. owner about five months ago. So it really is a very fast moving situation.",
