If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.A federal appeals panel appears inclined to restore the limited gag order in former U.S. President Donald Trump's federal election subversion case. A three-judge panel is hearing the case on an expedited schedule and are expected to issue a ruling soon but the exact timing is unclear. Family members of some of the hostages being held by Hamas are pushing the Israeli government to do more to bring their loved ones back. And there were intense exchanges, where they met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of the Israeli war cabinet in Tel Aviv on Monday. U.S. officials say negotiators are close to a deal to release some of the hostages Hamas adopted on October the 7th, but the caution the details are still being worked out. And as CNN's Alex Marquardt reports, sources tell us the deal in the works could leave quite a few hostages still in Hamas's hands. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "There is a sense of optimism about the hostage negotiations that we haven't heard before U.S. officials indicating that they are closer to a deal than ever before. Now, officials do continue to caution that things are extremely fluid that they can change quickly. And of course, that the fighting in Gaza does continue. But the White House's John Kirby says that they believe the negotiations are quote, close to the end.Take a listen. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON (on-camera): And we believe we're closer than we've ever been. So, we're hopeful. But, but there's still work to be done. And nothing is done until it's all done. We are laser focused on the American citizens that we know we're being held hostage and we want them out all of them. Everybody should be out now. But here we are in a negotiation. And we're getting closer to the end. We believe that negotiation. So again, I'm, I'm going to be careful. MARQUARDT (voice-over): So, what would a deal look like? Well, in the latest draft of an agreement, Sources tell CNN that Hamas would likely release 50 hostages, women and children. And that would happen over a four-to-five-day period during which time Israel would stop its military operations in Gaza. We understand Hamas has also demanded hundreds of trucks of humanitarian aid per day to go into the Gaza Strip. So, there are questions over how that can be implemented. And there are also questions of whether Israel would also release Palestinian prisoners at the same time and how many of them? (on-camera): So the gaps are getting narrower, and this release could come very soon. But remember, even if 50 hostages are released by Hamas in Gaza, around 80 percent of them would still remain.
