That's right, the meeting yesterday came after Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, called on the University of Pennsylvania's Board of Trustees to meet.To discuss whether President Magill's testimony was a reflection, an accurate reflection, of the university's values, you know, whether she is a good fit moving forward. But they have made no immediate announcements. A spokesperson said there is no imminent change that is going to be made by the board. But we know that the pressure is piling on. The Wharton Board of Advisers, which is the business school associated with the University of Pennsylvania, the board is a who's who of business leaders. Including billionaire NFL owner, Josh Perris, the CEO of BET, Scott Mills. And they are calling for a change in leadership saying they are concerned about what they call a dangerous and toxic culture that President Magill has allowed to exist on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. We also know that Representative Elise Stefanik has announced investigations not only into not just Penn, but also MIT and Harvard due to the testimonies of their presidents on Tuesday. As you mentioned, Wall Street CEO, Ross Stevens, who is an alum of UPenn, is also the CEO of Stonebridge Holdings, has threatened to rescind $100 million worth of stock that Penn holds if Magill does not step down. We have spoken to a number of students here on campus all day, probably more than 50 or 60 at this point. Several say that it's inevitable that President Magill is going to have to go because of the financial hit the university is taking and could take. Donors closing their pocketbooks and this huge threat from Ross Stevens. Others say, from the pro-Palestinian side, say she has not represented their views and they feel alienated. Clearly, mixed views on this campus and a lot of pressure still building on President Magill -- Boris?",

You know, I think we have to ask ourselves the question, how we got here that the presidents of the top universities in this country are testifying before Congress and they can't say that genocide against Jews would constitute a violation of the code of conduct. You know, and they were asked multiple times. It was a very easy question to answer. They were asked many times, and each time all of the presidents refused to say yes.

You know, all of us have family and friends that are fighting in Gaza. My brother is living in Israel right now. You know, this is a really tough moment for us. And she has come to Hillel twice, but she could be doing a lot more. And beyond just kind of being visible to students, she needs to be more -- you know, take more action, really seriously signal that the university will not tolerate anti-Semitism. She just hasn't.

Well, I think it's a very tough question, and I definitely think free speech is important.I think it's important to note that the universities are not subject to a First Amendment -- you know, First Amendment standard with regards to speech. They are not required to tolerate all speech on campus. If people are chanting for a genocide against Jews, universities don't need to tolerate that. I think it's actually appropriate that they don't because that would be calling for the murder against me and my peers, which makes a lot of us feel unsafe. So I don't think that universities need to abide by a First Amendment standard when it comes to speech. And I think it's appropriate that they don't. You know, Harvard does have a code of conduct and you have provisions regarding harassment. And they specify in their provisions that harassment based on gender, national identity, or religion, among other things, would constitute harassment. So speech calling for the genocide of Jews seems to be like a very obvious type of speech that would constitute harassment under Harvard's existing code of conduct. I just don't know why President Gay refused to acknowledge that in Congress. And she should have, because it's in our code of conduct and it feels like a selective enforcement of the rules.",

They are not going to go back down. At least, overall prices are not going to go back down. But they will, hopefully, continue to grow a little bit more slowly, a little bit more normally, akin to what we have seen during the several decades prior to the pandemic. That will be good news.

Investigators say they found a list as well as ammunition and an eviction notice during a search of Anthony Polito's home. Investigators say none of the victims in Wednesday's shooting were actually on the target list. But they have identified nearly two dozen letters Polito mailed in the hours leading up to the shooting to university personnel across the country. And former California police chief, Alan Hostetter, who prosecutors say brought a hatchet to the capitol on January 6th and gave prior speeches calling for the execution of his perceived political enemies, has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for his role in the capitol riot. The Justice Department says, prior to the capitol riot, the retired police chief spread several conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. And the reigning Masters golf champion is leaving the PGA tour. Jon Rahm saying, in a statement, he is going to Saudi-backed LIV Golf. According to ESPN, he will make his debut in February as part of a three-year $300 million deal, that includes an ownership stake in a new team. And this comes as LIV Golf and the PGA are working out a deal to join forces by the end of the month. When we come back, this weekend, it's one of the most iconic football games that will kick off, Army versus Navy. I have absolutely no bias here other than to tell you, obviously, Army is going to win this entirely, right? We are live from Gillette Stadium next.
