Pence is now poised to recount for the first time under oath his conversations with Donald Trump leading up to the January insurrection.Also tonight, Kevin McCarthy leads a defiant show of force in the face of stern warnings from China, the speaker and a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers holding a historic meeting with Taiwan's president on American soil. I'll speaking with top Democrat who was in the room for the talks. And later this hour, we will go live to Jerusalem amid rising tensions in the Middle East. There are new fears that violence could boil over after Israeli forces raid one of the holiest sites in Islam for the second straight night. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to our top story tonight. Special Counsel Jack Smith notches a major victory, securing a firm commitment from former Vice President Mike Pence to testify in his probe of the January 6th insurrection. CNN's Sara Murray has been working her sources for us. Sara, of course, all eyes have been on Manhattan this week for that investigation, but this now sets up a major moment in one of the federal investigations. So, how significant is Pence's testimony?",

Obviously, we know that in the run up to January, 6th, Donald Trump put enormous pressure on his then-vice president, Mike Pence, to block the certification of the election results. And what a court said is that Mike Pence would have to answer questions about those conversations with Trump, but he could narrowly refuse to answer some questions about his time acting as president of the Senate.So, today, Pence said, essentially, we are happy enough with this ruling, we are not going to appeal it and we are going to go forward. So, again, it would be a historic first for mike pence to show up in front of a grand jury and provide testimony in a criminal probe about his conversations with the person who was then the president. We still don't know what the potential date of that would be, but, obviously, we'll be watching closely, Alex.",

So, there are plenty of lawyers I think on Pence's side and even on Trump's side who don't necessarily believe this would be a winning argument for them, even if they did decide to move forward with it.",

So, really, at the end of the day, you know, if he didn't testify, it doesn't help him in any way, but he can say I've carved out a little space for myself, I'm only going to tell them what I'm required by law to tell them and nothing more than that.",

So, when he's sitting in the chair, anything he says, or does is going to be protected under the law. Now, when he's prepared pairing to do that work, you start getting into a grayer area. So, which actions of the vice president can Jack Smith touch versus what he can? And I would guess this may end up back in court at some point when you try to divine sort of the gray area between Mike Pence, the man and the candidate for office and the vice president, and Mike Pence, the president of the United States Senate. But, look, Jack Smith can certainly talk about questions where he felt that my Mike Pence might have felt coerced by Donald Trump. He can speak about conversations going back to December of 2020 that led to the planning heading into January 6th. There is plenty that that Jack Smith can certainly ask about.

His executive privilege claims keep getting knocked down. It's really important to get to talk to those people. But what they say is, I think it was referring to devil's always in the details, just because they tell Trump you couldn't do something doesn't mean that he actually did it or it doesn't, by itself, show as intent, so they really need to get those answers from them.

And he claimed that they were threatened in exchange for testimony against him, which, you know, is not true.But I think what that reveals is that Trump is nervous. He thinks that the special counsel here may know quite a lot and is worried about what that means. Ironically, he also admitted part of this whole thing, which is to say that he openly and in the full light of day took the boxes of documents. That's a big part of Jack Smith's case.

And one of the reasons is because lawmakers across the board see China as a threat. But they think it is more powerful if they all speak with one unified voice on the issue. We certainly saw that today. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was a critic of Kevin McCarthy, she offered up some rare praise. I want to read you her statement. She said, today's meeting between President Tsai of Taiwan and Speaker Kevin McCarthy is to be commended for its leadership, its bipartisan participation and its distinguished and historic venue. That, of course, is a reference to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Ronald Reagan has a legacy of standing up to foreign adversaries.

And Kevin McCarthy with Tsai Ing-wen at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, that was a strong show of democratic solidarity. Take a listen to what Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen had to say.

So, last summer, when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China responded with unprecedented military drills that simulated a blockade around the island. This time, the reaction has been more muted, partly because the visit is held on American soil, not in Taiwan. And so far, beijing has held the routine military drills around Taiwan and launched a three-day patrol operation through the Taiwan Strait. But this is far less than what we saw last summer.Now, Beijing, however, has been steadily upping its intimidation of the island. Every day, Taiwan already deals with Chinese fighter jets around its skies and military ships sailing off its coast. But there are other reasons for Chinese Leader Xi Jinping to hold back a bit this time. He's been positioning himself as a global statesman and peacemaker, war games over Taiwan would overshadow that image. MARQUARDT:  Yes, the U.S. watching very carefully for any other response from China around this visit. Selina Wang in Beijing, thank you very much. And joining me now to discuss is the top Democrat on the China select committee, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. He was in the room for today's historic meetings with President Tsai. Congressmen, thank you so much for joining us tonight. This was a strong display of bipartisanship, very strong symbolism in front of President Reagan's Air Force One there. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he's saying that Democrats and Republicans today were speaking with one voice on Taiwan. Why is that so important despite the risk of escalation with China? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL):  I think it's very important because the Chinese Communist Party, known as the CCP, is counting on Americans being divided, fractious partisan with regard to protecting our interests and asserting our values. And so, today, speaking with one voice is very important, namely that we are going to stand with our partners and friends and allies in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Taiwanese people. And I think that sent a strong message not only to the CCP but to other countries as well.",

And so that is of paramount interest to us.And besides that, at this point, they are very big trading and investment partners because of the Chips and Science Act that President Biden led. Now, as we discussed today, with President Tsai, they are investing billions of dollars in manufacturing facilities in the United States for semiconductor fabrication. That's a huge event.

That state abortion ban went into effect after the fall of Roe v. Wade. And, essentially, how this happened, conservatives had had the majority on this bench for going back a decade. A judge retired. This opportunity was born in Protasiewicz, which seized it by a pretty wide margin, which is surprising. You don't usually see that in races in Wisconsin.But then it's not just abortion. If you remember back in 2020, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court upheld Joe Biden's win in that state after a last-minute challenge from President Trump over ballots in Democratic-leaning counties, Alex.

Simple things like where you drop off your early ballots, like drop off boxes, have been outlawed in Wisconsin. They have changed the laws of how you vote there. So, this Supreme Court is likely to hear cases about the mechanics of voting.But more interestingly, when you look at the results of last night, it was, -- you know, this was driven by abortion rights, no doubt. We saw it last year in the midterm elections. This was driving this as well. But if you look in the suburban counties around Milwaukee, the wow counties, we call them the three counties around Milwaukee that used to be Republican strongholds, not any longer. They still win there but the 30-point victory by Mitt Romney just a decade ago, now it's only about a three-point victory from Republicans. So, Republicans are bleeding in the suburbs. That is a big takeaway. In Dane County, Madison, huge growth. Youth vote was huge yesterday. So, that is significant. But without abortion on the ballot in 2024, who knows what this will mean. So, it explains some of what we'll see but it certainly is not to be all and end all of what Wisconsin will do in 2024",

This is the third holiest site in Islam. Of course, it is also known as the Temple Mount to Jews as the holiest site to Jews. Just in the last two hours or so, I think that's what we're seeing right now, Israeli police once again entering the compound and during the mosque itself, they say they respond to what they call dozens of juveniles who were barricading themselves inside with fireworks and stones. This is essentially a repeat of what we saw in the early hours of Wednesday morning , but it was much more violent and it was a bigger event in the early hours of Wednesday morning. In that instance, we see Israeli police entering the mosque with forced their riot shields are up. Fireworks are being fired at them ricocheting off the walls. They're responding with stun grenades and rubber bullets. Later, they say that they arrested more than 350 people in as a result of just that incident in some very disturbing videos. We also see what appears to be Israeli police beating some of the people that were arrested. We know of at least two dozen Palestinians over the course of the last 24 hours that have been injured. That's according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israeli police saying two of their officers were injured as a result. And just to show you how what happens in Jerusalem, what happens especially Al Aqsa has reverberated reverberations not only across this region, but across the world. Rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, at least 12 have been fired so far in the last 24 hours. The Israeli military responding with airstrikes, condemnations from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia against what's been happening at Al Aqsa. And as you noted, the American office of Palestinian affairs, saying violence has no place in a holy site during the holy season, saying they're alarmed by the shocking scenes both at Al Aqsa and the rockets coming out of Gaza, calling for restraint and de-escalation. Keep in mind, Alex, that it was a very similar sort of situation, the clashes at Al Aqsa that helped lead to that 11 day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021. A lot of fears that this could once against spiral into something similar -- Alex.",
