And at that point, they realized, wow, we don't really have a consistent way of tracking these balloons. And so, at that point, what they were able to do, they were able to collect signals from that particular balloon and put them through the intelligence community's holdings, essentially, and see where they had popped up in the past.So it was a very technical method that they use there. But they did discover it only in the last year. And that has allowed them to not only discover where those balloons have popped up in the past over the continental United States or elsewhere in the world, but also has given them the capability to track them in real time. So this is a really useful tool that they have now to see where these balloons are, how big the fleet is. And of course, whether these balloons are crossing over any particularly sensitive areas. And I should note that this method is pretty important because without it, it's really difficult to track these balloons, which flight very high as high as 300,000 feet in some cases and are very slow moving. So it's very easy for radar, for example, to -- for them to evade, for example, radar detection.",

They thought it was kind of just going to go around the edges of the continental U.S. that it wasn't really going to, of course, enter Montana, which was a surprise, I think, to everyone.And so they wanted to watch it and see where it was going to go. And whether importantly, they could collect intelligence on it. They did not view these balloons, just in general as a potential national security threat to the United States. So they figured, look, the risk to civilians on the ground, if we shoot this down, is high. The potential intelligence value of these balloons is also high. So let's just wait see where it goes.
