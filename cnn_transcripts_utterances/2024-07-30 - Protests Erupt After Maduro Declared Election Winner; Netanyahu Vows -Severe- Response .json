A vote which by most accounts appears to be rigged. Protesters have been blocking roads, chanting fraud and toppling a statue of the late leader Hugo Chavez. Maduro warned Monday night the government knows how to, in his words, defeat those who are violent.Along with most Venezuelans, the U.S. and regional leaders have also questioned the legitimacy of the election with the Maduro government refusing calls to release tally sheets and other voting data. The Council of the Organization of American States plans to meet Wednesday at the urgent request of nine Latin American countries. And in the past 24 hours Venezuela has withdrawn diplomats from seven countries in tit-for-tat expulsions.

About 50 meter from where I am, you can see the teargas at the bottom of these roads, of these avenues, because there are intense clashes with forces of the government security forces of Nicolas Maduro. You can see there a semi-armored vehicle. I can see that from the bottom. People around me are shouting on a microphone that they want freedom, and that they won't leave the streets until Nicolas Maduro is ousted. (Voice-over): On the other hand, the government of Nicolas Maduro has proceeded by claiming the legitimacy of that election. Maduro was formally proclaimed the winner on Monday morning by the electoral authorities and shortly before that, the attorney general had this to say to anybody who wished to think that they could protest these results.

It's a deep risk, I have to be clear, John. Over the past 10 months, this is why so many have been calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. So you don't have these sorts of situations coming up.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was late morning in Southport, a seaside town in the Northwest of England when police first received reports of a stabbing. It was quickly declared a major incident with multiple victims. Later in the day, police announced two children had died. The attack took place during a Taylor Swift-themed yoga class aimed at six- to 11-year-olds when a man walked in with a knife and started attacking the children. Police said nine other children were injured, with six still in critical condition. Two adults were also injured as they tried to protect the children from the assailant. All those injured suffered stab wounds. A local business owner described it as like a scene from a horror movie, according to P.A. Media. And he described mothers arriving at the scene screaming.

And what the Philippines wants today from this meeting that's being held right now, they want more help from the United States, John, to make that a reality, to keep these sea lanes, these trade routes free from their point of view, free from Chinese interference. So, at the heart of this, we want to show you a map. This is what China claims as its own in the South China Sea. This is what's known as the nine dash map, or nine dashes that should be on that map. Just imagined nine dashes around the South China Sea that were made in the 1920s. And China's saying, essentially, this is ours. The Philippines and other nations vehemently disagree with that, saying that at least a chunk of that is the West Philippine Sea. Now, the latest estimates that we have from 2016, up to 20 to 30 percent, John, of global trade flows through the South China Sea. It matters who controls those sea lanes. So, we heard from President Marcos a little while ago talking to, of course, these two top American officials. Listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FERDINAND MARCOS JR., PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT: I'm always very happy that these communication lines are very open so that all the -- all the things that we are doing together in terms of our alliance, in terms of the specific context of war situation here in the West Philippine Sea and in the Indo-Pacific, are continuously examined -- examined and re-examined so we are agile in terms of our responses.

But, you know, I sit two feet away from Brad Lendon, our global affairs military lead reporter here at CNN. And we were saying that China really, of course, does not back down from these claims. It would be very surprising for China to do so. It measures its progress in terms of decades, centuries, millennia. So, it will be interesting to see what, if any effect, this United States aid has on this very delicate equation, John.",
