Israel signals it will ignore the legally-binding measure despite international pressure to respect it. Also ahead for us. Singapore Airlines changes its seat belt rules after a flight from hell earlier this week, and a London-born boy who died aged 15 will become the first millennial saint. Details on his miraculous life coming up. And we do begin with a ruling from the United Nation's top court ordering Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah. Now, the 18- page ruling from the International Court of Justice warn that an IDF operation in southern Gaza would make what it calls a disastrous humanitarian situation there even worse. The judge's decision was part of a broader claim brought by South Africa, accusing Israel of genocide, an allegation rejected by the Israeli government. And the panel is calling on Israel to respond to their ruling within a month. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If you just look across this week ofan ICC calling for arrest warrants or calling for a judgment on arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant, Defense Minister, as well as Hamas leaders as well. And you have Ireland, Spain and Norway as well say that they recognize a Palestinian state. And these organizations and countries are building a head, if you will, of international pressure on Israel, that Israel is shrugging off and potentially even sort of broadening its shoulders to continue with what it says is the offensive that it needs to -- that it needs to -- that it needs to push ahead within Rafah to go after the remaining Hamas leadership. But I think if you take today's announcement by the ICJ in that context, there is this growing international pressure. Now, could this over time lead to -- lead to sanctions on Israel? There's the potential for that, but in of itself, this is -- this is, this is obviously more than symbolic. It's a very big warning for Israel. I think it was interesting that the president of the court, as he laid out, you know, the decision, he said that U.N. officials on the ground in Rafah have been making statements over the months and continuing to raise alarm over the diminishing humanitarian conditions for the people there. And the court president used that as an example of how there, Israel has had ample warnings, not only from the ICJ previously, but from officials, U.N. officials on the ground, and they are just not heeding that. But is this going to affect things on the ground? It does certainly doesn't appear to be about to do so in the short term.",

Now, as youjust heard, Nic, outline there, this has been a big week for developments in the Israel-Hamas war today. As we were saying, the International Court of Justice ruling, they had their ruling on Rafah on Wednesday, Ireland, Spain and Norway, all announce plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state. And of course, on Monday, the International Criminal Court prosecutor announced he had requested arrest warrants for Hamas and Israeli leaders, and those include Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And I want to welcome Mary Ellen O'Connell; she's a professor of international law at the University of Notre Dame. And thank you so much for weighing in as we try and parse exactly what this legal ruling might mean, and in terms of that, what practical legal effect can it have, given, as we were just discussing, it is unlikely to ever be truly enforceable. The point that obviously many want to get to is, it's supposed to get us closer to peace and prevent more human suffering. Is there any way in which this legal ruling can actually do that? MARY ELLEN O'CONNELL, PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME: I believe it does so in two ways. First, it sends a clear message of what the law actually require if anyone is in doubt and Israel and the U.S. or other places about what Israel is doing and international law, this latest order makes it crystal clear, Israel is going too far. I hope very much that it will also have the practical effect, if not on Israel itself, on its own leaders and its population, demanding compliance with international law. It will have an impact on Israel's last remaining friend, the United States. President Biden has also been highly critical of the Rafah operation. He now is in a position to put to act in compliance with his own warnings and withhold all U.S. offensive weapons to Israel. That's the last point of pressure that it's really possible for the international community to bring to Mr. Netanyahu and bring the chance of this very accurate, very acceptable ruling been complied with.",

You point out that countries like the U.S. could be deemed complicit in violating the ordersif it doesn't halt military aid to Israel immediately. And yet, how do you feel the U.S. might react to all of that, and does it further divide the international community? O'CONNELL: Very sadly, I believe the calculations that are going on in the White House right now have more to do with President Biden's re-election prospects than truly with what you could be standing for in the world, and that is the rule of law. I think there's no question that the European Union will stand with the rule of law. It is also in Israel's long-term interests that the -- that the world have a robust rule of law that binds all states that raises the norms against all kinds of violence, especially terrorists violence. We only get that if there is consensus and support internationally. European Union understands that. I hope President Biden decides that his long-term interests, United States long-term interests, which is also Israel's long-term interests, is to side with the law every time because what's on the other side of law compliance is law violation. President Biden should not want to be the one who ushers in a further denigration, a further loosening of commitment to the rule of law. That's not in America's interest or Israel's.",

I mean, Israelis feel that these kinds of rulings reallyput them on par with Hamas, which is a terror organization and provoked all of this. You know, just as an example, and please point out where I am wrong about this, because I'm sure many would say I'm wrong. Few questioned the allies when they took on ISIS, arguably many civilians suffered immensely during those military operations as well, because ISIS lived again among the civilian population. O'CONNELL: One of the things that has finally become apparent to so many of us in the world through Gaza, through Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is how much we have failed to really hold countries to the rule of law up to this point. The United States instituted a war on terror after 9/11, it continued in many inappropriate ways, including in the response to ISIS and the very high civilian death toll in that campaign. And finally, we see that this damping down of the law, this slippery slope of not holding, that's journalists, that's international lawyers, that citizens everywhere, all of our countries, which are officially committed to the rule of law by not holding them to those principles. We've removed the barriers, the psychological barriers, and then organizations like Hamas and other armed militant groups keep fighting because violence apparently is acceptable, Israel uses too much force, excessive use of force, including the tool of war, which is inappropriate against terrorism. Russia invades because it says it's acting in self-defense, and the way the U.S. did in Iraq in 2003. It's time to say, if we care about the rule of law, which we officially all do, we have to hold governments, all governments regardless of their friendship with one or another or their democratic bona fides, we have to hold them all to this common bond created after the second World War in the U.N. Charter. And that -- and the stop, loosening that, misinterpreting it. The time to and the International Court of Justice has helped us with its unequivocal and clear statement that an offensive against Rafah will violate all this fundamental law. Let's get back in compliance with the rule of law, protect human lives, which is the very purpose of law, and halt the Rafah offensive. Now, that's what the court is saying. It's finally drawn a line in the sand, and said, we're going to lose all order, all chance of peace, human rights, protection of the environment, everything we need for our future if we don't begin in this most egregious case of enforcing the law now.",

There has been a blame game between Israeli and Egyptian officials over why that crossing has yet to reopen. But the end result has been the same, which is that no aid trucks have made it into Gaza via that Rafah Crossing, which is a critical artery for humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. We have also watched impediments to aid getting in from other crossings as well as the Israeli military has expanded its military offensive in both southern and northern Gaza. But certainly, this announcement that we'll see aid trucks go in from Egypt through that Kerem Shalom Crossing into Israel and then into Gaza will certainly make a big difference if indeed it goes through.

We're told that once Hagerich is able to cover that fine, he'll be released and he'll be able to leave the country. His attorney said that they hope to get this done today, and that Hagerich could be back in the U.S. later tonight, actually. His attorney told us right after the sentencing quote, \"that Hagerich is relieved. He is pleased the sentence in all its circumstances is reasonable and fair. And he's relieved and looking forward to pay the fine and return home as soon as possible. The judge's ruling is something that officials in Turks and Caicos has said was always a possibility. They've been saying this for days now. Yesterday, the country's premier actually took -- noted rather that no American that's ever been convicted of a firearms offense in the country had ever received a mandatory minimum sentence of 12 years in prison, which is what Hagerich was facing on these possession of ammunition charges. And he also pushed back with some pretty serious comments that were made by U.S. lawmakers who said that officials in the Turks and Caicos islands had been targeting Americans. As you noted, Hagerich, who is from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty to his charges shortly after he was arrested back in February. He is one of five Americans that have been arrested on these types of charges in recent months, according to Hagerich and his wife, he forgot that the hunting ammunition was in his baggage when the couple visited the  country there. And so Paula, right now, we believe that once Hagerich is able to cover this fine, he's going to be able to go back to Pennsylvania. The timing of all this, of course, will depend on how quickly they're able to come up with that money, and the attention moving forward, it now turns to the remaining Americans that are facing these types of charges that are still in Turks and Caicos. One American is scheduled to be sentenced next week, and then the remaining group, they have court hearings scheduled for next week as well as June and in July. Paula?",

But it was, as I think you were taught during the week, it was the ferocity of them. The plane was going up by 800 feet a minute. It was coming down by 1,100 feet a minute. It was then going back up again by 600 feet a minute. But the actual distances it traveled were only 100 feet, 50 feet, 75 feet. So it's all about the force, not the length of which it was actually being moved. Yes. You do what you can. I guess I don't think -- I think the Singapore measures are understandable and they will work, but they're not workable in the long run.",

And on Thursday, Pope Francis recognized a second miracle, the healing of a young woman who was near death after a bicycle accident. This means that that young man is on track to become the church's first saint of the millennial generation. CNN's Christopher Lamb joins us now, and he has all of our details. You know, it sometimes can take centuries for someone to be really recognized in this way. Why this young man, and why did the Vatican do this?",
