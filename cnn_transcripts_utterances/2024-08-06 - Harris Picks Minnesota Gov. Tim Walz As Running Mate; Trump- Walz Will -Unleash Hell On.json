Moments ago, a plane carrying Minnesota Governor Tim Walz took off from the Twin Cities, heading east, ultimately to Philadelphia. That is where, later today, Walz will officially be introduced as Kamala Harris's running mate, capping off a whirlwind 16 days since Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and Kamala Harris stepped in.CNN was first to break the news this morning. Governor Walz is a 60- year-old veteran, former teacher and football coach who spent 12 years in Congress. The Harris campaign just released this TikTok video, contrasting Walz with the Republican candidate for vice president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): People like J. D. Vance know nothing about small town America. It's not about hate. It's not about collapsing in. The golden rule there is mind your own damn business. Their policies are what destroyed rural America. They've divided us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is now them taking that a step further, particularly because Walz has been a favorite among the progressives left. Take a listen to what J. D. Vance said when he arrived here in Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Many, many, many people said repeatedly that the reason Kamala Harris was going away from the Josh Shapiro selection is because they were worried about antisemitism. They were worried about certain voters. They were worried about some of the leaders in the grassroots activists and their party wouldn't take a Jewish nominee. I think it's despicable. I think it's disgusting. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance, part of the reason they were so excited to have him on the team is because they believed he would serve as an attack dog, a bulldog. He really hasn't had an opportunity to do that because he himself has been under an enormous amount of scrutiny.You're going to see some of that turn with this Walz pick. He is going to go after him. You expect to see that behind me today. And I do want to talk a little bit about that Governor Shapiro pick, because even though they are attacking Kamala Harris for not choosing Shapiro. I was on the phone with someone moments before we broke the news that Governor Walz had been the pick. Who was saying that they hoped it was Governor Walz over Governor Shapiro, because they believe there was a lot more risk, particularly with the battleground state of Pennsylvania, when it came to Shapiro. So, even though they are insulting her for not making that choice, there's least part of the campaign that is relieved, but that's not something they have to contend with, but again in this critical state.",

      "sentences": "Look, you know, the one thing about Tim Walz is that he kind of dropped out of a Norman Rockwell painting, OK. He comes from small town America. Enlisted in the National Guard when he was 17. You know, a social studies and geography teacher, who took a losing football team and helped coach it to the state championship.I mean, you know, he looks and sounds like small town America. So, if you want to reach out in those ways, he's very, very good. He also ran a bunch of races in the swing congressional district. You covered him in Congress. Jeff is right. He was a more moderate candidate then, but the things that brand him as a progressive are very much economic things like, you know, paid family leave and childcare help and so on. I think Democrats are running on those issues now, and so people may try and brand them. Now, the first thing that the Trump campaign did was put out a tweet about the George Floyd aftermath. And I think you're going to hear a lot of that. But I don't know that they're going to impeach this ticket on the grounds of them being too progressive. And I think Tim Walz doesn't look that or sound that way. I mean, that's not the way that I would necessarily go. So, you know, I -- he doesn't help you win a state. That was something I said to you long ago. I would look at Pennsylvania. I'd look at Arizona. And she did look at Governor Shapiro. She did look at Senator Kelly. But, you know, in terms of the persona of Tim Walz -- and last thing I'll say, I want to -- last thing I will say is, I do think this issue, as I understand it, of chemistry was very, very important. She's friendly with Josh Shapiro and knows him well. But the question was, could they get together on what the role should look like? I think she feels very comfortable that she and Walz can get together on what the role would look like, and that's why we ended up where we are today.",

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yeah. In that way, he's very much a traditional VP pick, in that he addresses deficiencies on the ticket, which is what normally you try to do, whether it's geographic or demographic. And he does, he brings in military background. He's a geographic counterweight to Kamala Harris's sort of coastal, you know, liberalism, and it's sort of the opposite of the Trump, Vance pick, which doubled down on attributes Trump already had, all white, all male, all MAGA. So, it really is a complete ticket. You know, he is more progressive. You don't -- you don't get Bernie Sanders, Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal to all endorse if you're not progressive, and they're all behind him. So, he'll have to answer for that. He'll have to answer for George Floyd. An episode, he admitted, he said, was an abject failure of leadership in that state, he's going to have to defend his record. But so is she. Neither of them have had to lay out an agenda or answer tough questions about what they would do or what they have done. So, the good vibes will keep going for probably this week, but eventually they're going to have to answer not just to Republican attacks, but to the media.",

And there was a lot of tough talk from some of the folks in the state about his lack of doing so quickly.But he was reelected in 2022. And he was able to sort of move on from that and do things like free school lunch and breakfast in some schools, trying to protect abortion rights in his state, which people there appreciated. Going after the gun lobby, basically putting in some gun legislation, even though he says, look, I'm a father. I'm a gun owner. I'm a veteran. I believe in the Second Amendment. But I believe in some restrictions here to try to keep children in particular safe, knowing that they are dying at these incredibly terrible rates in this country from gun violence. And so, he's been able to surmount that, but it is certainly going to be a talking point. We have already heard it from the Trump campaign. They're going to come after him on that issue. But there is, of course, the issue he's running with the black woman who has been attacked mercilessly by Donald Trump, trying to undo her identity that she has created for herself and that she should be able to create. That has leaves a nasty taste in the black voters that Donald Trump has been trying to go after and that could be a real pivotal point here, too.",

And from the clips that you just showed, he thinks there's a more effective way in which someone like him can talk to those voters and bring them over.

One is, is the person sort of palpably qualified to be president. This guy's been a governor. He's been a congressman. The second -- the second piece is, are you pretty sure he's not going to embarrass you? And it seems like Trump failed on both tests because they were so filled with hubris in that convention that they decided, we can afford to take a flyer on Vance. You know, the Trump boys liked him.
