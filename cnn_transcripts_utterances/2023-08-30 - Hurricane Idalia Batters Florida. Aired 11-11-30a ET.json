And brand-new video from Keaton Beach is coming in. Take a look at this, the roof completely ripped off of this home. This is where Idalia made landfall just about three hours ago, the walls of this home now laying in splinters. In Perry, Florida, the hurricane hit as a powerful Category 3 with winds topping 120 miles per hour, this woman catching the moment, the moment a tree fell on her home. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes. And it's in Georgia.We have got some breaking information to give you. So, now the center of the storm has crossed over into the state of Georgia. While we're still seeing impacts in Florida, now the bulk of the concern begins to shift to the Peach State. Again, we're going to continue to see it make its way across that state and into South Carolina. But one of the bigger concerns at the moment is the rain across this area. You have got winds around 65, 67 miles per hour in Valdosta. But the biggest concern in Valdosta is the rain. We now have a brand-new flash flood emergency for the city of Valdosta, because they are dealing with incredibly torrential rainfall coming down across this area. You can see all of that orange and red sliding right across the downtown portion of Valdosta. It's not the only area. You have also got heavier rain sliding into Augusta, also Charleston, South Carolina, starting to get some of those heavier rain bands. For some of these areas, you have already picked up two inches of rain. Now you're going to add an additional two to four inches on top of that. That's where the flooding concern comes from. It's also the wind. We talked about those wind gusts up around 60 to 70 miles per hour in Valdosta. We're starting to see those power outage numbers begin to spread from Florida now into Georgia. So, combined between the two states, we are now looking at over 300,000 people without power. That number is expected to grow likely up around at least half-a- million and could potentially get higher as the day goes on. The heaviest rain going forward is going to be from Tallahassee up through the Outer Banks. We have talked about this, widespread, at least four inches of rain and a lot of these places, but six, eight, even 10 inches is not out of the question in some of these areas. So please take this seriously. If you get these flash flood emergencies on your phone, take them seriously. Get indoors. Get to higher ground. They're not there just to -- just to be out. They're trying to inform you to get to higher ground. Here's a look at the flash flood threat as well. You can see we have got this moderate risk for excessive rainfall, again, not just in Florida, not just in Georgia, but this also spreads into the Carolinas because that's where this storm is going to go. So, if you live in any one of those states, keep in mind the storm may not be to you yet, but it is on the way and will continue to spread as we go through the rest of the day -- back to you.",

Everything is floating. The gulf has just moved in over Cedar Key, over parts of Steinhatchee, where our Bill Weir is. And we will check in with him in a little bit. As you said, the hurricane, Hurricane Idalia, is now over Georgia. It's now a storm that Georgia has to deal, with the winds, Category 1 winds and rain, devastating rain, four to 10 inches in some places. The concern there will be trees, tree damage. You can see some of the trees here in Tallahassee, a lot of trees in this area. And we are getting reports of trees down and freshwater flooding. The roads are just going to be a mess all around Northern Florida in into Georgia and the Carolinas as well. And even as the storm moves, bringing the wind and the rain, the concern in Florida is still very much the storm surge along the Gulf Coast. Yes, the storm has passed, but the surge continues, as the winds are still pushing the water inland toward shore, and high tide in some areas is not for several hours. Let's go to Derek Van Dam, who is in Tampa, who's been walking along the river that is Bayshore Boulevard all morning long. Derek, what are you seeing now?",

No, this is US-19, the highway that goes through Crystal River, or, I should say, it was US-19. Right now, it looks like there is a lake and a river coming together here. It is flowing so quickly across all of this area. All that you're seeing there before us get to the structures and the Best Western there, those were all parking lots that were completely dry as a duck's back. And now they're inundated with water. And it is going to get worse. While you heard Derek Van Dam they're saying they are going to see their major high tide around 2:00 or so, we are supposed to get high tide, we are supposed to see the worst of this at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. So, what you're seeing now, this is what the forecasters promised. They said, look, you are not going to see a whole lot at first, and then, all of a sudden, you're going to start seeing water just being pushed on to shore. That is exactly what is happening here. Just give you a little look around. And I kind of want you to hear the sound of the water. This is Northwest Sixth Avenue in Crystal River. Anyone that is familiar with this place knows what this is, because the Best Western is here. It's very easy to find. And the reason why they know where it is, is because this is where you go, one of the many places you go to see manatees. This is a place where a lot of tourists come to see Florida's treasure, those beautiful what they sea cows. And I have done it. I did this as a kid and I did this as an adult, going and swimming with the manatees and going to see the crystalline, beautiful water as it comes out of the earth. The spring here is just stunning. But listen to this. Let me just let you listen to the sound of rushing water. This is you US-19 right at Northwest Sixth Avenue. Listen just for a second, running water in the middle of a highway. All right, let's go ahead to go to Michael Brennan. He is at the -- he is the head of the National Hurricane Center, an important gentlemen to be talking to at this hour.

So we're still seeing significant impacts in terms of wind, heavy rainfall spreading into portions of Southern and Southeastern Georgia. That's going to continue to spread northward. We can see the rainfall moving into South Carolina, coastal North Carolina. We're going to see storm surge, hurricane-force winds continue.

You see all these cars here? Some of those are ours. Why did we need to bring our cars here? Well, you can tell. We were parked in the parking lot. The water came up past the tires. And so, at that point, we realize we need to get to higher ground. But this is not going to be much better in the coming hours. You do see that there are emergency vehicles. And what are they doing? The smartest thing ever. They're bringing in a boat, because they know that, at this point, the only way to go get and help people if they have stayed in this area and to survey the area is going to be by boat. That's what's happening at this hour. And, by the way, I have now seen fish swimming on the other side of US-19. There's not supposed to be any water over there. And there's enough for fish to be swimming around in it. But this is still a water event happening here. The surge is coming. And the next few hours, the highest tide is going to happen here.

And the process of intensification is something we need to highlight, because it was just yesterday morning that this was a tropical storm.

But, still, there are some perils remain. And, John, you know from being here over the past 24 hours here's a unique feature, kind of the trees here in this area. This branch just kind of flew off a tree right near us. A branch like this can be dangerous enough, in and of itself. But, look, it's got all the Spanish moss hanging on it. It makes it about twice as heavy as it normally would be. So, when these branches start to fly off the trees, as this one just did near us, it can be very, very dangerous. And, also, you have got -- look, all these trees -- this large, live oak tree behind me still in some peril, because the ground is saturated behind it. Officials here are always worried about these trees being uprooted and coming down. And, again, we're just getting reports of some roadblocks here in Leon County. There's also the proximity, of course. Look at the power lines and how close they are to this tree. That's going to be an issue as these emergency crews start to fan out and assess the damage. But we do have some good news to report from a county not far away, we Wakulla County, where the town of St. Mary's is. I just spoke to an emergency management official there. That town, St. Mary's, very susceptible to storm surge. It is really low to the water. They say that town gets flooded really at the drop of a hat in a normal storm. They expected it to be flooded.

And so what they're doing right now is, they're just driving around this part of Tampa making sure that folks are OK. Part of the reason why is, you're taking a look at it right here. There is a good amount of flooding in a lot of these neighborhoods. Just to the west of where Derek Van Dam has been live along the river there, you really get a sense of just the situation just by driving around about. Two blocks to the south of here, we saw a number of other homes that have also been flooded out. This one house here to my right, you can see they put up about a dozen sandbags, and you can see the waterline, just how high things got. No doubt that home was flooded. Now, a few minutes ago, I was able to talk to the mayor of Gulfport. That is a city across the bay in Pinellas County. He tells me that, right now, they're still dealing with significant flooding. They're still dealing with what's left of low tide, and that, at some point this afternoon, they're hoping to be able to get out around town to see exactly how much damage there is. But, again, right now the story, at least where we are live right now, which is just off of Westshore Boulevard, again, to the west of where Derek is, is the flooding, because just on the other side of that block over there is the bay itself.
