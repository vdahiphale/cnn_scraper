The report laying out key differences between Biden's cooperation with the investigation and Trump's alleged obstruction of his own classified documents case. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We're following major legal development affecting the two men likely heading toward a presidential rematch. CNN's Paula Reid has more on Donald Trump appearing to win over the nation's highest court as he vies to remain on the ballot. And our own M.J. Lee has details on the special counsel report clearing President Biden of charges while sharply rebuking his handling of classified information. First, let's go to Paula Reid. She's outside the U.S. Supreme Court. Paula, it looks like this was a pretty good day for Trump's efforts to stay on the ballot, not just in Colorado, but across the country.",

And yet, we heard today over and over, in that clip you played from Justice Alito, worries about the consequences of the Colorado Supreme Court's decision, worries about what would it mean if individual states could keep presidential candidates off the ballot. Those worries may well be legitimate. I mean, I think Karl is right.

The probe concluded without charges tonight but finding Biden willfully retained classified information after he left the vice presidency.CNN's M.J. Lee is over at the White House. She's got details for us. M.J., what does this report conclude? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOSE CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, almost 400 pages of this report from Special Counsel Robert Hur concluded this, President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency, but it also says that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter, Robert Hur saying that they didn't have evidence to fully establish the president's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This report, Wolf, lays out in painstaking details notes and reports that were found in the president's Wilmington home, in the garage, in the den, in the offices that contained classified materials in some decrepit boxes, as you can see in these photos that were included in this report. And they included sensitive materials, including about foreign policy. One example that has come to light is a handwritten memo that was classified that the former vice president wrote at the time to the former president, Barack Obama, encouraging him to not send in more troops to Afghanistan. But what is more problematic, according to this report, is that some of these materials were shared at the time with the president's ghost writer who was working on his memoir. Now, what is striking about this report as well are the many, many and harsh details about these alleged memory problems that the president had, including when he was being interviewed by the special counsel. A couple of examples, it says that the president didn't remember what years he served as vice president. Another example is that it says in a trial, Biden would likely present himself to a jury as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. Now, the report, we should note, also lays out the full scope of the president's cooperation in this matter, including sitting down for an hour's long interview, consenting to multiple searches, turning over those documents immediately. All of that, of course, is in direct contrast from everything that we have seen from former President Donald Trump.",

And that is just, according to Special Counsel Hur, not present in this case. To compare that with Donald Trump's case, which stands out far beyond anything most national security experts have seen before, you have a series of events in which, for months, refused to give back documents. Then he sat and personally went through documents, decided which ones to give back and which ones to retain, then was served with a subpoena and actually encouraged others to obstruct the enforcement of that subpoena.

He served as a Trump impeachment manager, also served on the January 6th select committee. Congressman, thanks for joining us. As you know, President Biden willfully held on to classified materials and even shared some of that information with his ghost writer who didn't have the necessary security clearances. Even if he won't be criminally charged, are you concerned by the president's conduct here? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Well, sure. You know, as the lead Democrat on the Oversight Committee, we would like to do some legislation to get our best archivists and librarians together to figure out a way that we can tag material more quickly and prevent it from kind of negligent mishandling, the kind we had from Mike Pence and Joe Biden. But that is an ocean away from Donald Trump, who deliberately pilfered hundreds of top secret classified government documents and then refused to return them and hid them all over his house, whereas this Republican special counsel said that Joe Biden had been completely forthcoming and cooperative and they're not bringing any criminal charges against him. He did take some gratuitous slaps at Joe Biden because of his age and a lot of these kind of age discriminatory and age insulting remarks are getting rather tiresome. All we really need from a special prosecutor like Hur is a decision whether there's any legal grounds to move forward. He said there's not. And he didn't need to take all those cheap shots. And, obviously, you could take the same kinds of cheap shots at Donald Trump, who recently confused a woman that he sexually attacked and then lied about with one of his wives and also mixed up Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley.",

So, they're going to come up with some cheap shots like that.I mean, to me, Wolf, it reminds me of the kind of gender-based cheap shots they took at Hillary Clinton when she ran for president, and now there are all these age-based cheap shots that they're taking on Donald Trump. And it does show you how desperate they are, because you could turn them around and use all the same ones against Donald Trump, who is fumbling his way through every day trying to figure out who he's attacking this day or that, in which case, based on his criminal conduct he's attending.",
