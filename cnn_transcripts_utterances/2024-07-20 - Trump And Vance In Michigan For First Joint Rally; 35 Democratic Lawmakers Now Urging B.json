Vance formally accepted the GOP nomination, they're hitting the campaign trail together for the first time. This will also be Trump's first rally since last Saturday's assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. That shooting leading to changes at tonight's rally. CNN's Kristen Holmes is live for us in Grand Rapids, Michigan where that rally is going on now. Kristen, what's it like on the ground",

Vance or layer, the first time he went to a campaign event, started talking to the people as the vice-presidential nominee. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: President Trump in other words, wants to build a country that actually works for the citizens of this country once again. He did it for four years. He did it so successfully for four years. We've never -- think about this, my friends, we have never had an election where you have four years of one guy and four years of the other guy. And who could possibly reject the idea that four years of President Trump has been a hell of a lot better than four years of Joe Biden, right. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are thousands of people, many of them told us outside, they were here to prove a point after that Butler, Pennsylvania rally. It is the first time that Donald Trump has held a rally since then. Obviously one big difference back at this one is inside, but that is not the only security measure. There are a number of changes that we have seen. One, the streets around this arena are closed down, something you almost never see during these Trump rallies because I've attended many. We know there are extra Secret Service agents on the ground, extra Secret Service agents traveling with him. He has a bigger footprint, meaning a bigger motorcade. He's also had state police, including aerial security, talking about helicopters. We also know there is more law enforcement on the ground than we have seen at previous rallies after that shooting. Secret Service requested 50 to 60 more local officers. So obviously they have really beefed-up security. Now what's happening right now is that Donald Trump is backstage with J.D. Vance. They're sitting down for their first joint interview. Then they will come take the stage. And Jessica, what we're looking for is what they actually look like as a team. This is the first time we're really seeing the top of the ticket on the campaign trail. What is -- what is their chemistry like? One of the things that Donald Trump liked about J.D. Vance is that they got along so well. Well none of the American people have really seen that until tonight. So obviously it'll be interesting to see their dynamic as we head into this last four months of the campaign.",

Now, one source describing the couple as deferential to the president's decision; another source saying they're deferential to the process. In other words, they want or believe that donors should continue to support President Biden as long as he is the presumptive Democratic nominee. Now, of course this it comes against headwinds for this Biden campaign. They have struggled with donors, some of whom have been holding back their big dollar checks over concerns about the president's candidacy. Some sources saying that it has become increasingly difficult to get donors to back this campaign because there are just so many questions circling whether or not the president remains in the race. The campaign, however, has repeatedly said on the airwaves and in statements that the president is going to stay in the race. Hitting the airwaves yesterday, Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledging that it has been in a tough few weeks, a challenging time, and there has been some erosion of support. But that that essentially the president is going to stay in this race. So the president, while he is here and he is self-isolating and while his symptoms are improving is certainly still grappling with a party that is not entirely behind him. Democratic lawmakers are still putting out letters today about the president stepping aside. We anticipate that could continue over the next few days. So certainly, this remains a challenging time, even though the campaign has multiple -- on multiple occasions, tried to calm the nerves among allies, donors, and lawmakers. So we are still in a bit of an uncertain period, even though some of the president's most loyal aides maintain that the president is dug in on staying in the race.",

Now that is apparently not where Speaker Emerita Pelosi is. And I have to say President Biden has a lot of impressive accomplishments. I don't think he'd have gotten any of them without Nancy Pelosi. So the notion that somehow she has betrayed him it's not true. She is a great Democratic, this is the finest legislative leader in all of American history. And parties exist to win. They don't exist to be a family. They're not religion, they're not your home. They have one purpose. And that is to win. And when Democrats believe that you don't help them win they're going to cut you loose. It is like, you know, Mr. Trump is fond of quoting Hannibal Lecter. Let me quote another fictional character, the late great Hyman Roth, the gangster in \"The Godfather\" who assisted, Michael Corleone. He says, this is the business we've chosen and this is the business Joe Biden has chosen. It's pitiless business. And he has no -- I think no reason to feel betrayed at all.",

So I think Vance is raising a good question and yes, I think all these Democrats who are coming out against Joe Biden, I think they're trying to, as Paul pointed out, they're part of a party and they wanted to win an election, but somebody needs to ask them, are you satisfied that Joe Biden is fit to serve today?

It's all about polling and about running for office and nothing to do with his fitness to serve as president. They just think he's a drag on the ticket now. And I have to say the Republican Convention has actually energizes Democrats. Every -- the first time since the debate, first time in three weeks, the Democrats were fired up because they watched that speech to a woman and a man. I was there in Texas saying well, we can beat this guy. I mean he was terrible. You talk about fitness to lead. I mean, if I gave a speech like that, my wife would throw a net over me and they'd haul me off. It was pathetic that they had -- the convention had -- it was great. The convention was great except for the vice-president candidate speech and the presidential candidate speak. But the former stripper was great and the former rocker was great, and the former wrestler was great, the former wife beater, I wouldn't have put him up there, but he did a good job.

And now maybe don't know who they're going to vote for this time around. I understand this rally is full of a really energized base and that is clear.

People who rarely vote, if ever, maybe even people who registered to vote for the first time today. That is Trump's great ability in this campaign to reach into a pool of voters that Joe Biden really cannot get or communicate with and bring them in. It's not actually dissimilar to what Barack Obama was able to do in 2008. He had access to people that no one else could touch. They were energized by him and him alone. So I think it's actually two groups. And here's what he's going to tell them. You have an opportunity here to compare my presidency and how you felt in terms of your own personal finances and personal security. And you can compare that to Joe Bidens. And when you look at all the polling right now, whether you're a swing voter, or whether you're not, most people agree Donald Trump was a better president than Joe Biden. He has a better job approval for his presidency today when you ask people to compare it to Joe Biden. So it's actually not all that complicated. Were you better off under me or are you better off under him?

She or Chris christie, he's from a very blue state, New Jersey. He carried it twice, second time in a landslide. They could have reached out to those voters. They don't want them. You know, Mr. Trump -- this is amazing. He's now got to lead in all the polls but it's because Biden has dropped not because Trump has moved up. He survived a week ago and we thank God for this. He survived an assassination attempt a week ago and he hasn't gained a point. Reagan went to 73, right, when he got shot. And again, thank God Reagan survive. Thank God, Mr. Trumps survived. But he's gotten no sympathy, no -- you know, why? Because the country doesn't want him. Mr. Trump has never in his entire career commanded the support of the majority of American people. The country just doesn't want them. And maybe that's why the pressure is so high on Joe Biden. I will note that the powerful Democratic Senator Menendez was convicted of 16 felonies this week. And all the Democrats say let's expel him. Mr. Trump is convicted of 34 four felonies. All the Republicans say, let's elect him. I think that says something to those suburban voters.",

And so I think the polling is always going to exist in a narrow band for him. But that's not how we elect the president. We elect the president in the electoral college. And right now, Donald Trump leads in about 14 of the top five swing states. I mean, you look at the map we've got states on the map and haven't -- I ran George W. Bush's campaign in 2004 in New Mexico. We have not won -- Republicans have not won New Mexico in 20 years. It's now on the map. Where Paul lives in Virginia, it's on the map.

That's a pretty high batting average.So there's a real chance, maybe a 50-50 chance that Mr. Trump becomes president. And then there's some, whatever chance, that his vice president succeeds him. As has happened so many times. So he -- he wants a man a heartbeat away from the presidency that has his same views on issues like abortion. Make no mistake about it. Scott may want to put -- try to put lipstick on this hog, but Donald Trump is the reason that millions of American women, after 49 years under Roe v. Wade, have lost their rights. And it's only going to continue. He's going to continue to stack the judiciary with these ultra, ultra right-wing lawyers and judges, who are going to take away your right to IVF, like they tried to do in Alabama, who are going to take away your right to contraception. This Project 2025 wants to ban Mifepristone, the abortion pill. As many Republicans do. You're going to have a national abortion. And that's just one issue. By the way, he bragged in that speech about his tax cuts, which was $2.5 trillion that went to the wealthiest people in America. And that's including Mr. Trump. So I mean, when he can see a way to do it for himself, he's all in. But this is just not a guy who I think is going to -- he's got a record that middle-class Americans can rally to. The Democrats need to take that fight to him. That's the most important thing. And frankly, they haven't been doing it for the last couple of weeks.",
