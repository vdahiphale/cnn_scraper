Just ahead, dangerous and deadly weather tears across central United States, leaving more than a dozen people dead, and the danger is far from over, with millions still under threat this hour.No place is safe. An Israeli airstrike on a makeshift tent camp in Rafah kills dozens of people. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas compound. And just days after extreme turbulence rocked a Singapore Airlines flight, another international airline suffers a similar ordeal, with a number of people injured. Hello everyone, I'm Rosemary Church. We begin in the United States, where more than 120 million people across the country face the risk of severe weather in the coming hours on this U.S. Memorial Day. A deadly storm system is expected to continue its path of destruction. Tornado watches are in effect across the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys, impacting nearly 5 million people. Earlier, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear issued a state of emergency which has multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes. More than half a million homes and businesses are without power and at least 18 people have died in four states. That includes four children in Cooke County, Texas, where a tornado hit overnight. That's just north of Dallas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed disaster declarations for four additional counties, bringing the state's total to 106. He says more than one-third of all Texas counties are now subject to a disaster declaration. And for more on this, I'm joined now by Lori Arnold- Ellis, the spokesperson of the American Red Cross of Greater Arkansas. Thank you so much for being with us. LORI ARNOLD-ELLIS, SPOKESPERSON, AMERICAN RED CROSS OF GREATER ARKANSAS:  Thank you for having me today.",

In a letter to the United Nations, an emergency official says more than 2,000 people were buried alive. The U.N.'s Migration Agency has said the landslide swallowed up more than 150 homes, with debris spread across an area as large as four football fields.Rescuers are still searching, hoping to find more survivors. The landslide hit a remote region of the country in the middle of the night early Friday. Well, more than a million people have been evacuated in Bangladesh and western India where Tropical Cyclone Remal made landfall just hours ago. The first cyclone of the year brings the threat of wind gusts up to 135 kilometers per hour, potential landslides and storm surges of nearly four meters. Authorities in Bangladesh raised the storm danger signal to its highest level for two ports and nine coastal districts along the Bay of Bengal. The cyclone continues to move north and is expected to weaken as it gets further inland. The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 35 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in an Israeli strike in the southern city of Rafah. Gaza officials say the strike hit a camp filled with tents for those displaced by the war and caused a fire that left many people injured with horrific burns. The Israeli military claims it was targeting a Hamas compound and killed two senior Hamas officials, but the IDF acknowledges reports that the strike, along with the fire, did harm civilians.

It was in a displaced person's camp where there were tents, there were makeshift shelters.And according to Gaza's Ministry of Health, they say that most of those who were killed and injured were women and children, saying that no hospital had the capacity in the area to be able to cope with the scale and the number of those killed and injured. Now, we know also from the Gaza government's media office that this was designated as a safe zone and this is an area where some had moved to after being evacuated by the Israeli military in other parts of Rafah, notably in the east. Now, we've had a response, a statement from the Israeli military. They say that they did carry out an airstrike, they struck a Hamas compound in Rafah, and they say that they killed two senior Hamas officials, one of them a commander of Hamas' leadership in the West Bank. Now, they do acknowledge that there was a fire, reports of a fire. They say they see reports of civilians being harmed as well and they are conducting a review of the incident. Now, we know a large fire did break out in that area. There are horrific images on social media. There are images obtained by CNN where we see the bodies and the injured being pulled from those burning tents. Now, we saw firefighters, paramedics, also the displaced desperately trying to put those fires out. Now, also earlier this Sunday, we saw Hamas fire eight missiles at Israeli territory, and for the first time since the end of January, they targeted Tel Aviv. There were no reports of casualties, but we heard from the Israeli military that Hamas is operating in Rafah, they have hostages in Rafah, and this is why they need to operate there. But the fact, of course, that more than seven months, well over seven months into this war, Hamas is still able to fire rockets into Israeli territory does raise questions and it does also put more pressure on the Israeli government to come up with not just a military strategy, but also a political plan for the day after the war.

I think the significance of this weekend was bigger in denying Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the nomination because the Libertarians have ballot access in far more states than he has been able to achieve so far, and if he had gained their nomination, it would have made him more of a factor in the election. So, on balance, keeping Kennedy away from that ballot access is probably something that both parties prefer at this point, but as I said, I think it said more about the party than it did about the candidates, and they're likely headed toward a smaller share of the vote again in '24 as they were in '20, as opposed to 2016 when they had a former New Mexico governor as their nominee, and they actually did win, I think, over four million votes.",

If there is a hung jury and Trump is not convicted, or if he is. But I think if he is convicted, obviously that crosses a threshold for voters. I mean, we have seen in polling, in theory, that there is a slice of voters who say they're extremely reluctant to make Trump president again if he is a convicted felon. I'm not sure, based on the actual behavior we've seen in polls that that would play out quite as much as some surveys are suggesting, but it would be a threshold that voters cross. Trump has kind of set himself up to argue, you know, argue it round and argue it flat, as the lawyers say. If he is not convicted, he will say the case was so biased and bogus that even a jury in one of the most blue jurisdictions in the country could not find against him. If he is convicted, they'll simply say it was a blue state that went against him. I think the scary part of this, from the point of view of the overall kind of health of American democracy, is this expanding argument on the right that not only are prosecutors and local officials biased against Republicans in these blue jurisdictions, but you can't even trust a jury of ordinary citizens. In essence, that was the argument the Texas governor Greg Abbott gave when he pardoned someone who killed a Black Lives Matter protester after they'd been convicted in liberal Travis County, Texas. I mean, it's a kind of soft secession to essentially say that only Republican constituencies can be trusted to judge whether, you know, Republican officials should be held accountable.

They said, quote: We have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone. It's surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves but we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It's a nightmare. Life wasn't always easy for Grayson. They went on and although he took his own life, we know he rest peacefully now. Please, honor Grayson by being kind to one another. If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else. Grayson Murray was just 30 years old, a talented golfer who publicly battled his demons. But when he was 22, he owned his PGA Tour card and quickly won his first PGA Tour event just a few weeks later. He later said that such rapid success was both a blessing and a curse. Despite is phenomenal talent, he struggled both on and off the course with anxiety, mental health issues, and alcohol abuse. But he never tried to hide his challenges from the world.",
