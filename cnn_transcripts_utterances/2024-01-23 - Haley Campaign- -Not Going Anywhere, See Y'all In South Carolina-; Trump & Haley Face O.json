Nikki Haley's campaign manager releasing this memo, a very detailed, lengthy memo addressing the critics who say that tonight is a make-or-break night for Nikki Haley. Among other things, the memo reads. We aren't going anywhere.And adds, we've heard multiple members of the press say New Hampshire is the best. It's going to get for Nicky due to independence and unaffiliated voters being able to vote in the Republican primary. The reality is that the path through Super Tuesday includes more states than not that have this dynamic. Until then, everyone should take a deep breath. Let's discuss what's going on with two special guests. CNN political analyst, the Vice President of digital content, and the host of TheGrio Weekly, Natasha Alford. Also, with us right now. Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton. Shermichael, what do you make of this memo? I assume you've read it now.",

So that way, they can own the narrative about whatever happens tonight.But what I think really matters is about moral courage. Nikki Haley has not gone all the way in terms of her honest assessment and critiques of Donald Trump. This whole idea of him being 80 years old, somehow being a problem, let's be real. When he's at those rallies, he's talking for hours, right? He has energy. He's able to use his charisma to really persuade and motivate those voters. So, let's stop using that line. It doesn't work. The Chaos follows him everywhere he goes. It's a really passive statement. Why is the chaos following him, right? It's not -- it's not something that's just happening.",

But he's able to persuade people by the way that he talks about the confidence that he has. And so, she has all of this arsenal that she has not used because she's still tiptoeing, trying to curry favor with certain voters. And until she does that, until she shows them more moral courage to say, Donald Trump is the wrong president for this moment, not just then, but the wrong president right now, I think she's going to miss an opportunity.",

And when you start doing your voter profiles to figure out who are your voters that you need to target and engage and ultimately turn out, if I'm advising Governor Haley, I'm thinking OK, New Hampshire, moderate leaning independents. I'm looking at South Carolina.We're probably going to lose if we decide to stay in but we're going to give it our all. The governor endorsed Trump or both U.S. senators have endorsed Trump. A litany of U.S. Congress members have now endorsed Trump. Several major evangelical pastors in the state, I know the state very well, Wolf, have now also endorsed a former president. So, you're looking to Super Tuesday. I'm looking at states like maybe Massachusetts, maybe Idaho, a few other states that are more moderate leaning that she could pick up delegates potentially. But what the reality is, the math isn't there. She'll always be playing catch up to Donald Trump. You need 1215 to become the Republican nominee.

Kamala Harris has seized this issue. She was out in Wisconsin this week talking about it and speaking about it with a passion that we haven't seen before. So, I think it's effective. But also, beyond abortion, what else is the message, right? They have to hone in on that economic message. Because right now that is what people care about.
