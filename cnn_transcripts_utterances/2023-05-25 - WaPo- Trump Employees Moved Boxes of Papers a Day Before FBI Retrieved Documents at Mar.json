      "sentences": "360\"We have two big stories breaking tonight. New word the debt ceiling talks maybe -- maybe -- yielding progress. We're going to talk to Senator Bernie Sanders shortly. But we begin tonight with new reporting that paints a remarkable picture just how much evidence federal investigators may have to show the former president obstructed justice in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. It comes tonight from \"The Washington Post\" and the headline is stunning: \"Trump workers moved Mar-a-Lago boxes a day before FBI came for documents.\" New details including alleged dress rehearsal for moving sensitive papers show a focus on Donald Trump's instructions and intent. Now in a moment, we'll talk to legal analyst, Elie Honig who joins us, but first political investigations and enterprise reporter, Josh Dawsey who shares a byline on the breaking story. Josh, can you just lay out the sequence of events at Mar-a-Lago based on your reporting? JOSH DAWSEY, POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ENTERPRISE REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Sure. So in May of 2022, federal prosecutors subpoena former President Trump for all classified documents that he still has in his possession. After that period of time, some of the boxes that are in the storage room are moved into other parts of Mar- a-Lago. One day before federal prosecutors come to pick up the subpoenaed material, on June 3rd, the boxes are moved back into a storage room. On June 3rd, prosecutors are taken to the storage room and said this is where all the classified documents are held. You cannot look through the boxes, but this is where they're all held. And Trump's aide, sent an attestation that say everything that is classified had been given back. Obviously, we know now that not to be true. There were more than a hundred classified documents, they were all over parts of the residence. So what's interesting of prosecutors is, why were the boxes moved in and out of the storage room in that period of time? And why were they moved back one day before federal authorities came to search the area?",

The boxes were put in the storage room. All of this was kind of much ado about nothing. And what witnesses have said is that's not true. There were certain documents that he had a particular affinity for, that he would show visitors when they came, but he would keep in his office.",

What was he going to do with these documents? He wasn't posting them online. He wasn't as far as we know, selling them to anyone.

And if he talked like that, though, he probably wouldn't get anywhere close to the Republican nomination, Anderson. And so that's the big problem right now. Who is going to step up in the chiasm and actually speak like a president, think like a president, unite the country, bring our values back together, and talk to people in a common sense way, instead of listening to political consultants, tell him well, you've got to get further to the right of Donald Trump, because if he falls out of the race, you're going to be the guy that takes over, and you've got to get his base.

You and I both know there's 144 million people that do not vote that are registered to vote and with the right messaging, you could bring a lot of young people into that campaign. I did like what Governor DeSantis said about Bitcoin the other night on Twitter Spaces. There's stuff that he's doing that makes sense.

And so now that Governor DeSantis has done that, I think it's going to be hard for the Democrats to want to take that lane. I hope they consider that because I do take Elon Musk at his word, that he's trying to broaden out that platform and make that platform a platform for free speech.

General Hertling, I mean, in terms of Ukraine's fight against Russia, are these cross-border raiders effective either strategically or psychologically or in any way?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: In all those ways, Anderson, whenever you're conducting raids or faints or demonstrations, it causes the enemy to take a look at what they're doing, where they're defending. What you're talking about along the border between Ukraine and Russia on the eastern part of the country is close to probably 1,000 kilometers, 600, 700 miles. The Russians cannot defend across that entire length and breath. So anytime you have a raid like this that gets in very quickly, causes a little bit of disruption in some chaos, and then moves out very quickly. You see the enemy reacting to that just like the Russians did. The Russians claim they killed 70 of these raiders. It's just not true. You can tell by talking to that commander just now that he didn't lose a whole lot of people. In fact, he said he lost one soldier and two were wounded, but it caused a lot of disruption on the Russian side.",

It's just a 1,000 knife cuts against Russia, and it's all part of shaping operations for the Ukrainians to determine where the weak spots are in the lines, where they can attack, and how the Russian forces are moving their elements around to address different threats coming from unexpected directions.",
