I would also state, and I want to make sure that I say this because they've been very, very helpful, the Brookfield Power Company owns two dams, operates two dams in this area and they've been very cooperative, you know, they live it every day. So, as an example, one of the things that we're doing -- the river currently runs at like 8,500 cubic square feet per second.And when they tighten the dam tools down, they actually lower that down to like 5,500 cubic feet, right. Does that mean anything to you? What it means to us is that, that current, if we can slow that current down, we can lower the amount of water in the river, it's certainly easier for us to work. It's easier for our divers to see in clearer water than muddier water. If it's a foot lower than it was before, it's easier for us to work. And there's different searches, obviously, but unfortunately people lose their lives and bodies of the water on a regular basis. So, this is something, that we're trying to dial in But yes, sir, right here. You. Yes.",

Certainly, our people and our community members. So, we want to make sure that we do that right.

And frankly, no one knows if he is alive and has fled, or put distance between him and the scene, or whether he is dead. I say that because one of the things recovered yesterday was a note. Investigators I spoke to characterized it as a suicide note, meaning it was written with a mindset that whoever was reading it would be reading it after Robert Card was no longer around.So, we're in a process of elimination, which is they've probably completed their search of the woods immediately by that boat launch, but then that leaves them with the water. Now, there's two possibilities. One is that he's in that water, that he drowned himself, and went forward with what might be a suicide after his homicides. Or the other is, here's an individual who at one time had a small boat registered to him, currently has a jet ski registered to him, that he could have used that lake area that feeds into a river, and made a left out to the ocean, or a right inland where he could have found a landing place, a switch car. But these are all the unknowns that as we come up on that 48-hour mark they've got to start to walkthrough and try and eliminate. And eliminating that body of water is something that's going to take a while and a lot of effort but it's an important step.

In fact, I -- the future part of that press conference was really odd to tell us what they're about to do. I don't need to know that. I need to know what you've done and I need to know how -- if I'm in that community, how this is going to look today, tomorrow and the weeks to come.We need to get it -- they need to get into a battle rhythm, and that includes what are the standards to end the shelter-in-place. The police briefer said there's a continuing conversation. With whom? I mean, what are the standards? The community is now inside? And so, I am maybe at the, sort of, lose patient stage of this. I want to be clear here. The focus on finding him is clearly one that I respect and applaud. I am not undermining it. But there is a second part to public safety, and that is public trust. And I fear that they are losing it not because they haven't found him. People understand that. People -- it's the woods. They understand that. It's that there's just no details about how life is going to begin again.
