Bickford has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. The security package, not just crowd control and traffic, but whatthey call the counterterrorism overlay includes a network of cameras, NYPD counter sniper teams in skyscrapers above, bomb detection canines moving around the perimeter, dogs that can pick up the whiff of explosives, even moving through a crowd 100 feet away, radiation detectors worn by police on the street, and an especially equipped NYPD helicopter high above. Police are also focused on potential demonstrations. The war between Israel and Hamas has brought on protests in New York and clashes with police when some protesters announce their intent to disrupt the lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.

Like, I'm sorry. Like it is - it is lost cause revisionary history of things. It is why there are monuments that were built after the Civil War, after the reconstruction, to confederate generals. It's why there are military bases named after confederate generals. Really bad confederate generals, by the way, Braxton Bragg. And when you use that language, if you're aware of any of this stuff, it's not simple. It's not, oh, there was also this. You keep saying, we're from the south, of course it was about slavery.

Either, you know, be a Donald Trump, be outrageous, say how you feel, or be a DeSantis, say that you are anti-CRT. But don't try to sort of play both sides. And so you lose when you do that.

They found her comments from 2010. She also had comments in 2019 in her book that she wrote. She was referencing removing that flag, right, in 2015, after the horrific killing at the Mother Emmanuel Church. And she says in that book that in 2019 she was calling it - she calls it again, lost cause, language here, the flag is a symbol of heritage and service and its tradition. In 2023, as a woman from the south, a woman of color, to keep going back to that, maybe it does mean tradition and service.

It's just say the obvious thing that is the truth. And, to me, that's insulting to voters, right? They can take it. They can take it. It's a fact. And to kind of try to like wobble around this thing is such a strange hill to die on, in a way. And - and so you look ahead to, OK, what does that mean now? It's -- people, to your point, just can't -- what can you trust if she can't just call it out and tell you what she thinks. And, look, Donald Trump, people don't - there are - listen, people have very strong opinions on what he has to say.
