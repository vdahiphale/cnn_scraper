Now we went to -- we think is that area near a railway line; saw several craters outside the compound, smoke emerging from there, firefighters still taking cover because a common tactic now of Russian forces has been what's known as the double tap missile. One missile hits the target and then, minutes later when first responders are in place, trying to rescue, trying to deliver care, another missile comes in, simply to, I think restricts Ukraine's ability to deal with situations like that and spark horror amongst people. That was particularly effective in Kharkiv. Today seven dead; you mentioned 23 injured. Those noises ringing out across the city of over 1 million, increasingly common, frankly. Just at the weekend, seven killed at another double tap missile attack at a lakeside resort outside of the city.

That -- there's no clear sense of exactly where that will lead as you well know. Those negotiations have been stalled over the last few weeks since talks last broke down over that Egyptian framework agreement. We reported earlier this week, of course, that the Egyptians seemed to have offered -- come up with one proposal with the Israelis and then quietly made changes to that proposal. Submitting it to Hamas, leaving a lot of the other mediators unclear on what Hamas had agreed to when they came out with that agreement, saying that they had reached a ceasefire deal. It only later became clear that the Egyptians had actually made -- quietly made changes to that proposal in order to try and get Hamas' sign-off. And that was a considerable problem leading to the current impasse. But of course, the reality is that it is the substance as well, where these two sides, Israel and Hamas, still remain very far apart; in particular, over Hamas' insistence that this round of negotiations lead to a permanent end to the war in a second phase of an eventual agreement. Now as all of this is happening, we're still watching the start-and-stop efforts to get sufficient humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. That Rafah border crossing still remains closed. And we're also watching as that floating pier that the U.S. military anchored to the shore of the Gaza coastline last week is having trouble getting up off the ground in terms of the amount of aid that the U.S. had expected could get in through that pier. They had talked about some 90 trucks. It has slowly started to ramp up with the Israeli military saying that, yesterday, 27 trucks entered Gaza via that floating pier. That included 371 pallets of humanitarian aid. The Israeli military also says that 281 trucks were processed via the Kerem Shalom crossing as well as the Western Erez crossing, which is in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Those numbers have been disputed, however, by humanitarian aid groups who say that, even if those aid trucks are making it through the security checks to the other side of the Gaza border, that doesn't necessarily mean that aid groups are able to actually go and pick those trucks up and begin to distribute them throughout the Gaza Strip. So as we have watched about 1 million people being displaced over the course of the last several weeks, humanitarian aid groups say that there has been -- have been significant difficulties in getting that aid not only into Gaza but then getting it to the people who need it the most.",

So I think that this is a time when Iran's neighbors want to reassure Iran, want to make sure that they're not the victims of any aggression from Iran. If you're from Hamas or Hezbollah or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, you want to make sure those relationships are still intact. There were a couple of surprises for me. I didn't expect the president of Tunisia to go to Iran. I thought that was rather strange, since he's a known anti-Islamicist -- or at least he has been.

I also thought it was interesting to see him in attendance. We've certainly seen an outward showing of fellowship by regional countries, like where I am here, the UAE, and Saudi, for example, who have, just in the past 18 months, realigned.

We also have to look to a body called the assembly of experts, which nominally chooses the supreme leader when one passes away. And they just had elections -- excuse me -- for the assembly of experts. We have some old faces and some new faces moving up in that body. I think we mentioned in our piece a man named Ali Reza al-Rafi, who is a cleric, who is well-established in the system and is now the deputy head of the management body for the assembly of experts. And of course, there are others.

O'BRIEN (voice-over):  The encampments initially sprang up after the university issued a fine of more than $230,000 to its students union because previous student protests over other issues blocked entry to the famous Book of Kells. A major tourist attraction and revenue generator for the university, which welcomes more than 1 million paying visitors every year.",

In five days we brought the college to the negotiating tableand five days all it took to get our university to commit to cutting ties with apartheid Israel. O'BRIEN (voice-over):  The day after the encampment was set up, public solidarity protests took hold of the street outside the gates of Trinity. The Monday after saw the first meeting between Trinity, the students' union and the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement or BDS. And only five days since the encampment began, Trinity gave in to student demands and announced it would divest financially from Israel.",

O'BRIEN (voice-over):  Trinity says, it, quote, \"abhors and condemns the disproportionate onslaught in Gaza,\" and has also decried Hamas' attacks on October 7th. The students union and BDS say they will closely monitor the outcome of the task force and ensure the university sticks to its promises while the original fine against the students union has now been dropped. They hope to inspire other universities to divest, aware that not many have a prized asset, such as the Book of Kells -- Kathy Rose O'Brien, CNN Academy, Dublin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
