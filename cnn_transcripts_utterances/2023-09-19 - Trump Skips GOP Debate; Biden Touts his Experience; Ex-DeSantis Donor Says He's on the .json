And fundraisers is, we have learned, where the president is kind of looser, more willing to speak freely. But it also seems like he was road testing to some degree an argument that I've heard from advisers, but has been less forthcoming publicly. And I want to ask you about this because you had this great story over the weekend about the difference between where Democratic national party leadership is and where actual voters in their party are.The president said in part, and this is behind the scenes, quote, \"a lot of people seem focused on my age. Believe me, I know better than anyone. When this nation was flat on its back, I knew what to do. When democracy was at stake, I knew what to do.\" Also had very sharp criticism and pointed criticism of the former president. Almost head out -- taking on the age issue head on. LISA LERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Exactly. And that's a fascinating little twist in this whole ongoing question about the president's age. We know from surveys, from focus groups, from interviews with voters that this is a top concern for rank and file Democratic voters that I think there was -- sort of Biden made this implicit promise in the first run to Democratic primary voters where he said, look, elect me and I'll stabilize things for you. They saw Trump as this existential threat. I'll beat him. I'm your best shot at beating him. And I think a lot of those voters didn't really think about a second term or the possibility of an 86-year-old second term president, and now they are. And they're concerned. And the problem - the reason the issue is so salient is it's something everybody knows. Everybody has an elderly parent or a grandparent or they're ageing themselves. Everybody knows about age. And so the decision by the president to start to move towards taking this issue on -- head on, as you point out, is really of a - a kind of acknowledgment of how damaging this is with his base in some ways.",

But you talked to him about the biggest -- one of the biggest concerns among Democrats which is age, which is Biden's age.Let's listen to this exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): I couldn't imagine three years ago that this president could accomplish so much in such a short period of time. I mean that. If this political season is all about a celebrity, with all due respect, we had a celebrity for four years. It didn't go well. And so I want a seasoned pro that knows how to get things done. I'm a little old fashioned. I want a guy who produces results. And the results are in. It's been a master class. There's simply no administration in my lifetime that's been more effective producing more substantive results. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We didn't see him out very much on the national level prior to, I don't know, the last couple of months. And we -- I would even say the last few weeks. And there is a view among I think a fair number of Democrats that - that the message, that the Biden/Harris message isn't getting out, isn't penetrating. And he is a unique messenger. He is somebody who now the Biden campaign does see as somebody who can say what he just said, who can make the argument for why the first two and a half years from the point of view of Democrats should have - should be something to celebrate and he deserves -- they both deserve a second term.And he's trying to fill a messaging vacuum. And, of course, that leads to the obvious question, which is, is it -- does it help him in the long-term? Maybe. I mean as you heard in that interview, he denied any interest in 2024, which he's done in the past. He even said that he hasn't even thought about running for president ever.",
