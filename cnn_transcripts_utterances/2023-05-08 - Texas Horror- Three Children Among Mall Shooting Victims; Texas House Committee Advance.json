Over the weekend, a man gunned down several people at a mall in Allen, Texas, near Dallas. At least eight people were killed. Seven others wounded. Police are investigating whether the gunman who was killed by a cop at the scene was motivated by right wing extremism. This is not a monthly occurrence in the United States. It is not a weekly occurrence in the United States. This is now happening every day. We're only 128 days until 2023, and there's already been 202 mass shootings of the United States so far, according to the gun violence archive. We define mass shooting as one for more people are injured or killed, not including the gunman. Two hundred two, that's more mass shootings than there have been days. Not even close. In Texas, well, Texas is the unfortunate sanction to being home to some of the worst deadliest, mass shootings that this country has ever seen, especially in recent years. Just last year in Uvalde, Texas, a gunman killed 21 people at Robb Elementary School, including 19 fourth graders and two teachers inside their classrooms. In 2019, at a Walmart in El Paso, 23 lives lost, 23 killed, when a gunman opened fire after spewing racist rhetoric online. In 2018, at Santa Fe High School outside Houston, ten people killed when a student opened fire with a revolver and shotgun belonging to his father. In 2017, Sutherland Springs 26 people killed during Sunday services, at First Baptist Church. In 2016 in Dallas, five officers shot to death when a gunman targeted police in a Black Lives Matter protest. These are just some of the mass shootings in Texas that I've covered for you, from this desk, just some of them. Some of the ones that made national headlines. There are many more that don't get covered, not to mention of fewer than four people, and the accidental shootings, and the suicide. Almost every time Texas is devastated by gun violence, we hear a familiar refrain from the man who has been governor during this whole time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R), TEXAS: What Texas is doing in a big time way, we're working to address that anger and violence by going to its root cause, which is addressing the mental health problems behind it. We as a state, we as a society need to do a better job with mental how, anybody who shoots somebody else, has a mental health challenge, period. We all know this is something that we must address as a nation, but also as a state. And that is for all of us to do a better job to address mental health issues. (END VIDEO CLIPS)",

Didn't know if it was a boy or girl, couldn't tell. I immediately got that person about 15 feet around the corner so the child wouldn't see anymore than what they had experienced.

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, you know, Carroll's attorneys really focused in on fact that Donald Trump was not here. He didn't appear for any part calling him a no-show, saying -- asking a jury to say, if you were falsely accused of rape, wouldn't you run into court to defend yourself, hammering again to the jury that Trump did not come here, did not look at them in the eye and deny these claims.Now, they also said even though Trump wasn't here, the jury did see his video deposition and arguing to the jury that Trump was actually a witness against himself. They pointed out his testimony when he was shown the photo of him having met Carroll at a gala several years before the assault and mistakes Carroll in a picture for his second wife Marla Maples. They're saying, look, she is -- he is admitting right then and there that Carroll is his type. They also point to the \"Access Hollywood\" tape which was played repeatedly to the jury again today. And o that tape, you know, Trump says he just kisses women, he grabs them, he's a star, he can do what he want. And, Carroll's lawyer said to the jury, look, this is a confession. This is Trump saying how he treats women in his own words. He also reminded the jury about the other women who came forward and testified about their allegations of assault, saying that this establishes a pattern of how Trump views women. You know, and to find Trump guilty, they said, excuse me, to find in Trump's favor, the jury would have to conclude that everyone else was lying when they testified. Now, Trump's attorney came back out saying Trump didn't have to appear today because this didn't happen. They argued to the jury about Carroll's attorneys. They want you to hate him enough to ignore the facts. And what they're focusing in on were parts of Carroll's story, her allegations they say just didn't make sense. You know, they also argued to the jury that Carroll colluded with her friends, inspired by a \"Law and Order\" episode in 2012. You know, Carroll's attorneys, you know, of course, have argued that Carroll said that she didn't see this episode at the time that she came out with her story and to this day hasn't seen it. Closing arguments finished today. Tomorrow morning the judge will read the instruction to the jury on the law and deliberations will begin.",

      "sentences": "Carroll is seeking some monetary damages in this case. Now, her lawyers today said they weren't asking for a specific amount saying Carroll was here to reclaim her name. They had an expert testify that the damage she sustained from Trump's statements could add up to at least $2.7 million.Now, Trump, though, also could face reputational damage because if the jury does find him liable, there's going to be boxes that they check. But they could find him liable for rape and that would mean that he lied about these allegations to Carroll. But even Carroll's own attorney today in these closing arguments said that Trump was elected, even though all these allegations of sexual assault were public, so likely would not affect any of his chances for re-election, Jake.",
