      "sentences": "Protesters in Israel are reaching out directly to Joe Biden to break the deadlock over freeing hostages held in Gaza. Have a look. This was the scene from just one demonstration.A massive banner, you can see there, asking the U.S. President not only for help getting those captives out, but actually saving them from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Some protesters clashed with police after voicing anger at the government in this rally, demanding that Netanyahu resign and that elections be held. All this coming after Biden laid out what he calls a new Israeli ceasefire proposal. The U.N., the U.K., France, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are all expressing support for the plan, with mediators in Qatar and Egypt calling on Israel and Hamas to finalize the details. Joining us now is journalist Elliott Gotkine in Tel Aviv. So, Elliott, Biden's announcement of this peace proposal still reverberating strongly in Israel. What's the latest? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Very much so, Kim. I think the key point to remember here is that the ceasefire proposal, which was conveyed to the world by President Biden in that very detailed statement on Friday, is the ceasefire proposal that was greenlit by Prime Minister Netanyahu and the other two members of his war cabinet. So I think what we're seeing from Netanyahu, when he came out with an unusual statement on the Jewish Sabbath, which he doesn't usually do, in which he said that any ceasefire proposal must not preclude Israel from fulfilling its war objectives. And he reiterated what the conditions for a full cessation of hostilities, which comes in phase two of the three-phase ceasefire proposal, were -- and these are mainly to destroy the military and governance capabilities of Hamas, to get all of the hostages, 125 or so, living and dead, back from Gaza after they were abducted during the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, get them back into Israel. And then thirdly, to ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. So I think what Netanyahu is trying to do is to clarify that, yes, this is Israel's ceasefire proposal, but that it doesn't preclude Israel from fulfilling those war objectives. Now, the ball is now in Hamas' court to make a final decision or announcement in terms of its position. Its initial reaction, it said, was positive and that it would deal with these proposals constructively. But I think also what Netanyahu was trying to do by getting this statement out during the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday was to preempt the inevitable blowback that he was going to get from the far-right members of his governing coalition and which duly arrived at the end of the Jewish Sabbath when the far-right ministers put out statements saying that this deal is tantamount to a capitulation to Hamas, that it is a defeat for Israel, they wouldn't support it, and if it goes ahead, they would pull out of the governing coalition. Now, that doesn't mean that the deal couldn't still get across the line with support from the opposition, and Yair Lapid, the opposition leader, says that he would support a deal if the government greenlights it. But, inevitably, it could mean the demise of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government. It would mean fresh elections. And an opinion poll suggests that if elections were to be held tomorrow, Netanyahu would lose. So no doubt, Kim, that is something else that is playing on his mind.",

      "sentences": "So, look, he said he was thrilled to be invited. It's not his first rodeo. He's done it several times before. And he said that he will present the justness of Israel's cause in its fight against terrorism and against Hamas, which, of course, the United States designates as a terrorist organization.And I suppose he's also going to be trying to convince any wavering lawmakers, particularly among Democrats, that they are on the right side by supporting Israel and by standing by it. Of course, we've seen some weapons shipments being paused as a result of differences between the Biden administration and Israel. So I think Netanyahu, on the one hand, trying to, you know, ensure that he's still got the lawmakers in the United States on side. But I think also for his domestic audience to remind Israelis that he has the ear not just of the president, but also of lawmakers in the United States, that they can put their trust in him. And that's certainly from his perspective. He is the only person that can represent Israel's interests with the United States, whether it's in collaboration with the United States or standing up to the United States. So I think those are pretty much the reasons why Netanyahu is, in his words, so thrilled to be invited to Congress by all four leaders, Democrat and Republican, to speak to Congress on an undefined date in the future.

Thanks so much.New York is ramping up security for its annual Israel Day parade, which kicks off in just a few hours. Officials say the elaborate security plan is similar to the one used for New Year's Eve in Times Square. Police say they will not tolerate any violence or disorder after recent clashes with protesters in the city, but added that there are no specific or credible threats to the parade. This will be the first parade since the war began, so the usually joyful celebration will take a somber tone. Ukraine's largest hydroelectric dam is in critical condition after a barrage of Russian strikes on the country's power grid. That's according to regional military leaders who spoke after the sixth wave of Russian attacks on the energy system in recent weeks. Officials say traffic around the Dnipro power plant is completely blocked after Saturday's attacks, and people in the area have to use detours to get around. Ukraine's energy ministry has imposed emergency blackouts in some parts of the country. Now, in the last hour, I spoke with Rebekah Maciorowski, a U.S. volunteer who serves as a combat medic in Ukraine, and I asked her how much the war is different now compared to the early days of the war.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government has hosted Vladimir Putin in Beijing within the last month. Xi Jinping describing Putin as a dear friend, and the two leaders have met dozens of times. This was only one of the flashpoints of disagreement that came up at this annual conference. You did have a meeting between the Secretary of Defense of the U.S. and the Chinese Minister of Defense last year. There were no formal face-to-face talks. So, in a way, that's perceived as an improvement. But there was -- there were still major areas of criticism. The Chinese Minister of Defense this morning accusing the U.S. of stirring up trouble in Taiwan, for example, accusing the newly elected Taiwanese government of being separatists and saying, quote, \"that they will be nailed to the pillar of shame of history\" and accusing the U.S. of dumping weapons in Taiwan, also having criticism for the Philippines for its ongoing territorial dispute and skirmishes with the Chinese Coast Guard in the South China Sea.
