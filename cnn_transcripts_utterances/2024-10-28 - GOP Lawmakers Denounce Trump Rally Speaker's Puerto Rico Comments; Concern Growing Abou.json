      "sentences": "All right, why are Republicans so nervous about those comments right there? Well, it has to do, as I said, with one of the most important voting blocs in one of the most important places, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, you'll remember, the commonwealth -- Joe Biden won it by just 81,000 votes in 2020. Donald Trump won it by 44,000 votes in 2016. So you get the idea. It's really close in Pennsylvania.OK, there are around 600,000 by some counts -- 600,000 Latino voters -- I'll put an L right there -- in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Around, by some counts, 300,000 Puerto Rican voters in the state of Pennsylvania -- the third-highest Puerto Rican population in the entire country. You will notice one thing about these two numbers here. They're both way bigger -- way bigger than the margin in Pennsylvania the last two elections. They are a key voting bloc in the commonwealth. And it's not just the numbers; it's where they are in the commonwealth. Let's focus in here. Now, the darker the shade the greater the population. And there are a few places that are pushing 30, 40, 50 percent Hispanic population. I'm going to circle them right here around these three counties and these two counties here. And if I take out this filter and go back to the main map what you can see is that four years ago Joe Biden won three of these counties; Donald Trump really won two. And they're some of the swingiest in this swing commonwealth. Let's just push in. Everyone knows Joe Biden, of course, is from Scranton, Lackawanna County. He got 53 percent there. It's really tight. Nearby Wilkes-Barre in Luzerne County, Donald Trump won that. But again, 56 to 42. Pretty tight there. You go a little bit south here. Reading is Berks County. Donald Trump, 53 percent. Again, very close. Maybe the most telling is Lehigh County. That's where Allentown is. People know the Billy Joel song from Allentown. But Lehigh County has had huge demographic shifts over the years. It has nearly a 50 percent Hispanic population. And you can see Joe Biden won 53 percent of the vote there, 98,000 votes. He was able to get 17,000 votes more than Hillary Clinton did. This is often seen -- Lehigh County -- as one of the most important swing counties in the entire country. A huge Puerto Rican population, Kate. You can understand -- you can understand why Republicans are nervous about this campaign. Kamala Harris was in Pennsylvania talking to Puerto Rican voters while they were being made, Kate.",

And I can tell you from what I've seen doing a lot of races around the country the MAGA brand is deeply unpopular and brings Republicans down. And I think a week out from the election this being kind of the last big image of the campaign is going to be bad for Trump. And I hear May on what Trump may have said in his speech but, quite frankly, what's being clipped and what's being sent out there, especially in Latino communities, isn't anything he said. It's all the other divisive stuff that was said by his surrogates. And that's not the way you close a campaign eight days out.",

At the same time, we have seen leading up to this point -- this isn't the first time that there has -- even Donald Trump himself has said something that would -- you would view as offensive to Latinos.One thing we have seen though since 2016 to now is he's making gain -- he's made gains with Latino voters. Kamala Harris is seeing less support among Latino voters and other Democrats. He is making gains from where he was in 2016.

In fact, better with Latino voters than Joe Biden did in 2020.So I think that with a week out we have still a few number of undecided voters. They're tuning in. And I think if they're tuning in and they're seeing this MAGA movement on full display -- the bizarre, hateful rhetoric -- I think that's going to turn a lot of people away. And I think it also turns a lot of other voters away -- suburban voters that are up for grabs. So I think what we're seeing from the campaign -- from the Harris campaign is an aggressive, targeted effort to actually match or do better than where Biden did in '20, and she's on track I think to do that.

By many assessments he was frightened by this. She's a woman. She's a woman of color. She's a prosecutor. She's all sorts of things that he normally doesn't have to answer to. And suddenly she was rising in the polls and he's in a fight for his political life. And in so many ways -- you know about it -- obviously if he were to lose this, all of the cases against him, his business empire, his personal wealth, and his image of a winner goes out the window if he loses again this time after losing the last time.

That's a difficult thing to do. Yes, they very seamlessly took the Biden organization and stepped into it, and that gave them a framework to run with. But she had to define herself to the whole nation. That's hard for vice presidents because they're always in the shadow of a president.

It recommends a Mediterranean diet specifically. That includes nuts and healthy fats. It says a low-fat diet does not have as much of an impact on reducing risk. And it recommends to avoid sitting too much during the day, so avoid having a sedentary lifestyle. But for the first time, John, the recommendations include mention of GLP-1 drugs. Those are those popular diabetes and weight loss drugs. And it says that GLP-1 medications are effective in lowering the risk of stroke, and people with diabetes, and people with high cardiovascular risks. So these drugs include Ozempic, for instance. And this is a major development to have GLP-1 drugs mentioned in these recommendations. The recommendations also specifically mention women and monitoring blood pressure during pregnancy -- postpartum. They recommend also monitoring during menopause. And for the first time the recommendations say that transgender women taking estrogens also should be monitored as that has been identified as having an increased risk of stroke.
