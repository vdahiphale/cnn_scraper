Right now, Hurricane Idalia is barreling toward Florida's gulf coast and is expected to make landfall as a category 3 storm or stronger overnight. The storm is rapidly intensifying as it travels through a warmer than normal Gulf of Mexico. The majority of Florida's counties are now under a state of emergency. Schools are closed, airports have been shuttered and hospitals are moving the patients that they can move to safer locations. Cities around the eye of the hurricane are predicted to possibly see more than 12 feet of storm surge with winds more than 100 miles per hour. We are just getting in some new video. This is out of Key West, where residents are already starting to feel the storm's effects. Moments ago, this dire warning from the mayor of Cedar Key, near where the storm is expected to make landfall. The mayor estimating around 100 people remain in his town. He's urging them, pleading with them to leave. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Even had a tornado warning near Marco island not that long ago, St. Petersburg, jut a gust of 31 miles per hour as all of these bands come on by, one closer to the eye than the next, the wind will begin to pick up one band after another. There's your 90 mile-per-hour-storm and it is still like you said in this very, very warm water. And we are going to see surge. The surge is going to be 12 to 15 feet in places. Now, the good news is there's not much many people there, not many people, that much land there. That's great news. But the people that are there need to leave right now. Cedar Key, Steinhatchee, those places are going to be mostly under water. Here's what it looks like here, and this is what the radar is going to look like.

And it's pretty desolate here. The beach behind me is empty, and that's how officials want it. This is a mandatory evacuation zone, zone A. And the reason for that is because the danger here is the storm surge, what Bill was just talking about, as that hurricane moves towards the coast, over those very warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the concern is that the storm will continue to gather more and more strength and storm surge will affect these low-lying areas, where we are right now. I just want to show you, we have been watching all morning as some of the wars of this hotel were lining up these sand bags. As you can see, they are lined up all across the sidewalk here. The beach is over beyond us, but this area is expected to get at least 4 to 7 feet of water once that storm surge comes in, if it does come in tonight into tomorrow morning. So these sandbags are here, but when we're talking about 4 to 7 feet of water, it really might not do a whole lot. Now, the area where we are, there are a lot of hotels, a lot of resorts, this is an area where a lot of tourism takes place, but the place is pretty empty. In fact, the hotel where we are staying, guests were told to evacuate by 11:00 this morning. And even as we were coming into town late last night, you could see that it was pretty desolate. A lot of the stores, the restaurants had shut down. So it does look like people are heeding those warnings.

Those are the things we're most confident about, was well as this rise in average wind speed intensity, 3 percent increase for 2 degree warming scenario.In terms of the numbers of storms that are going to affect the U.S., that's very much an open question. There's no long-term trend by the way in U.S. land-falling hurricanes, and the models are somewhat divided on whether they are going to be fewer storms in the Atlantic basin. There's some indication from models of the storms that are out there in the Atlantic basin, the greater fraction of them will make landfall in the U.S. under a global warming scenario.

And as well, he approved an emergency -- emergency kind of preparedness declaration right away, which helps -- which helps the federal government move quickly to do stuff before it hits on land and also after -- also to prepare for the aftermath. Look, what the FEMA administrator and the federal government has been able to do, they deployed more than 600 federal employees who are prepositioned to help. There are about nine search and rescue teams out there also pre -- pre-deployed. What we are telling people is to make sure that they go to ready.gov to get any information that they need, preparedness tip, and also to make sure that you are -- that you are charging your technology equipment, also to make sure that you're getting food. Just be prepared for what's about to happen. This is an all of government approach that this president is doing. This is what he has done. We've seen in this type of weather.

Why not separate the FEMA dollars from Ukraine dollars so you don't have that problem for those who need this FEMA money as soon as possible?

Look, as in regards to the supplemental funding that the president has asked for, I don't want to get into hypotheticals. The president put forward what he thinks is incredibly important that we need. If you look at Ukraine, the president has been clear. We're going to help the brave people of Ukraine as they are fighting for -- fighting for their freedom, fighting for their democracy in this unprovoked war as we've seen from Russia, and we are going to be there.

I'm excited to ask you this next question, although you might wish that you hadn't stuck around. So, a new \"Associated Press\" poll finds that most Americans believe that President Biden is too old to be president. The poll looked at 80-year-old President Biden versus 77-year-old Donald Trump. Seventy- seven percent of adults say Biden is too old to be president, 51 percent of adults say Trump is too old. And if you look at the breakdown by party, Republicans generally don't think of Trump's age as an issue, but both Democrats and Republicans agree Biden is too old. So here's the question: is the White House worried that questions about President Biden's stamina could ultimately impact whether or not voters will be able to support him for a second term? JEAN-PIERRE: So, I'm going to be careful about 2024. I can't speak to that directly. But --",

The ten -- the first ten tranche of prescription drugs that we just introduced because of the Inflation Reduction Act, and that is the thing that the president is able to do is deliver. Really move forward historic pieces of legislation, change the lives of Americans for generations to come. And that is what we focus on. The president's record and what he's been able to do. Look, people have come after the president about his age. They did in 2019. They did it in 2020 leading into the general election. And they did in 2022. And guess what? He beats them every time because he has his finger on the pulse of what it is that the American people need. He talks about issues that really matter to the American people. And he is delivering. Is there more work to be done? There's always more work to be done, but we are happy to take that on.

Jessica, according to a new court filing, attorney Sidney Powell who even Donald Trump is said to have thought was a nut, I think was his term for it, she's entered a not guilty plea and said she'd waive her arraignment in the case in Fulton County. She's a major figure in Trump's post-election legal challenges. And another codefendant in the Georgia case, Ray Smith, also pleaded not guilty. So of the 19, that's two.
