Ukraine accuses Russia are spreading a fake warning as part of a psychological attack. More now from CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Kyiv.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukrainian special forces fighting up close and taking prisoners. Rare footage of them still inside Russia's Kursk region where British Storm Shadow missiles were claimed to have hit Wednesday, these fragments found by locals. Just hours earlier, American-supplied ATACMS missiles also plowed into Russia, marking a stark new escalation in the war. Yet it was also in Kyiv that fear grew. The U.S. Embassy closing here for the first time since the invasion, citing a threat of air attack. WALSH (on camera): Reflection of the heightened tension here felt in the capital Kyiv. It's been under regular bombardment for over two months, but other European allied embassies are also limiting their function today, perhaps a sense across NATO here that we're entering a new chapter of this conflict. WALSH (voice-over): As Kyiv braced for another sleepless night of sirens, the bereaved planted flags into this sea of loss in central Kyiv. Anya's father died of his injuries three weeks ago after five months in a coma. She is raw from both the talk of peace and fear of sirens. ANYA IVANINA, LOST HER FATHER IN THE WAR (text): I will be honest, we went down to the basement during every air raid siren today. It was really scary indeed. I want peace very much.  I don't want our country to be hurt, I want it to be as it was but without the Russians, without all of this. WALSH (voice-over): But it's never over. In Kyiv, the air raids intensifying in the past two months and the weekends seen here the worst for a while. So, the heightened anxiety behind several NATO embassies reducing operations this day sparks Ukrainian officials to plead, they hold their nerve and deride this piece of Russian misinformation online, a detailed and fake warning of wide scale attacks. This situation should be interpreted, he says, as Russia's attempt to use any elements of psychological influence. They have one instrument, which is to scare. This has always been a classic element of Russian politics. So, I'd like our partners to be more careful as to the information coming from Russia. (END VIDEOTAPE) [02:05:04]",

Russians wouldn't want that and certainly in Beijing, Xi Jinping would tell Putin you are not going to use nuclear weapons. So, I'm not yet convinced that we're at an imminent risk of nuclear weapons, but I do think it's a danger that should not be discounted.",

So, I do think you will see other states recognizing this and recognizing that to have nuclear weapons gives them real coercive and intimidatory power.Now obviously we have nuclear weapons too, so, you know, the deterrence goes both ways, but the West does actually have to deter and we're not deterring at the moment. We are on the receiving end of Russian nuclear threats and we're not really doing anything in response. And I think China will take notice of that in terms of its own nuclear posture. Iran, North Korea, obviously focusing on that, but you will see other states looking at that and thinking, well, maybe we need to have a nuclear option as well.",

And they will then be thrown into the battle in areas such as the Donbas or other areas of Ukraine to try and force the Ukrainians back quickly to create a situation where Ukraine has lost even more territory.And that's even before Trump comes up with some sort of deal that essentially rewards Russian aggression by giving Russia control of territories that gets captured.

But the city itself is not affected and the volcano is not expected to disrupt international air traffic, unlike another volcanic eruption in Iceland 14 years ago. This volcano was dormant for about 800 years before it started erupting in 2021. Scientists say it's now likely to stay active for decades to come.Australia is moving to ban anyone under 16 from using social media, calling it a world-leading reform to protect children from harmful content online. New legislation introduced today would force social media companies to verify users' age or face hefty fines. As Hanako Montgomery reports, the move came after a string of suicides by children who were bullied online. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For all the positive connections, the joy social media can create, it can also quickly strip it away, destroy it forever. KELLY O'BRIEN, MOTHER OF CHARLOTTE O'BRIEN:  I will miss your hugs, your kisses, your laugh, your beautiful, beautiful smile. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  In September, 12-year-old Australian girl, Charlotte O'Brien took her own life, after years being bullied on social media. Her parents quickly joined a political fight to protect children from online harm. The Australian government says the best way to do that is to ban anyone under 16 from using social media.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) MONTGOMERY (on camera):  Now, Rosemary, as you just saw, for grieving parents and for those who support this proposed legislation, these regulations are long overdue. They believe that these new rules would make the internet a safer place for kids and protect them from potentially very harmful content online. But critics argue that there are still many questions the Australian government needs to answer, such as how these regulations will actually come into play and how they'll be enforced. For now, the next step would be for this legislation to pass through the Senate next week, where it will be further deliberated. Rosemary?",
