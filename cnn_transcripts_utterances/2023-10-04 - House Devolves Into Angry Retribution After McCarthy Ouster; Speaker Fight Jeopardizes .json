And as Republicans begin the autopsy on what happened to Kevin McCarthy, they are now doctoring some of the results.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip. And tonight, the fallout intensifies after the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy as House speaker. There is a race underway to replace him but even more intense is the blame game. Some Republicans are pointing the finger at Matt Gaetz, others point to McCarthy and the deal that he himself cut to neuter his own power back in January. But, increasingly, we are hearing more of this, that Democrats are the one to blame for not saving McCarthy. The Republican congressional committee said Democrats on the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus have the spine of a boiled noodle of spaghetti. McCarthy himself echoed that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  I think today was a political decision by the Democrats. And I think the things they have done in the past hurt the institution. You can't do the job if eight people, you have 94 percent or 96 percent of your entire conference, but eight people can partner with the whole other side. How do you govern? (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP:  It's a really good question, but it is one that I think Kevin McCarthy should have been asking himself back in January, because it was McCarthy himself who agreed to those hardliner demands by Republicans to get the speakership, in the 15th round, I should add. Now, it is also odd that he thinks that Democrats should be the one to throw him a lifeline when he green-lit the Biden impeachment inquiry. He gave the January 6th footage to Tucker Carlson, and when just days ago, he blamed Democrats for the almost shutdown. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, there are just a couple of more, what, four or five votes beyond that. So, if you get a sizeable number for both of them, no one is going to be anywhere near.And that, of course, was one of the reasons that McCarthy was elected back last January in the first place, was because he was the only one out there who could get 218 votes. I mean, unless one of them gives way, I think it's going to be a long, difficult process and we may look back at last January when there were 15 rounds and say that was easy. That was a Tea Party compared to what we're going to face this time around. I mean, on a logical basis, you would say Steve Scalise is the next in line, he's the majority leader, he has a lot of support within the conference. One of the problems I think that he faces is real questions about his health. Because of the fact he survived that shooting back if 2017, now he's fighting multiple myeloma.

Clearly, by the end of the year, which is not far from now, if there is not a new injection of funds by Congress, Ukraine is going to lose its support, not obviously from Europe but from the U.S. And that would very much jeopardize the situation.What is most distressing about all this, Abby, is the fact that Vladimir Putin, and it's been clear from people inside the Kremlin, has been counting on the idea that he can outlast the west and particularly that he can outlast the United States, that we will tire of supporting the war in Ukraine, that there will be divisions in this country and that, therefore, that he'll be able to eventually win the long war because of the fact that the west, its support for Ukraine will flag.

And I think Attorney General James is both thinking about what's happening in the courtroom but just clearly concerned what's happening outside the courtroom. And that's where the former president really has control, frankly, because he often sets the tone. I think she's made the estimation that's important for her and her office's efforts that she's challenging his attacks on the legitimacy of her investigation, of the justice system, as put forward in her case. So, I don't want to weigh in whether it is good or bad but I think she's made the estimation that it's important for her.",

Somehow here, I think that would hurt him in a financial sense. But I think what's really important here is that the investigation gathering process for all of these cases is not over. And by that, I mean, when you are the target, the defendant in a case, and you are making public statements, those can and will be used against you. So, for example, when the former president comes out and says, talks about his cases, those prosecutors are looking at each word he's saying. So, that's important in civil case here because money's on the line. But to the extent that the former president does this as it pertains to his criminal cases, those prosecutors, I guarantee you, will use those words against him. I think there's a reason why he's been a bit more careful with his criminal cases and speaking about the subjects there, but I think he's really going to dangerous territory here because each word, each slip of a tongue, that could be a confession in a way, and that's going to be -- that's going to come back up in court.",
