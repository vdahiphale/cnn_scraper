More than 9 million people in downtown L.A. and surrounding areas are under flash flood warnings. Thousands of flights also canceled or delayed on Sunday. There's also a state of emergency in Nevada, which is feeling the effects of Hilary as the storm moves South. North, rather. It made landfall in Mexico in the Baja California Peninsula early on Sunday, causing widespread flooding and power outages. At least one person there was killed when their vehicle was swept away in the floodwaters. For the latest, let's go over to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. It's starting to make its way in.

This is so historic, and earth-shattering.It's hard to wrap your head around the idea that this portion of the United States and South -- Southern California, portions of Arizona could be so drenched by a year -- year and a half's worth of precipitation. It's hard to imagine that that has happened, but it has. The mountains have really borne the brunt of this, where some areas have received just about a third of a meter of rainfall, and the rain keeps coming down. Right now, it has winds associated with it at 75 kilometers per hour, or about 45 miles an hour. But look at some of these rainfall totals. In Riverside County on top of San Gabriel, the San Jacinto Mountain, eight and a half inches of rainfall. These are areas that only see fractions of an inch of precipitation. Even for Los Angeles, they set a record. One and a half plus inches of rainfall. It's not finished yet, because essentially, Tropical Storm Hilary is just kind of parked across the Los Angeles area, but it is racing very quickly towards the North. So, it's going to spread that broad shield of wet weather all the way up into Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. It is staggering to think that this system that was such a massive hurricane lost so much energy but is still capable of propelling all that moisture further to the North. All right. So here's Los Angeles. Here's San Diego. Where you see these red boxes, essentially extending from Los Angeles, Ventura County, San Bernardino County, Orange County into Southern Nevada. You're looking at staggering amounts of rainfall. We've already seen in a lot of areas the forecast verify some areas have already seen about ten inches of rainfall. There is more in store, because orographically, that rainfall lifts, and it gets wrung out across the mountains. It has to go someplace, and there it is. Southern California, you're still in trouble going into Monday. But, it's going to gradually taper off throughout the day and then make its way towards Montana and Idaho. Now, there's a big ridge of high pressure out here. The circulation around that is clockwise. There's an area of low pressure here. That's Hilary, Tropical Storm Hilary. So everything is filtering up underneath that ridge of high pressure. And that's why it is so staggering. Now, just to give you some idea, the tropics are acting up. When we come back at the top of the hour, I'll tell you about what's happening here near Puerto Rico, Hispaniola. There is a tropical system developing there, and we'll update you on that situation.

Vibrations felt at least for 80 kilometers away.At last check, the Ventura County Sheriff's office said there was no reports of any significant damage. Ecuador's presidential election is heading for a runoff. Preliminary results indicate leftist Luisa Gonzalez and businessman Daniel Noboa will face each other in a final vote in October. Now this comes over Ecuadorian voters cast ballots Sunday in the South American country's presidential and legislative elections, with tens of thousands of soldiers on guard. Tensions rose dramatically after one of the candidates, a legislator and former investigative journalist, was gunned down at a campaign rally, you'll remember, earlier this month. One of his friends, another investigative journalist, took his place on the ballot. He cast his vote Sunday, wearing a helmet and armored vest, surrounded by heavily-armed guards. Ecuador is in the grip of murderous drug gangs, which have carried out brazen killings, extortion, and other crimes, rocking a country that not so long ago was heralded for its stability. Not surprisingly, security and corruption among the main issues. CNN's Rafael Romo is tracking the vote, as well as the presidential runoff in Guatemala, as well. He joins me now. Let's start with Ecuador. What's your read on how the vote has gone and what comes next with the country?

Listen, he's 35. He was the youngest of all candidates, constitutionally. In Ecuador, you must be at least 35 to run for president, so he barely made it based on age alone. There were other candidates, with more experience, had more support, according to the polls. And he is the one who makes it. Who is he? He is a businessman. His family has a banana export business. And his father -- listen to this -- tried to run for the presidency three times unsuccessfully. He was also a member of the assembly. So he comes from a political dynasty, so to speak. So he's not totally out of his comfort zone. But it is very interesting that he's going against a candidate who, in the polls, Luisa Gonzalez had dominated for months.

On the other hand, we have a conservative congressman. He's the son of Ecuador's richest man. These two candidates really look like the same sort of division that we've been seeing in Ecuadoran politics for years. Conservative oligarchs on one hand, and left populists on the other.

There are criminal cases, completely politically- biased, fabricated criminal cases against his political party that could really hamstring his plans in the legislature.

But more widely, for Ukrainians here in Zaporizhzhia, we've heard four or five air sirens so far today.The ability to perhaps challenge Russian superiority in the air to deliver missiles and hit civilian targets on a nightly basis than we've currently seen. So no doubt at all in Ukraine's mind. They urgently need F-16s right now. But they aren't going to get it. They're going to have to wait, probably, until January with the back end of this year to see the first trickle in. That is because the complex mechanism requires Ukrainian pilots to be trained by European allies, with U.S. sign-off. And then the jets, which heard from Denmark and the Netherlands now are coming their way would also require U.S. approval to be passed on. But it is because they are good stuff. They are high technology. They will be useful for Ukraine indeed. But they will require a lot of maintenance, and a lot of support to keep going. But still, like we saw with the supply of Leopard armored tanks in the past months, when NATO puts its mind to answering a very direct and public and, at times, angry Ukrainian demand, they're able to do that. And so we are, perhaps, seeing this possibly formulated with the F- 16s, but their arrival will be way later than Ukrainian troops on the front line dying daily would like to see.
