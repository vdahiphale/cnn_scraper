As I know, you'll be well aware, Catherine, Princess of Wales, had abdominal surgery at a London hospital back in January. Well, now there are reports that a staff member may have tried to access her private medical records and allegedly breaking confidentiality rules in the process. Max Foster has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another day, another princess headline. This one alleging medical staff tried to illegally access her records while she was there to undergo surgery at this private London clinic. The country's data watchdog now says it's assessing a breach of confidentiality reported in the Daily Mirror. The British tabloid reported that at least one hospital staffer allegedly tried to illegally access Kate's private medical records while she spent 13 nights at the London Clinic Hospital in January after planned abdominal surgery. The Mirror says the hospital informed the palace and launched a probe into the allegations. And in a statement to CNN, the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's office said, we can confirm that we've received a breach report and are assessing the information provided. On Wednesday, the U.K.'s Health Minister, Maria Caulfield, warned that hospital staff could face prosecution. MARIA CAULFIELD, BRITISH MINISTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WOMEN'S HEALTH STRATEGY: You're only allowed to access the patient notes you're caring for and with their permission, and there's really strict rules. The Information Commissioner would take enforcement action against trusts or primary care practices, but also as individual practitioners, your regulatory body. So, for me, it would be the NMC would take action as well. So, it's pretty severe. FOSTER (voice-over): It's another blow for the princess and the palace that's been protecting her privacy fiercely during her recovery. They've released minimal information, which has sparked wild speculation about her true condition and whereabouts.",

Most Fed policymakers still anticipating three rate cuts later this year and they're updated what we call the dot plot chart.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year.

Gang violence has escalated in Haiti in recent weeks, with the U.N. estimating 80 percent of Port-au-Prince currently controlled by gangs. Former U.S. President Donald Trump can officially appeal the decision to keep prosecutor Fani Willis on the election's subversion case against him in Georgia. It's because a judge has now given the green light. That same judge ruled last week to keep Willis on the prosecution team. It's now up to the Georgia Court of Appeals to decide if it wants to take up the case. In a surprise move, Ireland's prime minister has announced he'll be stepping down.

A poll that month from the Jewish People Policy Institute found that 26 percent of Israelis advocate the reconstruction of the Gush Katif settlements after the war is over.

And for that, you know, quip (ph) aside, you know, we've been believing that this is going to come together. And a super proud moment to have the Secretary Raimondo here and President Biden. So, we're already putting this to work. We've already started to realize some of the tax benefits have already started to materialize for us in our financials, but a lot of this is '24, '25, and '26, you know, when the major amounts of the grants and other items start coming together for us as we're making these huge capital commitments. It's over five years, 100 plus billion that we're putting, and it's across four projects. You know, we have our major Oregon research site, the Silicon Forest as I call it, you know, the major new manufacturing site in Ohio, the Silicon Heartland, in New Mexico, what we call the Silicon Mesa for the most advanced packaging, and right here in Arizona where we had today's announcement, the Silicon Desert, all of these underway as we rebuild manufacturing in the U.S.",

Also, some of the other things, hiring the technicians, the engineers, we have more time to develop those skills. And part of this as well was a $50 million commitment by the CHIP's office, you know, the National Science Foundation and Intel to help build those new jobs programs at both the community college level as well as at the university level. And in each one of those four locations, the responses that we've gotten from the local universities and colleges has been nothing short of spectacular to build the workforce that we need.",

But Ohio -- excuse me, Ohio does get me veryexcited because that's where you plan to manufacture the A.I. chips and hopefully in the future, manufacture them for other big players as well. I know you've already got Microsoft on board as a partner. So, this is fantastic, or as a client. Now, at the present day, Nvidia and likes of AMD send their manufacturing orders abroad in order to do that. What's your message to Jensen over at Nvidia or some of these other big players to say, hey, you should be building on Intel?",

I read late last year that Sam Altman of OpenAI said he wanted to raise $7 trillion to develop and manufacture chips in order to guarantee A.I. progress, and I think my mind blew. I'm assuming he was including the power costs in there and the data required to do it. But how big is the total addressable market that we're talking about, simply for these A.I. chips that we're talking about now in your mind? Like, how big is the opportunity?",

Now, a lot of those estimates don't assume a lot of acceleration for the A.I. chips. So, part of Sam's thesis is, hey, I need to build bigger machines to train an inference to accomplish AGI, you know, this artificial general intelligence objective. And maybe the computing requirements for that, you know, aren't 10 or 100 times bigger, but maybe 10,000 times bigger than today. So, with that, we need bigger data centers, more power for those data centers, but we need a whole lot more chips. So, I think the estimates are that, hey, this is probably going to go faster, and that's why, you know, today's announcement is so critical as we're building the capacity for these A.I. surge requirements for the semiconductor industry, and we want to be a supplier to all of Sam's software, to Microsoft, as we've already announced, and everybody else, in addition to the Intel product line.

Maybe we're getting back to 50/50 in U.S. and Europe for the most advanced semiconductors. So, that's very aggressive build out from where we are today, but super important to the economic future as well as the national security interests. So, today, you know, a real marker on that journey. But we got a lot of work to do. It's going to take a lot more investment, and chips one is a great starting point. And the best thing that we can do is make chips one successful. So, we've built the political will and investment capital for chips two and the full sustainability of this ecosystem for the future.

The Dodgers going into this new season as the favorites to win the World Series. This was the first time that we had a real Major League Baseball game being played in South Korea, which is a baseball mad country anyway. So, so much interest and excitement. The fans were queuing in -- queuing up hours and hours before this game to get in. And when it finally did get in, the man of the moment delivered. Ohtani, as you say, with a couple of hits and he didn't take long either. His second at-bat was when he scored his first hit. He drove in his first run in the eighth inning, which was a big inning for the Dodgers. They had to come from behind to win this one by five runs to two. And everybody just loved it. We had a crew in Seoul and they caught up with some of the fans after the game, some of whom, by the looks of it, had traveled from Japan to see their man. UNIDENTIFIED MALE t (through translator): I was in Sapporo as an exchange student, and that was during Ohtani's last season before going to the MLB. So, being able to watch Ohtani then and now in Seoul is so meaningful for me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE t (through translator): Ohtani is an Asian player who is making amazing achievements in the U.S. and is like the best player you'd see in a hundred years. And the fact that such a player is in South Korea as a Dodgers player to play in the opening game is so meaningful for me.",
