An urgent evacuation order for the residents of Gaza, which aid groups have deemed impossible, as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is warning Hamas, the recent strikes, and I'm quoting him now, are \"Just the beginning.\" Plus, Israel hitting hundreds of new targets, in Gaza and Lebanon, as members of the IDF, are carrying out raids, in Gaza, looking for hostages, held by Hamas. And House Republicans, tonight, went home, without a Speaker. The chaos that is happening, on Capitol Hill, has real consequences, for what's happening, in Israel. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Right now, Israeli forces are moving closer, to the Gaza border, striking more targets, tonight, as speculation, of a ground invasion, is growing, following Saturday's deadly attack, by Hamas. Anderson Cooper will join us live, with his reporting, from Tel Aviv, in just a moment. But this all comes, as there is a race against time, for what could be the next phase, of this war. Israel has issued an urgent warning, overnight, to more than a million Palestinian civilians, living in Northern Gaza, telling them to move south, within 24 hours, about 1.1 million people, in just 24 hours. The United Nations says that is impossible. They're calling on Israel, to rescind that evacuation order, which I should note Israel has not done, tonight. That red box, at the top of your screen, that you can see, right now, that's the Evacuation Zone, in Gaza. But here's the problem. Most of these people have nowhere to go. Entire families have been sent scrambling, piling into cars, or really whatever mode of transportation that they can find, to get to safer ground. Many of them have been left to walk for miles. President Biden directly addressed the massive humanitarian crisis that is unfolding, today. And he emphasized that many Palestinians have nothing to do with Hamas. The President also made a promise, to the families, of the 14 Americans, who are still missing, tonight, after a conversation that he said, was gut-wrenching. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's no doubt whatever comes next is going to be violent and deadly, and a lot of people are going to die.Hamas has told Gazans not to leave Gaza City. They do not want the civilian population moving further south. We have seen, today, large numbers of people, trying to move, traffic jams and the like. But it is a very difficult situation. There's not a lot of places, for them to go, in the south. It's not as if there are huge tent camps that have been set up. We don't have Hamas, helping people, move to the south. And that southern border with Egypt is closed, to large numbers of Gazans, who probably would like to cross into the safety of Egypt. That's a huge security concern for Egypt. So, large numbers of people can't move when desperate enough. The question is, what do they move to? What happens to them when they're there? And how long is this situation going to last? COLLINS: Yes. There's fewer resources, even in the south than there is the north. Anderson, your reporting earlier, and there was this moment, where this happened, in the background.

He has dozens of family members, who are in that Evacuation Zone that we showed you, that tiny red box, in Northern Gaza. He is also the Director of Philanthropy at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees. And Hani, I'm so glad you're here with me, tonight. Because your mom, your dad, six of your siblings, so much of your family, is in that tiny red box, that Evacuation Zone, in Gaza. And I imagine that they are pretty terrified, tonight. HANI ALMADHOUN, FAMILY STUCK IN GAZA EVACUATION ZONE, DIRECTOR OF PHILANTHROPY, UN RELIEF AND WORKS AGENCY (USA): Yes, absolutely, Kaitlan. It's been a tough time, because I wear two hats, the Humanitarian Relief hat for UNRWA USA, and a family man, who has family, in Gaza. And my in-laws evacuated, today, to a safer place, and promised safety. And nobody stopped in. They got there. And they regretted that decision, because they went to a place with no facilities. Everybody's sleeping in the street. They regretted that. And they said, \"Hey, let's go back to our home,\" but they couldn't. So, there is a lot of trauma there for the Palestinians. My mom is definitely in the red box. They're in Beit Lahiya. We just saw it on the map. She is unable to leave. She already left one time, from our other house, up north. And she said, \"We can't leave.\" Right now, she's hunkering, and sleeping, under a staircase, in our family's home. And today was the first time I was able to call her. And she, and this really broke my spirit. She said, \"Can you turn the video for a minute, because it feels this is the last time I will see you.\" And I was surprised she would do that. And our family, our extended family lost 16 people, 14 in one attack, and two people later. It's we have not had time to process that trauma, in our life. And I just feel, it's, there is a lot of work to do, and I can't take a break because we want to support the Palestine refugees, as you've heard the reports about UNRWA's facilities. And we work here, in the U.S., to support, and many generous Americans stepped up, to support our work. But also, there is the personal side, which makes it a lot more painful, because it's --",

The U.S. government gets these kinds of intelligence reports, disseminate it across the administration, constantly warning of potential violence, flaring up, between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
