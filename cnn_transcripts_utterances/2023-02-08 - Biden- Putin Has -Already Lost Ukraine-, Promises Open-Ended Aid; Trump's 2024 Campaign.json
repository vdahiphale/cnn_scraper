It's clear where he stands.This comes as we're getting new video into OUTFRONT showing a top of the line U.S. artillery shell called the Excalibur in action in Ukraine. And it is incredibly precise. Take a look at this video that we have obtained. You see what is described as Russia's missile defense system. It's hidden inside that building. And in a split second the building and the air defense system blowing up. Flames engulfing what is left of that structure. Now, CNN is reporting that the Ukrainians have been using these Excaliburs, which the United States began supplying just a few months ago with great success. Now it's open-ended, more and more. Just look at these videos. These show the Excalibur blowing up Russian tanks. These lethal strikes are not just taking a massive toll on Putin's tanks, though, but, of course, on Russian soldiers, too. The daily death toll in the hundreds. And the new weapons are hurting Putin's already deeply challenged efforts to recruit more manpower. Just hear this new report. According to the Russian independent media site Adjenstu (phy), Putin's government is now threatening prisoner who's refuse to fight in the war with new charges and longer sentences. In fact, they're saying even threatening to charge them with offenses that may be 20 years in the past, allegations. The reason is that many prisoners now are saying no, they don't want to go fight on the front lines, even if that means getting out of their penal colonies and jail cells, reportedly because they now have heard of the number of Russians dying on the battlefield. Putin needs these bodies fast because we understand that the largest number of prisoners facing these threats are in the region's bordering Ukraine in those very regions so that they can make the threat and get them to the front line fast. Forget all those training stops or anything even resembling that. All of this reporting comes in the context of what Putin seems to be doing, which is pushing right now a new offensive near Kharkiv where Ukraine where able to drive the Russians out a few months ago. And just when you thought the Russian government wouldn't or couldn't stoop any lower, CNN's Tim Lister and team are now reporting that this man, a former Chechen commander wanted for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, is now leading Russia's earthquake relief effort in turkey. It's not a joke. According to Ukraine's security service, Daniil Martynov was behind the occupation of a Ukrainian psychiatric hospital in March. It said that on his orders, almost 500 people were taken hostage including more than a hundred bed-ridden patients. The hospital was then turned into a firing position for Russians. Now that's the guy leading Russia's relief efforts in Turkey. And it comes as the Kremlin is upping threats against the entire world tonight, warning of military and political ramifications, their exact words, if the United Kingdom sends British jets to Ukraine. The threat coming on the same day Zelenskyy visited London in only his second time outside Ukraine since Putin invaded. You can see with Zelenskyy there receiving a hero's welcome. What he asked for was the fighter jets. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We can start with a few squadrons, he says, each with 12 jets. If we have one to two or more squadrons, it would be the first step for our pilots to transition. They can be in formation and perform combat missions on different directions. The U.S. has given the Ukrainians some air-launched anti-radiation missiles called HARM. But Kyiv says those, too, would work much better, he says, if launched from Western jets. The HARM missiles aren't as efficient as if they were from American or other allied aircraft. Their functionality is restrictive, their range is shorter, making the efficiency lower. Ukrainian officials say they want U.S.-made F-16s. So far, President Biden has ruled out giving Kyiv combat aircraft. But the UK says it will soon start training Ukrainian pilots. And Ukrainian officials tell CNN they're confident they'll get jets, just eventually they got the main battle tanks they requested.

Do you agree with that? REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY):  Well, I definitely do have some concerns. I think the fact that George Santos, we didn't feel, should have the ability to serve on committees. I don't think that he should be serving or hearing any briefings either. I told my staff that any letters that are being sent out, group letters about certain policies with George Santos' name on, I don't want to be involved, I'd rather send one on my own. He's taken this institution and really made it a laughingstock. I mean, people from throughout this country are now focused, and George Santos has become somewhat of a household name. And it's not for anything good. When you are constantly on \"Saturday Night Live\" and the nightly shows being mocked because you literally lied your way to the halls of the United States Congress, I agree with my colleagues from New York and Long Island, and I agree with what Senator Romney said last night. There was just no reason for Santos to even be there, and definitely not sitting on the aisle.

He's talking about the committee itself. Is that enough, in your view? D'ESPOSITO:  Listen, I think that the speaker has taken this role as our leader, and he's looking at this issue from a broad view. And I think that he's making the best decisions for all of us and for this institution. And I know that we've had conversations many of the New York delegation that have called for his resignation.
