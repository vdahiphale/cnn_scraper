The platform announced today Trump's channel is no longer restricted and he is free to upload any new content that he wants.Axios' senior media reporter, Sara Fischer, is joining us to explain this. Sara, YouTube is joining the party of Meta and Twitter in bringing Trump back on to the platform. Explain why he was banned in the first place and what YouTube is saying about why he is allowed back on.",

      "sentences": "That is a great question, Abby. Following the January 6th insurrection, YouTube banned Donald Trump from uploading new videos and doing a variety of other things, like buying ads on the platform, in response to violating its policies around incitement to violence.YouTube wasn't the only platform to point to that type of policy to ban him. Meta pointed to a similar rule. What it means he is coming back on is twofold. One, it means he can now upload videos again. He hasn't been able to do that in over two years. Two, he can buy ads again. That is a really big deal. Even though Donald Trump has Truth Social, his new social media platform where he can spew whatever he wants to say, there is no real mechanism for him to reach a lot of people through advertising like he had on YouTube and now on Meta as well.",

Because when you are talking about Meta, as well as Facebook, Instagram, huge source of fundraising for the Trump campaign.Those companies, Twitter and Meta, have restored his accounts. Trump has said he is not going on there because he has his own platform. But what do you expect? Do you think that will stick as we go into 2024? FISCHER: It is an interesting question because Truth Social has guidelines that essentially bar him from posting on other platforms. First, in order to incentivize the president to use Truth. It was also a mechanism to assure investors that this platform would be successful. I think, going into his 2024 campaign, you'll definitely see him use the platforms for advertising. In terms of posting, maybe if he can strike some sort of deal with Twitter - I know Elon Musk now owns it, it is a different kind of platform - to integrate some things with Truth Social. Maybe he would post there. I'm not quite sure if he sees a lot of value in posting organically, right now, on Facebook, Meta and Instagram. But I do think he'll buy ads on those platforms.",

But the Justice Department special counsel investigation is still ongoing. What does it mean that these individuals are being interviewed? Everything or much of what happens in criminal law comes down to intent. And when you talk about the possession of classified documents, a major question is going to be, did the person intend to hold them in violation of the law? Was it an accident or not? People who worked at Mar-a-Lago are particularly able to answer questions like that because they can speak to what they witnessed, conversations they overheard, or conversations they were part of that might have touched on documents.",

If someone is advising a client to commit a crime or overhears about crimes that might be committed in the future, they can waive the attorney-client privilege and ask that person to come in and testify. I think a judge is going to look at the conversations between Mr. Corcoran and the former president and say, look, where was he actually providing genuine legal advice to the former president? And where might they have been talking about or providing information that would be relevant to a criminal investigation? You have to go statement by statement. There is no blanket way to answer it.

I pulled this earlier. This is Sargassum. And that is a particular type of seaweed that we're talking about in this big body floating toward Florida. And to be very specific and answer your question, we are looking at hitting over to the east coast of Florida. That's where it is expected to impact. Yes. If just a portion of this hits the east coast, you're talking about a pretty different beach when folks come out to vacation, specifically those coming out during the summer. We talked about how, right now, it is 5,000 miles long. Well, right now, it is also about six million tons of seaweed we're talking about. And the scientist I talked to said that is not even peak yet. It could get up to 20 million pounds of this particular type of seaweed heading toward Florida. Here in the Keys, in Monroe County, they've already allotted $200,000 for cleanup for what is to come. What is the type of impact? You could probably - as you mentioned, a bit of a stinky seaweed, so you could see some respiratory issues for some folks. But this stuff here is not toxic like we're seeing on the west side, which is the red tide. That does kill fish, cause respiratory illness. It is toxic. Right now, Florida coasts, west side as well as east side, sort of dealing with a bit of a challenge, if you will. And we haven't even really seen yet what will come from the east coast or, excuse me, onto the east coast from the sea. PHILLIP: That is really - I mean, for beach goers really tragic.
