And just in, we are going to start with this, because CNN has learned that the Manhattan grand jury that is considering a potential indictment, of former President Trump, will be reconvening, tomorrow. They did not meet, today, in that Stormy Daniels hush money case that we've been talking about, all week. The District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, still has said very little, about the status of the probe, and whether or not Trump is even going to be charged. But this probe does appear to be nearing a conclusion. And meanwhile, there has also been in another case, a big defeat, for Trump, in another investigation, this one, into his handling, of classified documents. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled today that Trump's own attorney, Evan Corcoran, must testify, again, before a Washington grand jury, this time, without the protection of attorney-client privilege. That means that the Justice Department has successfully convinced the court that the former President's interactions, with Evan Corcoran, his defense attorney, were potentially part of a possible crime, overriding that protected attorney-client privilege. Let's start tonight with CNN's Paula Reid, who is here, joining us, on the set. I want to not start with that investigation. There are two that we're tracking, right now. One is moving a little bit slower than the other one. And that is the case, here, in Manhattan, where we saw that the grand jury did not go, and have - meet today, reconvene. We are told they're going to do so, tomorrow. What are you expecting?",

Well, we know, right now, behind closed doors, prosecutors are weighing, whether they should bring Michael Cohen back.Now, Cohen has already testified, before the grand jury, twice. He's met with investigators, 20 times. The reason they would have to bring him back, though, is that on Monday, a witness, Robert Costello, an attorney, testified, before the grand jury, and his role was to attack Cohen's credibility. This was a witness that the defense, the, Trump team, requested, go before the grand jury. So, whatever happened in that grand jury room, whatever Costello said, now we've learned that prosecutors are trying to figure out, if they need to bring Cohen back, to rebut that testimony, or if they could bring a different witness back, to rebut that testimony? So, it's going to be really interesting to see, tomorrow, if Cohen shows up because beyond that, it's unclear what additional work, the grand jury has to do. But, I mean, one of my big questions is, what on earth could Costello has said, in that grand jury room that would have been news, to the prosecutors, or the grand jury, about Michael Cohen's credibility.",

CNN has learned that the Manhattan grand jury that is hearing testimony, about the hush money, paid to the adult film actress, Stormy Daniels, will be back in session, tomorrow. A final decision, on whether to indict former President Trump, in that case, could come at any moment, now.And also, today, former President Trump's own defense attorney has now been ordered, to testify, before a different grand jury, this one, in that classified documents probe. So many developments, tonight. So, I want to bring in Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, who was on the House Judiciary Committee, joining us now. He was also the lead prosecutor, in Trump's first impeachment trial, and is now running for a Senate seat, in California. Good evening, Congressman. Thank you so much for joining us. I want to start though with this remarkable ruling, we have, when it comes to Trump's defense attorney. They are piercing this attorney- client privilege. How rare is that? How high is the bar for that? And what does it say to you, about where the documents investigation is headed? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I think it's very rare. I was a prosecutor, in Los Angeles, for almost six years. I don't remember this happening. Now, it did happen, actually, in the January 6 committee investigation, when Judge Carter, out in California, also found the crime-fraud exception to apply, and ordered the production of emails, from Mr. Eastman, you might recall. So, it's happened now, twice, with Donald Trump, and those, in his orbit. But it is exceedingly rare. It's a very high burden, to be able to prove that because that attorney-client privilege is generally so worthy of protection. But here, you're going to have the attorney now, go into the grand jury, and that, attorney is going to be faced with potentially, telling the grand jury, information that will incriminate his client. Or, if he doesn't, then there's a risk if he's not truthful, that is, there's a risk of incriminating himself. So, I have to imagine that he's going to want to go in there, tell the truth, and let the chips fall where they may.",

Given the pressure, to threaten to maybe have an investigation, or have Alvin Bragg testify, in the House and beyond, is that, you think, giving pause, to the prosecutors now, and why there might be a delay? Would that impact their decision? SCHIFF: No, it wouldn't impact their decision. And it would be a terrible thing, if it did. We don't know what's going on in the grand jury at the moment. I'm sure there's an explanation for the delay. But I'm very confident it's not because Jim Jordan or Kevin McCarthy are threatening to bring the District Attorney, into Congress. That is a really abusive act, by the Speaker - by Jordan. This is what we saw before, in the Russia and Ukraine investigations, where basically Republicans in Congress, view their role, as the criminal defense firm, for the former President. Now that they're in the majority, though, they have the subpoena power, and it at least holds the prospect of it being even more abusive. And the thing of it is that if we're going to have a rule of law, if we're going to be a nation of laws, and not a nation of persons? It means that law has to apply equally, to everyone. And you can't have Congress weighing in, to try to stop prosecutors, from prosecuting their party's leader.

I think the American people are growing fatigued, by all the drama, and all the trauma that surrounds the former President. And one thing that we have seen in the past is that when there is not accountability? Then he goes on to commit worse and worse abuses. So, the prosecution is necessary. If they have found probable cause, and believe they can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, the prosecution is necessary. Without it, I think it breeds a disrespect for the law. A system in which Michael Cohen is told, he needs to go to jail, because of his participation, in a scheme, in which he was directed, by Donald Trump, at least according to that earlier indictment? If he has to go to jail for that, then why does the guy that did the directing somehow get a pass? And so, there's a lot at stake here beyond Donald Trump's future.

But it seemed to be, from our outside vantage point, at least a year before they, in an in-depth way, looked into the multiple lines of effort, by the former President, to overturn the election. And, for that reason, you have other prosecutions now that are going forward first. But I certainly think that the Justice Department should have pursued this with far more urgency. It appears at least vis-a-vis, the Mar-a- Lago case? There is that urgency, now. I've never seen a briefing schedule, where you're asked to brief, up until midnight. So, there is an urgency now. But, on the most serious charges, not, Mar-a-Lago, either, the most serious charges, around January 6? And there, the Justice Department should have moved, in my view, a long time before now.",
