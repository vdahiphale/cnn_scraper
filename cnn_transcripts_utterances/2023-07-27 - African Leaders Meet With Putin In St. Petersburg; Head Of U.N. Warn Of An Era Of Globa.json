      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Vladimir Putin tries to shore up Africansupport, offering to send free grain to the continent. We'll have all the reaction to that. Then the era of global boiling has arrived. That dire warning from the head of the U.N. as countries across the world continue to burn. Plus, a democratic crisis in Niger as the country's army command says it supports the military coup against the president. We'll have more on that coming up. We begin, though, in Russia, where a summit of African leaders has kicked off in St. Petersburg. It's a chance for Russia to show it isn't a total pariah for its invasion of Ukraine. But that war and the ensuing food crisis loom large. Many African countries depend on Ukrainian grain, and the cost of wheat, as you know, has spiked since Russia quit the Black Sea grain deal. Well, the chair of the African Union is at that summit and he's calling on Russia as well as Ukraine to peacefully co-exist. But Russia's president isn't talking peace. He's talking opportunity. Vladimir Putin says his country can replace Ukrainian grain sent to Africa and will supply that grain free of charge to six countries. Meanwhile, we've gotten a sighting of Yevgeny Prigozhin. The whereabouts of the Wagner boss have been somewhat murky since the collapse of his rebellion, if you remember last month. But the mercenary leader has been spotted on the sidelines of the summit, as you can see there, trading military fatigues for jeans and a polo. CNN's Nic Robertson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  In public, in Russia, Wagner affiliated accounts saying mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin openly greeting a delegate to President Putin's Africa conference. The last time Prigozhin was seen in Russia was his mutiny to overthrow Putin's defense chiefs. He sent tanks and troops towards Moscow, a direct challenge to Putin's authority.",

The president did speak at length about what he saw as the unfair enforcement of sanctions, some things he's done since the very beginning of the war in Ukraine. He also said that the grain that was coming out because of that Black Sea grain deal, which allowed ships to leave Ukraine and go into the export market, he said those were mostly going to European companies and nations. And that, on some level is true. But by pulling out of the grain deal, the Russians, and of course, originally advancing on Ukraine, the Russians have caused those significant spark in the price of wheat over the last few days. And this could ultimately hurt Russian nations. So, it is walking a bit of a tight rope here, but clearly, this very large scale summit with far less leaders in presence of Putin, is a way for him to try and show he's not isolated entirely from the world stage.",

In terms of their impact in Africa, and his way on the African continent, you know, it's a very diverse continent with many countries, but there are some specific countries where Wagner plays a very critical role. Mali, Central African Republic, other parts of the Sahel where they have basically become the security force and the means of propping up military and civilian governments. And in turn, have used their force to gain money, extort diamonds and gold and rubies in some cases, and then fund their own mercenary operations in the Ukraine and elsewhere. I mean, I think one aspect of why Putin may be acting as he is, is because he needs Wagner, and the campaign against Ukraine, and also in the relations with certain African countries where the mercenary group is heavily involved. But overall, it's hard to tell whether Prigozhin has any impact on countries like South Africa, countries like Egypt, and certainly those like Kenya which are closer to the U.S. and Europe than maybe some others.

U.S. officials say Ukraine is committing more forces to its campaign after a near two months of slow progress. They say the Ukrainians still have troops in reserve, but they are committing the main bulk of their forces right now. They have also renewed Russian attacks against the Odesa region.

You know, the area of Ukraine that is mined right now, it varies from 15 percent to 30 percent, but equivalent for example to the second smallest state in Australia. So Ukrainians are having a tough time, the other thing happening of course, is the build-up of muscle, Russian muscle in the Black Sea.

There is no constitution, there's no separation between the legislature and the parliament, there's no federal and state governments.

So, if you get rid of the court, you have an unimpeded majority that doesn't have to worry about rights. And this is going to have dramatic effects for Palestinians in occupied territory. Now, it's not as if the Supreme Court was great for those Palestinians, to begin with. You know, it has allowed, you know, all sorts of restrictions on their movement, it's allowed restrictions on their ability to even add a bedroom on their home. And it is steadfastly refused to address the legality of the supplements, which it can't address because they're blatantly illegal. They violate Article 49 of the fourth Geneva Convention, which basically says you're not allowed as an occupier, to move your population into occupied territory. And most significantly, the provision, the Rome Statute at the International Criminal Court defines that as a war crime. So, the court has avoided all of this, but I think what Palestinians fear is that there are certain steps the court has been willing to block. For example, they said so far that settlements cannot be built on private Palestinian land. They actually allowed certain settlements to be dismantled in Gaza.

We have seen so many reports, we don't need any more reports. You just need to look out of the window. I want to take a deep look at how cities are. Adapting and changing the way residents get around. One city in particular has led the way on this change, for decades. That is Amsterdam. Using bikes instead of cars and many green spaces, the city encourages citizens and visitors to adopt a sustainable lifestyle. Funder (sic) of Sustainable Amsterdam, Cornelia Dinca joins me now to discuss how her city is becoming more resilient to climate change. Thank you for taking time to speak to us in the. Show you would have seen the recent hot weather we are seeing in Europe. The wildfires forcing clearly many cities and politicians to think about climate, change think about policy. This is, as I was speaking to my colleague a few minutes ago, the new normal. How important are Amsterdam's sustainability efforts? How do they lower Amsterdam's contribution to climate. Change",

My background and a lot of the work that I do is with international groups that, including governmental groups that come toAmsterdam to learn from Amsterdam's leadership on sustainable mobility. We know that Amsterdam is a cycling city. The cycling capital of the. World and quite often, people think that's about climate change but historically that shift that Amsterdam made to become a city more for people and for bikes was driven actually by safety concerns. Starting, let's say in the '70s, especially. But in the 1973 oil embargo, for example, the oil crisis had a really big impact in terms of the city really rethinking the streets, the purpose of the streets and the mobility system. Having said, that's in the last decade or so, the emphasis is now on how do we actually retrofit the city further, in order to respond to periods of heavy rain, especially which is much more common an issue in Amsterdam? And in the last few, years how do we respond to periods of no rain at all? So planting more trees, expanding green spaces, taking away space from cars in order to allocate that for flat management, for example. All of these kinds of interventions are very important.",

Place and I moved to Amsterdam because I was interested in sustainability topics. I was surprised to find out while I was doing a master's on urban development topics that Amsterdam was not always a city of. Bikes so that's a very common misconception. People always think that we have this idea that's Amsterdam has always been the cycling capital of the world. In fact, after the Second World War, Amsterdam did take this much more car- centric approach to development or actually these American traffic engineers who were coming to Amsterdam but all over Europe and the world saying, OK, if you want to be a modern city, you have to embrace the car. The bicycle is passe. That's actually the path that Amsterdam also went down on for a few decades until this turning point in the '70s and in the '80s, where we decided to reclaim cycling culture. Like I said before, the driver, at the time was really safety, the oil embargo absolutely helped. But climate change per se, was not the driver at the, time but having made this shift actually makes the city absolutely more resilient but also more attractive nowadays. Also let's say better positioned to further adapt to the current and future harms of extreme weather.",

They do not want these indictments and criminal trials around it to interfere with his campaign. And that is exactly what they are looking at now. If an indictment does, come what you can expect is you will hear from the president, like I, said his team expects that he will put something out on Truth Social. You will also see him continue with his very aggressive campaign. Schedule he is slated to travel to Iowa tomorrow, for a campaign stop. He will also be holding a rally on Saturday in Erie, Pennsylvania. I'm told that, regardless of what happens with the potential indictment, those scheduled trips will happen and he will continue to move forward with that aggressive campaign schedule. As of, now I know that his team is also reaching out to many lawyers and allies and trying to get a better sense of what exactly the criminal case against him could look like. The scope of the evidence, that the special counsel has against him, as well as who in Trump's inner circle could be cooperating with the special counsel's team.
