The company announced this week that it will be closing both of its stores in the area come July 1st. That's when their leases expire. In a memo obtained by CNN, the retailer's chief stores officer, Jamie Nordstrom, writes this, decisions like this are never easy and this one has been especially difficult. But as many of you know, the dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully. Nordstrom is not alone in this decision. In fact, \"The San Francisco Standard\" has tracked at least 20 major store closures in that Union Square area -- that's really the center of downtown San Francisco -- since just 2020. The city is staring down a nearly $800 million budget deficit over the next two years. Let's talk about all of this with the chief economist for the city and county of San Francisco, Ted Egan. Good morning, Ted, and thank you.",

So, you know, we have less crime in the neighborhood where Nordstrom was than we did before the pandemic. So, I think maybe the perception of safety may be an issue that's depressing foot traffic, but I think there are bigger forces at play.",

Offices are a very big part of the city's economy. They generate about 80 percent of our GDP. And, you know, they're hall full on a given day. With that we're not seeing the business tourism and the conventions, and that gives downtown a kind of an empty feeling and that makes it difficult for retailers.",

But businesses still need offices, they just don't need as much office space as often as they did before. And the office market is going to have to adjust for that. We're going to either need to see new tenants coming in or some of that space is going to be -- have to be used for other purposes. That kind of adjustment has to take place before we get the daytime population in San Francisco back to what we're used to. And then it's going to be a better environment for retailers.",

But when we look at the economic data, we see things trending up in a way that doesn't sort of fit the doom loop narrative. Again, it's been a slow recovery. For example, taxable sales in our downtown are 10 percent plus higher than they were last year. It's just been a slower recovery because we're waiting for really the future of downtown to sort itself out.",

The city is going to face budgetary precious because of remote work and because of the lack of recovery in hotels. And the transit agencies, which we rely on to make sure downtown is full, we - we can't really get to a full downtown without transit service. They are facing their own fiscal issues.The issues about crime could lead into a situation where people are avoiding downtown and that makes the environment there worse. Again, I don't think that's the direction we're headed now, but that's a risk. So, there are a number of things we need to get right over the next few years.

More Americans have an unfavorable view of the U.K. royal family at just 38 percent. And I will note, you know, this is something that I find to be fascinating.
