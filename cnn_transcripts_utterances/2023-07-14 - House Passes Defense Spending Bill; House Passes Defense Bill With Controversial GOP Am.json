      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the GOP finds the votes to come out on top of a culture war collision. Republicans passed the crucial bill that assures the U.S. is ready to fight wars and they did it after putting a very deliberate conservative stamp on it.Plus, Jared Kushner under oath. New reporting reveals that prosecutors asked the former president's son-in-law, did Donald Trump believes his own election lies. And Iowa decides in six months. The countdown to the caucuses is on as Donald Trump decides to play hooky and skip a big summit. Is that we need Iowa when you have Mike Tyson. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, Kevin McCarthy keeps the Republican family mostly together to win a culture war battle. Last hour, the House did its job and cleared a must pass defense bill. The final vote tally was 219 to 210. And that seems really, really tight for a bill that sets military policy. Well, it is. The narrow margin is thanks to a very heated back and forth over controversial add-ons to the bill. Republicans say those amendments are unnecessary course correction to weed out wokeness from the military. Democrats accused Republicans of hijacking the bill to shove right wing ideology down the throats of the American people. The House speaker spoke immediately after the bill was passed his tone triumphant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): I'm sorry to disappoint you that Republicans continue to keep our promises and we just again, from all your questions all week long, will the NDA pass this week? Not many of you ever asked me about the policy. So, I want to spend some moment. Your first question? Yes, it passed. (END VIDEO CLIP) BASH: Let's go right to Capitol Hill and chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju. It seems as though the tensions could not be higher. This felt like a very emotional 48 hours there.",

      "sentences": "Yes, no question about it. Because as you mentioned, this bill typically is passed every single year with a huge bipartisan vote. In fact, that came out of the House Armed Services Committee with just one dissenting vote and pass with Democratic and Republican support.That was not the case. That happened just now. Just four Democrats broke ranks and voted for it, four Republicans voted against it. Among the Democrats who voted for it and that 219 to 210 vote, Jared Golden of Maine. He is a Democrat from a swing district, someone who is more moderate than many of his members. He voted for this plan and among the Republican no votes. Andy Biggs a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus along with Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican as well as Eli Crane and Tom Massie, four conservative members on the House voting no, but the Democratic support so little is because of the changes that were added to this bill. Speaker McCarthy catering to the demands of his far right, which is threatening to hold up this bill, allowed amendments to go forward that essentially would nix the Pentagon's abortion policy, providing reimbursement to serve to members of the military who travel out of state to get an abortion. Also dealing with the issue of transgender healthcare, eliminating healthcare for veterans, transgender veterans, that would be part of this bill as well, as well as eliminating diversity and equity and training programs had been a big push among conservatives, no longer part of this bill. But in talking to conservatives, many of them defending these changes and also arguing that they plan to pressure their leadership to hold the line and not back off in negotiations with the Senate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): When you have a man in a dress that's recruiting or promoting the military, that doesn't fly in East Tennessee. He doesn't fly anywhere, most places in America. When we get away from what traditional America believes, traditional America will not -- it's not going to play ball. REP. RALPH NORMAN, (R-SC): You know, we're going to drive a hard bargain on that. And we can't control the Senate. We can't control the House (Ph).",

Someone who had authored that bipartisan bill out of that committee, voting against his plan here. He is optimistic that a deal could be reached with the Senate that would be more in line of what he supports, but it's unclear how that conference committee process, House and Senate process will play out.We have learned that Kevin McCarthy gave Marjorie Taylor Greene who is a hard right conservative, someone who plan to vote no on this bill. He gave her a spot on the conference committee. That was one of the concessions he made. So, gives you an indication, Dana, of all the horse trading that went on, as McCarthy pushed his bill through on the narrowest of margins.",

And not just because this is a must pass military bill that we've all seen passed with flying colors, by large bipartisan votes, but because they are each side is using it, mostly Republicans in this case, to make the point that they believe certain cultural issues either belong or don't belong in the U.S. military and the culture and the realities that are happening in the broader America should or should not happen in the military.",

And you saw Democrats really struggling last night after the abortion amendment that banned the reimbursement from the Pentagon of families who need to travel across state lines that they need to get that healthcare because it's not offered in their state.You saw a lot of Democrats kind of grappling with the fact that they were going to have to make a decision about voting against a bill that includes pay raises for the military, that includes more investments in infrastructure. Some of them have military installations in their own districts. Gerry Connolly told me 25 percent of my economy in my district is based on military investments.

This is a pure bass political play. And this is why, you know, it's so interesting, because we have always attached the term, reporters who cover the NDAA.We've always attached the term must pass, must pass, must pass, because of the politics you state, because like no member of Congress wants to be facing an ad, targeting them for voting against the military in any way, right? So, it's always this must pass thing. But when you load up, sort of culture war battle lines, it creates a whole different crosscurrent of politics here. And so, yes, while the horse trading is normal and has gone on forever. I don't know that this is particularly normal. I mean, I think this (crosstalk) you mentioned the Republican Party. You know, I think it's an unrecognizable Republican Party, even 15 years ago, you know, the way that this kind of bill or these issues would have been dealt with by Republicans in Congress.",

He learned that the secretaries of state from Pennsylvania and New Mexico have both been interviewed by Special Counsel Jack Smith, in his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Now these are just two of the seven battleground states where former President Trump and his allies were really trying to up end Biden's victory.Now what's interesting to me is when it comes to the Pennsylvania secretary of state, he met with investigators back in March. And Zach Cohen that they were especially interested in his time as the Philadelphia city commissioner in issues he encountered around a misinformation about widespread voter fraud. And that's notable to me because you know, as you've reported, and others have reported over the past few days that the Michigan secretary of state was also asked about this by investigators, asking specifically how misinformation impacted election workers right, threats against them. So, this is clearly a real focus right now for Jack Smith in his investigation. We know other officials from those seven states have also been subpoenaed or asked for interviews by the Special counsel. So, this appears to be a large part of what the special counsel's working on right now.",

Mr. Kushner testified before grand jury at the federal courthouse in Washington last month, where he is said to have maintained that it was his impression that Mr. Trump truly believed the election was stolen, according to a person briefed on the matter. So that is it comes to the question, and I'll have you since you are the lawyer at the table, she is the only lawyer -- and covering this. OK. So, that's a question of intent, which matters a lot. When you look at Donald Trump's culpability when it comes to January 6.

It's one thing if your son-in-law right says, yes, he had a good faith belief that he had won the election. But you have so many other witnesses who contradict that, right? We know in early December, his own Attorney General Bill Barr told him that look, you lost. And then we know that they're really focused on a meeting a few weeks later, where Trump was literally in between two groups of people in the Oval Office, some outside lawyers who were trying to give him plans to use the military to seize voting machines, and then his own trusted White House lawyers who were like, no, we're not doing that. And as we've talked about, that you've lost, we need to move on.And one of the reasons they're focused on that meeting is not just for what was said, but for what Trump did afterward. And getting insight into his mindset during all these key events, leading up to the election and following the election. This is a real focus for the special counsel. It does get difficult in terms of a successful criminal prosecution to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt in terms of what you actually believe.
