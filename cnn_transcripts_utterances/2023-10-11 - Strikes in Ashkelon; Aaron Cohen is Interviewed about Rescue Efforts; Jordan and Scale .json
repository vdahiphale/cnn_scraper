Israel has been clear about that. They know that. That is a reality.There is a resignation and an acceptance of that and an expectation. A really heavy sense of weightiness. Because, yes, people are here, people are living their lives, but it is not normal. The streets are deserted. Many of the stores, as Nic Robertson was say, are closed. The ones that are open are not very full. It is a nation on the edge, on the verge, and a nation waiting.

We provide extensive amount of intelligence back and forth between the agencies. From what I understand, there are American assets right now because there is a possibility that there are U.S. hostages that are being held. I cannot confirm. I don't know. But it is a possibility. Those units train extensively together. They did a lot of operations against ISIS in a very clandestine unit that was operating or has been operating for the last eight years in Syria and other parts of the Middle East. These units train together. These units share information. They are constantly in contact. That includes German assets, the GSG9, the British SAS. They have a fantastic relationship. And right now they are talking, they are planning. And the U.S. intelligence technical capabilities with that fleet that's been moved into the region has an incredible signal intelligence capability that is being shared with the Israelis right now to help zero in on those hostages. That's our first concern right now in this operation. We need to get those hostages. And if you ask me how it could be done, I believe that the smokescreen of the counteroffensive, which is being planned by the Givati Brigade in the south, the 300 - the reservists that's been called up, the Givati Brigade it's Israel's equivalent to the Marines. I think there's going to be a smokescreen there and an opportunity to use the chaos of that incursion or counteroffensive to mount multiple hostage rescue takedowns. It's going to be dangerous. It's going to be high intensity. And like your reporter said, there's going to be a lot of bloodshed, unfortunately. But we -- we pay a heavy price to have an Israeli state. So, this is what we do, we come together in these times and we're creative and we execute with audacity and poise and precision. And it's time for Israel to go to work.

And those can be interesting and fun parlor games, but here's why it's not fun and interesting parlor -- it may be interesting, but not fun parlor games. After that motion to vacate was gaveled, we heard a member on the floor yell, what's the plan? And that's the reality of where Republicans are right now. There still is no plan. There's no end in sight. And this could continue, not just through today, but for several days, if not into next week.

I remember Morris Udall, who was a congressman in the 1970s, ran for a leadership post. He was from Arizona. And he thought he was going to win, and he lost when they took a secret ballot.

And it's -- it's a new battle that Israel is now facing from these Hamas terrorists who crossed into Israel and went door to door in various kibbutz and various locations, including that musical festival, and jut deciding to go kill as many Israelis as they possibly could. It's been a shocking development indeed, especially for everyone in Israel.And I've been speaking with Israelis almost on a daily basis, getting their sense of what's going on. This is truly something that hasn't happened before. Israel has faced terrorism over the years, suicide bombers and things like that. They faced full-scale wars, the 1967 six-day war, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but those were with countries, Egypt, Jordan, Syria in those days.",

They are almost certainly going to move into Gaza and deal with Hamas as best as they can, knowing it's complicated, knowing it's very dangerous and knowing that there's a huge civilian population there, but -- and also knowing now that there are a lot of hostages that Hamas took from Israel into Gaza.So, it's very, very complicated. I'm sure their military planners, their intelligence planners, are going through various scenarios, rehearsals how to deal with this. But I suspect that's going to happen in the coming days. And I've been convinced for days now, since Saturday morning, that this new war that has developed is only just beginning. And I still believe that.",

And I was the first journalist allowed to go through this tunnel several years ago when I went to cover an earlier war that was going on between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.It was built by the Hamas and it went right out of Gaza and up to a kibbutz along the border. And that they would go in and their plan at that time, which was thwarted by the Israelis, was to use this tunnel, instead of going across a fence from Gaza into Israel, to go through these tunnels that they were building. And they were pretty sophisticated tunnels indeed. And I walked through it from Gaza into Israel and it was a really powerful experience for me as a journalist.",
