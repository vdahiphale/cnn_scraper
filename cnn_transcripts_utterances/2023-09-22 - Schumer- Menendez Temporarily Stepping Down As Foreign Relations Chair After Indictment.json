Democrat Bob Menendez temporarily giving up his post as Foreign Relations Committee Chair as he faces corruption related charges for the second time in 10 years. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is working to support the story for us.Evan, break down the charges for us. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, the Senator is facing very serious charges, including bribery and honest services charges. What prosecutors are laying out are some astonishing details of what they say the senator was trading in excess -- access to his office essentially, for money including hundreds of 1000s of dollars in cash, gold bars, mortgage payments for the home of his wife, as well as a Mercedes Benz car that, $60,000, car that a prosecutor say was all paid for by some of these codefendants. Now, Prosecutors laid out a June 2022 search by the FBI where they say they found some of this money, $480,000 in cash were found -- was found some of its stuffed into jackets bearing the name of the senator. You see pictures there the inside the 40 page indictment that was unsealed today by prosecutors at the Southern District of New York. They also said that they found $70,000 in a safe deposit back box that was also searched that day in June. They also notice -- they also noted that they found nine gold bars. They also said that they found fingerprints and DNA from some of the co-defendants that link some of that cash directly to the senator. Now, one of the -- one of the hurdles for prosecutors is to show what Senator Menendez was doing in exchange for the bribes, in exchange for this money. And here's what they laid out in this indictment. They say that he pressured a Department of Agriculture official to help one of his co-dependence -- co-defendants can maintain his monopoly on halal meat exports to the -- to Egypt. They say he pressured state prosecutors in New Jersey to help fix a case for one of his co- defendants and friends of his co-defendants. They say that he also provided nonpublic information on military sales to Egypt. Again, information that made its way to Egyptian officials, as well as editing a letter that was being used to help lobby members of the Senate, again, related to Egyptian military sales here from the United States, Wolf.",

We just got a statement from the governor that -- this is the governor of New Jersey, and let me read it to you, because it's very serious. This is Governor Murphy and today's indictment against Senator Menendez, the allegations in the indictment against Senator Menendez and four other defendants are deeply disturbing. These are serious charges that implicate national security and the integrity of our criminal justice system. Under our legal system, Senator Menendez and the other defendants have not been found guilty and will have the ability to present evidence disputing these charges. And we must respect the process.

But who knows how he reacts as the pressure mounts, especially from Democrats. That's something that's also different from his last indictment, there was a Republican governor, Democrats, you know, we're a little bit more hesitant to directly criticize him and call for his resignation. The circumstances are different, the case is different. The fact that there's a Democratic governor who would appoint a replacement is different. And quite frankly, I think the fact that he's facing charges again that, you know, there's a perception that even after facing this crap -- this cloud of scrutiny for several years, that he didn't operate a little bit better just to avoid any questions whether he ultimately gets found guilty or not. And so I think the cause for his resignation will increase. The question is, will he remain defiant? Or will he start, you know, reacting to that pressure?",

But overall, Joe Biden is at 52 percent and Donald Trump is at 40 percent.Take a look here when you look by party, Wolf, 94 percent of Democrats are -- they're basically universally aligned with Biden in this and that helps him overwhelm a slight six percentage lead that Trump has over Biden among independents 45 to 39. But note there that Donald Trump with his own party is substantially lower, 79 percent support than Biden is with Democrats. We see Joe Biden in each one of the general election matchups with Republicans, Wolf, winning this state outside the margin of error. So it could be a battleground state that is tilting a little blue if it stays this way for the full year. But it is welcome news to the White House even though what we've been talking about with Joe Biden in the past we do see in our poll concerns about his age, his health, among Democrats, they remain, but they're just not enough to swamp what is this substantial lead he has over Donald Trump in the state.",

That's something he told donors about in New York last week, and he started getting much more aggressive in this space going at Trump directly after kind of like holding back not wanting to weigh in on his specific indictments and trials and trying to stay out of the Department of Justice way, but the argument about democracy is one that you're not going to see President Biden shy away from you're going to start seeing him lean more into. So in that sense, Cassidy Hutchinson is a player in that overall story.Do I think her book is somehow going to impact Donald Trump's poll numbers? No. But I do think this larger piece about democracy, we saw it as an argument in the 2022 midterms, and the electorate cared about it enough. And I don't think that's gone away.

What Ukrainian Canadians tell me here is they know that Zelenskyy wants to be seen as a winner, that if he is seem to be winning this battle, no matter what has been said so far about the counter offensive, that he knows that he's able to get more military aid more quickly if he can show their strength on the battlefield.

And that includes assets from the Central Bank of Russia. I have to tell you, Wolf, whether you talk to the State Department in the United States or the Treasury, they are very skeptical that this plan can work or that it's even legal. So, Zelenskyy was definitely, again, leaning on Canada to try and have some influence with other allies, including in the United States. And obviously, this continues to be a tough sell with Republicans on Capitol Hill. It will take much more than one strike on the Black Sea headquarters to do it, but he believes that countries like Canada continue to plead his cause, that perhaps he can elicit more support even from Republicans in the U.S. Wolf.",

Initially that bill to fund the government tomorrow, it included a number of conservative priorities. But McCarthy had to reverse course, once it became clear that he did not have the votes for that bill.Now, I did just leave a meeting with some of Kevin McCarthy's top allies. And they outlined what their new strategy is going to be going forward. The plan as of right now is they're going to try to pass as many long term individual spending bills as possible next week. And they're hoping that that could get some of these conservative hardliners on board with a short term plan. But all of those bills, the short term plan that the GOP is considering, the long term bills they're trying to pass are dead on arrival in the Senate. So it really doesn't do much to solve their shutdown problem. And Kevin McCarthy is clearly frustrated. Take a listen to what he had to say earlier this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: I just believe if you're not funding the troops and you're not funding the border, pretty difficult to think that you're going to win in a shutdown. I've been through those a couple of times. And if members think by moving you into a shutdown and that's positive idea. I think what we continue to talk about it. I thought we had a really good conference the night before the two people the other way too. So it's a yin and a yang. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

New CNN video shows migrants wading through the banks of the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass Texas, many of them looking for a narrow opening to crawl under the dense rows of razor sharp wire.

And that was where we've seen dramatic scenes play out where you've had hundreds of people standing in the water for hours on and refusing to go back to the other side.And then eventually trying to figuring out a way to lift up the razor wire and safely get through. And that's what we saw yesterday unfold here as state law enforcement and border patrol agents simply just watched on. All of those people turn themselves in. And they were then processed by border patrol agents. Some of them we were told, were arrested on trespassing charges here in Texas. But all of this continuing to unfold that the question is, how long is this latest surge of migrants going to last and across the U.S. southern border. Local authorities are bracing for the long term impact of all of this. The mayor of Eagle Pass, Wolf, tells us that he's been told by federal authorities that they're about 50 to 60,000 migrants in southern Mexico. The train lines that have been moving many of these migrants North, they've literally been hopping on trains to make the journey north have been shut down temporarily. And the mayor also says that they believe that many of those migrants are deeper in Mexico waiting for those trains to fire up again, then that could be one of the explanations why we've seen so few people trying to cross today. But despite this, they believe that this migrant surge is going to continue and they're bracing for much more impact of migrants arriving here. These communities were many of the local officials say that the shelter system and the capacity to care for them has been strained to the maximum right now. Wolf?",

But among kids, they've risen five times since that trough three months ago. Now it's important really to put this into context. This rise is off the lowest level that we've seen for hospitalizations, with COVID since they started measuring this at the beginning of the pandemic, but it is rising to levels that doctors are starting to become concerned about this really overall.And if you look at where geographically hospitalizations are highest, it's really concentrated in areas in the south. Particularly you can see the yellow there that's showing higher levels and the orange even higher than that really concentrated in states like Florida. One concerning trend among the kids data we're seeing from the American Academy of Pediatrics is that really we're seeing these pronounced rises in kids under the age of four. We're seeing that they are just a quarter of kids in the country but more than half of COVID hospitalizations. And their vaccination rates for COVID are particularly low. Only 13 percent of kids under the age of four have had any dose of COVID vaccine, compared with about two thirds of kids between the ages of 12 to 17. So the American Academy of Pediatrics really urging parents to talk with their pediatricians about how to protect their kids from COVID.",
