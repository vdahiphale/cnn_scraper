First we learned that the president of the University of Pennsylvania is stepping down and then just frankly moments later that university official who made that announcement saying that he, too, would be resigning.Let's start with Liz Magill. She announced tonight that she would be stepping down from her position as UPenn president per the university statement. She will remain as tenured faculty at the law school there and also agreed to stay on board while they find an interim replacement. As we've reported, students, faculty, staff, donors which are certainly a critical piece of this, all losing confidence. At least many of them losing confidence in Magill after that disastrous testimony on Tuesday in which she, along with the president at MIT and Harvard, failed to explicitly say that calls for the genocide of Jewish people would not immediately violate the university's code of conduct. And then moments after we learned of her resignation, Scott Bok also saying that he, too, would be stepping down from his position as the chair of the Board of Trustees at the university. In a statement, Bok wrote, quote, \"Former President Liz Magill last week made a very unfortunate misstep. Following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable and she and I concurrently decided that it was time for her and I to exit.\" Bok also defended Magill calling her a good person, a talented leader and, as he put it, not the slightest bit antisemitic. And then finally, Jim, also offering some perspective and some insight on that testimony from Tuesday saying that she was not herself. Bok wrote, \"She was overprepared, over-lawyered, and provided a legalistic answer to a moral question,\" and that, Bok said, was wrong -- Jim.",

I mean, the fact of the matter is that she was asked a very simple question which was, is calling for a Jewish genocide against the policies of the University of Pennsylvania? She wasn't asked any type of harder question that actually involved more context. And her answer was that it was context dependent and that it could only be considered harassment if the words became actions.And I was really taken aback by that because the question was regarding Jewish genocide and she said if it becomes action. So what I hear is, if calls for Jewish genocide on campus turn into a Jewish genocide on campus, then it would be considered harassment. And while I certainly hope that that would be at least considered harassment, the fact that it would take that much to hear our president say that it would indeed take that much for them to do anything to protect us, it was scary to hear. And so I don't think that it was just an unfortunate response. I think that if she had given at left a more context on what type of context would be acceptable for a student or a faculty to make a call for Jewish genocide, I would be really willing to listen to her and to understand what she was trying to say.

That's what they're going to try to do on day one. And the pieces that were (INAUDIBLE) the most, Jim, are the weaponization of the national security community. I mean, that's where, if you look anywhere in history, you see the most grievous abuses of power is when the army or domestic security forces are used against a leader's political enemies. And those are things that aren't just forecast of what Trump could do. He's talked about weaponizing the spy community, to spy on his adversaries. He has talked about creating his own mercenary force within the military so he doesn't have to go through a chain of command that he worries would disobey him. He's talked about using the Department of Homeland Security to intimidate his opponents in Democratic sanctuary cities and to make sure that blue states don't get aid and red states do when there's natural disasters. I mean, this is laid out very clear. We know what will happen. And I do worry. It will be likely the end of the American republic as we know it if he comes back.

So she says that the complications of her pregnancy have really been detrimental to her health, and she is worried about her future reproductive health. And this is according to her doctors in which she's been discussing with them. So she decided to sue the state of Texas to essentially ask them to allow her to get a legal abortion in the state. A judge in Texas granted that.And this is significant, extremely significant, when it comes to the debate over abortion bans. And not only that but the medical exemptions in the state of Texas. This is a state with one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. You see those exceptions there. And so this ruling was very significant. But the attorney general in the state of Texas did not agree with what the judge ruled so he asked the state Supreme Court to intervene. And that's exactly what they did here. Essentially freezing the lower court's decision, saying that it is a temporary block. That at some point they will review this case but did not give a timeline here. And time is really critical because, as we mentioned, she's 20 weeks pregnant. So I want to read what her attorney said. And her attorney saying that they are very hopeful but still say, you know, that this is why people shouldn't beg for health care from a court of law. On the other hand you have Ken Paxton who is saying that essentially Kate Cox failed to demonstrate what life-threatening condition, or why she's at risk of death. You see part of what he wrote there, saying that she fails to identify what life-threatening medical condition she has. Again, she says that this has been extremely difficult and she's had to go to the emergency room. Believes that if her child is to be born, it would only live for a few days.

Her doctors have told her that in their best medical judgment, the treatment that she needs to be able to preserve her ability to have kids again in the future for this pregnancy, it's an abortion because this pregnancy is not going to end with a healthy child.

But it's even worse than that, because not only did the doctors serve -- you know, say they believe that she qualifies for an exemption. Not only did she go to court to file this lawsuit and get approval from a judge who says yes, I agree with you, you qualify for this exemption. But even after all of that, Ken Paxton comes along and says he disagrees with the doctors. Apparently, he can exercise or he can practice Medicine better than Kate Cox's doctors can, even though to my knowledge, he doesn't have a medical license. And he is also saying -- he is thumbing his nose at the judge's order saying, telling the hospitals that if they move forward and allow Miss Cox to have the abortion that she needs, that he is going to come after the doctors in any way, notwithstanding what the judge has already decided.

There were chaotic scenes as the bodies of the dead and wounded were taken to a local hospital in that area, Deir al Balah. But much of the fighting, the most intense fighting that we've seen over the course of the past few days has been around the biggest city in the south, Khan Yunis. That's where Israeli officials believe that some top Hamas leaders may be. Israeli troops are trying to encircle the city. They say that they're breaking through Hamas' defensive lines, that they're fighting from house-to-house, tunnel-to-tunnel they say. And tonight, the IDF issued what they called an urgent appeal for residents and civilians of central Khan Yunis to evacuate. They posted a map online saying that people in five specific areas need to go to a sixth area where they say shelters have been established. The IDF posted a map, but it is unclear to what extent the Palestinians in Khan Yunis have internet connectivity and can get online to see this map. It is unclear whether they know to check Israeli channels or whether they can understand this very complicated map. And we don't know really what shelters are in that area that Israel is telling these residents of Khan Yunis to evacuate to. At the same time, thousands of people have gone even farther south towards the city of Rafah near the border with Egypt where there is some shelter, but the shelters there are overflowing, people are sleeping in the streets. There is no fuel. There is little food, little water. The Red Crescent said that around 100 trucks of aid did cross into Gaza from Egypt today, but that is still well below the average number of trucks that were crossing into Gaza during that fragile seven-day pause. Now officials say that some 85 percent of the Gazan population is now displaced, while the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health says that more than 17,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7th -- Jim.",
