And we'll also take you live to the Doha Forum, where some of the leading global voices are discussing regional diplomacy options for the Israel-Hamas War. University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and the Head of the School's Board of Trustees have resigned. It comes after the intense backlash to the comments made by three U.S. university presidents to Congress about anti-Semitism on their campuses. Now, this all began amid a wave of protests over the Israel-Hamas War. Many at college campuses, many of them expressing support for the Palestinian cause. But there's a debate over whether phrases, such as, \"From The River to the Sea,\" amount to a call to eradicate Israel. Magill and the Presidents of Harvard and MIT struggle to answer a Congress member's question about where their universities would draw the line.

Now, moments after Magill's Saturday evening announcement, Scott Bok said that he too would be stepping down as Chair of the Board of Trustees at the university. In his statement, Bok writing, quote, \"Former President Liz Magill last week made a very unfortunate misstep.\" Bok eventually writes, \"following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable and she and I concurrently decided that it was time for her to exit. Bok also defending Magill, calling her a good person, a talented leader, and in his words, not the slightest bit anti-Semitic. Bok also sharing some perspective about what may have been Magill's state of mind the day of this disastrous hearing on the Hill, saying that Magill was not herself at the time, that she was over-lawyered, that she was over-prepared, and that she provided a legalistic answer to what was a moral question, and that, Bok says, was wrong.

      "sentences": "The White House is remaining mostly tight-lipped about these charges filed against Hunter Biden saying that President Biden loves his son and supports him, but not weighing in on the substance of the charges. And certainly this is one of the most sensitive issues inside the West Wing.There are very few aides who discuss this matter with President Biden. And when you talk to them, there are few who say they have firsthand understanding of how the President is processing all of this. But certainly it is weighing heavily on President Biden, his son's legal issues. These are no different. And some of the personal issues that were raised in that filing will be problematic for President Biden as he gears up for reelection next year. And certainly this will be a political headache for the President as he enters 2024. And you already hear Republicans trying to conflate Hunter Biden's legal issues with the legal issues facing President Trump. But of course, these are very separate cases. President Trump was in the White House and he was running to be in the White House again. Hunter Biden has never been president and won't be president. But this is still a political headache for President Biden as he enters this reelection year. And certainly the challenge for him will be making this a contest between him and President Trump and trying to frame the stakes of this election. And you are starting to hear him sharpen his attacks on his predecessor and most likely rival. And in fact, when he was in Las Vegas on Friday talking about passenger rail investments, he went after President Trump by name. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: Trump just talks to talk. We walk the walk. Look, he likes to say America's a failing nation. Frankly he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is why President Biden is out here in Los Angeles this weekend raising campaign cash at a series of fundraisers.And in fact, behind closed doors at those fundraisers, he is even sharper in his attacks on President Trump. On Friday night, telling donors, literally, I believe the future of American democracy is at stake. The greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy, because if we lost that, we lose everything. So certainly you see President Biden there fine tuning his attacks on President Trump as he gears up for this election season. Now, I was talking with Jeffrey Katzenberg. He's the movie mogul, but also a Co-chair of the Biden campaign. And he told me that this 36- hour stretch of fundraising out here in California will be the most successful campaign fundraising stretch that President Biden has engaged in since he announced his reelection effort in the spring.

But between now and then are the holidays, which means that GOP hopefuls have very little time left. And with Trump the clear frontrunner, candidates are telling Iowa voters why they'd be the better choice. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I know is you don't defeat Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. And that's what Donald Trump gives us, rightly or wrongly. I had a great working relationship with him. But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him. You know I'm right. Chaos follows him. And we can't have a country in disarray and a world on fire and survive this chaos. GOV. RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's important to point out that normally in an Iowa caucus, you've got five or six candidates that are running as conservatives and conservative voters are having to look through. That's not the case this year. I think you have Donald Trump, who's obviously moved left, who's not even really putting in the work to earn people's votes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's their third in franchise history.Also, big congrats to those Los Angeles Lakers, winners of the NBA's first ever in-season tournament. It was big night for Anthony Davis, scoring a season high 41 points to go along with 20 rebounds, powering LA to a 123-109 victory over Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas. Now, speaking of rain, Shohei Ohtani is making it rain cash with a massive new deal. The Angels Star headed to the LA Dodgers for a reported 10-year $700 million. I can't even say it, Bianca, it's that much. That's worth more than six entire NHL franchises, 23 MLS franchises, and before taxes, Bianca, $700 million comes out to making $191,000 every day, every year for the next 10 years. What'd you do with that?",
