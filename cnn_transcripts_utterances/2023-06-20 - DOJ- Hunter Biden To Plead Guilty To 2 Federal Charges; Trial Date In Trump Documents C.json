Separately, CNN has also learned that Hunter Biden reached the deal with the Department of Justice to avoid prosecution on a gun felony charge. These developments come after years of investigation by a Trump appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, whom President Biden did not replace when he took office because of Weiss's investigation into his son. Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney Weiss wrote to House Republicans that he alone had, quote, been granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges and for making decisions necessary to preserve the integrity of the prosecution. But none of that stopped Donald Trump or his staunch allies on Capitol Hill from immediately attacking the plea agreement and calling the agreement, among other things, a, quote, slap on the wrist and a, quote, sweetheart deal. The Biden White House has remained mostly silent putting out a short statement that says, quote, the president and first lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life, unquote, an echo of what President Biden told me during an interview last October.

But if this was all they had federally criminally chargeable, then it's not a sweetheart deal.Now, just to give you one example, a lot of this is perspective. If we look at the gun charge, it is exceedingly rare for somebody to be charged with a federal gun crime and given pretrial diversion as Hunter Biden has been given he doesn't have to plead guilty as long as he behaves himself, the charge will go away. On the other hand, the vast majority of federal gun crimes involve somebody who either used the gun in some sort of violent crime, or somebody who's a prior convicted felon. So it's rare to see someone prosecuted at all under the law that Hunter Biden was prosecuted, which is possession of a gun by an addict. So it's largely a perspective here.",

The president recently said in an interview that he didn't believe that his son has done anything wrong. Of course, Hunter Biden in this guilty plea is indeed admitting to wrongdoing.

And that's because I'm told that the White House and the president's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, they have kept an open line of communication with Hunter Biden's attorneys throughout this process. And that that is a line of communication that's been open on both ends. That being said, a senior Biden advisor told me that, look, they are not directing or advising Hunter Biden's legal team.
