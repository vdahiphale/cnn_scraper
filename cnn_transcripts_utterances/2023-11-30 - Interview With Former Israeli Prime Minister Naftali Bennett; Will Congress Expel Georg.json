CNN just obtained the study exposing racism, hazing, discrimination and sexual abuse assault across the agency. We are following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Here in just over an hour, the House is set to debate on an expulsion resolution for Republican Congressman George Santos. The New York freshman, crying fowl today ahead of tomorrow's vote that could make him just the sixth House member in history to get booted from the House. Santos ripping his colleagues at a morning news conference, saying that they are guilty of double standards and that he's being bullied in the wake of that scathing House Ethics Committee report. It says Santos spent thousands of dollars on things like Botox, personal vacations, paying off personal credit cards and luxury goods. CNN's Lauren Fox live for us on Capitol Hill here. Lauren, this, of course, would be a rare vote, a historic vote. What can we be expecting to come out of this?",

You heard yesterday from House Speaker Mike Johnson that he had some reservations about moving forward with expelling a member of Congress who had not been convicted of a crime. That is a concern that you are hearing from other members as well, including Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, their words, their views, of course, weighing heavily into how members are looking at tomorrow's vote. I would note that George Santos this morning spoke to reporters and his strategy was really to deflect and to distract from the allegations that were raised in that House Ethics report. In fact, he was asked if any of those allegations were true. He said he was not going to go line by line and go through the report. He said at some point in the future he would be willing to do that, but obviously not answering the underlying question of whether or not he misused campaign funds, one of the core allegations that were alleged against him in that report. So he also said that he didn't participate fully in the Ethics Committee probe, but that he did participate to some extent. When I pressed him on why he didn't sit down for an interview, something that the House Ethics Committee had requested from him, obviously, the press conference this morning made clear he is defiant. He is not planning to step aside, but, obviously, pressure mounting as that vote is expected tomorrow on whether or not to expel George Santos.",

With him getting kicked out of the House, this would narrow the Republican majority, already very razor-thin majority, in a district Joe Biden carried. That means that Democrats could pick up that seat, and something that Republicans are frankly concerned about. I talked to, though, the New York Republicans who are also freshmen, the ones who are pushing them out. I asked them this morning about the fact that Speaker Johnson has reservations about this. They still said it is time for Republicans to kick him out of the House, regardless of the political consequences. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BRANDON WILLIAMS (R-NY):  We don't know who he is at all. He is a dedicated, committed con man who is in the halls of Congress and access to government secrets, to a lot of things that could be damaging to this country. He has to go. REP. MARCUS MOLINARO (R-NY):  George Santos is doing whatever con man and 4-year-old does, which is to ignore the truth, take no responsibility, and point at others and suggest they're worse. There was a bipartisan, comprehensive Ethics report. That is his due process. It is concluded. It is comprehensive. And it proves that he's a con man, a fraud and a criminal. And he shouldn't be a member of Congress. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK (R-VA):  I think the concern really is more about that thin majority, because this report was done bipartisanly. You have a Republican chairman of the Ethics Committee. It's very detailed. And most of the members are very familiar with campaign finance and what you can spend your money on and what you can't use it for. And so when they read that report, they understand how flagrant this was. His own staff are people who have now testified or pled guilty in the judicial system already, so people are familiar with that. And, really, he's been given a lot of opportunities to resign. And as has been pointed out, usually, shame would have already driven somebody from office at this point and somebody would have already resigned at this point. So I think the New York delegation, the people who are closest to this, the New York Republicans, all these freshman members, this has been very painful for them, the ones leading the charge, regardless of how close this majority is. And I do think they are -- I certainly hope they will get that large number of Republicans. I heard it was somewhere near 90 or so, and I hope for their sake, because they're the ones who are going to pay the price if George Santos isn't gone.",

And each vote is incredibly significant.Especially at the time we're seeing how difficult it is to usher through an agenda along party lines, that one vote could be hugely significant, which is why a lot of people do not think that this expulsion resolution will pass tomorrow, because of the sheer political concerns. But I should note, we still don't have a clear sense about whether the two-thirds majority will be reached, because a lot of members are not saying what they will do. I talked to many this morning, who simply said, I'm still weighing it, I'm thinking about it, I'm trying to make a decision here. And the Republican leadership has said they are not whipping it. That means they're not telling their members to vote one way or the other. Even though the Republican leaders are expected to oppose it tomorrow, we don't know how the other rank-and-file members will come down, which is why it leaves a lot of uncertainty in this hugely significant, unprecedented vote tomorrow.",

I mean, this is not a member who is doing anything at this point, other than collecting a federal paycheck, which he doesn't deserve. And the clear evidence is already there. And any other, I think, member at this point would have left at this point. And, clearly, if they had 20 more Republican members, they would -- they would already have gotten rid of him. So, I think, regardless of the numbers, other people are leaving. Kevin McCarthy might leave. Bill Johnson is taking a position -- Congressman Bill Johnson from Ohio was taking a position to leave and be a university president. You can't be held hostage to this one person who is out there threatening to expose members of things and make -- who knows what things he might make up in the future.
