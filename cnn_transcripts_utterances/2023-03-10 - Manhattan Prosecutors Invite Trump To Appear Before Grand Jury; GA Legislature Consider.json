Give police departments the resources, give prosecutors the resources to do those things they need to do more.Bill more jails, if you need to do that, whatever it has to be, but don't try to come in and set aside the will of the voter. I want you to think about what the Republican legislature has done in Georgia. And I'll give you a sense of why I say there's an undercurrent of racism here. When people started lining up to vote, and it took four, five, six, seven hours ago, those numbers were too big. So guess what they did, the Republican legislature passed a bill saying you couldn't take a water. When the absentee ballot started coming in and we're being counted in a certain way that it seemed that suddenly absentee ballots were moving toward the Democratic side and that the elections were getting shifted. Guess what the Republican legislature did. They came in, decided I needed an oversight board to try to take over local boards of election. Nonsense. And now when you've got a prosecutor and she happens to be an African American lady, but when you've got a prosecutor looking into whether or not Republican leaders, including the leader of one of the chambers, who is authored this bill or sponsor this bill, he didn't author it, but it's out of his chamber. When you look at that, when you get somebody to investigate whether or not they stole it, or involved in fraud in the election, they want to pass suddenly an oversight by senator they're interested. Just ask yourself, have they ever passed a bill on whether or not we should recall or have a committee oversight on whether members of the General Assembly were doing their job? We have not and that tells you about what you need to know.",

They're very tired of the storm after storm despite being appreciative that there's now a rain after such severe drought in previous years.Where I'm standing, I want to show you. This is the Nimbus dam, it is releasing thousands and thousands of cubic feet of water per second. And this is flowing into the American River from Lake Natoma. This is an example of what officials have been doing to prepare for this moment. They are doing a managed release in this way to help the rivers and creeks and levees not be overwhelmed by the rain that's incoming. Now, in this particular spot, the rain was very heavy, the winds were gusting overnight, it's now moving a little bit more east of us into the foothills of the mountains, which have already had unusual snowpack from the previous storms you mentioned. And one of the problems there could be structural collapse because when you've got a lot of heavy snow on top of those buildings, that's mixing now with the rain and getting, you know, the slush and melting and possibly causing groups to cave in. We had one example of that last weekend, private school in Nevada City actually posting about it yesterday, their school gym actually caved in because of that weight from the snow that's mixing with the rain. We saw a local affiliate report that that happened to a structure in Grass Valley last night. So this is something that we're continuing to watch as we watch these rivers and these dams go to work. And hopefully, if it works as the officials have planned that could really ease the flooding concerns. Now, there still are flooding concerns though in many communities that have gotten a lot of this already in the past couple of months. We'll be watching them and making sure that everyone is safe in those areas as well. Erica?",
