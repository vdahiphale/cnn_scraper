We begin in the Israeli occupied West Bank where an American activist has been shot and killed during an anti-settlement protest. Eyewitnesses say she was shot in the head by the Israeli military. The IDF now admits to fir at the demonstrators and that they are, quote, now looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. All of this comes as the Israeli military temporarily withdrew after a 9-day operation to, quote, prevent terror in the West Bank. Israel's defense minister signaled the IDF will, in fact, return. Thirty-nine people were killed in Israel's military operation. Today, residents are returning to find streets demolished, homes destroyed neighborhoods without electricity or water. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. And, Nic, before we get to the conditions in the West Bank, tell us what we know about this shooting, shot and killed, Israeli forces admit they fired at demonstrators. Eyewitnesses say the shots were the result of Israeli fire. Was there anyone else firing in the area?",

They have admitted as you said that they fired those live rounds but they haven't said yet if there was a gunman in the area. From what we understand from the description, this is a weekly protest. So it's nothing new that she was attending.The protesters were sort of at the bottom of the hill. The IDF was up the hill. It seemed to be getting towards the end of the protest, but the IDF had fired tear gas into the area. Some of the protesters were hiding behind large metal, the huge metal trash cans, then the IDF started firing shots, their protesters, including this young 26-year- old ran away and that's when she was hit as she ran away. Medics quickly put her in an ambulance but by the time she got to her hospital in the nearby city of Nablus, she was pronounced dead. Not far away in Jenin, we were arriving there just as the first of the funerals were beginning for all those people killed during the Israeli military operation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Zelenskyy warned of what he calls a significant shortfall in vital military support.

We are told that this delivery of these ballistic missiles happened recently, though it is unclear exactly when they were transferred. But the bottom line here is this is going to really have a significant effect potentially on the war in Ukraine, particularly as Russia has continued to step up its missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and, of course, the fear that they're going to continue to do so against critical infrastructure leading into the winter.",

And so, it might be a supply issue, but for now, the U.S. says that, of course, it's willing to continue to provide these systems as it can but the question of the long range missiles, that is another one entirely. The U.S. right now not budging on its insistent that Ukraine not use those long-range ATACM systems against targets inside Russia itself, primarily they say because they would not be useful. They say that the glide bombs that Russia is using against Ukraine and against Ukrainian positions particularly in southern Russia in that Kursk region, they are being launched from well outside the range of ATACMS and so, therefore they would not be useful anyway. They're much better used against targets inside Crimea. The Ukrainians are saying look we know better than you do what the targets are that are actually going to make a difference in this war. But still, you know, even with the pressure of the Canadians or the Eastern Europeans, saying the Ukrainians need this capability and they need to be able to use it, the U.S. for now not budging on that, Jim.",

Judge Juan Merchan delayed the sentencing until November 26 to, he says, dispel any notion of interference in the electoral process.Trump's attorneys are still seeking to throw out the charges entirely. Those charges stemming from hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels on the grounds of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling. Judge Merchan's decision today, a reminder just how intertwined Trump's legal and political fates are and how successful his lawyers' attempts to delay all these legal processes have been.

He outlined that Jim in a -- in a four-page letter today issuing his order of moving the sentencing hearing, saying he's thinking about how to protect the proceedings here, how to protect the jury verdict, how to make sure that justice is served and make sure that there is integrity about the public's perception of the judiciary. And one thing he wants to do is avoid advantaging or disadvantaging any political party or candidate by having the sentencing for Donald Trump before the election. It is not unusual for dates like this, like a sentencing date, to move. This date had already moved from July into September, later into September, and now it will be after the election, November 26th. In this case, Jim, jail time is a possibility and even today, Donald Trump is out there calling Judge Merchan, who is set to sentence him in November, a hostile judge toward him. Acceptance of responsibility and respect for proceedings is often taken into consideration by judges when they sentence a defendant. Donald Trump has been held in contempt in this case and so November 26th, at 10:00 a.m., is going to be a pivotal moment like we have never seen before if at that time Donald Trump is the president-elect of the United States, if he wins the election and the sentencing is happening, that will be an extraordinary moment. But, of course, make no mistake, his team fights everything and has already said they don't want to see any sentencing at all.

Earlier, he had said that there that was a possibility. Then he made it clear that it was not because he's only 14.

For NASA, this is not what they wanted. They wanted at least two different vehicles that could come and go to the space station. They've only had the SpaceX Dragon now for several years because Boeing is so far behind, so far over budget and has not certified the spacecraft yet, and it's still not certified after this mission as well.

There their questions about what happens in the future for Boeing and space. The CEO has said that he's going to satisfy the contract which means they need to get the spacecraft certified and they need to fly I believe it's a half dozen flights for NASA but they've not made any commitment at least in briefings that they've been talking to reporters about going beyond those six flights.",

The blast at Abbey Gate killed 13 U.S. service members and some 170 Afghans desperate to flee Taliban rule.In the years since, U.S. veterans of the Afghan war have suffered terribly through frustration, mental illness and too often suicide, wondering what they and their fellow soldiers fought and died for.

The reality is there is a growing and emanating terror threat comingout of the very NATO bases that we trained and operated on that is very likely going to visit us here at home.

And it's regardless of politics, these are men and women who fought alongside these Afghans who were conditioned to never leave an ally behind, and all of a sudden, we had to leave them in the dirt.And it's like the world's longest 911 call, Jim. They can't hang up the phone because they're all that stands between these Afghans and being hunted and killed. And so, if they do hang up the phone, if these Afghans are exterminated or killed or unable to resettle, what does that do to the mental health of these veterans that that's all they're able to hang on to, to find meaning in this war? And I think that's why our politicians and our generals are missing it right now.

It's another avenue for the NFL to spread the game globally and you can make money off of that.
