      "sentences": "He wrote, quote, \"While Biden's would be opponents have the luxury of lacking official responsibilities, a president must consider the geo-strategic and humanitarian implications of their actions. Sometimes, that means acting in the national interest in a way that may harm their political interests.\"Very cogently put there by Stephen. Our great panel of reporters are back here with us. Let me just give an example of what he's alluding to. A few examples of what progressives are saying about these strikes. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Progressive Caucus, an unacceptable violation of the constitution. Rashida Tlaib, violating Article I of the Constitution. Ro Khanna needs to come to Congress before launching a strike. Barbara Lee, violence only begets more violence. Those are some of the most powerful progressive voices in the House of Representatives. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, this is kind of what comes with being an incumbent president during an election year. You have the responsibility of not only going out and hitting the trail and the politics of the job, but also of governing. There has been concern throughout the White House as well as the administration of a wider war in the region. That is something they've talked about for a while. But I do feel like this has been a theme throughout the Biden presidency of really a focus on foreign policy and sort of a juggling act of balancing the domestic concerns, really the polling numbers, frustration among voters with also frequent trips overseas and a focus, including many speeches of conflicts overseas. I will also be watching. If you look at the original foreign policy plan laid out by the administration, there was a focus on avoiding long term conflicts and more so having precision on a competition with things like China, with nations like China. So moving forward now, where you have sort of multiple incidents, multiple conflicts like this, will be interesting to see just how the administration balances this.",

And I think the criticism, which would have been anticipated by the White House, is why they're going to go to great lengths to sort of lay out for the public why we are in the place that we are and why the strikes that we saw overnight was the action that the U.S. ultimately decided they had to take.I mean, we had a senior administration official telling reporters last night, look, the strikes, the attacks from the Houthis were such that had we not intervened and had we not set up this coalition in the Red Sea, the U.S. and its allies, we would have seen ships being sunk. There was even an incident over the last month where a ship carrying jet fuel may have been hit. So I think they're just trying to sort of paint a vivid as -- vivid a picture as possible of what could have been, not to mention just the economic ramifications, right? I mean, we're talking about a moment in time where, you know, prices are finally coming back down. The global supply chain issues have more or less been resolved relative --",

The first part about it is just such a reminder that it used to be that if a Democratic president did something that was sort of hawkish or even in the national security interest, he would have the back of Republicans because that's where they were, not with Donald Trump in the race or in the leadership of the Republican Party.",

So ISIS is alive and well.Let's turn to your new reporting, MJ. You can find it on CNN.com. We'll just give you a little bit of it here. You say about the Biden campaign and kind of how they're seeing the Republican race. They're kind of ready for it to be over so that they can actually make clear, according to reporting, that to their Democratic voters that this is a real thing. \"Biden campaign officials say they expect that a switch will turn on for many of these voters who are not yet convinced that Trump will be on the ballot in the fall. As one senior official put it, a realization will hit, \"Oh, blank, it is an election between that guy and that guy.\"\"",

But what their internal campaign research is still showing is that these undecided voters that they are going after that will determine everything in November, the majority of them still do not believe that it is likely to be Donald Trump.And they say, you know, the biggest reason is just simply that they're not tuned in yet. They're not tuned in in the way that we are. They're certainly not following the ins and outs of the Republican campaign. And that moment, that oh shoot moment, is coming. They just don't know exactly when that's going to be. Is that going to be after Iowa? Is that going to be after more Republican candidates drop out? And so until then, that is why we are seeing such a ramping up of the Biden campaign going after Trump explicitly on all the issues that we have seen them talk about, whether January 6th, the democracy issues, the economic issues. They're doing the framing of, this is what you would get if it were Trump and not Biden sort of preemptively. And just really trying to remind voters, yes, this is what the Trump White House looked like for the first four years.",

There was a lot of kind of move on from Trump voters. And those people tended to be DeSantis curious voters.

It's that they don't find her repellent and that's not a huge endorsement.And with Ron DeSantis, though, one of the things that's been interesting about voters is how they've decided that he went from somebody that they thought was a really great governor and they were really interested to see that they're just like, you know, he's not ready for prime time yet. Like, their estimation of him has really dropped. I hear that all the time about DeSantis. He should have waited. It's not his time. And so, I think, you know, when you have that debate, that you guys had, I was thinking about how all these two candidates are doing are driving up each other's negatives with these voters, right? They're just making voters sort of like them less. And the only person that that helps is Donald Trump. And that's basically the whole story of this primary.

And what he's doing that is so pernicious is building a permission structure for other moderate sort of normie GOP voters who don't really love Trump but don't consider themselves Democrats to go ahead and vote for Trump again despite the fact that it would be radically extraordinary for America to decide that a person who didn't engage in the peaceful transfer of power is our affirmative choice to lead the country again.
