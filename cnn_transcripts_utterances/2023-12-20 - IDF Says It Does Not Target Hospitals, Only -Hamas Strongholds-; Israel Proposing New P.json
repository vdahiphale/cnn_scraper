The director general of theHamas-run health ministry says at least 48 people were killed and more than 100 others wounded in Israeli attacks around the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. He says dozens more people remain trapped under the rubble. CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. Getting the injured in hospitals is difficult, if not impossible. The Palestinian health minister reports another hospital has ceased operations and fewer than a third of the enclave's hospitals are even partially functioning. Several people are reportedly killed in a series of explosions close to a hospital in southern Gaza. Israel's military maintains Hamas is using hospitals as staging bases for its militants. Hamas says that's not true. Israel's security agency released a video showing the interrogation of the director at a Gaza hospital. He says Hamas leadership used the facility in the early days of the war, because they believed they would not be targeted there. It is unclear if the director was speaking under duress. A UNICEF spokesperson voiced outrage at the conditions in Gaza's hospitals. James Elder says hospitals cannot serve as shelters for children and families. And so-called safe zones, become in his words, the zones of disease. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that was shelled twice, in 48 hours over the weekend.

And she had had to have her leg amputated after her house was attacked. She lost both her parents, two of her brothers and, then on Sunday, shortly after talking to us, she lost her life.

And we're talking less than two. So that's for everything. That is barely a drop to drink, when you factor in everything else. Not only that but a lot of the water in Gaza at the moment is salty or polluted. So it really presents a risk to children's health, because sanitation is also not up to scratch. There's one toilet for hundreds of people. And after the rains that we had a couple of weeks ago, that really exacerbated the situation.

They're also themselves dealing with their own challenges. Many of them are Palestinians and are dealing themselves with lost family members or sick family members. I spoke to a colleague who hasn't had water to drink in more than 24 hours and has a sick child that they're very worried about. One of my colleagues spoke to a 13-year-old girl called Raja (ph), who was saying how cold and wet she was, sleeping outside on the streets. And every time she heard thunder, she was afraid that it was a bombardment. So the impact on children is, from the air raids, it's from the potential diseases that are coming out at us thick and fast and the hunger that is just around the corner as well. So many children in Gaza are really, really hungry at the moment. So these are the stories that we're hearing from the ground and UNICEF is there, trying to do everything that it can, not only to get aid in -- and it's really only been a trickle but it's starting to pick up a little bit more now. But also to then distribute that aid; it's not safe for the children of Gaza and it hasn't been safe for us, which really presents a challenge in making sure that the aid reaches the children that it needs to, while the airstrikes are ongoing, which is why we need an intermediate and long lasting humanitarian cease-fire as soon as possible.",

      "sentences": "It's a very complicated process, because Hamas and Israel remain very far apart interms of what they need to get out of this deal. They both have leverage. The fact that Hamas is still holding well over 120 hostages and the vast majority of them believed to be alive, that has really stepped up pressure here in Tel Aviv, across Israel, for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the release as quickly as possible. Especially after the accidental shooting deaths of three Israeli hostages, by the Israel Defense Force over the weekend, families have been out pretty much every day protesting. And, of course, there's also the pressure not just domestically but internationally, for Israel to pause the fighting so that humanitarian supplies can come in, hostages can come out. But Hamas has said in the past that they're not going to give up these hostages without a permanent cease-fire, essentially an end to the war. And from the Israeli perspective, they're not finishing their job yet. They have not eliminated Hamas leadership, they have not prevented, to the fullest extent possible, this sort of attack, the attack that happened on October 7th, in which hundreds of unarmed Israelis were slaughtered. They have not been able to ensure that that kind of attack isn't going to happen again. Until they accomplish that objective, Israel says that war is not over. But what Israel can offer and what they have offered -- and that is being relayed to Hamas -- is, for starters, 40 Israeli hostages, prioritizing women, the elderly, and urgent care patients, would be handed over in exchange for a one-week pause in fighting. Israel is open, sources are saying, to extending that pause possibly longer, two weeks if more hostages are on the table with the ultimate goal from the Israeli side of getting all of those hostages returned. And the Palestinians, in addition to the humanitarian pause, of course, they want more than just a temporary pause. But they also want their own prisoners handed back by Israel. And not just teenagers and women, which was the vast majority of the handovers last time around. They want what's being described to us as heavy hitters, which could potentially mean men who are actually facing criminal charges here in Israel, as opposed to this large amount of people who are being held without charges at the moment. Possibly to be used as leverage, possibly on suspicion of a crime but not yet charged and not even aware of what charges or what they're being held for. So the two sides, both have something to gain by this moving forward. But it's not going to happen quickly. Again, that last hostage deal took more than a month to put together, which is dampening hopes of anything happening by Christmas or during the holiday week. But of course, there's always hope, Lynda. And certainly the humanitarian pause is desperately needed for the people of Gaza, who as you mentioned last hour, half of them, a full half, we're talking about 1 million people are starving right now. Just an unthinkable, an unthinkably horrible situation, especially during this time, which should be a celebratory time.",

What the Colorado supreme court ruled -- 4-3, so it was a very close ruling -- was that the evidence showed that Donald Trump did indeed participate in a insurrection and that he should be disqualified from the ballot, according to the provisions of the 14th Amendment. Now I should say that this is not a ruling that is obvious and it conflicts with what other state courts have said. So indeed the president's lawyers will be appealing to the Supreme Court. There are two ways; they're actually multiple grounds on which they would likely appeal. One just having to do with how the Colorado hearing unfolded, to say that it was set on a very fast track, this very weighty issue, and that there would be problems distinct to Colorado's process. But the other one, Lynda, is the very large question that is going to have to be resolved by the Supreme Court one way or another. Does this provision of the 14th Amendment cover Donald Trump? Does it even cover a president? And should he have to be proved guilty of insurrection in some other proceeding, a criminal proceeding? Or can it be done through the state court? So those are massive questions to be decided, that will ultimately come down to, will his name be on the ballot? This comes at the same time that the U.S. Supreme Court is also considering another fundamental question involving Donald Trump. Should he be immune from criminal prosecution? That's underway right now by special counsel Jack Smith, regarding election subversion. Those charges are also being brought against him. So here we are, just on the eve of 2024 and the calendar year for the presidential election that, the Supreme Court is going to decide key constitutional questions that will have a very real effect on what names are on the ballot and the fate of Donald Trump and who would be America's next president.",

But that, your question goes to why the Supreme Court really needs to settle it once and for all, what the 14th Amendment bars and whether Donald Trump is covered by it. Because if they look at just what happened in Colorado, you're exactly right. Say the Colorado situation is reversed. Or even if it is upheld, that would only affect the names on the ballot in Colorado. So the Supreme Court is really going to have to issue a ruling that can guide the rest of America about just what it takes, what needs to be shown, for the candidate's name to be removed from the ballot, especially, as you and your viewers know well, someone who is destined to be the Republican nominee and who is polling very strong.",

Causing a dramatic impact to international shipping and international commerce because of the impact that these attacks have had on these vessels operating there. Many companies have said that they are actually pausing their operations in the Red Sea because of the threat of coming under fire by these Houthi militants. So the U.S. and its allies now trying to find a way to respond that does not involve striking the Houthis directly, in Yemen, something that the U.S. has been trying to avoid over the last several weeks. And as a response to the attacks to date, the U.S. now says that they are going to be setting up an international coalition of maritime forces that will essentially be in the region and in the Red Sea, available to respond and help commercial vessels if they need it. Some of the vessels -- or some of the ships, I should say -- they will be escorting these commercial vessels if the situation warrants it. And, of course, we have also seen the U.S. shoot missiles and missiles into the Houthi region, down a number of the missiles and drones that the Houthis have launched targeting these commercial ships in recent weeks. But it remains unclear whether the Houthis are going to be deterred by this new maritime coalition. They have said that they are going to continue their attacks on these commercial vessels in solidarity, they say, with the Palestinians and in opposition to the Israelis. However, it's important to note that many of these ships that they have attacked, if not most of them, actually have no ties to Israel at all. And the U.S. says that the Houthis have just been attacking these ships opportunistically and they have been taking advantage, of course, of the U.S. and allied presence in the area. They want to try to bolster their international reputation and presence there and they think they will be able to get attention by continuing to target these vessels. So the U.S. facing a very big problem here, growing calls for them to strike the Houthis directly.

More than 3,000 people were ordered to evacuate the small coastal town last month when authorities anticipated the current eruption. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is on the ground, near Grindavik, and sent us this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The arctic night illuminated, as the Earth breaks apart from the fissure bursts its molten core. Weeks of earthquakes led to this display of our planet's fire and force.",

Because officially there is still more than a dozen people missing. But the fact that the official casualty figures, including the death toll, have only been revised up slightly from Tuesday to Wednesday is perhaps a reflection of the remoteness of the quake zone, sparsely populated and mostly rural and often mountainous. Even though the epicenter was only some 100 kilometers away from the provincial capital city of Gansu, the authorities say the focus is now shifting to post disaster relief, including treating the injured. Nearly 1,000 people did get injured in this quake but also resettling the tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate from their homes and farms after those structures were either destroyed or severely damaged. That is no easy task during the best of times in the very harsh, wintry conditions, with temperatures reaching as low as -20 degrees Celsius overnight, hampering this effort as well. And it may take some convincing for some of the people to get resettled since many of them are very poor farmers, telling state media they're not only concerned about their safety but also their livelihood, including the fate of their crops and livestock. Overall, the authorities say they have restored electricity and communication signals as well as road access to most parts of this quake zone, hit by that very powerful tremor late Monday night -- Steven Jiang, CNN, Beijing.
