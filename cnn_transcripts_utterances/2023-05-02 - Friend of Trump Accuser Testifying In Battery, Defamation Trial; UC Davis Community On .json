Under testimony and direct examination, Birnbach did just that.She said she recalled getting the call from Carroll within five to seven minutes after Carroll left the Bergdorf Department Store. She recalled it was around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. in 1996, because she was feeding her small children dinner in the kitchen. She said Carroll called her and recounted everything that happened, the same allegations Carroll testified to in the case. One of the things she said she remembered is that Carroll was breathless, hyperventilating, emotional. Her voice was all kinds of things. She said it sounded like she had a surge of adrenaline. She said, after Carroll described the alleged rape, that Birnbach stepped out of the kitchen where her kids were at, she whispered, \"You were raped, you need to go to the police.\" She said Carroll told her, no, no, no. It was a fight and they promised to never speak of it again. And then they also called, after Birnbach's testimony, Jessica Leeds. She is a woman who said she was sitting in first class, next to Donald Trump, who introduced himself to her. They shook hands. She said that, seemingly out of nowhere, he started groping at her. She said it was like he had 40 zillion hands. Then when his hand went up her skirt, she testified, that's when she got out of her seat and bolted to the coach section of the plane. Now on cross-examination, Trump's attorneys were really pressing Birnbach's many, many negative public statements around Trump, suggesting that she just hated him and this was all political. And for Leeds, you know, they are going to get into cross-examination just after the lunch break -- Jim?",

Walter, great to see you. Thanks for coming to the table here. In a written statement before today's hearing, a conservative former appeals court judge told the committee that changes have to be made. I want to read what he said. He said, \"The court should enact a code of conduct that would,\" quote, \"subject itself to the highest professional and ethical standards that would render the court beyond reproach.\" It's worth reminding everyone, they don't currently have an ethics code. Do you think we can rely on the court to do this? WALTER SHAUB, SENIOR ETHICS FELLOW, PROJECT ON GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT &amp; FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS: Justice Roberts indicated he doesn't want to do that, but I do think, if they set one up, we could count on them. Some people have talked about that there should not be a code of ethics because it would not necessarily be enforceable. But I think having a yardstick against which to measure the conduct of the justices would be a very useful tool for the public. And I think it would create a pressure on the justices to comply or at least be transparent about their noncompliance.",
