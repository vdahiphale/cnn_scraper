I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta alongside my colleague, Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv.We will get to you in a moment, Jim, but first right now, Vice President Kamala Harris is on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania. The democratic presidential nominee is taking a bus tour in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania there. They are in the western part of the state, and this really is the first time these candidates, Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz and their spouses are appearing to gather on this bus tour here in Pennsylvania. She by the way, is riding a wave of momentum. New national polls out today shows Harris taking the lead over Republican, Donald Trump for the very first time since she announced her candidacy just a month ago. Tonight, Harris will be heading to Chicago, where the Democratic National Convention begins tomorrow. It will feature four nights of primetime programs to energize the Democratic base ahead of November's pivotal election. But before the party starts, Harris is taking time to visit with voters face-to-face in Western Pennsylvania and CNN's Eva McKend is there in Pittsburgh with more.",

Just a few dozen people lined up in this airport hangar and then she has four stops today across Western Pennsylvania including here in Pittsburgh and in Rochester as well.And so think retail shops, phone bankers, canvassers those are the people that she wants to connect with in a more intimate setting. I caught up with a canvas are out on the doors yesterday here in Pittsburgh and she told me she was reach Republican and Independent voters and she was encouraged by what she was hearing. Those voters telling her that they expressed some openness to supporting the vice president. Meanwhile, this all comes as Harris is narrowly beating the former president in at least one poll, and in the margin of error in several others -- Fred.",

It was intended to be all about Joe Biden, really a final mark of his long life in public service.He didn't have a convention four years ago, of course, that was cut short by the pandemic, but this convention will also be he cut short by the political reality of the circumstances. He will be here tomorrow night. There is no doubt that Democrats are going to give him a warm welcome, a hero's welcome, most likely. And then he is going to essentially pass the torch to his vice president. We are going to see a literal changing of the guard right here at the United Center in Chicago. Vice President Harris, I am told, made it her intention to be at the convention, inside this convention hall to watch President Biden's speech. Of course, he has endorsed her and that changed everything just a month ago in this party. That endorsement really set things into motion for where they are now, and this is a united party, this is an excited party to get behind Vice President Harris. We are going to see speeches from a couple of former presidents, Barak Obama and Bill Clinton, Secretary Hillary Clinton will also be speaking on Monday. Doug Emhoff of course, the Second Gentleman who could be the First Gentleman if Democrats win in November, he will also be speaking as well as several other people. We are also learning that Michelle Obama will be speaking on Tuesday night right here in her hometown of Chicago. So certainly much excitement from Democrats. [15:05:01] Fred, there is no doubt that there is a unified sense of purpose in this party, but it is also clear when you talk to people, sort of aside from the celebrations that they know that this is still a tough fight ahead for some 75 days or so. Essentially, this race has been reset, but that does not mean that Vice President Harris and Tim Walz are really leading in any strong way. This is going to be a fight to the finish as they know, but this week is all about defining Vice President Harris really introducing her to the country in ways that they have not seen until now.",

Thank you so much for hanging in there.All right, for more now, on the campaign trail, let's bring in Craig Gilbert. He is a retired Washington bureau chief for \"The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\" Craig, great to see you. So this is interesting. Vice President Harris will be taking time away from the DNC. Yes, she will be there tomorrow in Chicago, but then on Tuesday, she will head to Milwaukee for an event. So what does that tell you about her campaign? The flexibility of her campaign, why it is important to do that while in the region and then heading back to Chicago? CRAIG GILBERT, RETIRED WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF FOR \"THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL\": Yes, I mean, it makes perfect political sense. I mean, you're having, your convention in a safe blue state, but 60 miles to the north, you have the tipping point state in the last two elections, Wisconsin and another 30 miles further north, you have the city of Milwaukee, where Republicans just had their convention. So it is an opportunistic move. It is a clever move, it is a little in-your-face and also, I think the timing. I mean, you're taking advantage in a battleground state of this surge in Democratic enthusiasm that Jeff alluded to. We've been tracking that for some time and Democrats were suffering from an historic enthusiasm deficit that is no longer the case.",

It says: \"After listening to the mediators about the recent round of talks in Doha (the talks in Qatar), it became clear to us once again that Netanyahu (that is the Israeli prime minister) continues to place obstacles to reaching an agreement, sets new conditions and demands in order to thwart the efforts of the mediators and prolong the war.\" It is notable, Hamas gives this read of the talks and releases a statement just as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken has arrived in Israel in his latest instance of shuttle diplomacy to get a deal across the finish line. With me here is CNN diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, also CNN State Department reporter, Jenny Hansler, who is traveling with Secretary Blinken. I want to begin with you, Nic because we were discussing just last hour about how Israeli officials have been using the phrase \"cautious optimism\" about these talks. President Biden said a couple of days ago that he thought we were closer to a deal than we'd been at any time prior. Hamas is throwing cold water it seems on those appraisals.",

So I think we are really getting a sense of the backwards and forwards nature of this.

So that's a net -- that's a clear game.But you're right about the number of soldiers. Both sides, both the Russians and Ukrainians have a constraint on the number of soldiers that they've got right now under arms both are trying to train more. Both know that they've got trouble on enlisting new soldiers. And so yes, in order to defend themselves, the Russians are having to pull troops out of the line, but also trying to throw recruits, brand new recruits, conscripts that were not supposed to be in war, not supposed to be in combat and they are throwing them in the line trying to defend their own territory.",

Now the complaint, which was filed this month with the DeKalb County state court says doctors removed a part of Cluster's school, measuring around 4.7 to six inches to reduce pressure on the brain. After he healed from that surgery, he was scheduled to have the bone flap reimplanted. As he was being prepped for surgery, Emory's staff couldn't identify the bone flap belonging to Cluster according to the complaint. One of the reasons includes several bone flaps having incomplete or missing patient identification. Cluster's attorney tells WXIA, they are suing the hospital for negligence claiming the loss of the bone flap resulted in extensive damages, as well as physical and emotional pain and suffering.
