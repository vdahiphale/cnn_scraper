And days before Thanksgiving, workers at Charlotte's airport are on strike, how it could affect Travelers during this busy week in the skies. Good morning. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. You are live in the CNN Newsroom But we begin this hour with President-elect Donald Trump spending his Thanksgiving week at Mar-a-Lago, fresh off finalizing all of his cabinet picks. The next test ahead, the confirmation battles, and those could be uphill battles for at least two of them, Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense and Tulsi Gabbard as the director of National Intelligence. Gabbard is getting these kinds of reactions from senators. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL):  She is, in terms of the intelligence community, very unqualified. Plus, she is potentially compromised and could be and has -- is there questions about whether or not she is now a Russian asset? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  Well, we'll have lots of questions. She met with Bashar Assad. We'll want to know what the purpose was. There's comments that are floating out there, but we want to be able to know the rest of the story. SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK):  This isn't a new administration coming in. And so when people are criticizing his picks, the president has done this job before. He knows exactly what he needs.

I mean, in many ways, and I've been saying this for weeks, is that I think Gaetz was a sacrificial lamb. If they had gotten him through, great, but the reality is, Jim, we all know this, he could put anybody at the Department of Justice as long as that person does what he wants them to do, then he wins.",

Lawmakers are really just waking up to these nominees just be getting their own vetting processes. Also, these are phone calls, meetings, all things that lawmakers have to do as part of this process.And so we're still a long ways away from sort of those high-profile confirmation hearings that you get on Capitol Hill. And as we saw with Matt Gaetz, a lot can change in not a very long period of time. I was talking to some lawmakers and aides last week who do have some concerns about Pete Hegseth, and not just the issues related to that police report that came out last week, but also just questions about what he has said about the Pentagon, whether or not he's qualified to lead such a huge bureaucracy in Washington D.C. These are real issues. And these nominees have a process where they have to convince senators who do think pretty highly of their role in advice and consent, that they're up to the job.",

We've all worked in Washington a long time. FBI background checks are sort of, you know, pretty standard stuff, yes, around the doorway. Trump is at the moment just thumbing his nose at these.

They do have a vote. They want to see all the information. And you can bet with someone like Tulsi Gabbard, they want more additional information given some of her past comments and some for past actions. This is a really important post and they are talking about national security. And that is something that the Senate Intelligence Committee is a very bipartisan committee behind closed doors.",

Mark, you and I, Lauren, we all listened to what was happening out on the campaign trail before the election.

And that is another place where potentially you will have to set budget caps. But important to keep in mind, you do not have a filibuster-proof Senate.

And I don't think that's what the American people want. That will violate the rights, not just of those who may be undocumented and here for years paying taxes, but also potentially American citizens who are caught up in the process and ask for their paperwork.So, anything that needs to be done has to be done with respect for our Constitution and our values and the specifics of what has been proposed are deeply concerning.",

And that was one of the reasons for his popularity and why his successor won. We need to increase the minimum wage here. And I would work with Republicans. There were some Republicans who voted for it in the past to do that and to work with the Senate.And Sean O'Brien, the president of the Teamsters, he's played a role in trying to get Republicans to be for increased wages for basic things like the Pro Act. I actually think fairly highly in the context of the new labor secretary because she did vote for the Pro Act. And so my hope is that we can find progress on an agenda to increase the minimum wage, to have labor neutrality. Now, if they don't live up to that, then that's something that the Democrats can point out in 2026 or 2028.

I don't have access to many of those documents at this point. But if it does go forward, I will try to be ready by December 11th.

But, I mean, you obviously aren't doing this with every murder case that's come through L.A. over the last couple of decades.
