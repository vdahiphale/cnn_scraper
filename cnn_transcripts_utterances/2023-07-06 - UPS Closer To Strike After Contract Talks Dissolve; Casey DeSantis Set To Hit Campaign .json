A strike could have major economic consequences since about six percent of GDP moves on UPS trucks.Here's the Teamsters president before talks broke down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN O'BRIEN, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS: Concede to our demands and give us what we deserve and we will go out there and ratify this agreement, or they can take the other road where they don't concede to our demands.

We were focused on the part-time portion of the UPS workers who work -- you know,  their part-time poverty doesn't work for us in the Teamsters anymore.

There's no doubt that the UPS full-timers make good wages, good benefits. But what people don't know -- in the neighborhoods, they see their UPS driver and they love them -- love him or her and they're happy, but they don't see the unsung heroes -- the single mothers that go to work at four in the morning. Those trucks don't go out unless they are loaded. And our part-timers are the unsung heroes. They are working for poverty wages and we need to drive up the starting rates of pay and reward those people that made the supply chain solution happen during the pandemic.

So people who are at home hearing that UPS might be -- the workers might be going on strike and they're already at the top of the heap starting for this, they question why. You tell those folks who are going to be inconvenienced what? O'BRIEN:  Well look, I'd tell them this, simply. UPS didn't give $93,000 a year out of the kindness of their heart. We've been fighting for decades and decades. We didn't -- we didn't get anything from UPS. We had to fight for it. UPS drivers and pre-loaders and all part-timers provide a tremendous amount of service. UPS is making record profits -- $100 billion. They doubled their profits.
