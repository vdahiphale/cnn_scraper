They likely have the votes. What they don't have is an agreement to move quickly. And that is because, like you noted, Mike lee, a Republican from Utah, has been insisting on an amendment to extend Title 42. Normally, they would have this vote. It would be no big deal. But he wants this vote to happen at a 51-vote threshold. And the reason that matters is there are a few moderate Democrats who might support his amendment. Adding it to the bill in the 11th hour would cause major headaches over in the House of Representatives, where Pelosi just has a two-vote margin in her Democratic caucus. So they cannot add it to the bill. And what Schumer and Thune were talking about last night when they were sort of striking this tone of optimism, is that what they're hoping they can put together is an amendment that Democrats will author that will give their moderates an opportunity to support something to extend Title 42, make it clear on the record that they want to do that, but would not put it in a position where they would have to vote for the Lee amendment, and then that amendment would get added.
