      "sentences": "Today, a troubling new admission surrounding Tyre Nichols' death. According to internal Memphis police documents, Demetrius Haley, one of the five former officers who were charged with murder, admits to taking pictures of Nichols after that deadly beating and texting one of them to several people.Now, surveillance video did capture that moment. And there's a warning here for you watching at home that we're about to show you something that may be difficult to watch. Here is Nichols already handcuffed, propped up, bloodied and appearing to lose consciousness, when Haley grabs his phone and snaps a photo. Now according to a police document, Haley sent the memo to five people, including one civilian employee and two P.D. Officers and one female acquaintance. With us now to discuss all of this is Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey, retired Los Angeles police sergeant. Sergeant Dorsey, hearing that and seeing that video, what goes through your mind to just hear also that Haley admitted that he did this?",

And now I'm going to say, you know, particularly before you unleash, in this case, unsupervised, ill-trained miscreants onto an unsuspecting community, you're going to put them on a specialized unit where they're out there hunting elephants, then you need to make sure they have the right skill set and temperament. And when they get out of that unit, they need to be psychologically evaluated again. Because let's face it, officers in patrol see gnarly stuff and it can get you twisted if you're not careful.",

What the president talked about last night was banning certain activities by federal officers. He said that, \"federal officers,\" for a reason. Federal officers did not shoot Breonna Taylor. Federal officers did not murder Tyre Nichols. Federal officers didn't sit on the neck of George Floyd. Nor did federal officers choke Eric Garner. And so, the problem is local. And it needs to be addressed with mayors who have police chiefs who are looking the other way. Those chiefs serve at the pleasure of those mayors. And that's where change is going to come. Not federally. I don't say no to whatever the president might want to do, but the George Floyd Justice and Reform Act, in many cases, does a disservice to the man's legacy. It would change nothing.",

And lawyers representing the family of Gabby Petito have released a selfie photo found on her cell phone after she was murdered by her fiance. It shows her face bloodied and scratched on the very same day police stopped her and Brian Laundrie to investigate a domestic disturbance call. Her family's lawsuit accuses the officers of ignoring how serious that assault was and not providing the protection that ultimately could have saved her life. CNN's Jean Casarez joins us with more. Jean, how significant do you think this photo is for the purposes of this lawsuit?",

      "sentences": "Well, we've never seen it before, Abby. This is the first time. The allegation was made in the wrongful death complaint with the Moab City Police Department and Moab city itself. But we've never seen the photo until now.I spoke to the attorney, Brian Stewart, one of the several representing the Petito family. Her phone was never recovered. And yes, she originally took this photo, they believe, on the day prior to that Moab stop with her phone. But it was recovered from the Cloud because they don't have that phone and they believe Brian Laundrie threw it away at some point in time. Now Brian Stewart tells me that their experts have looked closely at the photo. What that they're assessing is, first of all, there was a scratch, a gash on her face made by Brian Laundrie and that it was bloody. And they believe his hands grabbed her in the face area quite a few times, enough times that his fingers got blood on them because they say it smeared blood on the forehead, on the eye, to the side of the eye and to the side of the mouth. Now, in the wrongful death lawsuit, here's what they say, quote: \"At some point prior to their interaction with Moab police officers, Brian grabbed Gabby by the face so forcefully that he cut her cheek and drew blood. Gabby took a photograph of her injury, which shows blood across her nose and her left eye.\" And in that body cam video that we have all watched over and over again -- it goes for an hour and a half -- they talk to Gabby. You never see a close-up of her face, though. The allegation is that officers saw these injuries. They asked her about them. They never questioned Brian about them. They seem to take more of an interest, if you watch that tape, on injuries that Brian had. And they ultimately determined that Gabby was the aggressor in this whole situation. And they almost arrested her. They told Brian there would be a no-contact order. But he could go to the police department the next day, the prosecutor's office, and undo that very easily, so they didn't do that. We're waiting to see what the defendants in this wrongful death case, the Moab City Police Department and other officials, how they respond to all of this. They have not yet filed an answer to the wrongful death complaint -- Abby?",

Normally, how you would take a regular medication, except there's no drug in this.It's swallowed, it passes through the intestinal tract. When it reaches the large intestine, it vibrates, very small vibrations that trigger the mechanosensory cells in the large intestine. And it increases peristalsis or contraction of the large bowel, which can help the 10% to 20% potentially of Americans who suffer from chronic constipation. This is approved for people who have failed traditional over-the- counter prescription constipation medication or have side effects from it. There are two groups that shouldn't take something like this. Those that have gastro paralysis with the ability of the stomach to work properly or individuals who have history of bowel obstruction. It's interesting and exciting and something very different. It's made of the same material we use in the capsules with cameras that gastroenterologists sometimes use to look at the intestines. Unfortunately, it's not covered by insurance yet but the company that makes it is giving a coupon so that the out-of-pocket cost now is limited to about $69 for a month.",
