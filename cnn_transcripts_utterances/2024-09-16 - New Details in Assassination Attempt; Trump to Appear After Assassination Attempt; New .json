And that he has been a bit critical of the former president's. In some of some of social media posts, as you also noted, he has some strong opinions about supporting the war in Ukraine. In fact, we know that he traveled to the Ukrainian capital back in 2022. And that according to Ukraine's foreign legion, he reached out to them about volunteering in the work effort - or the war effort out there rather. We know that he also was arrested back in 2002 for barricading himself inside of a building with a weapon in North Carolina.Now, yesterday, CNN was able to speak with Routh's son, Orin (ph), who described his father as a loving and caring father. An honest, hardworking man. He went on to say that he is a good father and a great man. Of course, there are plenty of unanswered questions this morning, including just how this 58-year-old was able to get within 400 to 500 yards of the former president as he was out here golfing. We know that his trip to this golf course was a last-minute decision. It was not on his public schedule. And so it is still unclear just how Routh knew that the former president would be here. Here now is the sheriff yesterday talking about some of the security measures that were in place at this golf course when the former president took to the course out here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And at this level that he is at right now, he's not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. But because he's not, the security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible. So, I would imagine that the next time he comes to a golf course, there will probably be a little more people around the perimeter. But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done.(END VIDEO CLIP) SUAREZ: All right, so the director of the Secret Service is expected here in Florida today. He is going to meet with law enforcement officials and investigators here on the ground. And, Sara, we expect the director to also meet with the former president. And we expect to get details from both of these meetings throughout the day. Sara.",

I am very proud to be an American.\"We also recently just heard from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recalled his conversation with the former president shortly after the Secret Service responded. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): He was in very good spirits, as you might expect. That's who he is. He's so resilient. And we were really grateful to see him. There's no leader in the history of America that has been so attacked and has remained so strong and so resilient. He's one of a kind. He is not going to stop fighting for the American people. And it was really encouraging for us to sit and visit with him right after that happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) CONTORNO: As you said, Kate, the former president is expected to make an appearance today, at least virtually. He is launching a new cryptocurrency venture with his family.

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, so we're building up a picture of someone who is - has displayed not only a keen interest, but really I think bordering on obsession with supporting Ukraine. He seems, according to a book that he self-published and various media interviews, he seems to have traveled to Ukraine in the early months of the war. Initially it seems to volunteer, but that didn't work out. He was told, according to his own book, that he was too old and didn't have any military experience.So, after that, he turned his attention its recruiting, it seems, foreign soldiers. That also didn't really go to plan. He was picked up on a clip from AFP in around April of 2022 where he appears to have set up a military office in central Kyiv, but police apparently dispersed that. And then he targeted Afghan soldiers who were fleeing the Taliban. That also didn't come to anything. At one point he apparently, according to his book, tried to build drones for Ukraine's army using a sort of group of foreign engineers, but that didn't come to anything either. And look, I think the question is, obviously, how do you get from this interest in Ukraine and these efforts to help Ukraine to being a suspect in a potential assassination of a presidential candidate. But there's a clip that he - from an interview that he gave to \"Newsweek Romania\" where we get a sense of how he seemed to transfer those frustrations. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was very driven to help Ukraine, even though some of his ideas were completely nonsensical. I mean, he kind of spoke with the self-assuredness that he was going to get from A to B and nothing was going to get in the way, even though his plans were already running into major obstacles. And, you know, I talked to Najim last night who talked to that Afghan in Iran who had spoken to Mr. Routh a few days before his arrest yesterday. And I guess he was financially despondent, had around $60 in his bank account and was living out of the back of his car. So it kind of seemed like the end of his grand plans for Ukraine.",

I think, you know, the most Najim found out last night is that he very much stayed in touch with the Afghans he was trying to help. He seemed very invested in their success or survival. I think he was sending money to them.

The majority, the clear majority chance of winning the Electoral College. If she only wins by less than two, look at that, only a 23 percent chance of winning.Right now, Harris is right now in that danger zone where basically about half the time, given that popular vote margin nationally, she would win. And so here's the situation. Chance Harris wins the popular vote at this point, is about 70 percent. But the chance she wins the Electoral College is only about 50 percent. So, the bottom line is, at this hour, John, there's about a 20 percent chance that Kamala Harris wins the popular vote but actually loses in the Electoral College. So, we could be heading towards one of these splits that we saw in 2016 and in 2000, whereby one candidate, Kamala Harris, wins in the popular vote but loses in the Electoral College. Basically, at this hour, we're right in that sort of weird middle zone where we honestly don't know what's going to happen based upon the popular vote.
