      "sentences": "No, not quite yet, but President Biden is expected to head down to South Carolina today, really to give this speech that's an extension of the arguments he laid out on Friday when he warned that democracy is under threat. Political violence needs to be condemned in this country, and really issued his most forceful condemnation of former president Donald Trump yet this campaign cycle.But the fact that Biden is traveling to Mother Emanuel AME Church to deliver this speech is important. The campaign says that the president plans to remind voters that the hate that occurred on that day at Mother Emanuel Church when nine black worshippers were gunned down, that that hate still exists in the country and it's incumbent on political leaders to condemn and try to root out hate, violence, and extremism in this country. But the fact -- the campaign really believes that these arguments about democracy and pushing back on political violence are something that will resonate with voters heading into November. One point that they're stressing today and highlighting is the fact that they raised more than $1 million in the 24 hours since that speech at Valley Forge. That's according to a campaign official trying to highlight some of the momentum they have around these issues. But another reason why this trip down to South Carolina is important is because who Biden will be speaking to there. Black voters were a critical part of the president's coalition, and they will need that turnout to also be up in this 2024 election. If you take a look at polling, there's about a 62 percent approval rating among black voters. That is slightly higher than the general voting electorate in their approval ratings of President Biden. But then there are signs of narrowing in his support. The exit polls from 2020 found that Biden won black voters by 87 percent, but then if you look at that Quinnipiac poll, he is now with about 80 percent of support from black voters and 17 percent support for former President Trump. Now, one of the president's campaign co-chairs Jim Clyburn said that he's expressed some concerns to the president directly, saying that so far they have been unable to break through the MAGA wall. But this South Carolina primary will be a key test of whether Joe Biden can turn out and test his enthusiasm among black voters heading into the 2024 election.",

In talking to senior Biden campaign officials, guys, they believe -- they're targeted universes of voters. So folks that dropped off after 2020, totally disengaged from the political process that may be natural pieces of their base, young voters, voters of color, need an awakening to remind them that this is political season, and that as the Biden team sees it, this threat is very real not just to democracy as a theory, but to what democracy protects, your freedom to vote, your freedom for choice, all those things. That's the argument.The other universe of voters are the more traditional, persuadable swing voters. And in both of these groups, the Biden team believes people are not of the mind that Donald Trump is actually back on the political scene in a real way. They don't really believe he's going to be the nominee despite all of us covering this day in and day out knowing he is very much the likely Republican nominee. So part of what Friday was not just setting the stakes and the message, but also sort of grabbing the country by the lapels and saying, it's 2024. It is happening now, and it's time to get engaged.

So it is exactly this kind of rhetoric that the Biden team believes is their best shot at highlighting so that those folks in the middle don't swing back to Donald Trump's direction the way they were in 2016.",

And what I think is, he knows he made a mistake, he admitted that, but at the same time, Phil, one of the things that's important in the Department of Defense, and in the US medical system, is the privacy, it is a balancing for telling the public what's going on with you. Now, it's one thing to tell your boss and he admitted that he was mistaken in not doing that, but he also reminded people, hey, this is my procedure.
