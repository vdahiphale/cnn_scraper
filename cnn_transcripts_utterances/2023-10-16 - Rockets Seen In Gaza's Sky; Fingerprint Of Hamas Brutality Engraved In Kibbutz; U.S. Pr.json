      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper.This hour Israel's leaders are preparing for the next stage of their war against Hamas. They say it's a likely ground invasion of Gaza. And while Israel's military has not officially announced that its soldiers will invade Gaza, three senior Israeli military officials have told the New York Times that the goal will be to wipe out Hamas' top military and political hierarchy and capture Gaza City. An incredibly risky ground invasion will likely feature bloody street- by-street urban combat, made much more difficult by Hamas's underground, miles-long network of deep tunnels. Still, thousands of Israeli troops are preparing near Israel's border with Gaza. Once and if the Israeli military moves in, the United Nations warns further conflict could spiral into a quote, \"abyss in the Middle East\" as that conflict spills over borders. A fear echoed today by Iran's foreign minister who says regional war could soon be, quote, \"unavoidable.\" To Gaza's north, Israel's military is exchanging fire with the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which the U.S. considers to be a terrorist group. There, Israel has ordered the evacuation of 28 villages and Hezbollah, like Hamas, is backed by the Iranian government. And it may quote, \"respond to an invasion of Gaza by opening up a second front with Israel along the Lebanese border,\" according to the New York Times. To the south, Egypt's border with Gaza, the Rafah crossing is the only way for civilians to get out of Gaza, but that has been sealed off since Hamas' brutal terrorist attract on -- attack on Israel two Saturdays ago. Egyptian officials say it is Israel's fault that the crossing is closed, since Israel's government has not agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza or free-flowing aid. Egypt's conditions to open the Rafah crossing. In addition, Israel has not fixed the extensive damage caused by one of its airstrikes near the gate, according to the Palestinian officials there. As the humanitarian crisis in southern Gaza becomes more dire by the hour, the United States and Israel blame the bottleneck at the Rafah crossing on Hamas. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians listen to Israel's call over the weekend to immediately evacuate from the north likely a preparation for its grand offensive, as food, fuel, water, electricity, even body bags run in short supply, according to Palestinian officials and aid groups. While the suffering among Palestinians and Israelis is abundantly clear, what is unclear as of now is what the plan is by the Israeli government and the Israeli military if they do seize Gaza City and how the world will ultimately respond. Let's bring in CNN's Erin Burnett, who is live for us in Tel Aviv. Erin, we have seen rockets flying over Tel Aviv tonight. Does it feel as though the next phase of this war, this ground incursion, is about to start?",

Children's toys strewn about everywhere, bullet holes in almost every single home. You know, we'd see playing cards, kids' homework strewn everywhere. Al Qassam Brigade Arabic graffiti, victory is ours, Allahu Akbar on the side of houses, and also Jake still in active zone, right? They've still been clearing houses in Be'eri and others of Hamas fighters who had hidden. They're also, talking to soldiers today who've been accumulating some of the weapons, they're still finding Hamas fighters in, you know, convoys of jeeps that they had killed. Their body's now rotting. This smell is pervasive and the destruction of human life is completely pervasive, but it is sometimes the most simple things, the days of the week medicine that is completely melted from the fire in a house that stands out to you, that it is truly incomprehensible to walk through places like this. And honestly, in some senses, Jake, we feel like trespassers and we're trying to see it, understand it, document it, but the people who may know people in those homes or be related to them, they haven't been allowed back to even see their own family homes.

And when does that actually become an incursion?We've become used to all the missile strikes and artillery strikes on Gaza, and they are literally going on since your show came on the air. We've counted about half a dozen, and they keep coming. Some of the flashes behind me are big, and the explosion, we hear it very quickly, which probably just a mile or a couple of miles away. There are others where you see the flash, and it takes a lot longer, 20 seconds, to hear the explosion. And perhaps those are maybe Gaza City, about seven and a half, eight miles away, perhaps a little bit beyond there. But, you know, just a couple of minutes ago, we heard what sounded like an Apache gunship firing heavy machine gunfire along the -- along the fence line behind u, in the distance behind us. We haven't heard it like that before. We haven't heard that before. So, this is what I mean. It sort of gets hard to discern. There's a blur -- there's a blurring of the line. I guess the ultimate line, obviously, isn't it, is when the line is actually breached and crossed. And trying to get a sense of that, there's a greater sense of readiness. There's a very strong sense of willingness and desire to do it and the level of apprehension and a high degree of training. We've seen that over the past couple of days. But actually being able to say to you right now, do I think it's going to be tonight, do I think it's going to be tomorrow or the day after, it just can't tell. And maybe this confrontation with a massive slightly different because of the issue of that negotiations, that was another detonation explosion there, and because the issue of hostages potentially as well.",

JONATHAN CONRICUS, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES: You know, we're looking at the situation and assessing what Hamas tried to achieve by the brutal attack on October 7th, and we must assume that Hamas planned for this stage as well. And since that is the working assumption, then of course we have to draw the necessary conclusions and act accordingly when our troops are on the ground. We have to use all the tools that we have available and others in order to flush those terrorists out or kill them where they are.
