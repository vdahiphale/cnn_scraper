It gives Republicans a chance to talk about how they have a very different vision for what they want America to look like as we come upon the 2024 election year. So in terms of actually changing anything or really making a huge difference in what we expect to see, it doesn't really do that. What it did do, guys, is it allows for really stark contrast. As you've all been talking about this morning, as they talked about last night, between the president and his agenda, Democrats and their agenda. And Republicans, specifically House Republicans.
