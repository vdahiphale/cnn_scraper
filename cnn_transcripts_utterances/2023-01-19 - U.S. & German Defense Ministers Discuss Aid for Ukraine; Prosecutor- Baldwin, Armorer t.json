Coming up,I'll speak to a member of the European Parliament about voting to classify the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization an incredibly important story. First up, though, we have no time, and neither does the world. Those words from the Head of Ukraine's Presidential Office today, part of his country's latest urgent appeal for heavy weapons and its war with Russia. The subject was under discussion today during what was expected to be a crucial meeting between the U.S. and German Defense Ministers in Berlin. Germany still bulking at a U.S. request to send battle tanks to Ukraine, or at least approve the transfer of those tanks from other countries. We could learn more on Friday, when NATO's Ukraine defense contact group as its known, meets at a U.S. air base in Germany. Nic Robertson back with us this hour from London. So it's the only question in town at this point, will Ukraine get that military hardware that it wants? That it wants it says so urgently?",

Richard Quest was speaking while at Davos tothe Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte who said look, we just want to kind of work this out with a bit of consensus. It's no good one European country, one ally of Ukraine, sending tanks. We kind of want to do this together. We want to do it as an effort together. So I think that gives you the understanding of where the broad thinking is? Switch forward to tomorrow, where you have that group that can these Defense Ministers that can come to that consensus about it. Obviously, there's some concern that the United States is not putting its battle tanks here mono A1 Abraham tank, which by the way, you know, I've seen these things in the field. They're a massive, they're not, we're like, and they're not a petrol engine. Excuse me; well I just fix my microphone here. They're not a petrol engine device. They are run on a jet engine. They are complicated. They are big beasts. They take computers to set them up and run them in the field. And that does seem to be some of the trepidation from the U.S. perspective about putting their battle tanks into Ukraine. But the other tanks that are on the table, the German tanks that they have the leopard two that Poland has leopard two as well. Looking to Germany to authorize sending France is also looking at selling a virtual tank the UK has already committed its challenger two tanks. So it does seem to be you know, from the perspective that we've heard from Matt Rutte today this afternoon that this is coming together, but we won't know for sure until tomorrow.",

And now you're having this conversation with them on their terms, which is supposedly this is Russian territory, which is not internationally recognized. The other thing I think that the Russians are trying to do and I'm not sure that they're very successful in this. This is kind of to read the European audience to read Western audiences, and to say, well, you know, we will threaten, let's faces it. We will bring you into this kind of institution. So I think a lot of the time was that when western allies of Ukraine think that they are trying to create a consensus and they're trying to work together with the Russians is indecision. And then these critical points they're making these threats.

And so they find themselves in situations - they find themselves in a way, let's say for poorly prepared for this, because as this war goes on, the war that they really didn't want to happen and hope that wouldn't happen as the war goes along. They need to readjust the - disability, this policy that has been there for 70 years, and provided them a sense of security and stability in - of foreign policy in years and now they have to under fire to shift this policy. But this comes to an extremely important moment of hard times. And the point would, why the moment is so critical right now is that these tasks - German tanks and their approval to export them specifically from Poland, but also from other countries is pivotal, because there are many of them. And they are - they've been sold to many countries that are allies of Ukraine, and they can provide these tanks.

This is a march that will then go all the way to Nashville. It's been fairly slow, there have been scuffles long away, and there's been tear gas. What the trade unions are saying is that they reckon they're about 400,000 people in the streets of Paris today. Their aim is to get a million on the streets of France. And what we were hearing from the trade unionists in the run up to this march and demonstration and seriously strikes, Becky, is that their aim is to get to the levels of protests that we saw back in 2010. That's the last time that pension reform is achieved here in France, by Nicolas Sarkozy. There were nine months of strikes and protests culminating in a protest in the October of 2010 Becky that saw 3 million people takes to the streets. And it is a reminder of just what a sensitive nerve this question of pension reform is here in France. Because so many of the trade unions will explain to you it is part of the postwar social pact. It is something that is very dear to the French and the fingers here out here today and some of the scenes that we've been seeing speak to that.

I've advocated for years, really decades, transparency in the contracts that are let with governments of countries, they can't keep going into these contracts where there's non-disclosure clauses, there's collateral, because this makes it very difficult to restructure them. And the international architecture is very slow moving right now, most of the world is aligned with the idea of taking as much money from governments as possible.

And I think it's, it's nosurprise that these movements are happening at the same time that as Russia struggles with its war in Ukraine that the Iranian regime feels fear of actual democratic movement in Iran, both in terms of the movement within Iran, but also the movement of support from the rest of the world, putting political pressure and diplomatic pressure on Iran. This is why I think it's a good time to put this pressure on Iran right now, as they are weakened by the diplomatic weakening of Russia at this moment.",

And for those who live here, the seasonal deluge serves as a reminder of an ongoing water crisis. In fact, one innovative local school has made the stuff of life the center piece of its curriculum.",
