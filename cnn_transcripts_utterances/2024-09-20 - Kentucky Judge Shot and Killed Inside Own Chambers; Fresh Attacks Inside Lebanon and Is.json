And one thing, I think, to point out is that when I talked to some people close to the former president, I learned that some people in Donald Trump's inner orbit had actually been prepared for a very controversial and potentially damaging story about Robinson to drop this week. They had heard rumblings about this story.Now, one thing that, you know, we have to watch for, the timing of this is pretty remarkable is that Donald Trump is actually expected to do a rally tomorrow in North Carolina, in Wilmington, North Carolina. Now, when I talk to Trump's -- people close to the former president, they say that even before the story had dropped, they had not invited Robinson to attend that event. And now, they are expecting that decision to hold. And look, I mean, Robinson -- it's interesting in itself, because Donald Trump has praised Robinson in the past. You mentioned that he has endorsed him. He endorsed him earlier this year. He referred to him as Martin Luther King on steroids during that endorsement. And Robinson has been at most, if not all, of Donald Trump's recent events in North Carolina. Last month he brought him on stage to speak at his rally in Asheboro. He also recently spoke at Donald Trump's economic speech in North Carolina. So, it is interesting that he is not going to appear with him tomorrow. I think you can read between the lines there. But to take a step back, I think it's also worth noting that when I talk to Donald Trump's team and many people close to the former president, they have had long held concerns about Robinson and his gubernatorial candidacy. Now, this isn't the first time we have heard inflammatory things that Robinson has said in the past, he had mocked victims of school shootings, he had demeaned the civil rights movement. And really, when I talked to Donald Trump's allies, they said that they had been hoping that he would drop out because of these controversial comments. Now, I will say, when I talked to Donald Trump's campaign, they insist that there have been no efforts as of now to pressure Robinson to withdraw from the race. Again, they're hoping that might be a decision that he made himself. Of course, the deadline to do so for -- to drop out was yesterday. And so, there's a lot of things still percolating behind the scenes. Now, the one statement we did get on the record from the Trump campaign did not mention any of the specific details in this story. But they did point out that North Carolina is vital to Donald Trump winning in November. So, the stakes here aren't just about Robinson, who wasn't already doing so great in that gubernatorial race, but the stakes are very high for Donald Trump. They very much recognize that North Carolina is key to victory come November. So, I think there'll be a lot more on this.",

And look, I'm not sure we know for sure, but I do know that the Trump campaign, and timing is everything Shermichael, is releasing an ad this morning attacking Vice President Harris on the issue of transgender health care. Transgender, you say? Well, Mark Robinson apparently was cheering on transgender porn. KFile reporting on this message board, one of the things he wrote and, cover your ears, that's effing hot. It takes the man out while leaving the man in, Robinson wrote. And yes, I'm a perv too.

This guy is not going to win this race. I can just make that very clear now, he's just not going to win. He's been behind for, I think, several months now by pretty substantial margins. The state party there had an opportunity to go with Former Congressman Mark Walker. He's a pastor. This is someone who's a traditional conservative in the contextual sense. I think he's someone who probably would have won that seat, even if it would have been more competitive. Instead, they decided to go with this guy, and look at the results. This is someone that they clearly did no opposition research on. This is someone who certainly is a vulnerability and a liability, and in my personal opinion as a strategist, they need to kick him out. Forget the, well, let's just see what happens.
