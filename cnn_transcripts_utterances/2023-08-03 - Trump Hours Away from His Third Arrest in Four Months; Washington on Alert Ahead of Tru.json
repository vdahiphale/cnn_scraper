We expect his actual appearance in court to be pretty brief. We've now seen this a couple of times before. He'll be advised of his rights. He'll be advised of the charges against him. He may have an opportunity to enter a plea today, which, of course, we would expect him to plead not guilty. But we're going to be looking to see if Donald Trump does actually say anything in court, if he addresses the court at all. And we're also going to be looking for whether Special Counsel Jack Smith attends in person, as he did in Miami, when Donald Trump was charged in the classified documents case. Again, a lot of this we are not going to see in real-time, we are not going to see on camera. Cameras are not allowed in the federal court.

And I found myself actually agreeing with quite a bit of what Bill Barr said.However, if prosecutors are relying on Bill Barr as a witness, as some sort of divine messenger of truth on the issue of was there election fraud, they're going to have a big problem. Because, yes, Bill Barr, weeks after the election, December of 2020, did come forward publicly and say there's no evidence of fraud and he has said that consistently since. The problem is that for months leading up to the election, he was Donald Trump's biggest cheerleader when it came to the issue of fake allegations of election fraud. He went on NPR. He said there's massive risk of election fraud here. NPR had to run it back and say, we allowed the attorney general to tell a falsehood on our air. Bill Barr went in front of Congress in the summer of 2020, said, huge risk of fraud in voting, nothing we can do to police it. He was asked, do you have any proof of that? He said, no, but I just know it as commonsense. He came on our air on CNN in September of 2020, and Wolf Blitzer, rightly, knowing that Bill Barr was pushing the election fraud lie, asked him, how many cases has your DOJ actually prosecuted of election fraud? And Barr hemmed and hawed. And then Barr said, well, there's one case involving 1,700, 1,700 false ballots, which sounded remarkable until the next day when it came out that that case involved one ballot, one instance of election fraud. DOJ had to run a correction there. So, Bill Barr has changed his tune quite a bit. He is not going to be an effective witness for prosecutors on this issue. He's trying to whitewash history, but that won't wash in court. He was behind this. Why? He helped spread it during those key months leading up to the election.",

But I know that Donald Trump knew that he lost the election. And what this -- to Van's point, what this argument is going to rely on is despite the overwhelming evidence, demonstrable evidence that he lost and that every reasonable person around him knew he did, he still intellectually just didn't have the capacity to understand it. This is basically going to be that Donald Trump was too stupid to know he lost argument. I think he's going to hate it when his lawyers start having to make this case. And I would keep my eye on that because there's not going to be -- there might be some fanfare of re- litigating, like we want to go to these seven states and, for the 20th time, see if there was fraud and if those election results could have been different.

So, if Donald Trump actually makes that claim in court, all of his communications with all of his lawyers about anything become fair game for cross-examination. Donald Trump would almost certainly have to take the stand to make that defense. We can only imagine what a cross-examination of Donald Trump would look like. And it's not a free-for-all.
