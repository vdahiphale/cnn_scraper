Plus, the U.S. recognizes Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of the presidential election. I'll be joined by the former President of Colombia for his reaction to the election turmoil.

Israel won't confirm or deny responsibility for that assassination. But Haniyeh's death along with the Israeli killings of Hezbollah commander in Beirut, Hamas military chief in Gaza, and now a senior member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad are raising fears of an all-out regional war. Hezbollah's chief suggests a coordinated attack on Israel could be coming. And Iran's supreme leader says he considers that Iran's duty to avenge Haniyeh's death. The U.S. meanwhile says it is ready to move resources to the region to counter the threat. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We already saw the National Security Minister Ben-Gvir, who is very far right, and part of Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition come out and sort of celebrate this investigation.

We saw the Jerusalem municipality issue instructions to people to make sure that their shelter is ready to be used, telling them that they would have about 90 seconds to find somewhere to shelter if there was some kind of an attack. Also warning them that they would potentially be without power for several days. And in that vein, we have heard from one of the supermarket chains here that there's been a 30 percent uptick in sales. A lot of people buying toilet paper, buying canned goods, certainly last night, when we attended a rally for families of hostages inside Gaza and their supporters, there were quite a few people who mentioned to us that they had reservations about going out and joining the rally because of concerns that there is some kind of a large strike potentially imminent. Israeli forces say that they are ready to meet the moment as it were. We saw the Minister of Defense here Yoav Gallant who spoke with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin today for the third time this week.

There were also four spies, they're called illegals. They go to other countries to spy for Russia, posing often times as other nationals. And one of the most remarkable details that we've learned since this release is, we saw two of the spies who had been returned from Slovenia come off that plane, greeted there by Vladimir Putin, given flowers, they had children with them. And those children believed that they were Argentinean. They didn't even know there were Russian. This is according to the Kremlin, they only found out that they were Russian on that flight back to Russia. They didn't know who Vladimir Putin was. Putin, according to the Kremlin greeted them in Spanish because of course, they believed that, that was their native tongue. So often in these cases, when spies are undercover, their children have absolutely no idea until their parents are caught and then returned home.

And so, what's happening here in San Antonio, Texas, is that recovery. And it actually started moments after they landed here in San Antonio at about 3:11 a.m. this morning. We were there, our cameras were rolling. We witnessed as the freed Americans exited the plane with their family.

And do you also think the Secret Service is too reliant on state, local, and federal partners? I mean, you have almost 2,000 HSI agents helping in events coming this fall. That's a third of their workforce, and it takes a lot from state and locals as well. So first, would you bring back the PowerPoint? Do you think there should have been more planning?

But that goes back to my direction, that we have to be very specific about what we're communicating and what our expectations are moving forward. With respect to the reliance on state and local law enforcement, listen, there are 700,000 full-time law enforcement officers, over 700,000 full- time law enforcement officers in the United States. The majority of prosecutions in the criminal justice system in the United States are done by state and locals. That's a result of criminal investigations that they do every day in their communities to keep them safe. Over 135 officers died last year serving their communities, federal, state, and local. Forty-seven of them died by violent means, gunfire. There's not an over-reliance on them. They're out there every day securing their communities. They know the terrain. They know the people. More importantly, they know the local laws. If you're in a state where it's open carry, we're going to rely on them to enforce local laws. I, as a federal agent, cannot go out there and enforce the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I need those state and local law enforcement officers, so I would push back on that. With respect to leveraging other federal partners, when we were in the Department of Treasury and I was a brand-new agent, I would stand post during a campaign year with agents from ATF, IRS Criminal Investigations. You know, we were all one big, happy family. Customs. Customs moved over to DHS just like we did. So we do this every four years. We rely on those partners. We use them during national special security events like the Democratic National Convention, the United Nations General Assembly, the presidential inauguration. Those are whole-of-government security operations, which the Secret Service is the lead planning for, and we're going to bring in partners from across the government. I don't feel that it's an over-reliance. It's something that we have done going back to our days at Treasury, and we're going to continue to do that. We need those partners, and we need those state and local officers.",

      "sentences": "Listen, that's not for me to weigh in on, but what I will tell you is, you know, there's also a lot of discussion about why should the SecretService do criminal investigations. And what I will say is this. We were founded in 1865 as an investigative entity. It's in our DNA. I firmly believe that the best protection agents learn those skills being criminal investigators. You learn how to interact with people. You learn organizational skills. You learn to be analytical. Those are all traits that you need to have when you're on a detail. Moreover, if you look at where we are today, buildings, communities, everything is interconnected. And so we have a particular expertise in cyber and in cybercrime and critical systems protection. And so when you overlay that, that investigative skill set that we have, you know, it's more than just securing the President or our protectees in a brick and mortar setting. It's also protecting them from things that make them vulnerable due to cyber. And so the only way to learn that -- those skills to be able to detect, to be able to analyze, to be able to make sure that we are hardening not only cyber systems, but hardening a building that is fed by cyber systems. The only way to gain that experience, that knowledge, is to be able to do criminal investigations. Additionally, it is within our investigative authority to follow up on threats. People make threats to the President and the people we protect every day. We need to have that domestic and international network of field offices to be able to track down those threats. And if necessary, bring those people to justice and present them to a U.S. Attorney's Office. So this, you know, I know there's been a lot of talk. Should we or shouldn't we? Should we do this? Should we be in DHS? The bottom line is this. If you want the Secret Service to continue to be the Secret Service and be effective at what it does, it needs to be doing investigations and it probably needs to be in the Department of Homeland Security until Congress or others have an opportunity to weigh in.",
