It is 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi, I'm Eleni Giokos. This is \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next two hours, scenes of devastation in Rafah after an Israeli airstrike on a camp for displaced people, at least 45 people have been confirmed killed. Rescue efforts are underway in Papua New Guinea where more than 2000 people were buried alive in a deadly landslide. I'll be speaking to a U.N. mission official working on the ground. And storms tornadoes and floods are sweeping across the U.S. this hour. We'll get a live update from a town in Texas, hit hard over the weekend. Welcome to the show now Israel has struck a displacement camp where civilians were sheltering, killing at least 45 people in Rafah in Southern Gaza. That is according to the Gaza health ministry, we must warn you that you are about to see in this segment is going to be very difficult to watch. Well these are the scenes overnight of the camp in Rafah set ablaze, the Israeli military claim to CNN Hamas officials were killed in the strike with what they called precise munitions. Local officials say most of the casualties were women and children. Now you can see the location of the camp on this map. And it's a reminder that over a million people have been sheltering in Rafah as the war force people further south, though many have fled yet again, as Israel ramps up the operations in that area. The strike came just two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to hold its offensive in Rafah. On Sunday, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv, the first attack of its kind into Israel since January. We got CNN's Nada Bashir following developments for us. She is standing by in London. Nada, distressing video out of Rafah a lot of that video we actually cannot share because it is so disturbing. Help us understand the impact of the strike.",

And in fact, over the last month, we have been hearing warnings from the IDF telling civilians now to evacuate parts of Rafah to Gaza's coastal area for their safety and protection ahead of a looming full scale ground operation. This was not one of those areas. This was not an area that received an evacuation order. This was supposed to be a safe zone for civilians. Clearly, that is not the case. We've seen this incident overnight airstrikes targeting an area that is densely populated by civilians filled with tents, makeshift tents, sheltering civilians and we have seen graphic disturbing, horrifying video emerging from the scene last night. Tents completely engulfed in flames charred bodies being pulled from the burning, shelters, including the bodies of children. Now, as we've heard from the health authorities in Gaza, the majority of those casualties were women and children. More than 240 people have so far said to have been badly wounded and injured. We've heard from health authorities saying they simply do not have the capacity in the remaining hospitals in that Rafah area to care for that number of casualties. So this is an overall disastrous situation for many of those civilians in the Southern City of Rafah, huge amount of concern. Of course, we've been hearing widespread condemnation and warnings against further military action in Rafah. Clearly those warnings have not been heeded.",
