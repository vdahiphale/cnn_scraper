And I think what happened is that we you saw that teachers, not only in the hall, but in America, feel, you know, the stiff in their back and feel the respect that they deserve, you know, that they rarely get. And in these culture wars, I mean, what's the it's craziness to not let us meet the needs of kids. And to censor history and to ban books, and you don't know what you can teach and not to teach, so this sense of not only don't underestimate a teacher, but the role that teachers have in society and lifting them up so that they can lift kids up, that's what I think people felt.",

And it appears that Trump and his team really don't want to get ahead of anything that RFK is going to do.Here's what Trump said last night in an interview when asked about the state of play between him and RFK. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I have no idea if he's going to endorse me. I know he's got a news conference.

This is a full screen advertising the event that is here just outside of Phoenix where we are that has a shadowy figure and says that there's going to be surprise special guests and the campaign has been promoting this heavily. So, if it's not RFK, they are certainly trying to give the impression that it is.Now, I want to mention one thing here, because there are a lot of questions about RFK's controversial campaign, just some of the things that have happened since he has been running for office. He admitted that he had a parasitic brain worm that died in his brain and caused brain fog. He avoided questions in a Vanity Fair article. There were allegations over sexual assault from a former nanny. At one point, we learned that he actually placed a bear cub carcass in Central Park. But the question of whether or not he could move this race is still a very real one. And I want to tell you something about the state of Arizona right now. RFK is pulling at 6 percent. Donald Trump's team doesn't believe he's going to get a full 6 percent if he is endorsed by RFK, but what they do believe is that this election is going to be determined by razor thin margins, and any of that 6 percent that they could get could determine his fate, Donald Trump's fate, in a state like this.",

And how many times did they say independents, Democrats and Republicans trying to have a welcoming for those that are just not satisfied with the normal choices they have on the Republican side.I thought Kamala's speech last night hit the right tone in terms of her background, identifying with common Americans, and then also really separating herself, in some ways, from Joe Biden, policy-wise, cutting her own path. I was disappointed that she attacked Trump on Medicare. It's like she's going back to the normal Democratic scare tactics, and I don't think that is becoming inconsistent with this campaign.

It was not as much a pro-Kamala Harris speech as it was Donald Trump is too great a risk for our democracy. And he also pointed out very appropriately that which side you're on, we could be Americans that love our country and love veterans and want the best for our country.
