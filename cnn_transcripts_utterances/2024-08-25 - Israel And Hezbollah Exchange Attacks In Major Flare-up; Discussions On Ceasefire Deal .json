He explained, for instance, why Hezbollah took so long to take its revenge for the Israeli drone strike on the 30th of July here in Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander.He said that they delayed that strike, which was basically a month ago almost, was because for one thing they wanted to give the Gaza ceasefire talks a chance and another was that they saw that Israel was on high alert and there was an increased U.S. military presence in the region. He said, nonetheless, they went ahead with this strike and by his estimation, it was a great success. He said that it went according to plan and that they struck about a dozen military targets just on the other side of the border, which allowed them to fire further munitions toward what he said was the headquarters of Mossad and Unit 8200, which is Israel signal intelligence unit. But we have yet to see any evidence since that despite his claims that they actually struck those places. But he's certainly put on -- putting on a brave face for people in Lebanon who he acknowledged have for a month now almost been on edge waiting for Hezbollah to respond to that assassination and Israel's inevitable response to that. He did come out and say that whether there's going to be a phase two or not, he left that open to questioning, but he said that they are going to evaluate the extent of the effectiveness of their strikes and then take the next step. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HASSAN NASRALLAH, SECRETARY GENERAL, HEZBOLLAH (through translator): We will assess the outcome of the enemy's concealment of today's events. If the result is satisfactory and it achieved the intended goal, we will consider the response process to the assassination of Fuad Shukr complete. If it falls short in our view we will reserve the right to respond at a later time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They have said that they are preparing to act forcefully, in their words, against Hamas targets, any Hamas infrastructure and Hamas militants in parts of Central Gaza.But as you mentioned, Jim, we have seen these evacuation orders repeatedly now in the past, ordering civilians to move to so-called safe areas for their protection. But as we have seen time and time again these areas are not necessarily guaranteed to be safe. And in fact, there is a humanitarian zone in the west where the Israeli military has now ordered civilians in parts of Central Gaza to evacuate to. But according to our analysis, we have seen that humanitarian zone getting smaller and smaller. It is shrinking. And what we've been hearing from humanitarian organizations unfortunately U.N. agencies present on the ground is that these areas are not guaranteed to be safe. And frankly, there is nowhere safe left for Palestinians, civilians within the Gaza Strip. We have at times seen these humanitarian zones come under attack themselves. And of course it is very difficult to communicate these evacuation orders. The Israeli military has been sending out text messages to Palestinians. But as you can imagine, the connectivity in the Gaza Strip is hugely limited. So not everyone will be getting these messages and for some civilians who have been forced to evacuate on multiple occasions, there is a feeling now there was simply nowhere else for them to turn to at this stage. And what we've been hearing from our colleagues on the ground in Gaza that this particular area, the focus of these latest evacuation order is an area known to be housing tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom are taking shelter in schools in the areas. So certainly a concerning situation once again for Gaza civilians.",

I wonder, though, do you see deliberate calculation by all of the parties here because to your point Hezbollah, it would pay a heavy price for a larger war and not the least of which coming from the Lebanese population, which doesn't appear to get involved in such a war. But Israel, for instance, in its preemptive strike, kept its targets to the southern part of Lebanon, did not go north, did not go around Beirut.And of course, from Iran's perspective, you've had Iran keeping their powder dry to some degree in terms of carrying out what they have publicly vowed to do, which is a revenge attack against Israel for taking out Ismail Haniyeh inside Tehran. So do you see a deliberate calibration here by all the parties to avoid a bigger conflict?",

So in other words, when the Israelis took out the Hamas leader in Tehran, Haniyeh, they clearly calculated, they weren't very concerned about Iranian response. They thought, well, we know Iran doesn't want to be involved in the war. We and the Americans have effectively deterred that. And the Iranians thus far have shown that calculation to be correct.Hezbollah very similarly, the Israelis have shown a willingness to continue to strike and strike deeper and deeper inside Lebanon territory to hit senior leaders of Hezbollah and military capabilities because they feel quite confident that Hezbollah will be restrained. That clearly is not true of the Houthis, for example, who continue to use every military capability they have to hit pretty big tankers as well as to try to blow up, you know, American warships, others in the Gulf. That's a serious problem. Also, I mean Hamas, they've been blown up, so they don't have the military capabilities to pull off another October 7th, but they certainly haven't been deterred. And, you know, one thing that we haven't seen thus far, thankfully, are major Islamic terrorist attacks against Israel, against American, against ally targets in the region and more broadly linked to this Middle East conflict. But certainly they're not deterrable either. So I think it's important to differentiate what we're seeing from Iran and Hezbollah, which would make us feel a little more comfortable that this isn't going to blow up into a region-wide war. And what we're seeing from less, let's say controllable members of the so-called axis of resistance.",

Iran has this vast land area right here, but we'll remember back in April they used over 300 missiles and rockets and drones to attack Israel, basically about 1,000 miles from the Iranian border to Israel. And they were able to do this.But all of this was intercepted through the Iron Dome system that the Israelis had. And the Iron Dome system is designed to detect incoming missiles, rockets, drones, and really find out where they are, they kind of have the algorithms that predict exactly where these rockets might strike. They assess whether or not that's going to happen. And when they intercept this using the Tamir missile, for example, they will hit the missile right where, at this point, but they won't hit it directly. What they'll do is this missile will blow up in the proximity of the incoming projectile, and it will actually take things out. So when the Iranians did this strike back in April they lobbed a lot of stuff at Israel but because of the Iron Dome and U.S. intelligence and radar activity and allied activity, they were able to keep all of these -- the Iranian efforts, really they held them at bay and made the Iranian strike in effective at that point.",

And that has me curious because generally -- look, this is like a chess match or a game of Go, where one opponent does something and then the other opponent responds.The Russians are often very slow to respond on the battlefield, but it has me wondering if Putin has looked at this situation and said Kursk could be the thing to use to motivate the Russian population in that when you talk to a number of Russian specialists in the U.S. government, they say Putin hasn't been serious about winning the Ukrainian war. If he's serious, he would mobilize his entire population. He would draft more soldiers to make up for his losses on the battlefield. He hasn't done that. Well, he probably hasn't done that because popular opinion would rise up against him unless Russians felt endangered and the Kursk attack is making him feel very threatened.",

And that means in a sort of a man intensive war, where you have so many Ukrainian troops engaged on the eastern front against Russian forces there, I mean, how do you cover all of your bases at some point? You have to pick and choose and if too many forces get sent to Kursk, that could weaken their defense along the eastern front and then surely Russia will take advantage of that.",

What you hear from Russia watchers is all along the borders with Ukraine the populations that are exposed to war are unhappy with Putin's policies.But the closer you get to Moscow, Putin is in control of that media and he tells the narrative he wants out there. And that narrative is, see, NATO has backed Ukraine and Ukraine, an authoritarian government, is now pushing into our territory. This is what I warned about all along. And a course we have to keep fighting. As a matter of fact, I'm going to have to drop more Russian sons and daughters to beat back the Ukrainians.",
