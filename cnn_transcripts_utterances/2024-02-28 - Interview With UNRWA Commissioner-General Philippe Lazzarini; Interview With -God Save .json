The answer would be extremely easy. It's political will.

Now, if tomorrow you have a ceasefire, we will enter into a long transition phase.

What will we do? We would just sow the seeds for further hatred, revenge, and resentment.

And I have to tell you, Christiane, that many times also, the Hamas was not really pleased that these children were attending our school rather than the schools under the control of the de facto and the Hamas authority. And we have seen it, for example, during the summer camp, where whenever UNRWA was organizing summer camp, allowing children to do artistic activities, sport activities. We have up to 250,000 kids being registered. Whereas whenever the Hamas or the Authority were organizing summer camp, they had only 20,000.

But the mythology that we award that is very evocative. I used to live in Egypt, and I think about the pharaohs looming over modern-day Egypt. Well, the -- so does a cowboy loom over modern-day urban Texas. The other thing is, I think we kind of cherish our characters, even though there's some ruinous ones among them in our statehouse.

And now, you're out with a new book called \"What We've Become: Living and Dying in a Country of Arms.\" Another gun book. Why go down this road? DR. JONATHAN METZL, AUTHOR, \"WHAT WE'VE BECOME\":  Well, it's great to be back. I actually didn't think I was going to write another gun book. I felt like the research I did in 2019 through Southern Missouri had really told me so much. And it's not that there's ever -- you know, you've said the final word on this topic, but then a mass shooting happened in my hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, a very racially charged mass shooting, a naked white man with an AR-15 went into a Waffle House in South Nashville that was really full. It was kind of 2:00 in the morning, full of celebrating young adults of color. Killed four people, injured four more. And I'm somebody who studies race and gun violence and mass shootings and mental illness. And I just felt like this was kind of a story that had to be told, both because of the local connections, but also because it became pretty clear pretty quickly for me that this was a parable of many larger issues that are facing America.",

But somehow he's able to evade one after another just because we kind of give him the benefit of the doubt. DR. METZL:  Yes, that's exactly right. I mean, I have a kind of alternate reality I talk about in the book, which is imagine this same shooter, but as a six-foot-tall black man, and I say, he certainly wouldn't have made it probably past the first police encounter, but in the second police encounter this -- the shooter, Travis Reinking -- the real Travis Reinking, jumps naked into a public pool and then gets out and turns out he has these guns. And so, part of the story is how he's repeatedly -- he and his parents, actually his father, are repeatedly given the benefit of the doubt because, as I argue in the book, even a clearly disturbed white man is seen as somebody whose rights are to be repeatedly defended. It's more about the right of somebody like him to carry a gun, even in this extreme instance than it is about any kind of disarmament. And that's true in Illinois, and it's certainly true when he moves to Tennessee and then, ultimately commits the shooting.",

      "sentences": "You know, throughout this book, you also kind of pull on the thread of the consequences of race when it comes to how we see policy, howwe see gun violence overall, because one of the kind of immediate reactions after a mass shooting, et cetera, the defense is, well, look at Chicago, look at the crime that's happening here. That's where the gun violence is, et cetera, right? That we need to be tackling this from a -- well, maybe a conservative point of view. But then you end up -- you also show that there's actually an increase now, it says, I think, 52 percent of majority of Americans now own guns. This includes liberal Americans. And 41 percent of black Americans, that's a 17- point jump from just four years ago. What does that say to you? DR. METZL:  It tells me that owning a gun and carrying a gun has become our de facto response to moments of uncertainty, and it also tells me that those feelings of uncertainty are very profitable. I mean, what I talk about in the book, for example, is after the police murder of George Floyd, the gun manufacturers and gun sellers specifically targeted black and Latino Americans saying, you need a gun and the police aren't going to protect you. And also, that was based in real fear of what people were seeing in that video. More recently after October 7th, all of a sudden, we're seeing Jewish-Americans go out and buy guns who have never bought guns before. And so, in a way, to me, it kind of is a structural problem that when we destroy the interstitium that keeps us feeling connected, when we destroy, really, the materiality of thinking we're in the same network, that all of a sudden everyone is out for themselves. And that's in a way, again, why I fall back on a, we need to rebuild civic and democratic infrastructure argument in the book, because this mass proliferation of guns, it's just becoming this de facto response, but it's also, for me, a bigger symbol really of the demise of our infrastructure that makes us feel like we're all connected.",

METZL:  You know, that's part of the race story I tell in the book. You know, we had this -- I mean, the pathology of a naked white shooter with an AR-15 killing young people of color, young adults of color, it just could not have been more clear. And what I talk about in the book is Tennessee had two ways to go, we could have either said, let's come together, learn from this tragedy and figure out a way, or we could have said, well, this means we need more guns. And I really center a lot in the book on a gubernatorial election that happened right after the mass shooting, 2018 governor's election in in Tennessee. And there were public health candidates. And there was one candidate, Billy, who said this means we need more guns. I'm going to actually do away with all the gun laws. And what happened was right after the shooting, Tennessee elected a guy who did the opposite of what it would have done to stop the shooting. And then the book ends with another example in 2022, where when the shooter went to trial, you know, five years after the shooting, they couldn't charge him with a gun law because between when he committed the crime and when he went to trial carrying the gun the way he did wasn't a crime anymore. And so, when we keep doing the thing that's the opposite of what we should be doing in a way, and I really try to ask, what does that mean? What does that tell us about what we've become as a society?",

I mean, where does that fall short? DR. METZL:  Well, I'm a psychiatrist and I think that there is an important role for mental health, just not the role that we've been put in a lot of times. In other words, what I show in the book is that after many mass shootings -- for understandable reasons, many mass shooters, including Travis Reinking and the Waffle House shooting that I write about, suffer from symptoms of mental illness. But as I show in the book, that's not the same as saying that mental illness was the only thing that drove them to commit their crimes. In fact, when I start to list out all the factors that lead to mass shootings, mental illness often isn't in the top 30. It's, you know, loose gun laws, history of violence, history of substance use, all these other factors. And so, I try to be very aware of that. I do think there's a role for mental health, but what we saw for a long time is that mental health was the one thing that the right and the left could agree on. In other words, people on the right would say, it's not a gun's problem, it's a mental illness problem. But people on the left would say, well, look, we have the New York Safe Act, for example, or in Tennessee, where I live, legislation after a mass shooting that said mental health practitioners are the ones who need to be the ones who are alerting authorities if patients are being threatening. And really what I do in the book, I hope by the end of the book, people will realize why it's important to have mental health as part of this conversation, but why putting mental health practitioners at the front by themselves of this issue, in a predictive role, really is statistically just doesn't really do the job we wanted to in a way it's based on stereotypes of mental illness. Many, many people come to mental health practitioners voicing some kind of hostility, but only a minuscule percentage of them go on to commit crimes. And the other point is, I just think mental health expertise is very useful at looking at the bigger issue, which is the polarization around guns in America. And that is never part of the formulation.",

METZL:  What I try to show is just why a lot of the interventions that, I think, were well-intentioned that when they were devised, probably in the heyday of public health in the 1990s and early 2000s, you know, government databases, regulations, empowering police and judges to disarm people even temporarily, they probably made sense in the context of the blue state of America where these were being framed. And then, in light of other things that had worked, you know, against cigarettes and cars. But I think we need policies that understand the histories of guns in the south, the meanings of guns in the south and that, in a way, try to intervene. Let me just be clear. I think a lot of this is happening, right, because what I learned from sitting the NRA in this book is that they really did start as a grassroots organization and they didn't start by wanting to take over the Supreme Court. They learn they -- that they got their power by grassroots groups and running for school board and election or all these other factors. And in a way, I think a lot of that is happening. It's happening in Tennessee right now. David Hogg has a new organization that's running -- using the frame of gun safety, but having people run for run for office all up and down the board across -- in a way red state America. I do think that -- that's what needs to be happen. And again, I do think there are ways we can form alliance in more sustained ways than we have with people who are gun owners who also want to see this problem changed.",
