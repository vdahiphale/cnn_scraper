Kamala Harris is about to ratchet up her outreach to Republicans as she campaigns with former GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney for the very first time will be carrying their remarks in the battleground state of Wisconsin live.Also breaking, a new court filing by Donald Trump, asking a federal court to throw all the criminal charges in the January 6th election subversion case against him. This comes just hours after new details on the special counsel's bombshell evidence against him. The former president was unsealed. Plus, Israel is launching fresh airstrikes in Southern Beirut tonight, as it is vowing a strong and painful response to the unprecedented missile attack by Iran earlier this week, and warning that the Israeli retaliation will happen soon. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you are in The Situation Room. And we begin with the breaking news this hour. Longtime Republican stalwart Liz Cheney is making good on her promise to do whatever she can to help Kamala Harris and the Democrats defeat Donald Trump. We're standing by for Harris and Cheney to speak at their first joint event in a battleground city that has special significance for the Republican Party. CNN's Eva McKend joins us live from Ripon in Wisconsin. So, Eva, who are Harris and Cheney trying to reach out to with this event tonight?",

      "sentences": "Alex, this is a message grounded in country over party. The signs behind me read as such. Liz Cheney will introduce the vice president. And, ultimately, the argument that they are making here is that this election, in their view, is about democracy. It's about the Constitution, rule of law, and that the former president is a threat to all of those things. They are trying to appeal to conservative voters, independent voters who have no appetite for supporting the former president and to ensure that they don't stay home and that they maybe look over these policy differences that they have with the vice president and come out and support the Democratic ticket.They are employing this message not only here in Ripon, Wisconsin, which is significant, of course because it is known as the birthplace of the Republican Party. You have Republicans for Harris, that coalition, in all of the battleground states over the next several days aggressively making this argument. And, listen, not all Democrats think that this is the best strategy. Some Democrats tell me they believe the campaign instead should be focusing on black and Latino voters, Asian voters, other voters that are in the base of the party. But, listen, Wisconsin Democrats, they tell me that this is the right strategy, that election cycle after election cycle, they actually lean on Democrats in red counties like this one to go talk to their Republican neighbors and try to make the case here. And this all comes as a CNN poll of polls indicates that there is no clear leader in this contest. Alex, that means that it is going to be bitterly close up until the very end. And so that is why we see the campaign employing this strategy, trying to reach out to Republican voters. Alex?",

We've talked this whole election cycle about the so called Nikki Haley voters, this roughly 20 to 30 percent of Republican primary voters who actively turned out to vote against Trump. I think a lot of those voters, at least half of them, are much more closely Liz Cheney voters, traditional Republicans who believe in the Constitution, the rule of law, standing with our allies abroad, all things that Donald Trump has turned against.And I think having somebody step out, who is, I mean, the picture of a Republican, the idea of Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney supporting a Democrat is something none of us could have ever imagined, and saying that the country is more important and stopping Donald Trump is more important, I think, can be impactful. Let's be clear, this is not about going for card-carrying Republicans who have never considered voting for a Democrat. It's independents, it's moderates, it's women in swing districts, and it's disillusioned Republicans who are horrified by January 6th and care about the character of the president. So, we're going to be sounding the alarm in battleground Pennsylvania. I couldn't, in good conscience, having been a public servant in the White House and seeing Donald Trump up close, not tell people that I think he's wholly unfit to be in the White House again.",

There are pundits, there are progressive activists or people who are social media people who might have a complaint, but it's not serious.What you're seeing now three things. This is a coalition of hope for our democracy to prevail and to be sustained. That's why you got an ALC and a Liz Cheney and a Taylor Swift and everybody in between all staying together, not because we all agree with each other on policy. In fact, we really don't. It's we agree that we should have a country with a Constitution and a rule of law and not a dictator and not a king. And so that's one thing that's happening. The other thing is, this is defense for Kamala Harris. People are saying she's a communist. No Cheney would support a communist, period. And so it's a defense for her. And also it should be a little bit of an alarm for people. If you're taking this, not very seriously, by the time the Cheneys come out and say we are in trouble as a country, the democracy is on the line, you might want to take that a little bit more seriously. So, there are multiple things happening here, and I don't think the downside is even a real thing outside of social media.",

That's not going to make a difference. But with swing voters, with disaffected Republicans, Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney, they do give, let's say, cover or maybe inspiration to some of those disaffected Republican voters.One of the things Liz Cheney has said repeatedly is, and this goes to the poll of polls and how close it is, that no one can afford to vote for a third party candidate, right, someone in or stay home. And so I think what Liz Cheney hopes in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, where she's going with Alyssa, is this is vote by vote, getting out the vote in this very tight race, Alex.",

But, honestly, I wish that Taylor Swift had waited. I'm glad that Liz Cheney has waited. You know, a lot of people are going to be paying more attention going forward.

She's going to deploy people like Bernie Sanders and AOC.But I do want to say something just in response to my dear friend, Matt, listen, RFK Jr. endorsing Donald Trump is not a realignment of Kennedy Democrats now embracing Donald Trump. That's just respectfully ridiculous. He's been denounced by all living members of the Kennedy family other than RFK. What it actually signals is that my Republican Party, which is the only party I've ever voted in, is willing to embrace somebody who's an anti-vaxxer, who spreads conspiracy theories and who's generally dangerous to public health in order to maybe marginally get votes. I think it speaks to the character of Trump, which is an issue for so many Republicans like me. Win at all costs. If even if you don't win, say that you won. Embrace the crazy if it brings people in the fold. And there are a lot of swing voters. There are a lot of voters, as evidenced in the 2022 midterms, who are just so sick of the craziness.",

She certainly does not have a path in Donald Trump's Republican Party.I think what she does hope, and she's spoken about this, is that there is a new Republican Party, something more along the lines of what you would consider the traditional Republican Party before Donald Trump. I don't want to gang up on Matt, but I want to push back on something he said, too, about this issue of Kamala Harris supporters being concerned that Liz Cheney's hawk, military, you know, defense, foreign policy views are going to affect Vice President Harris' views. Liz Cheney has made it clear, and I think Vice President Harris has, this endorsement, this appearance today, it's not about policy.
