That's kind of the standard on the campaign trail. When you're hearing Donald Trump speak for an hour-and-a-half, two hours on end -- I mean, he talks about anything and everything. We saw, you know, earlier this week, which now feels like a lifetime ago, but we saw him earlier this week, you know, end a town hall and stopped answering questions and just spend 39 minutes listening to music and just kind of walking around on stage and not taking questions, but really just listening to random songs. And, yes, it is seen as traditionally a liability with a general election audience to sort of not focus on the issues and sort of have these anecdotes and these moments where you sort of question his mental acuity or you just question what exactly is the point of what he's doing.

She's, you know, attacking Trump more directly while still talking about her message.And, I think, one of the clearest differences we've seen in the last few days is just how much Harris now is engaging with interviews. That is clearly after weeks of criticism that she wasn't engaging enough with the media. That she wasn't, you know, doing more off the cuff interviews. We see her doing one today on her 60th birthday. And that sort of has set her up to be able to criticize Trump more directly. For her to now say with authority, well, I'm out on the road talking to people. I'm doing all these interviews, whether it's with media or podcasts or more informally. Where are you? Why are you now so exhausted? The reality is both of them are having, you know, insane schedules on the campaign trail on this final stretch.

And I think we can slice and dice the data around early voting at this point. You know, you look at in Georgia it's -- it was about roughly 53 percent women. So, if you look at women, then you think, oh, maybe does that benefit Kamala Harris with her message so tailored on reproductive rights and women's rights, and, you know, that distinction with Donald Trump?

No one is talking to us about the timing of it.But they are saying that they are waiting to see what the outcome of the U.S. investigation is into what the source of this leak was. Again, they're describing it as a minor leak. If it is a sort of, for instance, an Iranian spy in U.S. intelligence, which is one of the possibilities, I think, that's being looked at. What, you know, my sources are telling me is that it seems very odd that something of this small significance would be leaked and potentially risk exposing the asset inside U.S. intelligence. Another thing that's been speculated about here in the Israeli media, and is being talked about around watercoolers and Israeli officials as well is it's a deliberate leak in order to try and deter or delay any kind of Israeli strike on -- Israel.

Instead, it described what the U.S. saw mostly from its spy satellites about Israeli preparation. And they were exactly what you would expect to see.The assembly together of missiles, the dispersal of potential targets of Iranian retaliation. In other words, moving some of Israel's assets that are normally at bases that could be struck in response, getting them out of the way. So, then the big question, as Matthew said, is why did we see this? It looked a lot like the leaks that we have seen before from -- that came out of disgruntled lower-level military who had access to some of this. It was classified, but not at the highest level.

When you talk to Israelis, they frequently say these days that Vice President Harris urged them not to go into Rafah, in southern Gaza. They went there and that is how someone accidentally they tripped across Sinwar and ended up killing him. So, their view is, had they listened to President Biden, that both the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah would probably be alive today. Now, the American view of this is know when not to get into overstretch, and know when to take your victory and turn it into something permanent. Because otherwise, the American argument is, you'll end up looking back at this era as a series of tactical military victories that did not ultimately make Israel safer. And that's the dividing line.

Experts say once all the damages are calculated, each storm could cost $50 billion or more. Joining us now is Adam Smith, an economist and meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Adam, good morning to you. What was it, if there's anything unique about these storms that pushed them above, potentially, we don't know yet, but potentially above that mark of $50 billion, why are they so expensive? ADAM SMITH, NOAA ECONOMIST &amp; METEOROLOGIST: Good morning. They're so expensive because they've hit millions of people, their lives, their livelihoods, and they had multiple hazards, high wind, flooding, even storm surge. And from Florida to the Carolinas, just so many people on the path of these powerful, increasingly powerful storms, it equates to tens of billions of dollars of damage, and that's a conservative estimate.",

There wasn't another one until Katrina in 2005, 13 years between $50 billion storms.If you look at the last seven years, there have been five in just the last seven years.

First, we have a lot of more energy in the ocean and the atmosphere from climate change that helps supercharge these different extremes into billion-dollar disaster events, whether they're wildfires, droughts, floods or hurricanes. And also, we have more exposure and more vulnerability, people building and living in harm's way.So, the combination of our exposure, our vulnerability and climate change, enhancing some of these extremes into billion-dollar disasters is why we're seeing a high count and high cost for these different extremes that we're facing today.",

But in the last decade, we've had these billion-dollar disasters about every three weeks. So, we're getting these compound disasters with cascading impacts.So, what that tells us is, yes, we need to learn from these disasters and rebuild and make better decisions based on what we learned. For example, Asheville, 20 years ago, before Helene hit Asheville, was hit by another hurricane. We tried to bury the water pipes 25 feet down in the ground, but Helene washed away those backup water pipes. So, the 20th century and 21st century infrastructure and building codes sometimes still are not up to the standards that these extreme events unleash on us today.",
