This is CONNECT THE WORLD.And coming up this hour, Russia keeps up its bombardment of Odessa, targeting Ukrainian grain. Outrage in India following a shocking sexual assault video. Legendary singer Tony Bennett dies at the age of 96. And what happens when two summer blockbusters are released on the same day, \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\"? Welcome to the show. And we start with a fourth straight night of Russian missile strikes on Odessa. Russia hitting Ukrainian grain warehouses in attacks that Ukraine claims are tied to Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal. Ukraine says the strikes destroyed large stocks of peas and barley. And now both sides are warning that the other may be poised to attack ships in the region. And with the U.S. raising concerns of potential Russian false flag operations, Russia leaving the grain deal sparked a surge in green prices. Wheat futures are about 10 percent higher. It is the biggest increase since Russia's invasion in February of last year. Fred Pleitgen is in Berlin. Fred, there is a lot to get through here in what is now becoming a very direct target for Russia strikes on grain infrastructure, raised even bigger concerns of what this means for global supply. The E.U. says that we've already seen a lot of around 65,000 tons of grain that were lost due to burning and the fires. Losses are rising. Take us through the damage.",

And I think one of the things that we felt was really telling us that the Ukrainians are saying, look, they're able to shoot down some of those Shahed drones that comes, some of those slower cruise missiles. But the Russians really are using some of the heaviest and most sophisticated weapons that they have. And some of these missiles are designed to destroy aircraft carriers. And obviously, if those things hit a grain facility or, God forbid, an urban environment, they cause a lot of damage. The Ukrainians coming out just a couple of minutes ago and saying that 21 people were injured in the past couple of days just in the Odessa region alone. And of course we know a couple people were killed in those strikes that have been ongoing as well -- Eleni.",

I think what we're seeing right now in the Black Sea isessentially a standoff between the Ukrainians and the Russians. And of course, you have various players of the international community that in some way, shape or form are trying to mitigate all this and trying to get involved as well. In fact Turkey came out today and said look, they want to ensure that humanitarian cargo and that grain can be exported in some way. This could be brought back on track. Of course the Turks are saying that Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are going to be talking in the next couple of days about the grain deal. They want to try to get it back on track. But at the same, you have Russians saying that even civilian vessels that go to Ukrainian ports will be considered as possible carriers of military cargo and will themselves become targets. And not only that, what the flags that these ships are flying under those countries will also be considered to be part of -- on the side of Ukraine. The Ukrainians, for their part, are now saying exactly the same thing, saying that ships going to Russian ports could be seen as ships carrying military cargo as well. That's where the standoff factor comes in which obviously makes for an extremely dangerous situation. And that certainly could be one of the reasons why we are seeing this big surge in prices on world markets because that situation really seems to be deteriorating. No side is letting up. It seems to becoming more dangerous by the minute. And certainly right now despite efforts at mitigation, especially by countries like Turkey, there doesn't appear to be a clear path out of this at this point in time. Certainly not one that could make it possible to once again export grain from Ukrainian ports -- Eleni.",

Now, we move to a shocking video shedding new and disturbing light on the sectarian conflict in northeastern India. In fact the footage is too graphic for us to air. So what you're seeing now are protests after the video emerged of two women forced to walk naked through a heckling mob of men who appeared to sexually assault them. The incident itself is thought to have been from May but the footage surfacing this week has prompted police to make arrests and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break his silence on the months of violence. Vedika Sud joins us now live in Delhi. Harrowing video, Vedika. And to be honest, we just see violence that is similar to this against women playing out far too often.

We've seen the video, but of course we don't want to share that video because of the horrific visuals in it with our audience here, but let me first take you through the video. It's a 26-second clip where you see two women who are forced to walk down naked on a road with a mob of at least three dozen men surrounding them. They heckled them, they groped them, they sexually assault them. You can hear the women crying for help. You can see them using their hands to cover their bare bodies. It's taken more than two months for this video to surface. This incident dates back to the 4th of May. And now only after this video has surfaced is the government in Manipur and the center taking action against all the perpetrators and suspects related to this crime. And that's what's shocking for me and for a lot of people around us here. A lot of questions are being asked by activists and others to the government. And this is a BJP-led government. Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, leads this government in the center and the BJP government leads the Manipur government as well. And the question they're asking is why has it taken more than 70 days since this incident took place for action on the ground? Like I said, there are more than three dozen men in that video who are sexually assaulting and a part of that mob. But only a handful of arrests have taken place until now after 70 days. As of now, as I speak to you, four arrests have taken place and we have at least 36 men in that video. We've counted those men. And according to the state chief minister a manhunt has already been announced and launched in terms of trying to catch the suspects. But a lot has to be done in terms of accountability for that trust really to rebuild in the state of Manipur, that has seen ethnic clashes for over two and half months now between two ethnic groups. Both fighting over rights and both fighting over access to government benefits. Back to you.",

The Italian Health Ministry held emergency meetings Thursday to come up with new protocols for employers whose workers spend hours in the sweltering heat. This after temperatures in Rome reached a record high of nearly 42 degrees Celsius earlier this week. In Greece workers at the Acropolis are walking off the job to protest having to work in the baking sun. A trade union representing staff at Greek archaeological sites has announced a daily four-hour strike through Sunday. The heat wave is also putting the travel industry on edge. In fact observers are already seeing a shift in people's destination preferences. CNN's Anna Stewart joins us now live from London. Great to have you on, Anna. Look, we're seeing a huge shift here.

      "sentences": "Yes, everyone wants some sun for their summer holiday but not this much. This is uncomfortably hot in southernEurope and also actually quite dangerously hot in many situations. And it's really changing how tourists are experiencing parts of Europe. For instance, in Athens, the Acropolis has been shut. In Rome, there are stations where the city set up sort of command centers so tourists have access to water, to misting stations and to shade because it is dangerously hot and some people are passing out as they queue for attractions. So this is a big challenge. And for some of these European countries, of course, tourism represents such a huge part of the economy. For Greece, it made up 18.5 percent last year, more than 10 percent for Italy. Now looking at the shift we're seeing, the top spots in Europe continue to be the hottest locations. I can show you these top destinations according to the ETC. We'll see, I believe, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Croatia all up there. Spain is leading it at 8 percent. But the question is whether that will reduce. Will we see more popular destinations pop up? Interestingly, according to the ETC, they are seeing a surge in popularity for the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland, places that do have cooler climates. That said, it's hard to say whether people are necessarily avoiding southern Europe at this stage. There aren't the cancellations you might expect possibly because actually cancellation policies don't include extreme heat in terms of your insurance. But it might be a shift over the years. Particularly as we had a heat wave in Europe last year and this year. It may make tourists reconsider whether they want to hit up Southern Italy or Greece in August of next year -- Eleni.",

There is going to be a question about how firm she will hold to that date that she has now put on the calendar. This was a question that had been fought over by both sides in this case. The Justice Department prosecutors wanting this to go to trial at the end of this year, which would be very fast. And the judge even agrees with that. She says that that would be atypically accelerated, those were her words. But then Donald Trump, he didn't want to have a trial date set at all. He essentially wanted to push this past the entirety of the presidential election next year. That would be in November of 2024. And so now Judge Cannon comes in and she says, let's do it in May, but that does put this trial date right in the middle of essentially a political calendar that could be quite heated.

Mary Earp, she's the best in the world at her position but no fans can find her jersey because Nike doesn't sell it. Doubly the confusing here, Adidas makes Manchester United's uniforms where Earps plays club and sold out of her replica kit last season. Amanda Davies joins me now to perhaps shed some light onto why this is happening AMANDA DAVIES, CNN'S WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Well, why is a very good question. And the question is being asked, Eleni. And ultimately we're talking about this Women's World Cup as a real sign of progress for equality and the fight against sexism in sports and football. But it's very difficult to see this is anything but. Mary Earps as you rightly said she was named the FIFA best goalkeeper last year. But Nike and adidas, I have to say, for the World Cup are not producing replica kits for the goalkeepers of any of the national sides. You can see here as well Mary Earps is somebody who always wears a long sleeve goalkeeper shirt. But here she is wearing a short sleeve one because her shirt was designed without any consultation. So she had to come up with an alternative which was to wear something underneath her sleeves. And she said in a statement, an interview, that she said she was hoping not to have to make. She's been trying to come up with a solution to have the conversations that make this better. But she's described it as incredibly hurtful. She said it is hugely hurtful considering the last 12 months, especially, there's been an incredible rise in goalkeeping participation. It is a scary message that is being sent to goalkeepers worldwide that you are not important. And fans should be able to buy the shirts like with the men's game of any of the players they want to see. And they want to support. And that is not happening. Nike haven't responded to CNN in our request for comment. Adidas have responded, they have acknowledged that the goalkeeper's jerseys aren't for sale. They haven't explained why. But they have come back saying that their biggest effort kit bag for a Women's World Cup is being provided, still not good enough -- Eleni.",
