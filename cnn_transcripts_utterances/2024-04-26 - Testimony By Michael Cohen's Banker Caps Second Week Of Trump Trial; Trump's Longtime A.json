Daniel's contact listed her cell phone. She testified, as far as she can remember, Trump never used email to communicate. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Graff if she had seen Daniels at Trump Tower. Graff responded that she vaguely recalled once seeing Daniels in reception on the 26th floor. Then it was Trump's attorney's turn to cross-examine Graff. Susan Necheles asked Graff about Trump's interest in casting stars in Celebrity Apprentice, suggesting that was the reason Daniels was spotted at Trump Tower. Graff responded, that's what she assumed, testifying, I vaguely recall hearing him say that she was one of the people that may be an interesting contestant on the show.",

The prosecutors want to be able to show the jury every step of the money and the effort toward paying off Stormy Daniels from Donald Trump's sphere. Gary Farro is one of the people that can do that, both with his testimony and with his evidence. He can help them show the documents, the emails, the exchanges, and a crucial document from him that we ended the day with is him testifying that when Michael Cohen was setting up this account through this bank, there's a box to check that says, if this is related to political funds, check it.

The former lead counsel for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Donald Trump, Andrew Weissmann, is joining us. He's now co authored a brand new book entitled The Trump Indictments, The Historic Charging Documents with Commentary. Andrew, thank you so much for joining us once again. That transcript that we just heard some excerpts from gave us a window in how the defense was trying to undercut David Pecker's testimony. Do you think they were effective? ANDREW WEISSMANN, CO-AUTHOR, THE TRUMP INDICTMENTS, THE HISTORIC CHARGING DOCUMENTS WITH COMMENTARY:  Well, you know, I think that I don't fault the defense lawyer for pursuing that line of questioning to say, you know, what you say was this agreement was kind of snow in winter because you would do it. The problem with that theory is that there, in fact, was new content with respect to, let's just take Ted Cruz. You know, they famously ran stories that David Pecker had already talked about regarding an alleged affair, which they said was, you know, false. They ran a story which they said was false about his father and his relationship to the JFK assassination. And you also don't see any negative stories about Donald Trump. So, this is, I think, sort of taking pot shots, which, you know, is a fair thing to do. But one of the things that I think jurors look for at the end of the day is whose narrative. And I think that these are sort of disparate points that the defense has made, but when you think about it logically, I think it doesn't really hold up. But obviously it'll be a call for the jury.",

So that -- I had been sort of thinking about Michael Cohen as sort of a main player, but in many ways, he is a staffer. The main players here, the principals, are, according to the D.A.'s case, David Pecker and the defendant, Donald Trump, with Michael Cohen, having an important role, but as somebody who is carrying out, that's the scheme that they put together.I think the other thing is that David Pecker really explained the insides of the scheme. In other words, he explains that, why it is that the National Enquirer was paying money for the doorman scheme. He was paying money for the Karen McDougal scheme. But at some point, they said, you know what? We're done being the bank. We are no longer sort of your bank for paying off these people in the catch and kill. And that explains why it is that Michael Cohen had to take out this home equity loan that we were hearing about just as the testimony was ending today and explains that difference. Now there's why it is that the National Enquirer wasn't paying for this third and final scheme with respect to Stormy Daniels, but it had to be paid for by Michael Cohen.

This tornado went directly over the interstate, I-80 even knocking over a semi, but it remained very, very violent.

Think about how much square footage that is, if you move a violent tornado like this for a 50-mile long swath. It has now moved just to the north of Eppley Airport. Eppley was actually hit by a separate storm and it's closed that port. This is the airport in Omaha. But the storm that you see here is still going. Even though it's lost some rotation, it's moved into Iowa at this point, but we had crews rolling to the scenes right now looking at this damage.

It was relatively tedious kinds of questioning back and forth, and Trump appeared to be somewhat disinterested but also looking and watching Pecker.But when his assistant, Rhona Graff, who had been Trump's assistant for 34 years up until 2021, when she was on the stand, she was testifying more favorably about the former president. She was brought on as a prosecution witness to get some records in, but she was also asked by Trump's lawyer what it was like working for him, and she said, every day was different. She said it was fascinating and interesting. And at that point Trump was smiling, and he had shifted his body in his chair to actually -- so he could get a better view of her as he was watching her testify about him. She said that she found him respectful toward her and that she thought that he was very thoughtful. He would sometimes peek his head into her office and tell her that she should go home to her family. So, he seemed to be enjoying and appreciating that favorable testimony that he was hearing. And when she was leaving the witness stand it was just at the end of a break and Trump had stood up. It was unclear if they had had any communications or contact but he did seem to be pleased to see her in the courtroom and hear her testimonies today.",

Thank you very much.I want to get more on Donald Trump's response today, the president Biden saying he'd be happy to debate Trump before the 2024 election? Trump daring Biden to debate them outside the courthouse that day. Let's get some analysis. Joining us now, CNN political commentators, S.E. Cupp and Jamal Simmons. And, S.E., who do you think would have board gain from a debate? Would it be Trump or Biden? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Definitely Donald Trump, and he knows that. I think he's banking on the fact that he will look more robust, more energetic and he is not held to standards by his own voters like standards like telling the truth, knowing stuff, having policies that he's going to explain, they don't care about any of that. So he'll win with his crowd no matter what. And he knows, Biden's voters have very high standards. They want to ask questions about policy, Gaza, what he would do in XYZ situation. So I think Trump is probably right that it benefits him. That's why he's been pushing this for a very long time. And actually I think he's outplayed Biden a bit. He's going to say, okay, great, I'm ready to go tonight Monday, Tuesday -- you heard him say that. When Biden says, no, we'll probably do it as scheduled after the conventions, Trump's going to say, look, he's scared, he's unprepared, I'm ready to go now. I think Trump has the upper hand here.",

And one of the things I've seen in some of these debate negotiations way back in the '90s when I was a kid, I worked for a guy named Mickey Kantor who was the chief debate negotiator for President Bill Clinton during the reelect.
