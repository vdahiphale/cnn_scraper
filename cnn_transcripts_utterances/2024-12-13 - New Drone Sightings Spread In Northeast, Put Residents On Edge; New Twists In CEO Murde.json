The woman who lied about the Duke lacrosse rape, now admitting in public that it was all made up. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"The drone mystery is starting to get out of hand. Donald Trump, the incoming commander-in-chief, is now suggesting to shoot them down if the government truly does not know what's going on. And this is no longer limited to New Jersey anymore. Reported drone sightings are in New York, they're in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. Governors are getting louder. The public wants answers. And the few we got today, they didn't come in a briefing and said they came right here on CNN when the head of Homeland Security came on to try to calm people down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEC. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, HOMELAND SECURITY: We have not seen any unusual activity. We know of no threat. We know of no nefarious activity. It is very common for individuals who think they see drones to actually see small aircraft, and we have a case of mistaken identity. Also, we have six different people reporting what they think is a drone, and all of a sudden, we have reports of six drone sightings. So, there are some duplication. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The reports aren't just coming from online conspiracy theorists and the tin foil hat types either.Take New Jersey Senator Andy Kim. He went out with police last night and posted what they saw. They even used a flight tracker app to help distinguish the drones from the airplanes. They often saw multiple lights at a time at low altitude. The app showed no aircraft nearby. And Kim says they were moving in ways that planes do not. So now, we appear to be in a kind of Jersey pickle. The federal government said it's nothing. State and local officials are not convinced at all. They're launching their own investigations, and they're demanding to hear a whole lot more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

So, this could be that. It doesn't mean that it is, but the maneuvers certainly indicate that A, it's a drone, B, that they're probably on some kind of a reconnaissance mission, and maybe they're practicing a dry run for something.

That is as soon as he gets back and is arraigned, prosecutors have 15 days to get all the discovery. They can get another 30 if it's voluminous, which I think they will do. On the issue of extradition, though, I think, as it stands now, the district attorney is presenting the case to a grand jury. We know, right, Laura, that a grand jury doesn't decide guilt or innocence. They simply decide whether there's reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed and that this defendant committed it. And a simple majority have to do that. And so, that process will play out. Whether he waives extradition is an open question. He has a right to challenge it. And you heard there, D.A. Bragg said he may waive, but have to wait till Tuesday, and that's because any waiver of a fight to be released in New York has to make sure that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly knows he has a right to do that.

But does that mean that he truly spiraled into clinical or legal insanity? I think that is really a stretch. Was he a troubled young man? Is he a troubled bright young man? I definitely believe that is the case. I also highly suspect that he's narcissistic and has delusions of grandeur. I think in his own mind, he's something of almost like a batman character, a vigilante, a do-gooder like -- he seemed to admire Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. So, diminished capacity, possibly. But true clinical or legal mental illness, I think that's a real stretch. COATES: A really good point, just saying that somebody has a psychiatric need is not the legal standard. Can he appreciate the crime that took place? Is he competent to stand trial? These are things that need to also unpack. But Pete, let me get to you here, because the identity tip from the San Francisco Police, how does that tip go from the FBI to the NYPD? Because no one was revealing a name, of course, until after the arrest. And the chief detective said Mangione wasn't even on their radar until that arrest. What's going on here?",

And you have to remember, there's a lot of information coming in these investigations.

There being other indications, Laura, about people, his friends looking for him, he had commitments to a wedding, etcetera.
