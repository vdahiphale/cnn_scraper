If you're facing jail time and your face -- or just telling the truth about what Donald Trump stirred the pot on, I got to figure they're going to be playing a different game than they played post- 2020 election.

It's a way to put an enormous amount of pressure on people to cooperate, to flip, if you will, and become witnesses for the government to explain what happened and how they got involved, who got them involved in the scheme, just directions they got during the course of the conspiracy. So, nobody wants to be on the wrong side of the versus mark. The issue is, for me, I think is you might have some delay in what we would typically expect to see people jumping ship, you know. Like rats jumping off a sinking ship because there are so many unique issues in this case that are going to have to be decided by an appellate court. So, they may be getting some legal advice that said, look, just kind of keep your powder dry for a little while.Let's see if the court actually lets this case proceed. Let's see if it gets transferred to the federal court system. Let's see if there's a question of executive privilege. Let's see if there's First Amendment -- (INAUDIBLE) I mean, all these things have got to be ironed out. So, you know, the rats may stay on the ship a little longer than we usually expect. But at the end of the day, there'll be people flipping.",

As he was leaving the school and being ushered into a car, gunfire rang out. It was at least 12 shots.And all the people who moments before we're cheering him on, had to dive for coverage. Officials say this was a targeted attack against the man who once described his own country as a narco-state run by a political mafia. Authorities say nine people were injured. Villavicencio is 59 -- or was 59 years old. He was an activist journalist and politician who was running in Ecuador's presidential elections to be held in less than two weeks on, August 20. He would frequently speak openly, John, against corruption in his country and had recently said that the mafia has subjugated his homeland. And just to give you an idea of how bad the security situation is in Ecuador, seven of the eight candidates in the election were under police protection. The attack happened less than two weeks before the election. But officials say it will still go on as planned. John, back to you.",

And I'll tell you what's been going on inside in a second but first, about Clarence Thomas himself. He did not respond to the ProPublica story. We have been trying to get a response from him ourselves, and he has not. But I can tell you back in April when a similar story broke. He said early in my tenure at the court, I sought guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends who did not have business before the court was not reportable.But, John, the rules have always made clear that any kind of travel on private jets as you -- as you just put up there, 26 private jet trips, that has always been covered. And other kinds of luxury travel vacations have been covered, you know, depending on if third parties have been paying for them. And you know, they have -- they have a certain limit on what kind of personal gifts they can accept but that's only you know $415 right now. So, arguably, there are plenty of things that should have been disclosed. And I will say that Justice Thomas way back when he first came on the court in the 1990s did disclose some travel. And other justices have disclosed private jet travel over the year. So, that's certainly a gap. But how have the justices responded? I can tell you that every time there's one of these reports, and this one is far more comprehensive than anything we've had before but for other reports of Justice Thomas or Justice Alito, that their colleagues don't discuss them as a group. They don't -- they generally let each other you know, respond as they will see these kinds of private scrutiny. But as a group, they have been talking about a formal ethics code. But the Chief Justice who would like one does not want to do it without unanimity. And right now, they are at an impasse, John.",

But first, here's Dr. Sanjay Gupta with today's \"CHASING LIFE.\"(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's \"CHASING LIFE\" podcast. If you're like many people watching right now, you may feel like your attention span is shorter than it used to be. And you'd probably be right. GUPTA (voiceover): Back in 2004, workers could pay attention to a computer screen for about two and a half minutes. A few years later, that dip to about 75 seconds. And the most recent study found that workers pay attention to a screen for only around 47 seconds before getting distracted. And then it takes about 25 minutes to get back on task. [11:50:18] GUPTA: Now, think about that. The average American spends at least 10 hours a day looking at a screen. That has a lot of lost time. So, what can you do about it? GUPTA (voiceover): Well, the researchers here suggest doing the most repetitive work of your day during the first part of your day, when you're probably the least alert. When you're at peak alertness, for most people that's a little later in the day, do the work that requires the most mental bandwidth.",
