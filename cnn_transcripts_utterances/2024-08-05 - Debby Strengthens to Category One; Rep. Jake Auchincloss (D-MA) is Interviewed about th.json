So, the surge that was forecast from the National Hurricane Center been realized just a couple of feet shy from Hurricane Idalia back in August of 2023. And we all remember how impactful that was for the big bend region. The eye wall making landfall right now. You can see just as that center of the storm actually crosses land, that's when the official landfall will be made near the Steinhatchee region, or just to the points to the northwest. There's a lot of rain associated with this system. Flash flooding already occurring and will continue today and will extend right through the early parts of this work week. We're head - we've got a heads-up hear from Savannah to Charleston, particularly on Tuesday when this system feeds into some Atlantic moisture. We could see a record-setting rainfall total that causes catastrophic flooding. So, a big, big story for us.",

He's a member of the House Select Committee on competition between the U.S. and China. Congressman, always good to have you on the program. Thank you so much for being here. How concerned are you about this broadening into a wider conflict at this tricky moment? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Good morning. Thanks for having me on. Concerned. Since October, the president has been walking a tight rope in the Middle East. On one side, doesn't want to let terrorists win. We have to defend Israel and make sure that freedom and democracy can flourish in that region. On the other side, don't want an all-out war with Hezbollah, with Iran, with proxy terror forces in Iraq or Syria, trying to contain this onto one front. And that fundamental dynamic has not changed, although it's gotten to be an even skinnier and more swaying tight rope in the last couple of weeks here. I think the United States is going to have to continue to be ironclad in its defense of Israel's security. The idea that Israel is somehow culpable right now I think is absurd. Israel assassinated two terrorist masterminds who had spent decades killing Israelis and Americans. And the world is safer because of it. And now we need to work with Israel to ensure their security. We all also need to put pressure on Israel to architect a day of governance strategy in Gaza that is Palestinian lead, and that is consistent with Palestinian security and economic development so that we can get to a negotiated ceasefire and hostage release. That's ultimately going to help cauterize this conflagration.",

And one of the places where this is showing up is in the vice presidential search that Kamala Harris is undertaking right now. The Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, had been considered to be at the top of the list and is now - has been the subject of a number of criticisms in the media from left-wing groups in different instances. There's been a focus, for example, on an old opinion piece that he wrote when he was younger about this issue.I'm wondering who you think Kamala Harris should select her VP, and what you make of the way people are approaching and criticizing Josh Shapiro in this moment?",

Look at those - those numbers on the right for Trump in swing states. This is the model from CBS News. You're seeing a mix of 48 and 50s for Trump in these swing states. We can put up the previous look at this, when Biden was at the top of the ticket, and every single state has Trump above 50 percent, which is, of course, critical.So, this race has changed. In terms of the veepstakes, Pennsylvania, in particular, is one that Josh Shapiro could potentially help with.

That's the fundamental promise to the American people. And then, number two, is to help draw this fundamental contrast between the future and the past. It was Nikki Haley actually who said that the first party to change the top of its ticket was going to win. Democrats did it. Republicans didn't.
