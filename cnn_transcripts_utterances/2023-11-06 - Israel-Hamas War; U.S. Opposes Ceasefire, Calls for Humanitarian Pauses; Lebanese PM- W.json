Appreciate your company.We do begin in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas is about to enter its second month. The Israeli military says it is carrying out what it calls a significant strike right now on the territory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES (voice-over): An IDF spokesperson says the strike was \"very extensive\" and targeted Hamas infrastructure both above and below ground. The IDF also says its soldiers have now reached Gaza's coast in an effort to cut off the northern part of the enclave. In the meantime, communications are down again in the besieged territory. A local operator says there was a complete interruption, Sunday, of its telecom and network services. Aid agencies say they lost contact with their workers as Gaza faces what has been a third communications blackout. All of this as an intense diplomatic push is underway to prevent a wider conflict in the region, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken landing in Turkey a short time ago. And the director of the CIA is also traveling to several countries in the Middle East to meet with \"multiple intelligence counterparts and country leaders.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That's right, Michael. In fact, Israel says that it succeeded in doing so, and that essentially there is now a northern Gaza Strip and a southern Gaza Strip. That's from -- that's what Israel is saying. So it says it's reached the coast and it's fully encircled Gaza City and may even be planning to enter the city in the coming days because it feels that is one of the main centers of Hamas operations. Of course it's trying to kill commanders. It's trying to take out Hamas infrastructure and trying to free some of those 240 or so hostages that were kidnapped on October the 7th. So that's what's happening militarily.And by some accounts, the bombardment that the Gaza Strip was on the receiving end of overnight was the heaviest since October the 7th, since Israel began striking the Gaza Strip in the wake of those Hamas terrorist attacks of October the 7th. And that's really saying something. And so far, the IDF saying that it's hit more than 2,500 targets since the fighting began. And that some 347 Israeli soldiers have fallen. Now, as far as this communications blackout is concerned, it's now been going for more than 12 hours as far as we can tell. This is, as you say, the third communications blackout that the Gaza Strip has suffered. Not only does that impact civilians in terms of their ability to contact loved ones and friends, and family to say if they're safe, or even show that they're alive, both within and outside the Strip, but obviously has an impact on the humanitarian situation as well, especially for those requiring medical attention. And so, we've seen the head of the World Health Organization weigh in and saying that without connectivity, people who need immediate medical attention cannot contact hospitals and ambulances. All channels of communication must be restored immediately. Now, I reached out to the IDF to get some more information on this. They said that they had no comment at this time in those previous blackouts. Service has been restored pretty soon-ish, and one would expect it to be restored soon as well. But as I say, for now, Michael, I'm afraid we don't have any more on that. But, of course, we'll update you as soon as I get more information.",

And I know that some who are against a ceasefire argue that it will help Hamas. However, I feel that in that argument, they are inherently dismissing the death, in fact, even endorsing and justifying the death of thousands of civilians. And that is just morally irreprehensible. It is also short-sighted and not entirely rational because, as I've said before, if you manage to eliminate all of Hamas, what next? The root cause of this conflict is an illegal occupation. It is routine human rights abuses, illegal settlements, disregard to UN resolutions and international law. If we do not address these root causes, then you can kill the combatant but you cannot kill the cause.

I was last in touch with a couple of my colleagues yesterday, but since then the contact has been completely cut off again. They're desperate. They're screaming for international protection. At least 182 health care workers have been killed to date. And they say that they have screamed, they have tried to expose the atrocities that are happening both to the civilian population where they live, but also to them and the facilities where they work to care for this population. And that has been met with silence. I mean, I can quote a pediatric intensive care doctor two days ago who sent this text message saying, unfortunately, we are on our way to collapsing from the horror of the scenes that we see. Despite our strength, it's beginning to fade and the world is watching as if were in a horror movie and the viewers are all silent.

Kalamar said that the rules of war have been obliterated. She's calling for a truce, a ceasefire, a humanitarian pause, whatever it takes to alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza. Stark image there. Well, the fact that the US has been unable to persuade Israel to order even a humanitarian pause in airstrikes is one of the Arab world's greatest gripes with the US right now, and one of the biggest hang-ups during Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meeting with Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. Earlier, I spoke with James Zogby, the President and Founder of the Arab American Institute, about that. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES ZOGBY, PRESIDENT/FOUNDER, ARAB AMERICAN INSTITUTE: I have to say it's comical that the United States is giving 3.8 billion a year. We've requested an additional 14.3 billion from Congress, and we insist on giving it to Israel without conditions. And yet Israel places conditions on us, and we take it. And I was asked by a reporter a couple days ago, what did I think of US policy? And I said, I'm not sure we have a policy in the region right now. I think what we do is, Israel has a policy and we're simply following it and enabling it. And Israel's policy seems to be, I hate to use the word, but it's pathological. They simply want to destroy Gaza. And the idea that they're going to destroy Hamas and do away with it makes as much sense as 1982 when they tried to do away with the PLO and they ended up with Hezbollah, or when they tried to do away with the PLO with Hezbollah in 2006 and they got a stronger Hezbollah, or we tried to get rid of Saddam and we got Iran.
