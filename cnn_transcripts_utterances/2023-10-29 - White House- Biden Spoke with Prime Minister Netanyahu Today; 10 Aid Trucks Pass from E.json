      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. I am Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta alongside my colleague, Jim Sciutto in Israel.Jim, we will get to you in a moment. We begin with the situation on the ground in Gaza, where the humanitarian crisis is growing and there are new warnings about the risk of fighting spilling onto other parts of the Middle East. Earlier today, President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Their conversation comes as US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan warns there is an elevated risk of the conflict expanding into other parts of the region. Sources tell CNN the UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow about Israel's ongoing ground invasion. Israeli troops continue to advance in what officials call the second stage of the war. The IDF says its airstrikes hit more than 450 Hamas targets in just the last day including command centers, observation posts, and missile launch sites. And today, dramatic scenes from Gaza's second largest hospital. The Palestinian Red Crescent says nearby Israeli shelling has caused extensive damage even as 12,000 Gaza civilians are currently sheltering there. Desperation is sinking in for many civilians still trapped across Gaza. The main UN agency there says thousands of people broke into some of its warehouses, stealing critical supplies as the Israeli bombardment continues. At the same time, more humanitarian aid is slowly trickling into Gaza. Today, 10 aid trucks were able to pass through the Rafah border crossing, and communications in Gaza have been partially restored. Let's go to Jim Sciutto on the ground there in northern Israel -- Jim.",

Israeli forces firing back and concerns throughout about ground incursions by Hezbollah fighters.They've tried before in recent days and weeks intercepted by Israeli forces. There were concerns again today. My team and I stopped on a road blocked in both directions as there were concerns of another ground incursion. We've heard those shells flying over our head, as it happened. That's the north. Of course, Israel has been expanding its ground operations in the south, in Gaza, for the last 48 hours, and just outside of Gaza is where we find my colleague, Jeremy Diamond. He is in Ashkelon. Jeremy, I know that our vision inside Gaza is limited, and our sense of the extent of Israeli operations coming in part really from the IDF and what it chooses to tell us about it, but can you give us a picture as to what we know now about those expanded ground operations inside Gaza and how far they've gone into Gaza?",

So I first of all, would like to just dedicate this interview to their memory, it should be for a blessing. What happened on October 7th was as follows. It was a holiday morning, it didn't seem anything out of the ordinary. At around six o'clock, 6:30 in the morning, we begin hearing booms, explosives. At the beginning, I didn't think too much of it because we live here in southern Israel and we're used to flare ups every now and again. I look outside, I see the intensity of the attacks are more than a normal flare up. So I opened up my phone, I called my dispatcher and just to let him know that I'm available if I'm needed for anything, and he tells me immediately report to the station. There are casualties, dead, injured everywhere and more than 300 BSS waiting to be responded to, so I began going to the ambulance station to open up the ambulance. Usually, I work in station a little bit further from my home. I started going there, they ended up calling me and saying don't go to where you normally work because it's under heavy fire. This likely saved my life, because already there were -- the whole city where I normally work was taken over by -- you know, various neighborhoods were taken over by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from the Gaza Strip. Throughout the day, we had nonstop casualties everywhere. Everywhere in the entire southern region -- police officers, civilians of all different ages, soldiers -- it was a day of complete chaos and a day of complete destruction.",

That being said when their own government is forcing them to stay put, even though they're told by the Israeli Defense Forces to move to southern Gaza where they can take refuge while the military, the Israeli Army conducts their military operations in an attempt to rid the Gaza Strip from the iron rule of Hamas. If the Hamas terrorists are forcing him to stay put and are using them as human shields, then any loss of civilian life or any innocent life, as sad as it might be, it is at -- the blood is on the hands of the Hamas terrorists.

I mean, we have been seeing these in many different contexts around the world.So this is why since the beginning, I mean, we have been calling on all the parties, all the stakeholders, all the people who can put pressure on different stakeholders, even at the regional level to make sure that first civilians can reach safety. Second, that humanitarian aid can enter in Gaza Strip in a continuous way, not a couple of trucks every other day. And also third, this is very important to say that under international humanitarian law, civilians are respected if they decide to flee, but also if they decide to stay, because at the end, this needs to be a free decision of every individual.

This sounds like outgoing artillery fire, but earlier today, we were up on the northern border where we heard the incoming from Hezbollah -- the Hezbollah side.

Years ago, Pence was considered one of the most possible and exciting Republicans to become president, and this was a quick fall.So I think it just, you know, confirms the point of where Trump is and where his opponents are.   WHITFIELD:  Okay, let's shift gears to the Democratic race. On the Democratic side, President Biden has a new challenger. On Friday, Minnesota congressman, Dean Phillips announced that he is running against Biden for the Democratic nomination. He's not a household name. So what do you make of his decision to make a primary challenge to Biden?",

Part of it is a message he's been talking about now for some time that Democrats need a choice, a candidate who is younger, a candidate who's from a different generation and who is more popular. And so by entering, he is going to be able to make that statement.But I think it's unclear to many Democrats, frankly, why he is doing this, and he's a Democratic votes pretty loyally with Biden, so it's a younger version of Biden running against Biden himself.",

Cross border fire on Israel's northern border between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters on the other side of the border in Lebanon has been a daily event. In fact, many times a day. My team and I, traveling on the border earlier today found ourselves right in the middle of the crossfire with Israeli forces firing mortars and artillery towards Lebanon, Hezbollah firing artillery back towards Israel. It's a dangerous game up there. Our Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, Lebanon now, and Ben, as you watch this from there, this has been a low-level conflict at the border here but certainly not open war. Do your sources in Lebanon, do officials there expect Hezbollah to expand military activity on the border? Or do they see Hezbollah as largely sitting out of this conflict for now?",
