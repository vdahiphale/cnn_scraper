Any moment, he is expected to announce major U.S. investments in Asia as he is promoting workers' rights globally. But we're going to begin the hour with some breaking news coming out of the Israel- Hamas war. The Israeli army revealing soldiers have just located the body of another hostage.",

The body was located near Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest, which Israeli defense forces just raided yesterday. That raid is ongoing. They're claiming that Hamas was using tunnels beneath it as a command center. Let's get to CNN's Nic Robertson in Sderot, Israel. So, Nick, what do you know about this hostage found dead by the IDF?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. She's a 65- year-old lady, a grandmother, Yehudit Weiss. Her husband, Shmuel, was actually killed on October 7th. The IDF isn't giving any details of the condition of her body or the condition of the structure that she was in. So, we don't understand at the moment how she may have died, the circumstance specifically of the discovery of her body. But we are being told that her body was discovered in a structure close to the Al-Shifa Hospital. So, it does appear that the discovery of her body is connected to the ongoing military operation, the IDF operation at the Al-Shifa Hospital.Obviously, the families of all the hostages are desperate to get information and knowledge about their loved ones. And there's been a concern among many of them that because of Israel's heavy bombardment and because Hamas has been using potentially some of the hostages, as effectively human shields, there was always that worry that some could be killed in these ongoing IDF against Hamas military operations. It's not clear precisely what happened here, but that has been a concern. And Hamas, in their own propaganda that the Israeli government says is in essence just trying to play on the psychological emotions of Israelis, has claimed that a number of hostages have died over the past few weeks. And they blame it on Israel's bombing. There's no evidence to substantiate that. But, of course, this is a terrible, terrible day for Yehudit Weiss's family.",

It does appear as if the IDF will go south of that line now and conduct military operations because they dropped leaflets over Khan Yunus, which is perhaps the biggest population center in the south of the Gaza Strip.Now, obviously, it has much denser population because so many hundreds of thousands of people have moved from the north. And the leaflets are telling people to move. They're telling people to move towards known safe places in the south of the Gaza Strip. And Israel has been designating an area, relatively small area compared to the size of the Gaza Strip, close to the Mediterranean Sea on the western, southwestern side of Gaza as a humanitarian zone. It's not clear if any international aid agencies have been able to provide any provisions in that humanitarian zone. They, at the moment, say they can barely move around because they don't have enough fuel. So quite the location that the IDF would like the civilians to move to and what security they may find there isn't clear. But the very fact they're being told to move out of Khan Yunus indicates the IDF intends to go there.",

      "sentences": "The most horrible news for the family who's been hoping that their grandmother had survived. But it lends credence to Israel's claims that the area under the Shifa Hospital and around had been used by Hamas as some sort of an operational centre, possibly also to hold hostages. The IDF has reported to us that they found a laptop with information on it related to the hostages. Israeli media have been reporting that that's included photos of them.And the search continues within the hospital compound itself to find proof of this underground operation centre that Israel and the White House have been trying to find. The White House has said exists. And further bolstering that are the reports that back in the '80s, Israel actually built, when Israel was in control of the area, built a bunker, a bomb shelter underneath the hospital. So, I guess that's what they're looking for. One Israeli military official tells me they have found signs that Hamas tried to erase that it had been there. BROWN:  But they have released video showing military equipment. But as you point out, the raid is still ongoing. We have some new reporting coming in that the U.S. has intelligence, signals intelligence, meaning they picked up communications between Hamas militants talking about a command hub underneath that hospital. But so far, we have yet to see the concrete proof that it exists. So, does that tell you that while there is that intelligence and they have found some of this military equipment, that they're still looking for that concrete proof that, yes, there was a whole Hamas operation underneath the hospital?",

      "sentences": "It could be very, very easy. It could simply be that the entrances to what they're looking for have been collapsed by Hamas. Israel's been doing the same thing when it finds a tunnel structure rather than sending troops into it. It sets explosive charges that explode the whole area and it maps whatever got exploded. Israel and the U.S. have for years been working on technology to map the tunnel system that Hamas was using. It's bragged about having a tunnel system. It's not just a tunnel system that runs all over Gaza.This also explains why you see Israel moving to another location, Khan Yunis, because they said they're going to root out Hamas. Hamas is everywhere in Gaza. So they're not just going to do northern Gaza.",

And under the laws of war, if there truly was a command centre proven to be under Shifa Hospital, then that negates the area in terms of it being a medical centre and therefore off limits for military operations. That still, though, doesn't relieve Israel from the responsibility to try to protect civilians as it prosecutes the situation.",

Any minute now, we should be hearing him deliver remarks to a group of CEOs. And the White House is saying that there should be new announcements being made about investments that the United States is making in some of these APEC countries. You know, this coming on the heels of the Biden- Xi summit is a really interesting contrast, actually, because it really does sort of represent the ongoing efforts that the Biden administration has been making over the years to really try to nurture and strengthen these alliances that they have with a number of Asian and Indo-Pacific nations.And U.S. officials have been pretty clear all along that those efforts that they are making have a lot and everything really to do with trying to contain China and remain competitive with Beijing. So, at the same time that we are seeing this huge effort to try to, you know, ease tensions between U.S. and China, we are also seeing on this parallel track the Biden administration continuing to make these efforts to remain competitive with China. And we had been told before the summit by U.S. officials that this is something that Chinese officials had been sensitive to, cognizant of basically this reality of a changing competitive landscape.",

In all seriousness, though, a lot of attention being given to, the comments that President Xi made yesterday when he seemed to suggest that it was very possible that China may send additional pandas to the United States. If you are a panda fan, you will know that last month, 3 of the pandas that were housed in the Washington, D.C. zoo, they were sent back to China. And now there are only 4 pandas that remain in the United States.This is what Xi said about pandas. He said they were envoys of friendship, friendship between the Chinese and American people. And the White House today taking this question seriously, they said, look, we would welcome that development were that to happen. If Beijing were to decide to send additional pandas to the United States, White House spokesman John Kirby saying at the same time, we respect the sovereign decision that China made to remove some of those pandas earlier this year.",
