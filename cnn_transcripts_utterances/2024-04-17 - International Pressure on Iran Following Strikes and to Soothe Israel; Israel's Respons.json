The Israelis are on the five-yard line. They can finish that whenever they like. They need to think about how to deter Iran, which, by the way, is on the precipice of a nuclear weapon.",

But there's also -- the potential is they're not, for this thing to really spiral and really get ugly and get, sort of, inflamed in a way that it's going to be very difficult for the International Community to contain it in terms of spillover in the region and just becoming a very messy conflict.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOINT STAFF, PENTAGON, AND FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING, NSA: Yes, that's for sure, Jim. And, you know, one of the key things to remember, this could be a World War I like moment. In other words, where everybody gets together, they get different messages, everything's mixed up, and then all of a sudden you find yourself in a major conflict. So, this is the challenge. You know, Jonathan is right in the sense that this is a, you know, the real war is between Iran and Israel. And it also is a real, you know, pseudo alliance, even a sub-rosa alliance between some of the Sunni- led governments in the region on Israel's side, more or less, against the Shiites in Iran. And that's -- you know, kind of that element is also part of this. So, it's a very combustible situation, and the risk of escalation is extremely high.",

Not really answering the question of what he thinks of the jurors that were selected yesterday.And what we know about them, it's four men, three women. Most of them have college degrees or more. Including on the panel are two lawyers, a school teacher, and the school teacher was unaware that Trump has been charged in the three other cases, and she said that she likes that Trump speaks his mind. There's also a software engineer, an oncology nurse, and the foreman of the jury is a man from Ireland who works in sales. Now, the judge is saying, given how briskly we're moving through this, he thinks that we could have opening statements in this case on Monday. Now, what we expect tomorrow is that the judge will bring in a new panel of 96 jurors, and this process that we saw play out over the past day and a half will continue. They will go through the 42 questions on that questionnaire. The judge will ask if anyone believes they can't be fair and impartial, those will be excused. Then the attorneys for both the prosecution and Trump's team will have a chance to question these jurors 30 minutes each, and then they will begin the process of striking jurors. Now, Trump speaking out on a social media post today, making -- complaining about this process, saying that he thought he had an unlimited number of strikes. That's not true. There is a 10 strikes per party based on the law for what he was charged with. And the judge reiterated that during a hearing earlier this year where Trump was in attendance. Now, both the prosecution and defense have already used six strikes. So, they each have four more. So, the judge is thinking that that is very possible over the next two days, we will be able to see this jury and they're looking for 12 jurors and at least six alternates, Jim.",

He saw the big sections of the 787 fuselage being joined together. And he says the gaps in those pieces are simply too big, which creates stress and wear which could lead to fatigue failure over time. Now, Boeing insists there is no evidence of that in the 16 years that the 787 has been flying, there are about 1,100 flying worldwide. None launched to a crash. Salehpour was on NBC ahead of this hearing, and he takes this accusation one step further. Here is the section of that interview in which he says the 787 is at risk of falling out of the sky.

But if you look at the drop since the high on March 26th, that's a more than 60 percent drop in valuation there, you can see that graph right there of how much that has gone out. That's billions of dollars wiped out. And remember, the former president is the majority stakeholder in this company. He owns 60 percent of the stock. And so, he -- he's net worth just from yesterday plunged something like $300 million.Now it's still worth something. It's still worth $3 billion. And even though this has a sky-high valuation, it is struggling to make money and it needs cash. And there's a question of how much of this stock is just meme stock. It's people who are buying into it because of emotions or because they are betting on it versus the actual value. Now, the company is trying to add value by announcing this new streaming service. They've been a bit light on the details. They say they haven't said who was going to be on this. What kind of -- if there are specific shows. All they're saying so far, it's going to be about content that is at risk of being canceled or has been canceled and will span everything from news to religious to family friendly film and documentaries.
