Will those with the power to agree to a ceasefire even entertainment it? I'll talk to the men behind the proposal, Ehud Olmert and Nasser al- Kidwa.

Why will a two-state solution proposed this time work when it didn't in 2000, when it didn't -- when Ehud Olmert proposed it to Abu Mazen.So why is this plan different from the other plans? NASSER AL-KIDWA, FORMER PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY FOREIGN MINISTER: I think we need to be clear about what we have in hands. This is not a plan, not a comprehensive plan, but this is very important mutual proposal on the most important three issues in hands namely the situation in Gaza, the war in Gaza, and need for immediate cessation. And the political solution in the form of the two states as well as the future of Jerusalem. Now, to answer your questions, why it might work this time while it did not work in the past, the answer might be simple because of the war, because I believe that the people on both sides have become tired of the war and they want to see an end of the war and a substitute to the war. So what is the substitute? The substitute is what we said in our mutual proposal in terms of ending the war and the meaning of the ceasefire, the release of all hostages, the release of the agreed number of Palestinian prisoners. The full withdrawal of the Israeli troops. The establishment of a governmental body in the form of a transitional council of commissioners in Gaza that is organically linked to the Palestinian Authority. We don't want to create any different entities in the West Bank. On the contrary, we want to maintain the territorial integrity and the unity of the Palestinian people. You know, there is an alternative to war that we can do it together in a different way, that we don't need to go the same path of killing, of maiming people, of bloodbath that we see in Gaza. We have to end that. And the alternative is definitely the road of debate. The road of reconciliation. The road of a political solution. And yes, two states, Israel and Palestine, based on the mutual recognition on the basis of 1967 borders with, by the way, the territorial solution that was proposed by Prime Minister Olmert, the 4.4 percent of the territory that is to be exchanged in this swap between the two states.",

It was there in 2000, maybe it was there when you were proposing it, but today, I mean, if you look at by any indication the left of the Israeli political spectrum essentially has vanished. I mean, Labour is down to three seats.If you look at what the Knesset did when they passed a resolution that said there will be no two-state solution, that was voted for by many more members than Bibi Netanyahu's coalition. A very thumping majority of the Knesset voted for it. I think only eight people voted against. So at this moment, it feels like, you know, Israel is just not going to go for a two-state solution.",

You know, I always thought before I was prime minister, while I was prime minister, when I worked with other prime ministers and watch world leaders that the ultimate measure for great leadership is the ability when the time comes to do the opposite of everything that you ever promised to do, because this is what needs to be done now. This is what Menachem Begin did when he pulled out entirely from Sinai. This is what Ariel Sharon did when he pulled out entirely from Gaza.This is not what Netanyahu is going to do because he's not a great leader. He is not Churchill, and he's not Roosevelt and he's not even Chamberlain. And I'm afraid that none of the possible contenders in the state of Israel presently are capable of taking this decision because none of those people in different positions are prepared to do that which looks to be unpopular at the moment, but which is the only possible way to change lives.",

The rancor and chaos brought about the Colfax massacre, a racist massacre, which left at least 150 Black men dead. Dana Bash joins me now. Welcome, Dana.

It was racism. It was the south, which is -- was still reeling from losing the Civil War, trying to hold our grasp on the notion that Blacks should not be as equal in society as they. And they realized in the first couple of elections after the Civil War, during reconstruction, that they could easily -- Blacks could easily get more rights with the simple power of the vote.

Those four states in 1876.So, by the time the Congress had to deal with it they had to throw those votes out from those four states, and they had a tie in the Electoral College. And it was decided then that the vice president's role was only ceremonial, that he could not make choices.
