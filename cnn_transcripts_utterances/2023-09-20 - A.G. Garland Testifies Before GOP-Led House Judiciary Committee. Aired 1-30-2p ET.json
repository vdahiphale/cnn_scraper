We are referring to the president's son. He got a sweetheart deal. And the judge was smart enough to smell a rat when she saw it and she said, you guys go back to the drawing board. That same special counsel is in charge of this investigation. Isn't that correct, Mr. Chairman? Absolutely. I want to close real quickly with this. There was a World Naked Bike Ride in Madison, Wisconsin, just a couple months ago. I sent you a letter two months ago asking if you had a problem with that because it exposed a 10-year-old girl, by the race organizer, the bike organizers to peddling around Madison, Wisconsin naked. Do you think that's a problem? And why did you not answer our letter from two months ago?",

I directed the department to develop a strategy for responding to that. Thirty days later, that was pretty much coincident with Congress' passage of the Covid No Hate Act. And we have now fulfilled, I think, all of the obligations under that act. We have task forces set up to investigate and prosecute hate crimes both as hate crimes and where they satisfy the requirements as domestic violence extremism or as domestic terrorism. We have brought dozens of cases against people who have made these threats as well as in particular those who have attempted to carry them out. And as you know, we have a prosecution pending in Buffalo with respect to the horrendous killing of black Americans in the TOPS Grocery Store by an avowed white supremacist.",

I represent El Paso, Texas, a community right on the U.S./Mexico border. And so we have been witnessing firsthand the abuses at the hands of Governor Greg Abbott through Operation Lone Star, which began in 2021. He, Governor Abbott has deployed state resources and Texas National Guard members to the state's border with Mexico. And Operation Lone Star has created border management challenges. It's resulted in countless humanitarian and due-process violations for migrants. It's harmed guardsmen assigned to the mission. It's cost the state billions of dollars. And it has completely undermined the federal government's authority over immigration. I sent you a letter, my colleagues and I, a Democratic congressman from Texas sent you a letter in July about Abbott's floating barriers. I know that is now going -- that case is going through appeal. But we have also learned that the National Guard shot -- a guardsman shot at a Mexican national across the Rio Grande. And in September, on September 1st, I sent you a letter asking that the DOJ investigate that. We also know that Governor Abbott -- we've learned from whistleblowers that he has ordered National Guardsmen to prevent migrants from turning themselves in to CBP. Has ordered that they push back people into Mexico. And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to -- unanimous consent to enter the record an \"El Paso Times\" article from earlier this year, \"Texas National Guard Orders Hundreds of Asylum Seekers on U.S. Territory Back into Mexico.\"",
