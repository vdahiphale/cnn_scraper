Any minute now, we expect to hear from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as an unprecedented wave of protests and strikes consuming is Israel, leaving it on the brink of a shutdown, the mass demonstrations in opposition to his proposed judicial reforms. We will be bringing you the latest. But, first, we have breaking news out of Nashville, Tennessee. Police there saying an active shooter is dead at a private Christian elementary school. We are learning that multiple patients, law enforcement says, multiple patients are being treated. CNN's Amara Walker has been tracking this fast-developing story. Amara, another horrific shooting in America. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, listen, it's always heartbreaking, but it's starting to feel routine, unfortunately, right, because we're constantly, feels like, reporting about a school shooting in this country.We don't have much. But, as you said, multiple patients is what we are getting from Nashville Fire. We are expecting local law enforcement to give the media an update on the situation, as we are told it is an active scene. Some new information we are learning is that the FBI -- this is according to CNN's Nick Valencia -- the FBI has deployed agents to assist in this active shooter investigation. The gunman is dead, as you said. Apparently, he or she had engaged with police. We don't know the circumstances surrounding that, but, again, the most important thing, and I'm sure the thing that most people care about, are these victims. We don't know the extent of their injuries. We don't know if they're students, staff, faculty, but we are learning right now that three children have died as a result of the shooting. We are getting this. Is this from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center? This is the information that we're getting right now. The Nashville Medical Center has confirmed that three children have died, Alex, just heartbreaking. We don't know how old they are, but clearly they were the victims of what was a shooting event inside their small school. This is the Covenant School, a private Christian school, Alex, for pre-K through sixth graders. The Web site says that the average enrollment is a around 200, and the teacher -- student-to-teacher ratio is about 8-1. So this goes to show that this has to be a very tight-knit, small community. And right now there is an area for parents to go to try to reunify with their children, and that also has to be a terrifying situation for parents showing up, giving their names of their children to police, and waiting for information on whether their children or not were victims in this shooting event. So, again, three children tragically have died as a result of the shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, Alex.",

Amara and I just learned that news as she was speaking right after the top of the hour.We do know that this attack at this private school, as Amara was saying, happened just a few hours ago. We have been waiting for more details. We have just gotten the tragic breaking news that three young students from this school in Nashville, Tennessee, have been killed, as Amara just noted. This is a school that has pre-K through sixth grade. So those children, we do not know their ages right now. But they could be very young, three children and the gunman killed after this school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, just a short time ago. Amara, we know that you will stay on top of all of the details that are coming in to CNN, and we will be back with you very soon. But, in the meantime, I want to bring in CNN law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe. Andrew, thank you for joining us. You have been on with me, with so many of our colleagues so many times in the wake of these shootings. I do want to start with this news that three of the victims are young students from this school, again, the school pre pre-K through sixth graders. What is your first reaction when you hear that this was at this private school with young students and that three of the victims are young children?",

Could have been -- could have been a student. We have had -- we had a 6-year-old in Virginia just in January who brought a gun to school and shot his teacher. Could be someone who was on staff or on faculty. Could be someone who's related to a student or a staff or faculty member. But there will -- there's likely some connection between the shooter and the school. How they ever landed at this their plan for what they were going to do today, that's for the investigators to try to determine. And to do that, they will be doing all the same things they do after every one of these mass shootings. It'll be really tearing into that person's life as much as they can to understand what they may have been going through, what they may have written or said or posted on social media, what they might have told friends or family members, things that people around them may have observed in the lead-up to this situation, because, quite frankly, Alex, we have to get better at trying to figure out who these people are. Because we have so few other recourses to better protect our children and our society and our safe spaces, spaces that are supposed to be safe across this country. MARQUARDT:  All right, Andrew McCabe, stay with me. We are learning more. We have just heard from the daughter of one of the teachers at this school in Nashville speaking about when she learned about this horrible shooting earlier today. Let's take a listen.

They might not have the answers to all those questions yet. But that's certainly foremost in people's minds, and then about the victims.I mean, we understand that there are three innocent children who've been killed. And the shooter himself, of course, his or herself, is also dead. And how is the local community preparing to support this group of victims, family members, and parents and fellow students who are going to have a really tough, tough, tough experience to try to navigate over the next days and months and years, really? And, Alex, it will be very routine. you will see police officers and first responders say the same sorts of things we have seen time and time again in pretty much every state around the country. And it seems to be happening at a greater rate this year. So we need to be prepared for it.",

Is there any reason to think that the country has reacted in any way to this rash, this plague of mass shootings, particularly in schools? [13:10:18] MCCABE:  Well, Alex, there are definitely some folks on the Hill in our national government who are dedicated to trying to make a difference, at least in terms of availability of firearms. And we have made some progress on that in the last year, although I have to say those accomplishments are very minor, compared to the size and scope of this problem. If you look back across the trajectory of this, if you go back to Sandy Hook a little over 10 years ago, the fact is, we really haven't done the things that we could do to be more responsible about how we control access to firearms. Nobody's -- nobody's saying getting rid of firearms or any of that sort of stuff. We have a Second Amendment in this country that protects that right for people. But there are many ways we could administer that more responsibly, by doing background checks in a more complete and better fashion, by keeping guns out of the hands of children and people who are really struggling with issues that might lead them to a place to resort to violence. And on those major issues, major points, Alex, we see very, very little progress.",

In addition to the three children who were killed, we're also getting reports that two adults have also been killed, so five victims so far in the shooting, plus the shooter.So that is a death toll of six so far. We don't know, I'm told, whether the two adults include the shooter, but the total death toll so far, Andrew is five. Would you expect it -- I imagine there is an expectation that this death toll could continue to rise, and that we may learn -- learn have more who are killed in this upcoming press conference.",

And as that work continues, it's always possible to find additional victims, additional casualties and fatalities.

So, we went in as soon as it was safe for our responders to do so to try to provide lifesaving efforts for those that were impacted by this incident and this tragedy. Our crews were able to be on scene to pull out those that had viable signs of life, those that were still showing the option for -- to be saved. And we did make transport of three individuals and -- three children and then two adults that were taken from the scene. Our crews then set up a reunification unit. That reunification unit is at 2100 Woodmont Boulevard. That's where parents can go to be reunited with their children. All of the remaining students were able to be escorted out of the building with faculty and staff. We're not sure about the processes that they had in place, but we were on scene to help them mitigate anyone from seeing exactly what else was going on. But we're sure that they heard the chaos that was surrounding this. So we do have mental health specialists and professionals that are at that reunification site for both the students and the families that are going to be affected by this today. Our OEM units were able to provide buses to make transport from the Covenant School to the reunification site. We had one bus that carried 74 students and faculty staff members to the unification -- reunification site and an additional bus that had 34 students on them. So all of those persons were carried. It was difficult for us to kind of identify who was just there as part of staff or the church vs. who was there for the school, because it's all housed in one building. But at this time, we were able to get that number of persons transported out of the building and into that reunification site. So that is where parents can go to be reunited with their students. There is a hot line being set up for parents to call. But, right now, that is where they should go, 2100 Woodmont Boulevard, which is Woodmont Baptist Church. Additionally, we do have a debriefing site set up for on-staff -- or personnel who are working this incident. And there are mental health professional setup there for them as well. There was one police officer that was injured with a hand injury as a result of making an attack on this incident. But, other than that, there have been no additional injuries to first responders or personnel responding to this.
