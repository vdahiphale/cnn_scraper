The markets and the main events. One of the big events that we're talking about as well, a Special Counsel to investigate President Biden's potential misuse of classified documents.

We are live in New York. It is Thursday, January the 12th. I'm Richard Quest, I mean business. Good evening, a legal bombshell unfolded today at the White House where a Special Counsel is set to investigate whether President Biden mishandled classified documents. The Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the news only hours ago, not long after the President himself confirmed that documents from his time as Vice President were found in both his home and his personal office.

Now there are big differences. You can see there, Donald Trump has hundreds. There is barely a couple of dozen for Joe Biden, the level of top secret, one cooperates, the President is cooperating, the former President didn't. And in one case, the lawyers actually found and did it themselves; meanwhile, Donald Trump's team basically falls every step of the way. Does that make a difference in terms of how it is been handled? Our reporter, Kevin Liptak is in Washington. He joins me now. We're waiting for the White House. They can't be pleased by this.",

White House officials had been bracing for this over the last couple of days, in some way seems like an inevitability. But you know, some Biden allies are trying to find a silver lining in this. They say it will be short term pain, but in the long term, President Biden will be vindicated, that the Special Counsel will not find any ill-intent in these hoarding of classified documents. And that in the end, when you compare Special Counsel to Special Counsel, the Special Counsel for President Trump and the Special Counsel for President Biden, President Biden will come out of it looking a lot better because his team cooperated with the Justice Department. But still, there are a lot of unanswered questions that the White House hasn't answered, that the President's lawyers haven't answered, specifically, how did these documents get from the White House when he was leaving as Vice President to these two locations? Who specifically packed up the boxes? Who moved them to the President's house? Now that there is a Special Counsel investigation underway, it seems exceedingly unlikely that those questions will go unanswered, at least until the duration of this investigation. And so, we are waiting for the Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre to come out and speak to reporters, but I would not expect her to really be all that forthcoming about what she knows and what the President and his lawyers know now that they have this cover of the Special Counsel investigation to refer to.",

Whether or not the Special Counsel at the end of this comes out with any wrongdoing, I think for now, the public sees the Justice Department having identified something that went wrong in the White House. And for a President or any politician, that is never a good thing, particularly when you look back at their recent history. President Trump subject to Special Counsel Robert Mueller for potential ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign; now a Special Counsel investigating former President Trump for his handling of classified documents. So in the public mind, I think the phrase Special Counsel means something, and certainly President Biden's aides know that and knew that going into today. We do see Karine coming out here now. Yes.",

I just want to say a couple of things and make sure that everyone saw this. It's a statement from Richard Sauber. His statement reads: \"As the President said, he takes classified information and materials seriously, and as we have said, we have cooperated from the moment, we informed the Archives that a small number of documents were found and we will continue to cooperate.\" \"We have cooperated closely with the Justice Department throughout its review and we will continue that cooperation with the Special Counsel. We are confident that a thorough review will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the President and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovering of this mistake.\" With that, my colleague is here, John Kirby to talk through the bilat tomorrow and also with Japan Prime Minister, and also the bilat with the Prime Minister of Netherlands next Tuesday, and then I'll come back.",

And they're essentially making that clear. The word \"cooperate,\" though, is important, because it is such a distinction from what's going on with former President Trump who is now also being investigated for obstruction based on his unwillingness to hand over some of these documents. So even as they are unwilling to lay out exactly the parameters of what exactly happened, they do want to make this distinction, and they do see that as sort of their advantage heading into this Special Counsel's investigation.",

Now, the fire has clearly not been put out, but it does seem like it is more and more getting under control, 6.5 percent year-over-your inflation, of course that's not healthy. It's not good, but everything is relative. As you mentioned, six straight months of cooling inflation. This is the lowest rate that we've seen in 14 months. So that is encouraging. I think the officials at the Fed are going to be very happy to see that month-over- month, inflation actually declined. Consumer prices were down. We haven't seen that since this inflation crisis began. We know that food prices are still high. Shelter prices are high, that is painful, but it does feel like things are moving in the right direction here -- Richard.",

If we could put the big board back up on the screen. You know, US stocks up pretty solidly today and markets are betting that the Fed is going to once again slow the pace of interest rate hikes. At last check, the futures market is pricing in a 90 percent chance of a 25-basis-point interest rate hike, and that is up significantly from yesterday, from a week ago, from a month ago.

Now if you get into some of the detailed mechanics of how these numbers are put together by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is going to take some time for that to show up. But we know that we're going to see cooler shelter prices and inflation. The area that concerns me is what we call non-shelter services. So things like education, healthcare, travel. That's where you may need to see more restriction from the Fed or at least the level of restriction that they're talking about it. I'll tell you what's going on in financial markets today, is the markets are not just saying, Oh, the Fed is going to hike 25 basis points in February.

That's the kind of logic that the market will work with, and that the public will work with and say, is this a Fed that is really committed to bringing down inflation? So that's why I -- you know, I completely understand the point that is being made.

Sports continue to post pretty good profits right now. And so if I had to say, which is doing well and which is not, streaming is letting investors down, it's not profitable.
