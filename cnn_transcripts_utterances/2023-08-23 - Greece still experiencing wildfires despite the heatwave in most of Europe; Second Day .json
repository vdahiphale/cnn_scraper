Seven countries are under red heat warnings, the highest alert possible in Europe.More than 100 extreme heat records were broken on Tuesday in France, with some areas registering more than 43 degrees Celsius. Officials have warned residents to keep a close watch on the elderly, young children and others to protect them from the heat. Here's how residents are coping.

So over 100 records set or tied across France on Tuesday. In fact, across France were under heat related alerts. Those red alerts. So we had 43.5 degrees across southern France on Tuesday.

Milan at 37 will drop just a couple of degrees by Friday. Madrid hitting 40 degrees. Madrid will actually, though, start to fall below normal by Sunday. So temperatures really warm Wednesday, Thursday and even Friday, but then we start to drop by the weekend even to below normal values. So Rome 36, 37 degrees Wednesday and Thursday, and then temperatures really fall once again, Monday and Tuesday with the help of some showers and even thunderstorms in the forecast. Moving over to the U.S., this has been a steady trend across the summer, the excessive heat anywhere from the Gulf Coast all the way up to the upper Midwest will we have heat alerts in place.

He comes home, of course, with the promise, the commitment by two countries, the Netherlands and Denmark, to provide F-16s. Greece will also participate in the training there. There were talks in Greece around the transport of grain as well, which is something that Ukraine is now carefully looking at after the collapse of that grain deal. But I think political support was also a key factor here. This is a moment in the conflict coming up to the 18-month mark, with the counteroffensive moving relatively slowly. The fear of fatigue setting in political circles is clearly ever-present. So I think for Zelenskyy to be able to come home with all of this support is something that will definitely help morale in Ukraine. And that he can use to show that the Western backers are still very much behind Ukraine.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They're never seen and heard fire only once. Their targets just drop. Ukraine's elite sniper unit from the security services, the SBU, are usually invisible. Like the U.S. Delta Force, chosen for fitness and intelligence. Unlike Delta, fighting for their homeland survival for nearly 18 months. They gave CNN a rare interview as they honed their sniper scopes to broadcast the damage they say they've been doing to Russian front lines. It's sniper terror, he says. That's when we hit every target we spot. It demoralizes them and kills their will to do anything against us. But it's not always one-sided. Five weeks ago, they stumbled at night into a Russian recon group. We were in the gray zone between our lines, the commander says, using a guide from another unit. But we ran into a Russian assault group doing pretty much the same thing as us, moving towards our front position. We opened fire. Our guide was wounded. We suppressed them, pulled him out, called in artillery, and then watched them fall back with their wounded. They do not always escape. Sasha knows that too well. I've lost many people, he says. The best ones leave us first. His upper lip folds in slightly from an injury when a large shell hit his chest, legs, and face last March. It was unpleasant, he says, but I had 16 operations to rebuild my bones and teeth, and I got back into the fight. Western help has kept them afloat, they say. This anti-armor Barrett sniper rifle, a donation used so often that its suppressor has come loose and detaches. These machines and men, working at a tempo they were probably not designed for. They know why they are here though. My son is growing up, Sasha says. He's little, but he already trains, already knows who the enemy is, and that is Russia, hoping each single shot brings Russian defeat closer. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.

Officials say they were traveling to school Tuesday when one of the cables snapped, leaving them stuck. They were finally rescued after a 14-hour ordeal. But as CNN's Ivan Watson reports, it was not an easy task for the rescuers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A lone cable car hangs 900 feet over a ravine in a mountainous region of Northwest Pakistan, with six children and two teachers trapped inside. The students between ages 10 and 15 were on their way to school Tuesday when one of the cables snapped, leaving the car dangling by a single cable over the valley below. Officials say that the cable car had done multiple trips Tuesday before the cable broke partway through its journey. It was a race against time to save the passengers who were said to have no drinking water, two of them reportedly slipping in and out of consciousness. Pakistan's military scrambled to help save the group. But initial rescue attempts by helicopter failed, after strong winds made the car too unstable. A large crowd on the mountainside watched in horror as the cable car was left tilted at a steep angle. Rescue personnel were able to give the passengers nausea medication after getting reports of the children vomiting. One child was also given heart medication, according to officials. The crowd cheered with joy as a special forces officer hanging from a helicopter carried one of the students safely away from the valley. Several hours later, another two children were brought down with the help of local zip liners. One of the trapped teachers, aged 20, called a local broadcaster from the cable car. UNKNOWN (through translator): The authorities should rescue all of us as soon as possible. The cable broke off. WATSON (voice-over): The situation grew dire as light fell, and authorities were forced to pause helicopter rescues. So, a makeshift stretcher was connected to a pulley. Soldiers and locals worked together, desperately pulling on the ropes until another student was brought down. And then another. Their efforts finally paid off. After more than 14 hours, all eight passengers were brought to safety, a harrowing ordeal for children just trying to go to school. (on-camera): Now, some important context here. In some of these remote mountainous parts of Pakistan, these types of cable cars are a way to get around. They tend to be privately owned. They can make a dramatic difference for people trying to get from, one across a very steep valley. But again, they're privately owned and they've had safety issues in the past. As recently as December of last year, there were local media reports in Pakistan of another cable car that got stranded. Fortunately, 12 children on board that were successfully rescued. The interim prime minister in Pakistan has now called for a safety review of all of these cable cars. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
