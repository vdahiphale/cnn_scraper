The Israeli army released this video that it says shows preparations for the ground operation. The U.S. says Israel informed it of a number of operations, including the ground incursion. And a National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN that the mission can be a risk and the White House will keep discussing that with the Israelis. Meanwhile, there have been new airstrikes in Beirut's southern suburbs. You can see smoke rising into the air in this video from CNN crews in the city.

Miscalculating Israeli reaction and miscalculating their own allies lack of support. So the situation today is grim in Lebanon with a limited, quote, unquote, incursion or operation.

We know that very often what the Israelis are conducting are war crimes.But the real question is what we as Lebanese should have done. We as government, in terms of preparedness, in terms of knowing where people from area A should go to area B in case of attacks or Israeli warnings, knowing what type of preparedness for the medical sector should be prepared rather than just being left on their own. And also level of -- and also knowing why the Israeli government is conducting such attacks. The fact that Hezbollah completely miscalculated what the Israeli response would be thinking that it could actually maintain a level of operations that is relatively limited, that would prevent Israeli attacks, thinking that the international community will prevent Israel from attacking and thinking that Iran will support it more effectively are miscalculations that are as lethal to the Lebanese people as the Israeli criminal attacks and aggression over us.

It doesn't make it any better.I definitely hope that the Israeli, both the military aspect of it, is to go in and directly attack the Radwan Hezbollah forces. Those are the trained commando forces that have fought in Lebanon. That have fought in Syria, that have been trained and armed by Iran that have lots of different weapons. That were preparing to do what they called \"Operation Liberation of the Galilee\". So in that sense, when I listen to that it's listening to the United States and its understanding that Israel in its own way, and I know this isn't a popular way to look at it, Israel has been very restrained over the last 11 months because of both U.S. involvement, because of diplomacy, trying to go step up with (INAUDIBLE) with the possibility of diplomacy. And I say sadly for all of the diplomats, that I don't know any diplomat that's going to dislodge the Radwan forces. Becky: Benjamin Netanyahu was warned that the long arm of the Israeli military will extend to wherever Israel's enemy is based. And Miri, there is no doubt that the assassinations of key figures in Hezbollah, including the longtime head Hassan Nasrallah, are strategically significant.

It's not just against Hezbollah, and the Hezbollah capabilities in Lebanon. And I'll remind you also in Syria, Hezbollah is deployed also in Syria. This is also about the benefactor and the backer of Iran. It's about deterrence. So when you look that step further, when you don't just talk and you take action that has an impact in the Middle East, that action itself has to be effective. The action itself has to be targeted against those terrorists. Hezbollah is going to say lots of things. They put out little clips and little posters, every single thing that they do, they're very proud of what they do. They're not going to put out now of what we're doing in that sense, they're going to show it from their perspective. And I think that what Israel needs to do is not only impact their military capability, but also impact the way that we look at the threats in this area because at the end, it's about regional deterrence. It's not about destroying the other side. It's about achieving a type of deterrence where we're not the underdog, we're not the one under attack you.

Shigeru Ishiba is a former defense minister and longtime member of parliament. He was voted to leave the ruling Liberal Democratic Party last week after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's decision to step down. Ishiba will have a lot on his plate on day one, unveiling a new cabinet, and getting his party ready for snap elections later this month. And CNNs Hanako Montgomery joins me now, live from Tokyo. Good to see you, Hanako. So how tight was this race and what problems does Ishiba inherit from the previous administration?",

      "sentences": "Hi Rosemary, it's good to see you.Now this was again, as you described, a very hotly contested and tight race. On Friday during the Liberal Democratic Party's election for their new party president, we saw Shigeru Ishiba up against eight candidates, but really two other front-runners. The first Sanae Takaichi (ph), who is more of a hardline conservative and someone who prides herself in being a former Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe's protege. And now if she were elected, she would have been Japan's first woman prime minister. Ishiba was also up against Shinjiro Koizumi, who comes from a political dynasty in Japan and someone who positioned himself as more of a reformer. And now, if he were elected, he would have been Japan's youngest prime minister ever. But as we saw on Friday, the party and party-registered voters chose Shigeru Ishiba to be the new president of the Liberal Democratic Party. And also the new Japanese prime minister. Now Shigeru Ishiba is known as a former defense minister and someone who's done a lot of work in rural revitalization. Of course, that is a very big problem in Japan because of the demographic crisis that it faces. And he's actually quite well liked by the general public because of this. But within his own party, he actually struggles with a lot of unpopularity. He's seen as more of a harsh critic and someone who once betrayed his own party when the LDP lost power very briefly. Now, Ishiba, of course, despite these issues was able to secure enough votes to become the president of the LDP. Clearly, lawmakers saw him as the best choice to lead the party in the general elections, which will be held in October. Now, Ishiba, as you mentioned Rosemary, does inherit a couple of very large problems from now, the former Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. The first is a lackluster economy and a very high cost of living for many people in Japan. And the second is very big and significant political scandals. And that's actually why we saw from the Fumio Kishida having to step down because he was unable to address these political scandals properly. That's what led to his approval rating drop so significantly among the general public. So Ishiba will now be tasked with actually regaining the public's trust, showing the public that the Liberal Democratic Party is the party that will unify the country and actually introduce a lot of policies and laws that will benefit all people, Rosemary.",
