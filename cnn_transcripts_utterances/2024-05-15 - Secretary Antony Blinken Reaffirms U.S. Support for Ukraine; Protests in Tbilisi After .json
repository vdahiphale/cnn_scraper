The bombs are launched from Russian airspace, but Ukraine's air defense systems do not have the capability to intercept glide bombs, and Ukraine cannot use U.S. anti-aircraft weapons due to restrictions imposed by the White House. Authorities in Kharkiv say at least 21 people were wounded, includingthree children in one glide bomb attack. Apartment blocks, a school, a shopping center, other buildings were damaged in the strikes. Nearly 8,000 people have been evacuated from Kharkiv in recent days as Russian forces ramp up their cross-border attacks, ceasing towns and villages near the northern frontlines. Meantime, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken continues his visit to Kyiv, where he's once again reaffirming Washington's support after U.S. took months to approve a $60 billion military aid package. Blinken will meet with Ukraine's foreign minister in the coming hours. Earlier he sat down with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday discussing the war and the new military aid package.

You went on TikTok and called me a crying little expletive just before the trial began, nodding in agreement, Cohen said, sounds like something I would say. Trying to frame the witness as motivated by revenge, Blanche questioned Cohen about something he said on his podcast in October 2020. I truly, expletive, hope Donald Trump ends up in prison.Blanche pressed Cohen on how he continues to defy prosecutors' request to stop talking about the case. Is it fair to say prosecutors have repeatedly asked you to stop publicly commenting on this case? Yes, Cohen replied. Blanche noted that Cohen profits from his relentless attacks on Trump and on his podcast wore a shirt showing Trump behind bars. And you were encouraging people to buy it, Blanche asked. Yes, it's part of the merch store, said Cohen. Blanche asked if on his podcast, Cohen called Trump a boorish cartoon misogynist and a Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain. That also sounds like something I said, Cohen admitted. He was then asked if he was obsessed with Trump. I wouldn't say obsessed. I admired him tremendously. Before he faced off with Trump's attorneys, prosecutors walked Cohen through the documents at the heart of the criminal case. 11 checks he says he received totaling $420,000 after submitting 11 falsified invoices marked for legal services. Were any of those checks in fact for work during the months described in those check stubs, prosecutor asked. No, ma'am, he responded. All part of the alleged conspiracy to pay Cohen back the $130,000 in hush money he personally paid to Stormy Daniels. He also described how his relationship with Trump unraveled as he came under federal criminal investigation and ultimately decided to break with Trump and plead guilty to multiple charges in 2018. Cohen recalled how he felt after the FBI searched his home, office and hotel room in 2018. How to describe your life being turned upside down, concerned despondent, angry? Cohen described a conversation he had with Trump after the FBI's search, the last time he says they ever spoke. He said to me, don't worry, I'm the president of the United States. There's nothing here. Everything is going to be OK. Stay tough. You're going to be OK. Cohen said, I was scared. I wanted some reassurance that Mr. Trump had my back especially as this dealt with issues that related to him. He credited a conversation with his family, which he says convinced him to finally turn on Trump and begin telling the truth. My wife, my daughter, my son all said to me, why are you holding onto this loyalty? What are you doing? We're supposed to be your first loyalty. Cohen said, I made a decision based again on the conversation I had with my family, that I would not lie for President Trump anymore. (END VIDEOTAPE) REID (on-camera): Cohen will be back on the stand Thursday, the last day of court this week. And the next week, the defense is expected to put on a few witnesses and their clients going to need to decide, does he want to take the stand?

The Western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia seem to be the worst affected. Tens of thousands of hectares have been scorched. One of the fires, driven by strong winds, is now approaching the town of Fort McMurray. NA number of neighborhoods have been forced to evacuate. Fire crews were pulled from the fire lines because of safety concerns, and the battle has been from the air for the most part. And in Indonesia, more than 50 people have died after torrential rain triggered flash floods over the weekend. The floods brought with it cold lava flow from a nearby volcano. That forced nearly 3,400 residents to evacuate. Cold lava is a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles which flows down a volcano's slopes during wet weather. More now from CNN's Lynda Kinkade. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR (voice-over): Roza Yolanda sits on a hospital bed. She's covered in cuts and bruises head to toe. The recent college graduate tells Reuters she was at home Saturday, texting her sister about the heavy rain outside. Moments later, she heard a thundering noise. ROZA YOLANDA, FLOOD SURVIVOR (through translator): Suddenly, the lights went out, and the water rushed in. I didn't have time to stand up, and I no longer had time to run and was just washed away by the flood. KINKADE (voice-over): Flash floods triggered by torrential rains in Indonesia's West Sumatra province have left dozens dead and missing. Mudslides and cold lava flow from volcanic eruptions, a mixture of rock, sand, water, and volcanic ash, adding to the level of devastation, inundating roads and sweeping away homes, trapping victims or sending them into nearby rivers. YOLANDA (through translator): I got stuck on the road that was full of wooden materials and debris from the houses that were washed away. I got trapped by the pile of debris, and the water was not flowing anymore. And I hit the rubble and then tried to get my head out of the water, because I could feel the water flow was receding. KINKADE (voice-over): Thousands of people have been evacuated from their flooded homes, as rescuers recover bodies and dig through the damage. While Roza Yolanda recovers in hospital, others remain lost in the rubble. YOLANDA (through translator): Mom, thank God, is safe, while they are still searching for my Dad. KINKADE (voice-over): With heavy rains forecast throughout the week, the dire search for survivors continues. This, the latest fled catastrophe, as unprecedented rainfall triggers flash floods around the world. Lynda Kinkade, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
