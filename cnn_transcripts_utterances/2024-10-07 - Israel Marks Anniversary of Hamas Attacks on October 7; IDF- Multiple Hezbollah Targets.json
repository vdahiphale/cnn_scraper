But one of the things you hear from a lot of people here is that they're not just stuck in the trauma, but they feel it can't really end until the war ends in Gaza, until the hostages come back. Even though, you know, they're here remembering friends, loved ones who are dead, this collective feeling across the country, but particularly among those who were sort of caught up in Hamas's brutal attack that day, that none of this can end until the hostages are back. And I think that's one of the reasons why there is such a unified voice of pressure on the Prime Minister, why you had people outside of his house today letting the sirens go as well. But this country still feels the trauma and of course it feels the war is still very much on, which of course it is.",
