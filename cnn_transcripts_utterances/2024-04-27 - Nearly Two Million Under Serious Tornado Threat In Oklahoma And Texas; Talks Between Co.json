Millions of people are facing the threat of tornadoes, strong winds and softball sized hail. From Texas to Michigan right now forecasters issuing some rare warnings, including a, quote, \"particularly dangerous situation\" tornado watch, along with a warning of rare excessive rain.The storm system left a trail of destruction in Omaha on Friday afternoon leveling entire neighborhoods on the city's westside there.

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, night is approaching and there is some concern about another storm front moving into the Omaha area. And it is simply too soon for this. I mean, take a look behind me. What you're seeing right there, the flattened wood, it doesn't translate on cameras so easily. That was two two-story homes. OK. The residents there survived by sheltering in the basement. But the home is completely destroyed.A lot of the other houses look like this. Some parts of the structure are still standing. A lot of it has collapsed throughout the day. We have seen families as well as volunteers from the community coming here, helping with the cleanup, helping the families gather whatever personal possessions they might have, helping them salvage whatever they can. You can see the truck here. This is one of the families trying to save what they can because basically after they get what they can, they have to move out of here and insurance takes over, and then the rebuilding begins, which is a very lengthy process. Over here, the car that belonged to this family totaled and that is just a fraction of what we've seen throughout this neighborhood. It's a rather newer subdivision of Elkhorn and we had seen giant vehicles flipped and crushed and flattened, homes completely flattened. And I believe actually that we have our drone up in the air to show you a bigger overview picture of what this neighborhood looks like because this is just one street. There are dozens of streets here. Again, it doesn't translate that necessarily when the home is completely flattened, when we first arrived here, no, it's pitch black. We thought that, you know, maybe it was a construction site. But no, these were lived-in homes. A lot of the families moved in over the past last year or so. They will now have to figure out how to pick up the pieces of their life again. A lot of folks that we talked to expressed shock, disbelief. You know, this only happened last night that tornado hit at 4:30 in the afternoon on Friday. It is Saturday. People are shellshock, they're trying to figure out where to go, where to stay, how to pick up the pieces of their life. I am actually standing now at another property here on the street. This used to be a garage over there. You could see a laundry machine destroyed, crushed. This home, no longer livable. Just one of the many families that are going to have to rebuild their lives again in the aftermath of this destruction. And again, more bad weather coming in. A lot of concern here -- Jessica.",

Thanks so much.Also today, we are seeing more arrest at college campuses across America as pro-Palestinian protests spread at major universities. School officials at Northeastern University in Boston say campus operations have, quote, \"returned to normal\" after police detained about 100 people there this morning. In Northern California, large protests and encampments have taken over two buildings inside the Cal Poly Humboldt Campus. Today, university officials there announced the school will close and go fully remote for the remainder of the semester. In New York City, the epicenter of the demonstrations protest organizers at Columbia University say talks with school officials are at an impasse. They are demanding the university cut ties with Israeli academic institutions and divest from any Israel-linked entities. Demonstrators also want their schools to stand against what they believe and they say are acts of genocide being committed against the Palestinian people in Gaza. But some Jewish students worried the protests are becoming antisemitic, leading to harassment and that they fear for their safety on campuses. Let's go straight to CNN's Polo Sandoval. He's live outside Columbia University in New York. And Polo that is really, as we just mentioned kind of at the epicenter. Columbia is where a lot of this started to really take shape. How is it today? POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's where it all started, Jessica, as you pointed out. Now, well over a week into this negotiations between members of this pro-Palestinian student movement and the university, it seems that those talks, if they have installed, they at least have slowed significantly, especially if you hear from one of the negotiators that's been on the students' side of the negotiating table? They say that the really main objective here, as you pointed out, is still top of mind and on top of this, scientists outside the perimeter of the encampment, which has divestment from any of those companies that have Israeli ties. They have said that they've seen some significant progress on at least two fronts. The first one is that, number two, which is a complete transparency. They say that they've been offered to play a role in a committee to review some of the proposals that are received by the university. And also another one that you won't find on this list, which is to secure a statement from Minouche Shafik, the president university, to address last week's incident, where the NYPD made their way on campus to detain well over 100 participants of a protest. But the real deal maker or deal breaker as you point out again is divestment, especially when you hear from one of those negotiators, Mahmoud Khalil, who says, until they find common ground on that front this encampment is not going to go.

A majority of what we've seen on campus, again, just in general, has been peaceful. Right now you see a collection of some of those pro-Palestinian students that are participating in one of these speaking events, some readings. We have seen them participate in these kinds of events, so they have been, again, largely peaceful.But also what's interesting that I heard from some of the organizers is that they have not seen this encampment considerably since it started. So it speaks to where things are going. They also have not received any guarantees from the president of the university that they will not once again turned to the NYPD to clear this out. But then finally, Jessica, just the general mood on campus on this Saturday afternoon. There really is sort of this feeling of uncertainty because you have this encampment that is still ever present, but at the same time, you also have workers that are preparing for commencement that is supposed to happen at this very site in only a couple of weeks. So there are a lot of people that are wondering right now, including those students who are ere scheduled to graduate that are wondering exactly what will happen next. As for those negotiations, don't expect another update until Monday according to organizers.",

But the overwhelming majority of the protests that are occurring are not only peaceful, they are led by Palestinian and Jewish kids together. And there's absolutely no bigotry taking place. We've seen some inflammatory, unacceptable remarks made by rabble rousers and agent provocateurs usually off campus, right? Trying to get their 15 minutes of fame. But the protests themselves have been respectful and peaceful of thevast majority of them. I think what we're seeing is that some anti- Palestinian groups want to zero in on a small number of people and try to paint all the protesters with that negative brush. That's very cynical and it's not acceptable, and it does not reflect what most of these protests are about. And again, we saw this before during Vietnam when kids who protests were called communists and anti-American. You know, it's a very tried and true strategy. If you can't win the argument, you can't defeat the message, attack the messenger. So school should, of course, condemn any hate speech that occurs, but they've got to be honest that for the vast majority of kids, they are not engaging that at all.",

It's a small number of people. And they also know that this double-standard doesn't happen with other protests.When the March for Israel occurred in Washington last fall, one of the speakers there was the notoriously anti-Muslim, antisemitic pastor John Hagan. There were people in the crowd shouting genocidal things about Palestinians, there was no outcry about that. No House hearings about that. So it seems that kids who express support for Palestine are held to a very different standard than leading advocacy organizations and political leaders. And that's not a fair. College kids should be addressed on the merits of what they're saying. We shouldn't be looking at these nuts outside of campus saying crazy things because there are not that many of them, they don't represent the students.",

But the bulk of this week's testimony came from David Pecker.

And they're now getting down into some of the details for the jury.So it's just -- it's a stage setter at this point. Pecker was a good witness, the publisher of the \"National Enquirer,\" and it's been an attention-grabbing week for the jury and the public. DEAN: And it's a case that likely is largely going to hinge on a lot of documents. What exactly are prosecutors looking to show as they call witnesses like Michael Cohen's former banker to the stand? And as they try to walk this jury, there are a lot of documents. J. DEAN: Well, with the banker, they're setting the stage of the finances that were arranged to pay off Stormy Daniels during the later phases of the story, which we know about broadly, but we don't have the details yet. So what they have also apparently are a lot of documents. What we don't know if they have or do not have is information or witnesses or documents that directly link Donald Trump to the falsification of the documents or whether that's going to be something that has to be inferred by really overwhelming evidence that there's no other way it could have happened other than from his allowing it to happen. That's a thinner case. If they have a direct witness or they have direct evidence, that's going to be a powerful case. So this is what's keeping me on the edge of my seat as I watch what unfolds.",

In prior trials he has said that he would take the stand and never showed up to do so. So he's not a good witness. He is shown that in depositions, in the limited testimony he's given in a civil trial. He's showed me he was not a good witness. So it would be unlikely that's going to happen.

This week, President Biden signed a bill into law that calls on the Chinese company ByteDance to sell its popular social media platform within the next 270 days, about nine months, or face the total ban in the U.S. The new law is meant to prevent the Chinese government from accessing American's sensitive data.And joining us now is Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He's one of the co-authors of the bill and a ranking member on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. Congressmen, great to see you. Thanks so much for coming on with us. There are millions and millions of people out there in America who use TikTok, a lot of younger people, especially, but it runs the gamut. What do you say to those who are confused by this, not happy about this, afraid TikTok is going to go away? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): We want TikTok to continue to operate, just not under the control of the Chinese Communist Party. And just to refresh the facts, Jessica, TikTok is owned by a company called ByteDance. ByteDance is a Chinese company that's indisputable controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. The editor-in-chief of ByteDance is the secretary of the CCP cell that's been embedded at the top of ByteDance to control its operations. And so people are very concerned about two threats. One, the CCP's access to personal data. And, two, it's manipulation of content on the platform. And so that's why there's a huge bipartisan vote in favor of this bill.",

And then bring the White House and the administration into the discussions to get technical assistance. And then forge a path forward. It took about a year for us to all get on the same page and get all stakeholder's input on it. And then we introduced it. And you saw the result, which was very positive.",
