Like I said, SMU nearly coming back and winning the ACC title game against Clemson that would have earned them an outright bid regardless.But, I mean, I just don't know how you can keep a team like SMU or Indiana Eleven win teams out. Especially when the broader context of the 12 team playoff is to have these programs that haven't really been on these national stages give them a shot to go out and prove what they can do. Obviously they fell flat on those stages. I don't think SMU and Indiana are necessarily going away. I don't know if it'll drastically change the way that the committee selects these teams because on championship Saturday they are human. They saw SMU play a really good game. I don't think you can keep an 11 win Indiana team out, but it's certainly going to be interesting to see if it drastically changes the way that they select the teams. It's not supposed to. Their job is to just look at a given season and put the 12 best teams in. But it's certainly a topic of conversation, at least early on in these first round games.

Matt Gaetz. And now as you mentioned, we know when multiple sources telling CNN the report will be released tomorrow. Now, this release really is a stark reversal by the Ethics Committee which just last month voted to shelve the report while Gaetz was President Elect to Trump's Attorney General pick after he resigned from Congress for that AG position. Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration of that role after Trump called him to say Gaetz didn't have the votes in the Senate to get confirmed. The report concludes a years long probe by the Ethics Committee into numerous allegations, you mentioned some of them, against Gaetz, including whether he engaged in sexual misconducts with a minor, paid for sex, used illicit drugs, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, and more. Gaetz has strongly denied all of the allegations and has said the Committee's investigation is a witch hunt, saying this on X after reports of the Committee's decision to release it. The Biden-Garland DOJ spent years reviewing allegations that I committed various crimes. I was charged with nothing fully exonerated. Now, the post went on to say it's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.

He is as impulsive and unpredictable as he was the first time.It's hard to imagine that any process at all, even the most rudimentary, could have led you to nominate someone with these kinds of accusations hanging out over them. And I think that's an important consideration, you know, as we think about what will happen in the Trump presidency. I mean, he did lay out some key priorities, I think, that kind of loom above all else. Mass deportation, big tariffs, extending his tax cuts, rolling back the Biden regulatory agenda, particularly on the environment and climate. But as we saw again last week during the battle over the debt ceiling, he moves in unpredictable ways without a lot of notice to allies.

You know, what we saw through the -- even during the Trump presidency is that there are a number of House Republicans who will not vote for spending bills and certainly will not vote for raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance. So when Trump tried to try to do something last week, that is usually a goal of Democrats, which is taking the debt ceiling off the table without it being a point of leverage to try to affect other changes in the government, you had House Republicans that said no. I don't think that means they say no to some of the more extreme things that he might want to do along the lines of, for example, the way they implement mass deportation. What it does mean, though, what that backlash last week does mean, though, is that Democrats will have a point of leverage, some point this spring, because it's pretty clear that Republicans alone will not be able to raise the debt ceiling, and Trump will be faced to change choice of making a deal with Democrats or allowing a potentially catastrophic default from the U.S --",

I mean, Senate Democrats were willing to fund his border wall in return for extending protections for the DACA recipients, which is something that Trump said he wanted to do at the last minute. They blew it up out of the White House because they also wanted cuts in legal immigration.And this was, as I said, like the Gaetz nomination, you know, just kind of a reminder that that kind of impulsiveness is intrinsic to Trump. And I think, you know, what this showed is that if you add that kind of impulsiveness from Trump to the internecine warfare we saw in 23 -- in this last congressional session with a narrow House Republican margin to the new wild card of Elon Musk meddling, you have a recipe for a lot of things blowing up on a regular basis. Doesn't mean they aren't going to pass the biggest things they care about, particularly funding for mass deportation and extending the Trump tax cuts. I would suspect they will be able to do both of that. But there is going to be a lot of uncertainty and volatility in Trump two, just as there was in Trump one.

According to CENTCOM, the aircraft, an F/A-18, was operating from the USS Harry S. Truman when it was mistakenly fired upon by the USS Gettysburg. The USS Gettysburg, a Ticonderoga class guided missile cruiser, is part of the Truman Carrier strike group which entered the waters of the Middle East one week ago.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: When you are in a zone like this, where there is combat happening at one end of the Red Sea, and then there are other flight patterns that the folks on the USS Gettysburg -- the sailors of the USS Gettysburg have to deal with, it can be pretty easy to mistake targets from one to the other. In other words, is one a friendly target or is one an adversarial or a potential adversarial target? (END VIDEO CLIP) BENBROOK: Now, the U.S. has maintained a near constant presence of major Navy warships in the region since the start of the war in Gaza. And on the same day of this apparent friendly fire incident, the U.S. had carried out airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, including hitting a missile storage facility and a command and control facility in the capital city. Now, those strikes did involve the use of Navy F/A-18 fighter jets, but according to military sources who spoke with our team, that downed jet that we've been discussing was not involved. Fred.",

What we've been witnessing in our country, but especially in the west, is this disaffiliation from religion, people staying away from church, from the worship of God. And that's not a minor problem. That's a problem that has major social implications.And I'll tell you a little bit from the Christmas -- the famous Christmas story of the angels who say, you know, glory to God in the highest and peace to his people on earth. That's a kind of formula. See, when God is given glory in the highest. So beyond anything else, wealth, pleasure, power, family, country, anything, you give God the highest glory. The biblical intuition is peace then tends to break out among us because then together we're all oriented toward the transcendent good of God. And the way you make that real is by going to church, is by engaging in worship. So I would say to my, you know, my fellow Catholics, go to Mass. I say to everybody, go to church. So don't give in to the secularization of Christmas. Don't turn Christmas into some little, you know, kind of just humanistic feast. Go to church and give glory to God in the highest. That'd be my message.",

Shopping, right. Losing your minds and losing your wallets, too, trying to make everybody, you know, in the family happy.So what's your message to people, you know, to kind of reel it all in? Going to church, yes, that is a very important message, but perhaps that's not resonating still with a lot of folks who, you know, are getting.

I know it's been inculcated in people now for decades and decades, but just resist it maybe by one president for one person if it's expressive of real love and real affection, which is born of your love for God. See, if our generosity flows from our love of God, well, then, good, then we're honoring, you know, Christmas.So I would just -- I would resist it. I stand athwart it. Worship God first and let your generosity flow from that. And don't let the culture dictate to you. You know, so many ways, Fredricka, the Christmas message is revolutionary. It's very countercultural. Because the Baby King is seen in contradict -- the contradistinction to Caesar Augustus, he represents the kind of, you know, lordly power of the world, or you might say the power of the culture. Well, the Baby King stands over and against that. So I would say Christians, especially on Christmas resist the culture which has become too dominant, this materialistic, individualistic, secularist culture. Resist it by going to church.",

So St. Paul will say that Jew and gentile, which in his mind meant, like all the different warring factions of the world come together around him.Think of in the Christmas stories, the shepherds coming from near, but the wise men coming from afar. That's the idea of how attractive, how magnetic the child Jesus is. So that's what the Pope will talk about is incarnation. From that follows indeed this message of peace. And again, see that Christianity stands over and against the violent secularist culture. We follow the prince of peace, not any of the, you know, avatars of worldly power.",
