Beirut bombing, Israel vows to continue its offensive amid fresh air strikes on the Lebanese capital. Republican outreach. Kamala Harris taking the stage with former GOP Congresswoman and Trump critic, Liz Cheney. Arctic access. China's Coast Guard joins Russia in patrolling the very strategic Bering Sea for the first time ever. And port pressure. Strikes closed docks on the U.S. East Coast for a third straight day. We'll speak to the CEO of the Port of L.A. to see what the West Coast can do to ease those delays. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, we begin in Lebanon, where Israel is fighting Hezbollah on the ground and from the air. About an hour ago, around midnight local time, the CNN team in Beirut heard large explosions and saw a fireball rising from the southern suburbs. Israel says it's been striking targets in the southern and central parts of the city. The IDF releasing this video, too, reportedly showing a strike on a weapons facility and announcing the deaths of several commanders in Southern Lebanon. A strike in Central Beirut killed seven medics, according to Hezbollah affiliated Islamic health authority. In the occupied West Bank, at least 18 people were killed in a strike on a refugee camp. And in Southern Lebanon, Israel says a 21-year-old military officer is their ninth soldier to have died since the ground incursion began. Amid all of this, Iran is still braced for any Israeli retaliation after its missile strike on Tuesday. Jomana Karadsheh joins us now. Jomana, good to have you with us. As I mentioned there, the southern suburbs certainly under fierce attacks just in the last couple of hours. Just describe what it's been like and whether we have any definitive sense of what was being targeted.",

We did see a post on X by the Arabic language spokesperson for the Israeli military saying that they were going to carry out strikes, warning civilians in a number of areas in the southern suburbs to evacuate their homes. And less than 13 minutes after that, those strikes began. And as I mentioned, unclear right now what or who the target of those strikes was. But, you know, Julia, this has been the scene here now for nearly 24 hours of what appears to be this intensification of airstrikes by the Israeli military. Now, it's mostly been focused on the southern suburbs. Earlier today, we saw another massive strike as well. The Israeli military says that it targeted what it described as the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah. Hezbollah says that its press office was hit in that strike. But for the residents of Beirut, who have really gotten used to these strikes that have been focused on the southern suburbs, what happened about 24 hours ago with a strike on a building in the heart of the capital has really put everyone on edge and really created this atmosphere of serious fear and anxiety. And we were out on the streets earlier and we spoke with people about these strikes. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

A death toll in this country that is continuing to rise by the day. We don't know how many of those killed are Hezbollah fighters, but we do know that many of those who've been killed are women and children, according to the ministry of health. And now, we're looking at more than a thousand people who have been killed just in the past couple of weeks since this escalation and war began. And as you can see now, we are continuing to witness these airstrikes that are intensifying and you hear the fear in people's voices when you speak to them, and people just don't know when or how this is going to end. And I can't tell you how many people you speak to and they tell you that their biggest fear is -- as you heard there in that report, is that their country is turning into another Gaza.",

The real question here is eventually how is Israel going to retaliate against Iran, because we know that is coming too.

There can be a show of military prowess, similar to what we saw back in April after theIranians attacked at that point, or, as you said, that you can see more of the -- going for the jugular option, which would be nuclear facilities, perhaps oil facilities. I think the -- one of the key differences, for me, in what we're seeing today from the International Community and certainly, from the United States is, whereas back in April we saw sort of cease and desist, de- escalate message towards the Israelis. The message this time around seems to be a degree more supportive, certainly, not in terms of attacking perhaps nuclear facilities, but other options remain on the table.",

I think Prime Minister Netanyahu feels freer right now, not only because there has been western support after theIranian attack, but also because of the proximity of the U.S. elections, which means that President Biden is already lame duck from Netanyahu's perspective and in the next four weeks, can't really afford to put any pressure on Israel. And Iran is weaker because Hezbollah is already on its knees and Israel is continuing to target Hezbollah. And therefore, Iran is more exposed than was the case in April. The problem is that, at the end of the day, the Iranians have also demonstrated not all of their prowess, but some of it. The first attack in April was a proof of concept that they have the will to directly attack Israel. The second attack earlier this week was to demonstrate that they can get through Israeli air defense systems without necessarily causing a lot of death and destruction. But if this continues, eventually, there will be casualties and the United States will be pulled into a devastating regional war.",

Ron, we were talking about this very briefly earlier, it's a showboat moment as a key former House Republican backing a Democrat. As she said, she's never voted Democrat in her life before, but she feels that strongly about preventing Donald Trump from re-entering the White House, that this is the moment that she's chosen now to campaign with the Democrat.

I'm trying to think back of the lastexample of someone who was so senior in one party endorsing a presidential candidate or the other. Maybe John Connolly, 50 years ago, in 1972, endorsing Nixon. Look, an endorsement from Liz Cheney does not erase the concerns many voters have about inflation, the border, or crime, but it does help to explain why so many voters who think that Trump is better on those issues are still hesitating about voting for him or indicating they are going to vote for Harris. There is a meaningful constituency of voters who might be closer to Trump on policy, who view him as a threat to their rights, their values and to democracy itself. And Liz Cheney's endorsement and her indictment of Trump and the retooled speech from the vice president, which was different from what we hear on a normal basis, on a day-to-day basis, is very much aimed at those voters. Julia, we saw in 2022 that this is real. There were an unusually large number of voters dissatisfied with the economy who still would not vote for Trump style candidates precisely for these reasons. They viewed them as a threat to their rights and values and democracy. And particularly among women, which Liz Cheney, at one point, kind of gestured toward, this is a significant factor that is helping Harris surmount the discontent over inflation. It doesn't eliminate all the other problems, but it is a real factor, a real asset for her. And if she does win, it will be a critical reason why.",

I mean, that's been the story we've seen in the suburbs of Philly, the suburbs of Detroit Madison, Wisconsin, the suburbs of Milwaukee. And again, this is -- Liz Cheney being there is a permission structure for those voters. That is absolutely critical to Democratic prospects in this election. And again, this reinforces something that we saw actually at play in 2022 when there was a level of discontent about the economy and Biden's performance that should have powered a red wave, it fizzled out largely because too many voters, precisely in those suburbs, who probably leaned Republican on issue on taxes in the border still would not vote for the Trump party. That's the firewall for Harris, particularly in the critical states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, that'll probably defy this.",
