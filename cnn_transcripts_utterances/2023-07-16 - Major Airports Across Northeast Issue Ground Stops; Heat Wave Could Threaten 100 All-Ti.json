      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we've got lots of breaking news this weekend. And it entails weather extremes. Major airports across the Northeast have either issued ground stops or are experiencing significant delays as storms moved through the region. Joining us right now on the phone is CNN's aviation correspondent Pete Muntean. Pete, what airports are we talking about? PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): We're talking about a lot of airports on the East Coast, Fredricka. I just checked FlightAware, 1,195 cancellations in the U.S. so far today; 4,331 delays. New York getting hit especially hard again. After we saw a lot of delays, more than 2,000 just last Sunday and then the last week of June we saw a meltdown at United Airlines. So this sort of feeds into the story of travel misery that keeps happening over and over again this summer especially for folks trying to come home on a Sunday after the weekend and make it back to work. Just checking the FAA status of airports right now. Ground stops have been issued for Boston. Logan, that's flights into Logan until 3:00 p.m. A ground delay also. That's means flights leaving Logan, a departure delay for 75 minutes. So we're are talking an hour and 15 minute delays leaving there right now. Newark, a huge hotspot for these delays, a ground stop there as well. Also JFK, LaGuardia -- so New York getting hit hard. Even Florida -- Fort Lauderdale, Miami -- there are also issues there as well. Not out of the woods yet, Fredricka. The FAA says we could see ground stops as the day goes on in places like Philadelphia, Chicago O'Hare, Chicago Midway, also the major airports around D.C. -- Dulles, National, BWI. So this is just the start of what will be another day of misery for a lot of travelers. JetBlue getting hit especially hard right now. 23 percent of its flights have been canceled, but the very New York-heavy airline. Also united, relatively low right now, about 4 percent of cancellations right now. Though remember, the norm is about 1 to 2 percent for an airline. We know that United canceled about 3,000 flights; delayed another 8000 during that last week of June. And Newark is under a ground stop meaning that it's a huge hub for United, so they will get hit especially hard. We'll see as the day goes on. You know, these things have a lasting trickle-down effect, Fredricka and it can be widespread. So once the deck of cards starts coming tumbling down, it's really hard for airlines sometimes to pull it out of the dive. But the weather is moving off the East Coast but the FAA is warning things could last for a little while as the day goes on. It's really a weather story.",

It was just last Sunday and Monday that we saw the disastrous flooding up there and this is more rain.Now again, fortunately we haven't seen that level of flooding yet and the good news is, this line is moving out. It's slow and it's not as fast as everyone waiting in those airport lines would like to see but it is going to move out. We can put the map into motion and see the rest of Sunday. That line moves out by a little after midnight and certainly by tomorrow morning, the line has moved out and we are sort of in the clear when it comes to the weather.

      "sentences": "-- you are getting burned or you're getting choked out by smoke in the middle. So it really is -- it's dependent on where you are and we will talk a little bit more about the heat.I mean We look at these temperatures, these are the feels like temperatures right now. 108 in New Orleans, 103 in Houston, Shreveport at 112. If you are wondering why Dallas is only 84, that's another airport that got hammered by thunderstorms today. That's why it's a little cooler. But we know that is a hub as well. So again, more airport problems there. The current temperatures in the west: 104 in Las Vegas, 104 in Phoenix, and that's really where I'm worried about over the next couple of days. Moving into the next couple of days we see above average temperatures, they really don't go anywhere. They just sort of meander back towards Texas but under the gun still is Arizona. And Fredricka, this is just a downright scary map of Phoenix going forward for the next week. Nearly every one of these highs is a record for the day and the lows, if you want to call them lows, 94 and 95 as cold as it's getting cold at night. That is where these heat waves really turn dangerous. They turn deadly. All of these, all week long, would rank in the top 10 hottest nights Phoenix has ever had and you are putting 7 to 14 of them in a row. It hasn't dropped below 90 since last Sunday and it doesn't look like it's going to happen again for next Sunday. We talk about heat being a silent killer, you know, this is like a major hurricane when it comes to, you know, the disaster that could happen with this type of heat. And you know, we call it the silent killer because we don't hear about it like when a hurricane comes and you have devastation left everywhere and there's a death toll; or a tornado. We find out weeks after with the extreme heat, you know, when we look back and see these excess mortalities. We saw it last year and the year before in Phoenix with heat waves and this one is worse.",

And police have not determined a motive for the shooting and have not yet identified the victims except to say they are three men and one woman. Longmore, who officials say is armed and dangerous, was last seen driving a black GMC Acadia. The sheriff's office is offering a $10,000 reward for any information leading to his arrest. An inmate who escaped from a Pennsylvania prison is now back in custody after more than a week on the run. Police captured Michael Burham yesterday in a wooded area near the town of Warren.

It was back on July 6th that Burham reportedly used a rope fashioned from beddings to escape out a window in the recreation room at the facility that he was being held in, in Northwestern Pennsylvania. During the search for the last few days, a search that was conducted by hundreds of states, local, federal officers, they were able to locate some campsites and various stockpiles that they believe were directly linked to Burham. However, then Saturday came. I want you to hear directly from Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens describing how a private citizen managed to call in a tip that led to the arrest of this runaway inmate.

There and farther south and then around Bakhmut which is just seeing such an extraordinary level of fighting. That entire city has been destroyed. Remember the Wagner mercenary forces, they were the primary fighters on the Russian side there for quite some time before pulling out several weeks ago. But Russian forces have managed to maintain control of the vast majority of the city. Ukrainian forces trying to push both in the north and in the south. To the north of the city they haven't made much progress. They too are on the defensive there while they make some gains in the southern part. So it is rather going for the Ukrainian side, not just in the eastern part of the country but also in the south where they have also made some gains but they have been relatively modest, Fred.

Twenty-year-old Carlos Alcaraz has won his second grand slam title after defeating four-time defending champion Novak Djokovic in the men's singles match in Wimbledon after a thrilling five sets fight. Alcaraz is now the third youngest man in the open era to win at Wimbledon. Joining me right now from Wimbledon is seven-time major champion, Mats Wilander. Wow, what a match. I know you were right front and center. I mean, it was a test for so many things. I didn't get to see all of it because I was preparing for the show. What I did see was a real test of stamina. I mean, they were dueling, they were slipping. I mean, there was a little gymnastics in there as well, but this was a stunning loss in the end for Djokovic, wasn't it, and his fans? MATS WILANDER, SEVEN-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION:  Yes, Fredricka. Yes, it's a very stunning loss for Novak. Of course, am I surprised? Of course, you have to be surprised when know Novak loses a grand slam final these days. But I'm not shocked because Carlos Alcaraz has such a high level and I would even go out in a limb and say that this is most probably the highest level that men's tennis has ever been played on at the Wimbledon center court because like you're seeing, the grass is difficult to move but Carlos Alcaraz is just so good at 20 years old. But Novak Djokovic is the guy that makes this happen because he's so good, he's raising the ceiling, raising the bar and you have to step it up and Carlos Alcaraz did.",

But it did seem like it became a test of wills and of stamina.",

But also, he was dictating most of the points after the first set. He was kind of in control, not of the match, but of the points. And I think he did a great job there.But Novak Djokovic is, I love to see great champions winning and I hope Novak wins five or six more grand slam singles titles, but it's really important for the sport to have another face at the top of the game. No one better than Carlos Alcaraz. He has the stamina. He's got the stability. He's got the power. He's got the foot speed and then he's got the smile. And we have never seen a tennis player smile more than Carlos Alcaraz in these big pressure moments. So he's such a welcome gift from our tennis gods to our sport.",

He could hit a forehand harder than anyone in the world.So, for him to make the right choice at the right time, plus getting involved with the crowd is amazing at 20 years old. For Novak Djokovic, he gets involved with the crowd, too, but he uses that crowd a little bit differently. Sometimes he nearly wants them to be against him because it fires him up. But the gracefulness of Novak Djokovic on the court after the match, I have to say, Fredricka, is that of a great, great champion. So, Novak deserves all the credit for this match and Carlos is our champion.",

Before we go to break, here's today's \"Impact Your World.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASMIN GRAHAM, CO-FOUNDER, MINORITIES IN SHARK SCIENCE:  I'm a shark scientist. I very quickly became aware that there's not a lot of people like me in the field. We had this sort of movement on Twitter of Black scientists with the #blackinnature. When we started talking, we said, well, we should start a club. Minorities in Shark Science's mission is to change the culture so that people from historically excluded groups participate in marine science. We have programs like our Gill Guardians which is a curriculum that lives on line to help educate people about sharks and move them from fear to fascination. We have camp for our kids, science at the sea where we bring kids out to the ocean and then we have science on the move for those kids that can't get to the ocean and we can bring the ocean to them. We also have professional development so people can get very specific skills they need to be successful in this field and help connect people with other people that are doing research. MAGRIELI RODRIGUEZ-RUIZ, MISS EUGENIE CLARK FELLOW:  This has opened a lot of doors. I didn't think it was feasible being 45 years old pursuing a degree later in life. This reminds me that anything I want to do is possible.",
