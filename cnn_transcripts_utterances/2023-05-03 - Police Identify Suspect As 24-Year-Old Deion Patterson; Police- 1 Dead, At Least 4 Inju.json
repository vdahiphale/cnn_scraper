And this was the suspect, we have learned from Ryan Young, was there attending an appointment. An appointment for him, a medical appointment for him when he became agitated and this is - and you see in a photo here, this was actually taken from the scene. This is a photo provided from police.And police are saying that following or in the middle of that appointment is when this all played out. I do want to bring in Andrew McCabe to talk a little bit about what we are seeing and some of the outstanding questions because at this point, you have a search, an all-out search that authorities are conducting at this point in time. But also they do not know where this individual is, Andy. And so that creates a potentially very broad area as they are looking for this person.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Brianna. So let's think first in terms of the area that's currently within the perimeter, the area that's shut down. Even that is a large, large area to search carefully.So you have tactical teams that have to literally go through every single space or container that could hold a human being. So it's every hallway, every room, every closet, every storage area and you're doing it knowing that you're looking for someone who is - has a gun and has already shot at people today. So that has to be done carefully, slowly and deliberately. So that alone can take a long time. Now if you layer on the possibility that this individual has actually gotten outside the perimeter, whether through the carjacking that we've heard reported on or through some other means maybe changing his appearance, well, at that point, all bets are off. You're essentially looking at a manhunt like we just watched take place outside of Houston, Texas over the last several days. So this could really we could be here for quite some time tracking these events.",

So what does that tell you about the developing situation here?Andrew McCabe: Well, it could indicate that they now believe there's no longer a threat of that person being present in that area that was formerly under a shelter in place advisory and that tells us that the law enforcement officers on the scene believe that he's outside of that area or at least that they are no longer confident that he is within that shelter in place area. So without knowing exactly whether the shelter in place was the same general area as the part that's been perimetered (ph) off, it's hard to say exactly where they think he might be. But it's not a good sign in terms of law enforcements' confidence in being able to locate and apprehend this person quickly.",

And as it changes, they say they are currently working to locate a vehicle that was carjacked shortly after the time of this shooting to determine if it is connected to the shooting.

If so, which platforms is he on; does he have friends; does he have a cell phone, does he use an iPad, all those sorts of questions give you a better view of the scope of those things that you could potentially exploit to locate this individual. I should also say, though, that the carjacking information is really a great indication of just how complicated and hard this is for police. So remember, the Atlanta Police, they're getting calls all day long, hundreds of calls from all kinds of different things happening around town. And every time one of those calls includes a fact or a description that is somehow - could somehow arguably be related to this person, now they're adding that to the pile of things that they have to check out to determine if it's a - if the gentleman they're looking for. So it's - there are many - probably many other calls similar to this carjacking that they're wondering could this be related. So it's a lot of work to do.",

As we saw initially, the carjacking was not attributed to this.Now it could be they're getting they're of these tips in. They need the public's help, but that comes with a certain volume of information that has to be sorted through by law enforcement and responded to all of those because you don't know whether or not one tip is going to lead to the next.

It's interesting because just a few minutes prior to that, the Atlanta Police Department had put out a notice lifting shelter in place advisory. I'm sorry, if I sound a little out of breath. We were running towards the scene. Again, it was just a, sort of a barrage of what appeared to sound like gunshots in the area followed before and afterwards by officers and heavy tactical gear getting into their Atlanta police cars and then speeding off in the direction where we appear to hear the shots coming from. And, again, that was just a few minutes after a shelter in place has been lifted. You remember police officers saying that it was a potential carjacking that may have been connected on 14th and 11th. I say that now as we're seeing another - what appears to be a huge armored vehicle show up in the area. There's dozens of police officers all throughout this area. And again, as - those shots would appear to sound like gunshots being fired, there was a barrage of them and then they stopped. We don't see any officers right now running anywhere. Things have sort of calmed down and settled down.
