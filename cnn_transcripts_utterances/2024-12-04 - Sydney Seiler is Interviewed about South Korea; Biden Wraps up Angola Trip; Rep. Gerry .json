He is using a very unusual tool, as it were, in order to try to, you know, from the opposition's perspective, undermine democracy. From the ruling party's perspective, trying to get the ball moving.

In many ways, President Yoon has been, you know, just a thorn in the side of Kim Jong-un. And so I expect in the coming days, and we'll see rhetoric playing up the failure of President Yoon, the lack of public support, the fact that, you know, North Korea was right all along, this is not a guy worth dealing with.I don't think North Korea would take the step of - of seeking some type of provocative action that would try to exploit the current situation because such provocative action would just play into Yoon's hands. It would reinforce - if you recall, this whole martial law was introduced by President Yoon as - as necessary because of a North Korea threat.

This is an 800-mile unfinished railway project that's aiming to transfer critical minerals from interior countries in Africa to the ports for exports. Exports that could also go to the United States. Senior administration officials say that this is really a test case for their strategy here in Africa. What Biden has been trying to do is find areas to invest in and specific projects to help those countries there. And they hope that this is going to serve as a playbook for future administrations in Africa. It all comes as the U.S. has really tried to counter some of China's influence in the continent. China has spent the past ten years investing hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects across the continent through its belt and road initiative. Really leaving the U.S. and other countries to catch up. But President Biden, over the course of yesterday and today, did take some veiled swipes at China, as they really believe that this Lobito Corridor presents an alternative to African countries from what China has provided so far. Take a listen to that moment from earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
