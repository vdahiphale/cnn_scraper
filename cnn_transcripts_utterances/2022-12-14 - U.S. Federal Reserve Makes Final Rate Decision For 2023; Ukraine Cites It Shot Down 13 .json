And some migrant workers tell me, for instance, they've been just exhausted after working that long.

And I think when you talk to White House officials, when you talk to administration officials, they acknowledge the reality on the ground, the reality in the region, where the U.S. has just simply not been a central player or more often than that even, has made a lot of commitments. Made a lot of big promises, perhaps had symbolic events, and then largely disappear or cut funding on foreign aid, not really come through, particularly in the way that others -- other countries, other leaders, more specifically, China, but others as well, have over the course of the last decade. The primary element you've seen from White House officials here is to make clear that this is not just symbolic. This is not just three days and then move on. This is something that's going to be maintained over series of years. Part of that, $55 billion in committed investment over the course of three years, backing the African Union joining the G20. Likely, we are told, President Biden will announce a visit to the continent of several countries swing at some point in 2023. Trade, investment, leveraging the private sector, all of those really key elements here as well. But there's no doubt that underneath kind of this entire process here, is a recognition that there is a real geopolitical competition underway. China is significantly ahead when it comes to the continent, and the U.S. needs to change how it operates. That is a large part of what's happening, even, I would note, as White House officials claim that is not the entire reason of what's happening over the course of the next three days.

Which in the worst days of the AIDS pandemic, was really a game-changer for many millions of people on this continent.
