I'm here covering it all with CNN's Paula Reid and Kristen Holmes.And Paula, we're getting live updates from what's happening inside the courtroom. We don't actually have cameras inside of there, but we can hear what's going on. And the judge is raising what, I think, is a pretty good question, which is Trump's legal team is complaining about when these documents were turned over.",

And then, it's interesting because prosecutors also weighed in here and they said, look, only a small -- quite small number of these are actually relevant to this case. And then there was a pretty heated exchange between the prosecutors, the defense attorneys, and the judge about this question of what is relevant because this evidence is all related to the federal investigation and prosecution of Michael Cohen.And Trump's lawyers suggested that one thing that they believe was relevant was an FBI interview related to this investigation, also interviews with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. And interestingly, the judge stepped in and pretty aggressively asked, well, that's not relevant. What does that interview, an interview between Michael Cohen and the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, have to do with this case? He insists that that investigation, the Russia investigation, has nothing to do with this case. He says to the lawyers -- he said, I'm telling you, if you try to introduce something in the Muller investigation, it's not coming in. So, here, Judge Juan Merchan drawing a bright line that anything related to the Russia probe is not coming in in this hush money case. But it seems like the judge is trying to get to the bottom of, OK, why did it take so long to get these documents into the hands of the prosecutors, the defense attorneys, and how much of this is really relevant? Because how much of this is relevant? That gets to how much time they need to review it. If there are thousands of relevant pages, well that might take longer to review than just a few hundred pages. So, that's why the judge is really drilling in on that question right now.",

And essentially what you saw was the whole reason that they had a delay in the first place was because, essentially, D.A. conceded that there was about 30 days of relevant documents in there for them to delay.So, it's not surprising that you're going to see Donald Trump's team argue through each one of these documents and say, no, this is relevant. We need more time to do this because, again, the ultimate goal here is to push this as far as they possibly can. They can get 90 days out of it. They're going to want 90 days out of it. The other part of this is how close is to the election can they get this? The closer they get to the election, the more political it becomes.",
