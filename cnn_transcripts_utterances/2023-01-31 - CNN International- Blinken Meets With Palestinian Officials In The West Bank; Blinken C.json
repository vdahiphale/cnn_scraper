Just ahead, the U.S. Secretary of State is in the West Bank holding talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. We'll have the latest out of that.In Pakistan, rescuers sift through the rubble in search of survivors after deadly explosion ripped through a mosque on Monday. And disruption in France as thousands take to the streets to protest against an unpopular plan to raise the retirement age. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is wrapping up a whirlwind trip to the Middle East where he's found himself calling for calm across Israel and the West Bank. A day after meeting with Israeli leaders, Blinken is now in Ramallah meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and other officials as well. We should hear from them soon after their discussion. This visit happened to come right after a new wave of violence between Israelis and Palestinians erupted in the West Bank and Jerusalem. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Ramallah in the West Bank. We don't know what's happened in the meeting, but what are you hoping to hear or what are you looking out for?",

      "sentences": "You know, I think what we would be looking out for is any commitment that Antony Blinken thinks he's got from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, that there would be a softening of the Palestinian position on deciding not to work with Israel on security coordination.That's a big issue for the Israelis. And it's a big issue for the Secretary of State because the belief is that it helps both sides. This isn't, you know, when the Palestinian Authority makes a move like this, it isn't just a detriment to Israel. This is the belief of the State Department, that it's a detriment for Palestinian Authority. It's not clear that sort of commitment is going to come and then many people here on the street and we've talked to them today, who would tell you, look, we already feel the credibility of the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is undermined. He doesn't really have credibility. What in essence, he would be asked to do there will be further to comply and be complicit in everything that aggravates Palestinians, the expansion of Israeli settlements, the ability of Israeli military to come into towns like Jenin last Thursday, where nine Palestinians were killed in a raid where the Israelis were looking for, they call it a terror suspect. So these are the sorts of things that if Mahmoud Abbas does what Antony Blinken asked him to do and what the Israelis want, undermines his credibility. I think the other cool thing here is to see what Secretary of State Antony Blinken would say about a two-state solution. A lot of people here in Ramallah and other places on the West Bank will tell you they're not -- they don't really believe a two-state solution is possible. That's very important for the United States. It gives, in essence, a reason to keep talking on all sides. But the perspective here is that Israel by those actions of expansions of settlements, is shutting down that possibility, indeed. Talk to young people here, Max, and they will really say, we don't believe it's possible at all. And that's a gloomy political horizon for a lot of people here.",

We'll bring updates of course when we get those statements at that key meeting.Meanwhile, fierce fighting is raging in eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces battle for control of villages and towns around the decimated and deserted city of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military says it has repelled attacks but describes the situation as difficult. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says it's no time for what he's calling continued reflections and he's once again imploring Western allies to speed up weapons delivery. CNN's Scott McLean joins me now.

If you're looking at live pictures of the protests, you can see how many people have turned up. French unions, of course, for massive strikes, that's creating chaos, as more than 100 schools will be closed and transit services will be severely disrupted.

The last time the unions here in France, Max, were this unified and this determined to take on the government.You have to go back to 2010, under Nicolas Sarkozy, the last time that the French government managed to reform the pension system. That's how sensitive that nerve is, and how long it's been since they've presented such united front. Let me just show you behind me the march is about to kick off here from -- there at Place d'Italie. You can see people are preparing to march. These are colorful and noisy affairs, but a sense of celebration because the unions feel and are hoping that today they're going to get more than the -- more than 1 million they managed to get off the streets on January 19. Now Emmanuel Macron has really set up a sort of battle of wills going in to this summer. He's a, Max, is to get this reform through that would see the retirement age here go from 62 to 64 by the summer. Now, in parliamentary terms, that could work because even if there's a lot of opposition, he can get it through regardless. What counts is the opposition from the streets, and just how many people, the trade unions, can get out today, but also in the days going forward. They hope to force the government to back down. And bear in mind, this was a reform that Emmanuel Macron had vowed to bring in when he first became president back in 2017. He's hoping that this, at the start of his second term, will be the right time for pension reform. The trade unions and all of those out on the street today are determined that that will not be the case, Max.",

Officials say at least 100 people were killed when an explosion ripped through the mosque in Peshawar. It was located within a police compound and mostly attended by police officers, obviously. Earlier, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the wounded in the hospital. It's still unclear who's behind the blast.
