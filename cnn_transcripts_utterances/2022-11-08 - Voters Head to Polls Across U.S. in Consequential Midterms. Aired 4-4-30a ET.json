And the Democrat Tim Ryan has really kept it competitive and forced Republicans to spend here despite this being a red state that Donald Trump won in 2020.And a big part of that reason, Don, is because Tim Ryan is seen as one of the Democrats' best economic messengers. He really leans into the economic pain that voters are feeling. He talks about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state, even talked about areas where he agreed with Trump on China and on trade. But despite all that, it might not be enough for the headwinds that Democrats are facing in today's midterm elections. And meanwhile you have the Republican JD Vance. He's also has made economic populism a key part of his message. He's also tried to appeal to the base by denying the 2020 election and of course he has the support of Donald Trump who rallied here last night for him at a campaign.

Up to this point Senator Johnson has tried to paint Mandela Barnes as a continuation of President Biden. But also as someone who hates this state and people in it, referring basically to past criticisms Barnes has made of the state's institutions.But both of them have painted very clear stakes that this isn't just a Senate race, this is a vote about the future direction of the country. Now, Barnes on his side, he told us really his strategy in this final stretch on the other side of what's been a more than 100 stop RV tour that he really wants to meet people where they are on some of the biggest issues, the economy, abortion, election integrity even, and more, and that he doesn't want to take any vote for granted. That if you're in a city like Milwaukee, that doesn't guarantee a vote. If you're a rural voter, that isn't guarantee, you're not going to vote. In his words, he feels they didn't leave any stone unturned. When I asked him if he felt they had done enough to get Ron Johnson out of office, but of course we are going to see today when polls open in just a few hours at the more than 3600 polling sites here in Wisconsin.",
