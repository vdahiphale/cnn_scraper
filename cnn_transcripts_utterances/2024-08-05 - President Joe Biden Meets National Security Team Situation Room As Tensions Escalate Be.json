When President Biden convened his national security team the last time that retaliatory attacks were launched by Iran, that was in mid-April, he was joined by his national security adviser, his secretary of state, his secretary of defense, as well as many members of the intelligence community and his CIA Director Bill Burns. And this time, Kamala Harris, his vice president will be joining him in person whereas previously, she joined by secure video. But it comes, as you note, after days where the administration has been sprinting to figure out how to position itself and how to shore up its alliances in the face of the potential for those attacks to unfold. In a call yesterday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there was an extremely tense discussion, I'm told, over the demur prospects for the potential of a ceasefire deal because of that attack last week. And as you mentioned, President Biden spoke this morning with the king of Jordan to try to discuss ways to deescalate those tensions. We will see exactly what if anything they decide in the meeting today, that's expected to take place just in a few minutes from now as they discuss the very high stakes and very volatile situation in an already fragile region, Brianna and Omar.",

And I would hope, too, that there's discussion about our European allies and what role they might play. With regard to the Secretary of Defense again, having been there, my update would be to assure the president that our troops are prepared, that their positions are well defended and fortified, and that they -- we're moving troops or planes or air defense systems in place, which they are doing to make sure that we could support Israel and to help them knock down what other missiles, rockets or drones may be coming their way.

First, I think it's important that the Iranians know that the United States is meeting to discuss how it will support Iran, it's important that there be no daylight between Tel Aviv and Washington at this point in time, and that none is perceived by Iran and its proxies, because my view is that will be conducted by Iran and its proxies.Secondly, I think the timing is important, too, because we don't -- you know, nighttime is settling down on Israel right now, typically, these things are conducted at night, so you could see something beginning in the coming hours. And then, also, to have the entire team there sends an important signal. Again, I want to hear more about a multilateral approach in terms of defensive stance like we saw last time, not just with Arab states, but with European partners as well. But I think this -- a lot of this, again, is messaging and signaling to the Iranians don't escalate, don't do this, we will be with Israel, and we will beat back your attack.",

So, it'll be them, then I suspect, again, Hezbollah will be another major player here and others. And then the question will be is will they orchestrate some type of coordinated attack, which, unlike in April, will be less foreshadowing, more synchronized and probably produce a higher volume of rockets and missiles and drones, and more synchronized to hit at once. Their goal, I suspect would be to overwhelm Israeli defenses.",

But we also know they don't want a regional war. They continue to message that, you know, unofficially through people within their government.So, the question is, will they try and pull off what looks like a massive attack, which at the end of the day has really no serious outcome with regard to Israel, either killing Israelis or destroying Israeli facilities? We won't know though until we see what happens at the end of the day, but will they kind of pull their punch a little bit like they did the first time around? Or at least signal the punch, I should say, like they did the first time around? We won't know that until we see it.",

You know, there, you look at any three of those people being talked about, you know, Walz and Kelly have national security experience. Walz and Shapiro are both popular governors from -- you know, we don't talk about Minnesota as a blue wall state a lot, but it's a blue wall state. And all three of them are, you know, popular in their states and all represent battleground states. So, I don't think she can really go wrong. I do think that this is probably coming down to a sense of interpersonal chemistry. She probably as a vice president right now has some, you know, feelings about what makes somebody strong and qualified for this role. I will give Governor Walz some credit. He has really kind of come from behind here. And we've really seen him take both Trump and Vance to task on cable, on social media. And I think his star has risen as a result of that, but I can't really say that one would be any better than the other. I think this is, you know, this is with her now. This is her decision.",

But if Shapiro buys her half a point in Pennsylvania, that that may be worth it for her.I wonder, as you were looking at some of the headlines, we know that ahead of things like this, a lot of apo (ph) is going to come out and that has certainly happened here. He has faced added scrutiny over the weekend with several media reports, looking at his writings, for instance, in college about Palestinians, how his office handled a sexual harassment report criticism from Pennsylvania Senator Fetterman's team, about his ambitions. You know, knowing that, what do you think? Does that impact things?",

And I don't think Vance's problems are going away.And I do think that Shapiro has always had a little bit of a lead or a head start in this contest, because Pennsylvania is so important to the electoral college map, I'm sure many of your viewers are getting on and doing the calculations, you know, the 19 electoral votes there are so consequential and really hard to replace with other states. And for a governor who won by I believe it was a 20 point margin in a presidential midterm. You know, that really says something, if you can get 120 into that, one point extra so to speak, by putting them in there, that can absolutely be the margin of victory. So, I do think that's an important attribute of his but again, I just don't -- I can't think of an argument that any of these are bad choices. KEILAR: If she doesn't pick Shapiro, I do wonder what some of the criticism for not picking him will be. For instance, Congressman Jake Auchincloss this morning condemned some of his fellow Democrats for criticizing Shapiro's positions on Israel. He said, there's a strong undercurrent of anti-Semitism to that. How much of that do you think factors into this decision when it comes to Governorship Shapiro?",

There were concerns going in, well, we did this poll, and we didn't see that attribute and this or that thing, and people just coalesce behind her. I think the excitement is going to be so big that we will see the same thing.So, I'm not worried about her being criticized for not picking him. And, you know, I welcome a discussion with the Republicans about, you know, Israel or anti-Semitism, because it was Donald Trump who said that there were good people on both sides when neo-Nazis were marching in Charlottesville. So, I'm not concerned either way on this. I think this is really about who she thinks is ready to serve and who will be a good partner for her.",

I thought Tim Kaine was an excellent choice, and he really was a terrific asset to us on the campaign trail.You know, some people came up to us after the campaign and said, I really wish you'd gotten somebody younger or somebody who is going to get the base really excited. And I think, you know, we've seen some of that, for example, around Governor Walz. So, I think that's something for her to take into consideration. And I will say at the end of the day, I think we get really excited about this choice because it's this unknown. And we know we're going to learn soon. But I think the history on this is that this choice isn't enormously impactful. As we said, maybe in Pennsylvania, she could get a little advantage with Shapiro. But, you know, we saw the rollout of J.D. Vance has kind of flopped. But Trump's numbers really haven't changed that much. He, you know, Biden had dropped and so, he added advantage over him. But Harris has filled up that gap. And now we're back to a dead heat again. So, you know, I and I will say it's important. I think Trump is a great example of someone who made a very tactical pick, he tried to get someone who he thought would do well on T.V. and get his base excited. And it's clear there's not a lot of chemistry there. So, that's why I honestly -- I just hope that she's going with her gut and picking someone she's excited about, because that's one of those intangibles that, you know, it comes through. And it's going to come through at the convention and I really do believe that's the most important element here.",

What you're seeing is fear, it's not panic.And I'll reiterate that again, I'm also very much watching the fact that we are off the market lows at this moment. So, the market close today is going to be really important to give us a sense of direction. You said it, Brianna, there is a palpable fear that the U.S. economy is slowing more than we thought. And we saw that last week. It was exacerbated by weak manufacturing data by the jobs numbers too. And that, of course, then raise questions about why on earth the Federal Reserve didn't lower interest rates last week when it had the chance. My context on this, no one's talking about imminent recession. Yes, the economy is slowing. But we are still overall adding jobs. So, even on this, I think we need to take a deep breath. I even would be tempted to say if this were the only thing going on that perhaps stock markets are overreacting to the U.S. data. The point is, though, it's not the only thing going on. We have seen tech stocks fueling the stock market rally all year. And suddenly people are looking at that and saying, have they gone too far too fast, you can see the weakness in tech stocks today. That's also adding to this and it's been going on for days. Then, overnight, we get the Japanese stock market falling 12 percent. I'll allow you to use the P word on that. Now that's panic, you don't see that kind of move in a big global market without seeing spillover effects into the U.S. markets. And the other thing I'll add here is also geopolitical risk. You've been talking about it, it all fuels sentiment, in addition to this being a summer Monday. Now, there are silver linings here, one, if you're a stock market investor and around 60 percent of Americans are, then you're still up around 10 percent on the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ. We're just giving back gains, at least for now. And if you're a borrower out there, you're struggling with high prices, which let's face it, it is everybody. The conversation around the Federal Reserve now has completely changed. We are not talking about will or won't the Federal Reserve cut rates in September, we're talking about how much. They're watching all of this, and we will continue to watch the data. And if they need to cut rates by more than a quarter of a percentage point in September, they will do so. So, I think it's clear to say help is coming even if it feels like it's late guys at this stage.",
