U.S. president-elect Donald Trump learns he will be sentenced for his hush money conviction 10 days before taking office.

And opponents of South Korea's impeached president have been rallying near his official residence for hours now.That's where investigators tried to detain him yesterday but were blocked by his security detail. The arrest warrant against Yoon is valid until Monday, so they may try again. Yoon has devoted followers, though, just like the U.S. president- elect, Donald Trump. And as Mike Valerio reports, they're ripping some pages from Donald Trump's political playbook. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An unprecedented scene in South Korea as investigators move to arrest embattled president Yoon Suk Yeol. After 200 soldiers and members of the president's security team blocked their way, the investigators turned back empty handed. Outside, the president's supporters rejoice, waving South Korean and American flags alike. Yoon's supporters channeling pro-Trump slogans, even wearing these MAGA style hats, which say, against unconstitutional impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  If President Trump takes office later in January, I hope he will be able to sympathize with South Korea's rigged election, since President Trump also suffered from the last election, too. VALERIO (voice-over):  South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest allies with almost 30,000 troops stationed there. The country faces one of its worst political crises in years that started in December, when amid a series of scandals and calls for his impeachment, President Yoon declared martial law, shocking the democratic nation. In a few hours, lawmakers quickly gathered to overturn martial law but not before the army entered the National Assembly trying to stop politicians from voting, following the president's alleged orders to shoot the doors if necessary. That led to the 64-year-old being stripped of his presidential powers after members of his own party voted to impeach him. Thousands now call for his resignation. He's accused of leading an insurrection for which he could face the death penalty. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  I believe that the president should be arrested rapidly and the appropriate procedure must be implemented to reset the peace in the country. VALERIO (voice-over):  Meantime, his lawyers called the attempted arrest illegal and vowed to take action. The first session of the impeachment trial is set for January 14th. Yoon, a prosecutor himself said he's willing to defend himself but after Friday's clashes, doubts loom over the president's willingness to face the law -- Mike Valerio, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now he had been backing him and really giving him all of his support for some time now, starting out with that endorsement. It wasn't just the fact that he endorsed him but it was also that he did it on the Speaker's timeline. The two of them had discussed Donald Trump endorsing Mike Johnson on New Year's Day. They had a plan. And then Johnson believed it was so critical that he went to Trump and asked him to do it earlier. And Trump obliged. In addition to that, Donald Trump, we know, was calling several holdouts, Republican holdouts, trying to convince them of Johnson. And even after two Republicans voted initially against Johnson, Donald Trump called in to a private meeting with Johnson. And these holdouts, which ultimately won Johnson the speakership. Now he has congratulated Johnson. He said this in a post on Truth Social. \"Congratulations to Speaker Mike Johnson for receiving an unprecedented vote of confidence in Congress. Mike will be a great Speaker and our country will be the beneficiary. \"The people of America have waited four years for the common sense, strength and leadership. They'll get it now and America will be greater than ever before.\" Just two things to note here as to why we are told that Trump was all in on Johnson, twofold. One is that he believed that there were no other members who could actually win the speakership, that he believed Johnson was the only person who could get the votes. But on the other part of this was that he had no appetite -- this is what senior advisers said -- for a prolonged Speaker fight, particularly this close to the inauguration, that he had seen what happened with McCarthy, how it had sucked all the oxygen out of the room. He wanted it to look as though the GOP, the Republican Party, was united behind him as well, as he wanted all the focus on him, as we are really now just days away, seemingly, from that inauguration, where Donald Trump will be sworn in as President of the United States -- Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington.

Imagine Putin offers a ceasefire, a complete cessation of hostilities from the Russian side tomorrow, which will give the American conservative media the opportunity to report that Donald Trump finally brought peace, that he promised so many times. So I think that's pretty much a valuable bargaining chip for Putin. And for that, at the very least, there's clearly a gap between potential maximum and minimum demands from the Russian side. Of course, they would bring up the demilitarization of Ukraine and guarantees that Ukraine will not join NATO.

Stay tuned.(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Emotional scenes in Damascus on Friday as Syrians released from a prison notorious during the Assad regime celebrated their new freedom with dancing and hugs. Others carried photos of missing loved ones. Rights groups have long documented torture and mass executions in Syria's prisons. Meanwhile the French and German foreign ministers met with Syria's de facto leader in Damascus on Friday in the first visit by European Union ministers to the country since the fall of the Assad regime. France and Germany expressed cautious optimism about working with Syria's new government and said the constitutional process must include women and all of Syria's minority groups. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

INARA is in the process of setting up a mobile primary medical care van. And Arwa Damon joins me now live from Istanbul in Turkiye.Arwa, first of all, we want to get to the work that you were able to do or start doing in Syria, because I think that the trauma that children have suffered there, both physical and mental, is so different than any other conflict. Because you had the war, you had children who grew up hearing only bombs or getting wounded. And then you had that economic hardship that ensued afterwards. Describe a little bit of what you found there and what you think you can do.",

Because prior to the fall of the Assad regime, mothers used to be able to tell their kids, when they asked where Daddy is, they used to be able to say, well, Daddy is with the regime. Now children are going to their mothers and saying, well, Mommy, the regime is gone. So why isn't Daddy home? And mothers don't know how to explain to a child that Daddy has disappeared and that she doesn't actually have these answers for them. And then also, especially for those children, the millions of children who either were too small to remember what a life without war was like or those who were born into this war, I mean, Fred, they've never slept on a mattress. They don't know what it's like to live inside a structure with walls. Their entire life has been tents. You know, hot water, they don't know what it is to have hot water running out of your faucet. So along with this mobile medical van, we also managed to set up in this Damascus suburb called Daraya, which, I'm sure you'll remember, for years was besieged and bombed by the Assad regime. Something of a community center space for children, where we can also run mental health and psychosocial activities. And speaking to the head of the local organization that provided the space for us, he was saying things like, you know, they've never had a soft surface to run on. They've never had access to so many toys at the same time. And this is really when you grow to realize not just how much Syria's children were deprived of but how much they actually need.",

Their relatives have been killed, people who were imprisoned. How do you see that shaping up? Do you think there's a chance to achieve that?",
