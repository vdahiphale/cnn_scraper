Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting face-to-face right now with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.

The Secretary of State who is the first Biden cabinet official to visit China throughout Biden's administration more than two and a half years is sitting down, meeting with President Xi, we don't know much about the meeting yet, because it's still ongoing.But here's what we do know. There have been a number of hours that the secretary has engaged with Chinese officials over the course of the last two days here in Beijing, spending more than five hours in a working meeting with Foreign Minister Qin Gang yesterday, followed by a working dinner. And then he met earlier today with Wang Yi, who is China's top diplomat for three hours here in Beijing. A number of issues, State Department officials last night told reporters who are here on the ground that they were making progress on a number of threads. They said that the meetings had been direct. What they didn't do was get into the substance of these meetings just yet. Of course, they were briefing us in the middle of this two-day stretch here in Beijing. So what we're waiting to see is if there can be any forward progress on a few things that the United States set out to do on this trip. First of all, they want to regularize communications between the U.S. and China, particularly when it comes to military-to-military channels of communications between the two countries. And then, there were a number of concerning issues that the secretary was going to raise with his Chinese counterpart. One of those, of course, being the issue of synthetic opioids in the United States, which is a major killer of Americans. Fentanyl, the input from fentanyl, many of those substances come from China. That's something that he was going to discuss with his Chinese counterparts. Also three Americans who were wrongly detained in China, he wanted to raise that to seek ground if there was a way to try and get those Americans out of this country. And then, of course, the issue locally here in the region of Taiwan. And yesterday, the foreign ministry put out a readout of the secretary's meetings, and it was clear that Taiwan was a sticking point. Because that readout said that China's foreign ministry made demands regarding the issue of Taiwan, and said that, that is the issue that presents the most pronounced problem for U.S.-China relations. So, we'll watch to see what kind of conversations they had about Taiwan. Of course, the ongoing war in Ukraine was also expected to be a topic that they were going to raise. They secretary has a press conference later this morning.",

Police say the gunfire began at the state police barracks in Mifflintown. CNN's Polo Sandoval has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, this was a nearly 4-hour long ordeal that culminated a violent shoot-out between Pennsylvania state troopers and a suspect who was armed with a hunting rifle, and a scene that was described on Sunday by authorities as a situation that was as harrowing as it gets. It all started on Saturday afternoon when police say a suspect, a 38- year-old Pennsylvania man pulled into the barracks at the Pennsylvania state police in Lewistown, which is about 57 miles west of the capital city of Harrisburg, and then it opened fire on their parked patrol cars. He then drove away, and it was nearly two hours later, that the suspect then took aim at Lieutenant James Wagner. A married father who is also a 21-year-old veteran, he critically wounded him. We're told he's still in the hospital. Witnesses even using the lieutenant's radio to summon help from authorities. And it was later, a couple of hours later that authorities then tracked down the suspect near some businesses, near a restaurant, when that suspect reportedly shot and killed a trooper Yack Rogell(ph), about 29 years old, a member of the force there before the suspect was then shot and killed, ending what was an extremely violent shoot-out that was described by the Lieutenant Colonel you're about to hear from as virtual war zone.",

He would call into some of the 911 centers and then tell authorities that he was at a particular location, authorities would arrive and then he was gone. We also know according to authorities that he used a very high caliberrifle that was customarily used to hunt large game, and that anybody armor that Pennsylvania state troopers would have been using would have been no match for the suspect's fire power. Now, the Pennsylvania state troopers are moving forward with this investigation while not only planning a line of duty funeral, but also continuing to support their fellow trooper that remains hospitalized.

In that meeting, she said that the foundation of China-U.S. relations is, quote, \"in the people.\" Now, for insight into the meeting that is underway in Beijing today, according to the assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, who was also present at this meeting, she said this, quote, \"President Xi said state-to-state interaction should always be based on mutual respect and sincerity.\" Hoped this visit by Secretary Blinken could make positive contributions to stabilizing China-U.S. relations. Earlier today, Blinken met with China's top diplomat Wang Yi for three hours. It's a meeting the State Department described as candid and productive. But Wang Yi also asked the U.S. to lift unilateral sanctions and to halt its tech crackdown. And he also reiterated that Taiwan is one of China's core concerns. A senior U.S. official says Blinken's main goal here is to just re- establish the lines of communication, especially direct military-to- military communications between China and the U.S. Over the weekend, we heard from U.S. President Joe Biden, he says that he believes that Blinken's trip could ease tensions between the U.S. and China. And he added that he hopes to meet with President Xi Jinping in, quote, \"the next few months\".

China is on an expansion track. It says it's expanding globally in terms of trade. It's also expanding its control of what it considers its territory, including the South China Sea area, and eventually, Taiwan. Whereas, the U.S. is in a containment strategy, trying to contain that expansion and signal to Beijing that, OK, we understand that you want to compete on a global level, and eventually match us in terms of military might. But while you're doing that expansion, we are going to make sure that you play by the rules or at least, try to. So, these two sides are coming from this diametrically-opposed position, and they've got to essentially agree to not let fighting break out to have a civil dispute, as opposed to having this fall into something like armed conflict.",

But it was at about 12:25 in the morning when they received a 9-1-1 call that reported an alleged fight nearby. So these law enforcement officers responded to the 9-1-1 call, and as they were doing that, they heard the gunfire. They immediately went back to the Juneteenth celebration. And what authorities are saying now is that, an unknown number of suspects fired multiple rounds on multiple weapons. And it was chaotic, according to many of these witnesses.
