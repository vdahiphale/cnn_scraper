She taught me how to -- that when you were a senator, you better have your act together. You better know the details. I have one of my fondest memories is staying overnight at her house in San Francisco after a political event. She invited me to stay there. And at 7:30 in the morning summoned to me. She was sitting up in bed with these fuzzy slippers on reading the entire draft Patent Reform Act and started as a young member of the Judiciary Committee. She's quizzing me on various parts of it. She got ahead because of true grit and her fierceness. She was not want to be that emotional all the time, I'll be honest.

And it was noted today by Senator Murkowski on the floor of how Senator Feinstein clearly would have believed in a dress code. And I know that because I took over the Rules Committee, we were both the only women that have ever chaired it. So she would talk to me about this often. But at one point, she told me that this seersucker suit date was coming up. We don't wear a lot of seersucker suits in Minnesota. She know that. So she called to get my measurements.

You -- one of the things you mentioned, Senator, was the fact that she fought very hard to get the intelligence report about the enhanced interrogation, the torture report released.

I think that was, in some ways, among her finest moments here in the Senate, showing toughness and persistence in fighting for the prerogatives of the Senate. She also is largely responsible for passing the assault weapons ban, something that was unthinkable when she came here. But because of her own personal experience, with the tragedy of the assassination of Harvey Milk that catapulted her to a position of leadership as mayor of San Francisco, she spoke movingly and repeatedly. It was one of the very first things she talked to me about when I became a senator in a very gracious but forceful way, soliciting me to join as a co-sponsor of her attempt to reenact it.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, badass women of Washington. This was 2017. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: The door to the office opened and he came in. I heard the door slam. I heard the shots. I smelled the cordite. He whisked by. I walked down the line of supervisor's offices and found Harvey Milk, put my finger in a bullet hole trying to get a pulse. It was the first person I'd ever seen shot to death. And that began a saga. BASH (voice-over): I've covered Dianne Feinstein for many years and she rarely talks about that traumatic day 40 years ago. But looking back that tragedy put her on an unexpected path to becoming the icon she is now. From first female mayor of San Francisco to California's first female United States senator.
