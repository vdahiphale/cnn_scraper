Shocking allegations as Canada suggests India was behind the murder of a prominent Sikh leader this summer. How Canada's Prime Minister is trying to ease tensions now.President Biden and Zelenskyy make their cases for continued support for Ukraine from the United Nations. And archaeologists uncovered treasures and secrets of the Egyptian coast. What we're learning about those Egypt times. The Canadian Prime Minister is trying to lower the temperature with India without letting up on its investigation after a round of sharp accusations and diplomatic expulsions. Tensions spiked just after Justin Trudeau suggested the Indian government could be behind the murder of a Sikh leader on Canadian soil, and that allegation did not go over well with New Delhi. CNN's Paula Newton has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voiceover): Hardeep Singh Nijjar was just steps away from the temple he led in worship when Canadian police say he was shot several times by masked gunman who had marked him for murder as he sat in his gray truck. Police say the suspects then fled on foot, possibly in this car, a silver Toyota Camry. Canadian police released this image pleading for the public's help. That was mid-June. There has been no trace of the car or suspects since. The trail had gone cold. But many in the Sikh community in British Columbia believe it had all the hallmarks of a political assassination. Then, in a stunning disclosure, their suspicions were voiced by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",

Trudeau says he confronted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the accusations at the G20 Summit last week but Modi would not accept his claims. Trudeau instead went public with the accusations but not before speaking with U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies. This audacious killing in front of a place of worship is now no closer to being solved. Canada and India have traded tit for tat diplomatic expulsions with India firing back that Canada shelters terrorists and extremists. At issue, is sick independence. India has long sought to put down the separatist movement to divide India and it labeled Nijjar a wanted terrorist in 2022. While Canada is leaning on what it describes as solid evidence, Canadian police are still asking for the public's help telling CNN this homicide remains a priority investigation. Paula Newton, CNN.

But there were three words that really stood out from that statement issued by India's External Affairs Ministry which is unsubstantiated, motivated and absurd. I want to very quickly, Anna, take you through some of the top headlines from the national newspapers here in India and how they've been covering this diplomatic route that's been escalating day by day between Canada and India.I want to start with Times of India. It reads absurd. India slams through discharge of hand in Niger skilling, both countries expel one diplomat each, ties moving into deep freeze. [02:05:06] Now this is one-line ties moving into deep freeze that you got to see in most of the newspapers. But what really stood out to me in this newspaper The Times of India as well is U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand voice concern but shown Canada's call for joint condemnation. Perhaps one reason for this, Anna, at this point is that there is no strong evidence or any evidence at all that has been put out by Justin Trudeau in Parliament. Especially after making such a strong statement in Parliament Monday. Let's go on now to the other newspapers here. The Hindustan Times. Trudeau triggers diplomatic firestorm with India remark ties with Canada hit a new low. Diplomats expelled. Canada updates travel advisory for India. HardeepNijjar, a designated terrorist. For India, Nijjar was declared a terrorist in 2020. And there are some charges, very serious charges against him. He's also called an absconder by the Ministry of Home Affairs here in India. Now let's go into the Indian Express where it says Trudeau claims Indian Government lead to Khalistan leaders killing. Delhi says absurd. Again, India, Canada ties at new low, expelled diplomats in tit for tat action. Now, what's very important here is to see how most of the western nations really react to this for now. They've condemned the death. They've said that there is concern over this, but no one's really come out and support at Trudeau here despite him dialing both Biden as well as the U.K. Prime Minister. The ties are at an all-time low. There's no doubt about that. And we have to see where it goes from here. Trade ties are not really the best at this point. We also did know that Trudeau before coming in decided not to talk about trade agreements with Modi during that bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit earlier this month. So, we'll have to wait and watch and see how this really plays out. You have senior diplomats on both sides that have been expelled. And we're just waiting to see if there's any other reaction coming in from the Indian government. At this point, Trudeau has said that he's not trying to escalate tensions but the fact that on the floor of parliament is gone ahead and made that strong statement is an escalation in itself.

But it is rarely have ever been accused of being involved with assassinations in countries in the West, and particularly a country like Canada, a key Western partner. And another reason why these allegations are so stunning is that they were made public. The Canadian government decided not to keep them quiet. Decided not to convey them through more discreet means. And I think that that's such an unusual thing to happen. And clearly, it's contributed to this really deep crisis between India and Canada had the Canadian government not gone public with these allegations.

There's also a very large Indian diaspora in Canada, and people to people relations are very strong on the whole you've got -- Canada is one of the top destinations for Indian students overseas.And that was strategic convergences in this relationship as well. I mean, Canada values China for the role, it believes that can play in helping counter the challenge posed by China. But no, that we are experiencing, I think, a very pivotal critical moment for this relationship. For many years, it's been, you know, the Sikh issue has been the albatross around the neck of the candidate in the relationship but it's been able to get around that. Trade ties have grown, defense ties have grown, the strategic convergences have been there. But what we're starting to see now is the tensions are so high that it seeping into other aspects of the relationship. Just a few weeks ago, Canada announced that it was going to pause talks with India on a new trade deal. So when you start to see indications that these tensions over the Sikh issue are impacting the relationship on the whole, including areas that had been safe for many years such as trade relations. That's unsettling because there is, you know, you do have countries with fraught relationships, including India and China that still managed to get along through commercial cooperation and the like. But if you're starting to see that, you know, this is India-Canada relationship shows that it's not as resilient and foolproof as its backers may hope it is, that I think is an ominous sign for the relationship.",

And so, the message, I think, needs to be heard loud and clear among the Republican leadership, particularly in the House of Representatives. That is, you're looking at a political showdown over the future of the budget, over the future military spending in general and over the future of spending to support Ukraine. It is there.
