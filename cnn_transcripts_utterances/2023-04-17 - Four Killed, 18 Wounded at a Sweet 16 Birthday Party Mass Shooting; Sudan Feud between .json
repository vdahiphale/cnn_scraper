Mr. Kishida was evacuated from the scene unharmed. Meanwhile, police have raided the home of the 24-year old man accused of throwing the explosive object. More than 10 boxes of materials were removed from the property. Police are still investigating the motive for the attack and say the suspect is staying silent.

If you go to a political rally in the United States often cases, you will have to go through a metal detector. Your bags will have to be checked.

We first had the top diplomat, then, as you mentioned the President himself, Xi Jinping, and now the new defense minister in his first overseas trip in that role, very significant to see the commitment the level of engagement on both sides, and I think to some degree, the target audience of those upticks was the United States. The Chinese defense minister not missing an opportunity to mention the cold war, saying that Moscow and Beijing have very strong relations that far surpassed the military political alliances of the cold war. I think pretty clear statement on the fact that both sides are hoping this relationship will serve as a counterpoint to the U.S.-led alliance and its support for Ukraine, even though of course publicly, Beijing has not officially expressed support for Russia's war. It continues to foster that relationship. So, as I say, no concrete steps emerging from this meeting, but very significant upticks as we watch how this relationship unfolds.",

Let me take you through the sequence of events on Saturday evening. You know, usually you'd see something like this, Rosemary, in a Bollywood movie. It would be orchestrated the shooting, the gun shots, but this actually happened in the presence of several police officers in the presence of the media, and this was covered, believe it or not, on live television. You have a former lawmaker from India who was -- who has been convicted. He is a convicted criminal along with his brother. They pulled out of a jeep, a police van, and were taken towards a hospital in a city in Uttar Pradesh, of course, in the presence of police personnel, and all of a sudden you see a lot of reporters approaching them. Now, these two men are handcuffed and there is a chain around the handcuffs that's in the hands of the police officers as well. Now, these media personnel go up to talk to them. There is a brief interaction before you hear the first gunshot that goes off and what follows is at least a dozen more. After that, there's complete panic in the area. You don't see much on camera. I'm assuming that the camera person might have fallen with the camera because of which you don't see real movement, but you can hear the voices of panic. A lot of questions being raised over the security that these two men had who had been taken for medical examinations at that point. Also, right now, what we do know is that the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, has held a series of meetings to understand what the situation of law and order he's in the state after this incident, which is making headlines every day ever since it's happened. And we're going to see now what he has to see. He really hasn't come out. There's been no press briefing from him yet.

We call it that around the region. You know, you had a peaceful day, vast protest movement, toppling a long-serving autocrat.

So, there is hope in the fact that none can really sustainably prevail, but I think it's really important that we see continued concerted action not just by regional actors, but also by those further abroad to try and add the various actors to come back to the negotiating table to agree to a civilian government, which they were all very close to bring to and maybe to plant some of the issues which they're enabled, and which brought them to the, to fighting, especially on reform of the security forces, perhaps to plant that for later.",
