At over 200,000 square miles, France is about the size of one and a half California`s or two Colorado. We`re heading to France now where the country continues to face ongoing protests over the government`s plan to overhaul the pension system. The government wants to change the national retirement age from 62 to 64 and the government says the current system is already not economically sustainable and says that citizens are living longer now. So something needs to change. Here`s CNN`s Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley on the ground in Paris with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Violent protests, garbage on the streets and two no confidence votes, President Macron`s planto overhaul the French pension system has caused uproar. But why all the fuss? As France`s population ages and the French live longer, the government here says that it can`t afford the pension scheme that allows retirement at 62, so it`s raising the majority pensionable age to 64. Opponents of the reform argue that the changes will hit blue collar workers because they start work earlier in life and women unfairly. The opposition has been vocal and strikes have hit across the country since mid-January. Parisian streets have been choked with 10,000 tons of rubbish as a result of a garbage collector`s strike. But public transport and even the oil industry have been affected. Aside from the content of the reform, many in France have been upset by the manner in which they`ve been rammed through without parliamentary support. Fearing that the law wouldn`t secure a majority vote for pension reform in the National Assembly, Macron`s Prime Minister invoked a constitutional mechanism that allows the President to force fiscal legislation onto the statute book without a vote, and that sparked nationwide demonstrations and violence in Paris, especially. On Monday, the government survived two national assembly no confidence votes. The bills are now likely to become law, and Macron faces opposition from the French far right, the far left and a sizable chunk of the center. And the angers against the reforms show no signs of ending and could hobble his second term in the Elysee Palace. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
