It happened as demonstrations raged across the country for a fifth straight night. Police say they detained more than 700 people, some of whom set fires, overturned cars and damaged buildings.

So, first of all, what's the latest on this alleged attack on the mayor?CATHERINE NORRIS TRENT, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, FRANCE 24: Well, the latest we're hearing, Kim, is that prosecutors have now opened a formal investigation into attempted murder after this attack, which is shocking a lot of people in France as they're waking up this Sunday. Images of extreme violence coming out of this town of L'Hay-les-Roses which is a suburb just south of Paris. So it seems that the mayor's family, the mayor of that town, his family was inside, his wife and his two young children went around 1:30 a.m. a car rammed into the building. The prosecutors say they believe that that was to try and burn it down and in fact pictures of -- of a huge blaze at the property were broadcast. The family managed to escape but his wife was injured. We believe her leg was fractured and one of the children was injured too. So the mayor of that town has said he is shocked by the violence. Political reaction coming out to has been of people very shocked to hear of those events. We've seen in previous nights, town halls and city halls across France coming under attack basically in these riots with been set on fire outside, vehicle set on fire, angry protesters or rioters coming to those symbols of the French state of French authority. But this is an attack on seemingly on his family. And we've had reactions for example from Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right national rally party saying that a new milestone has been reached in France. So there is increasing pressure on authorities to crack down on the violence.",

This all comes as Special Counsel Jack Smith is ramping up his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including some of those efforts by the President and his allies to reach out to state officials. Now, the Governor's spokesperson he downplayed the significance of this call to us saying in a statement to CNN, frankly, nothing here is new nor is it news to anyone following this issue the last two years. Governor Ducey defended the results of Arizona's 2020 election. He certified the election, and he made it clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by evidence to be brought forward.

These are long range weapons either fired from occupied parts of southeastern Ukraine or from the Black Sea as well. And interestingly enough, the Ukrainian Air Force says that this is the first time in 12 days that drones have been used to fire at the Capitol.What is also unusual is the fact that all of them were shot down, which is why the Ukrainians had been pushing for more air defense for their skies because President Zelenskyy said last month that they simply do not have despite what they've had been given from the west already, they do not have enough air defense systems to protect both cities and also troops on the front lines. And Zelenskyy, as you mentioned, also met with Pedro Sanchez, yesterday, the Spanish Prime Minister and there were some headlines that come -- came out of that, including the extraordinary claim that you mentioned that 21,000 Wagner mercenaries were killed along with 80,000 injured in eastern Ukraine. Now, CNN can't verify that kind of a number. But Zelenskyy did go on to say that look the insurrection attempt in Russia is definitely weakening Russia on the front lines and he says that Ukraine has to take advantage of that. [05:20:08] But he also seemed to preempt some criticism of the speed at which the Ukrainians are moving forward with their counter offensive saying that look, unlike what he describes as the cannon fodder of Wagner mercenaries, Ukrainians have to be much more careful with their own moves along the heavily mined front lines, because they value every single life. One of the thing that I thought was interesting and worth pointing out from that press conference, Kim, is that, President Zelenskyy was asked whether or not he thinks that he is the person in the world who is most at in danger right now. And he said, well, no, because he thinks that Vladimir Putin is much more in danger than he is because from his vantage point, it's only the Russians that are interested in killing him.

So first of all, CNN spoke with you, you know, what -- over a week ago, I guess is all of this, the Wagner insurrection was unfolding. Could you ever have guessed that this was how it would all play out? NIGEL GOULD-DAVIES, SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: The course of events of the past week has been extremely unpredictable and there's still a great deal. We don't know about them. And in particular, the circumstances in which the acute crisis was suddenly diffused. A bargain appears to have been struck under conditions of extreme pressure on all sides to allow Prigozhin to go to Belarus. And maybe we can talk a bit more about that. But what's clear is that this is a tectonic moment in Russian history. And even if the immediate threat to the Kremlin has been averted, the shockwaves of it continued to spread out across Russia, and to sow deep anxiety and unease among Russian elites in particular. And if there's at least one really important ongoing strand of this, which is clearly not resolved yet, it's the question of how much further this went than Prigozhin and Wagner, specifically, the suspicion that others are even closer to Putin may have been involved. And the fact that General Surovikin has been detained, appears being questioned for several days now, suggest that this plot, all this plan went further.",

How far they will be folded into which -- which forces. There's some suggestion that it might be some of them in Belarus might be absorbed into Belarus's regular armed forces. And of course, Belarus is a co-belligerent, but not yet a co combatant in the war, it hasn't sent its own forces directly to fight against Ukraine. Those preside -- provide all sorts of military services for Russia. But if in whatever way, and whatever form a critical mass of the Wagner -- current or former Wagner forces were permanently located in Belarus, that would create the potential new worry of another axis of attack from Ukraine's north down into -- much closer to say to Kyiv or even Ukraine's western border than the fighting that's currently going on. And the Russian regular forces did in fact, mount such an attack at the beginning of the war itself, it would be an unwelcome development for Ukraine, of course, if this threat further to the west and further to the north would be renewed.",

The tragedy has sparked public outrage against the police who have been accused of systemic racism.

This included graphic images which show the nine minutes and 29 seconds that Police Officer Derek Chauvin held Floyd to the payment with his knee on Floyd's neck, similar to Nahel in France, Floyd's death led to widespread protests and sparked a national conversation about race, police brutality, and social injustice.

These are the people that greet you when you get to the hotel, the people that are behind the scenes that are cooking and cleaning. And they have a number of demands. They're of course asking for higher wages and better pensions. Specifically, they're asking for a $5 an hour increase.But they're also asking for better health benefits for safer workloads. And they're also focused on a housing fund. And part of the reason is that the union says that a lot of the employees the workers cannot live in the areas where the hotels are, where they work. They're pointing to members who are having to commute two, three hours a day just to get to where they work. And so they say this is making it extremely difficult for them. And I want you to listen to what one of the union members says about being an essential worker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
