Two Democratic senators calling for the FAA to reassess whether the size of seats on planes are, in fact, too small in the event of an emergency. There's new legislation from Senators Tammy Duckworth and Tammy Baldwin urging the FAA to conduct more cabin tests with, quote, realistic conditions.CNN's Pete Muntean is joining us live.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Erica. You know, more seats onboard an airplane, the airlines got to make them smaller. But with more seats, it makes it harder for the airlines to evacuate a plane in the case of an emergency.I just spoke to Tammy Duckworth about this and she says this is all about safety, even though the unintended outcome here could be a federal regulation that makes it so that airlines can't make seats any smaller. Here is the rub. Right now the regulation -- sorry, the average seat size is about 31 inches onboard a plane. It's called a pitch. That's the leg room from your seat essentially to your knee. It was about 35 inches back in 1960. But since that time, men are the example here, they've gained about 30 pound on average according to the CDC, they've gotten an inch taller. So, the FAA looked at this back in 2019. They did a mock evacuation. And they figured by doing this they only -- a sample of people who were over 18, under 60, no kids, no car seats, no carry-on bags. So, Duckworth says it is long overdue to redo this experiment. And this bill would do exactly that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): It is very much long overdue. The standard that the FAA is using was set in the 1960s. And the fact of the matter is air travel has changed a lot since the '60s. There are a lot of folks onboard, for example, with carry-on luggage because we can't -- many people can't check their luggage anymore because there's additional fees. The FAA doesn't test -- do these tests where they include carry-on luggage. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why it's 53 plus a little bit more. And I was just interested, how common is an age gap that's 53 years? So, this is the spouse age gaps in the United States. And we'll break it down by getting wider and wider in the age gap in the relationship. Look, about 10 percent of relationships are ten years plus. You get to 30 plus years, you drop down to about 0.5 percent. So, less than 1 percent. You get to 50 plus years, look at that, 0.05. And let me give you an idea. We're dealing with such a small sample size, it could be somewhere in that area. But it's basically very, very, very small. And the other thing to know about age gaps is that they are, in fact, becoming smaller in this country. So, the average male/female space age gap now is just 2.2 years. You go back about 50 years ago, it was three years. You go back to 1920, about 4.4 years. So, the age gaps have shrunk in half on average.",

And, again, that's just an approximation. It could be even smaller than that.And the other thing that I'll note is that mothers in this country, we just got a new report, they're also becoming older, age 40 plus. The share they make up of newborns, back in 1992 was just 1 percent. It's now 4 percent. Now, under age 18, that's dropping from about 5 percent in '92 to about 4 percent in 2022.
