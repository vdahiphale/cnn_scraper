In poll after poll the economy, of course, remains the leading priority for voters. Donald Trump was trying to focus in on pocketbook concerns. He gave a speech at The Economic Club of New York and here's what he said about the cost of childcare. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I have to stay with childcare. I want to stay with childcare. But those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just -- that I just told you about. We're going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as childcare is talked about as being expensive it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taking in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Harris campaign reporting just this morning they raised $361 million in August. That is triple the amount -- nearly triple the amount that the Trump campaign raised in the same period of time.So you better brace yourself if you live in a battleground state. If you turn on your TV, you're going to be seeing political ads from here on out. Joining us now to talk about all of this, Stef Kight, political reporter for Axios; Stephanie Lai, political reporter for Bloomberg; and Gabby Birenbaum, D.C. correspondent for The Nevada Independent. Welcome to all of you. Thank you so much for being here on this Friday as we are heading into this sprint here. I want to circle back to what Donald Trump said and -- about childcare there, Gabby, because I think there were a lot of people that were kind of scratching their heads about exactly what he was saying. He seemed to be implying that he was going to change -- he was going to impose tariffs and that we're going to save money, and therefore we were going to pay for childcare. Do you -- the reaction to that was a little bit head-scratching. The Harris campaign posted it all by itself without even commenting on it or anything like that. What did you hear in that, and what has the reaction been? GABBY BIRENBAUM, D.C. CORRESPONDENT, THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT:  Yeah, it's really hard to pull out any, I think, coherent piece of policy. That was a long and rambling answer. He seems to think if we improve the economy through tariffs and through cutting regulations then the price of things, including childcare, would go down. The Harris campaign obviously has talked about this care economy in a more robust way about sort of the need for childcare and the need for the federal government to sort of come in and subsidize those costs on some level. And so, yeah, I think posting without any comment from the Harris campaign really kind of says it all.",

Vance was also asked about this on the campaign trail and he seemed to say well, family members could step up and help people with childcare needs. This is one area where Democrats do feel, I think, that they have an advantage. STEPHANIE LAI, POLITICS REPORTER, BLOOMBERG:  Certainly, and I think we've seen that on the Hill as well. When it comes to the discussions that are being had it's mainly led by Democratic lawmakers. And so when it comes to the topic of childcare that's something that Republicans, especially this Republican ticket, hasn't really touched on very significantly. And if you listen back to the question that was asked at the Economic Club it was very specifically asking what sort of legislation would you propose, and he didn't have an answer for that.",

So it's something that they seem to think is working.And we really have seen the Harris campaign focus their campaign on this kind of vibe of joy and optimism and moving forward. They're trying to make the case that Harris is the person to lead the country into a new era. To move on from Trump. To move on from Biden. And that's the pitch they're making. And they're not going deep in policy because of that, and that's something Axios has been covering closely. Instead of really delving into the detailed policy proposals that Republicans want to fight about in these next 60 days, the Harris campaign is really continuing to focus on their vision for America. This broader idea of joy and contrasting what they are offering the U.S. to Donald Trump. And again, to your point, saying that we're the real patriotic party.",

So as the election nears both campaigns already have begun to think about their possible administration appointees. For Trump, that apparently includes Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO and owner of X already served on two advisory councils during Trump's first term, but he left after Trump announced that he was pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. Musk wrote this on what was then still known as Twitter back in 2017. \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.\" But the tech titan has formally endorsed Trump for a second term, and he did that shortly after the assassination attempt against Trump in July. And now he's apparently willing to return to working with Trump if he wins again in November, specifically to lead a new commission that Trump embraced yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's landed on the front page of all -- many of these newspapers that are spread out here. I'm flashing back a little bit to what it was like to cover Donald Trump's 2017 -- you know, when he came into office in 2017 and he would kind of put these ideas out there, and then they would end up coming to fruition even though it seemed a little bit questionable perhaps at the time. I mean, what do you think is going on here with Trump and Elon Musk? BIRENBAUM:  Yeah. I mean, I think this is the latest step in what's been a real bromance this summer between the two of them, right? I think, look, it's pretty typical for politicians -- particularly Republicans, right -- to talk about waste, fraud, and abuse -- and that's what this is -- and say if I'm a candidate -- you know, if I'm elected, I'm going to cut down on waste in the government. We're going to cut spending. I think this is just sort of a flashy way to dress it up with a rich and famous man. Obviously, I think you highlighted with that tweet the irony between their partnership is that Musk is the famous producer of electric vehicles, which Trump has sort of ideologically railed against. And so there are obviously ideological fault lines between them that I think the image and the bromance is sort of papered over at the moment. But I really think it's just sort of a celebrity way to dress up what's typical waste, fraud, and abuse promise.",
