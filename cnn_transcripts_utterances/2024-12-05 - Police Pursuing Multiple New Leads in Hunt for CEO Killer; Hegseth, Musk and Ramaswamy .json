Sources say police are looking carefully at words written on ammunition tied to the killing, and whether they offer hints about a motive.Also tonight, a very busy day for Trump's transition up on Capitol Hill, Pete Hegseth holds a fresh round of meetings as some key Republican senators still won't commit to backing him for defense secretary, this as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy pitch lawmakers on their new government efficiency commission. And a scathing new U.S. Justice Department report finds a very disturbing pattern of abuse and discrimination inside yet another major American police department. Why federal officials say Memphis needs a serious overhaul. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to our top story tonight, the hunt for a killer in Manhattan. Investigators are tracking down multiple leads right now as they try to piece together the movements of the gunman who fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is outside the New York hostel where police say the person of interest in this case the person of interest stayed before the shooting. Shimon, what are the latest clues at this hour?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right. Well, behind me is the hostile that a person of interest that police have been seeking, wanting to question in connection with this murder. They say that the individual stayed here behind me that he checked in on November 30th and was here four nights, the murder happening yesterday on Wednesday.We've also learned that, you know, he had been here for some time. Police were back at this location today, speaking to people inside, people who've been staying here say that he was staying on the fourth floor. They saw police up there today and also late yesterday, police had arrived here. The other thing police have now is also video, video from the individual that they are seeking on a bicycle on West 85th Street, leaving Central Park and then heading westbound. What's really interesting about that, Wolf, is that in that video, you don't see the backpack that we saw the shooter with, you know, in the video after the shooting. We don't see that in that video. So, police believe that he ditched the backpack at some point inside. Central Park. And they searched the park. They were unable so far to find that backpack. Those are some of the clues that police are working with and trying to track the movements of this individual. And they have a lot of video at this point. Also, Wolf, what they have is a water bottle. You know, we have talked about this yesterday. They found a water bottle. They were able to lift a smudged fingerprint, which right now is not providing any kind of clues to them. But they have that. And they also have a cell phone, what they believe is a burner cell phone, perhaps a non-traceable cell phone. And they are still trying to get inside that phone. It is locked. And as we know, sometimes that just takes a lot of police work and a lot of technical work in order for them to do that. So, that is what right now police are working with. The other thing is, you know, in these photos, police released photos of this individual who checked in to this hostel. He is grinning, from what I can tell from being inside this hostel today. He was at the check in counter. He presented, police sources tell us, a fake New Jersey driver's license. And that is also important, because, obviously, that tells you the level of planning here with this individual. Wolf?",

I think this is where he is. I think I can give you a name. So, they're working through those leads.They're also working on the unusual gun that was used in this killing, where it has this giant silencer on the end of it, and it appears to be jamming. They've been investigating a version of basically a weapon favored by assassins that comes with the silencer that is a bolt action weapon. It is extraordinarily quiet. But what we interpreted as jamming may actually be him racking one bullet out as the next one is seated in the chamber to fire. They've recovered the six shell casings, actually three shell casings, three live rounds. And that's where they found these cryptic messages written on them.",

They're trying to identify this person in the photographs, a person on the video who commits the shooting, and they're also trying to find him physically where he is.Once they can attach a confident I.D. to that person, they get an entire new universe of leads to follow, right? So, they'll be able to quickly locate where he lives. They'll locate family members, associates. They'll execute search warrants on all those places. They'll likely have access to things he left behind, like computer media, other phones, things like that, writings, they might uncover evidence of motive. So, once they make that crucial identification, things will get much tougher for this person to stay out ahead of them. So, that's why it's so important for people who see this photograph and think they may have recognized this person to call in to the tip line and let them know what you think.",

And this is kind of a mantra in the insurance industry for how you get away and keep a profit by simply denying claims. It really does suggest that this shooter is a person who is a disgruntled either employee, but far more likely a citizen customer. In other words, somebody who had UnitedHealthcare insurance and felt that their claim was unjustly denied or delayed, or even took them to court and found that they were deposed and that the insurance company defended their denial. Or if not this shooter, particularly someone very close to him, a family member may have suffered or even died. And in his mind, this directly due to the actions of an insurance company. It could be UnitedHealthcare is just a token, you know, a symbol of the entire insurance industry, or it could be very targeted specifically to UnitedHealthcare. But I think we're going to find, and I do believe they're very close to finding this suspect, that he has a longstanding beef, a long story that is going to be tied to the insurance industry, because the message on those casings was very intentional. He is angry at the insurance companies.",

Every second, every minute, every hour that ticks by that they haven't identified and located him, he is able to get a little bit further away.We also know that this suspect is someone who spent a lot of time and care in planning his escape, right? He was in the city for days before this shooting took place. He probably spent most of his time gathering intelligence about the areas he would go to commit the crime and the areas he might flee to after he committed the crime. We know that he was seen on video carrying the battery for the ebike that he used to escape the scene. It's possible that he pre positioned that bike just where he would need it to be able to get away quickly and to not get snagged in traffic, you know, vehicular traffic problems and things of that nature. So, very smart into the park, somewhere ditches the backpack in a way that we cannot find it, and we see him on video coming out of the park without the backpack. So, he spent a lot of time thinking about this. The chances are he is not wasting any of that time advantage he has, and he's getting as far away from New York City as he can.",

He has definitely been on a shooting range and practiced what he did over and over again because he was very calm through the entire shooting process. But then, again, even as Andrew so beautifully outlined all of his planning, he still dropped the phone. He still dropped the water bottle.

Let's discuss what's going on with Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who is the incoming top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, this would be a truly extraordinary step to blanket pardon people who haven't even committed crimes, haven't been accused of crimes, haven't been convicted of any crimes, to shield them potentially from Trump. Is this the right move? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Well, it's certainly a sign of our extraordinary times where you have, you know, incoming president of the United States who's making threats of prosecution and jail towards private citizens. And so it's obviously something that should be looked at. I mean, members of Congress, of course, are in a somewhat different position because we are covered by the speech and debate clause, which insulates us not only from criminal prosecution for doing our legislative duties but also from civil attack and also not just at the federal level but the state level. And, of course, presidential pardon applies just criminally and it applies only against federal offenses. So, I think this applies more to people like maybe John Kelly or Mark Milley. These are, you know, former Republicans, former Trump staffers who he has threatened in very vehement ways in different contexts. Those people, I really think -- you know, it makes sense for those people to be considered for whatever kind of protection can be offered to them in the event that a Department of Justice opens up, which views itself as a bureaucracy of revenge and retaliation against the president's perceived political foes.",

And, of course, the First Amendment covers what we do outside of Congress. And, you know, again, I would be more concerned with people who worked for Donald Trump who have no protections like that constitutionally other than the First Amendment, who, you know, the incoming president has said he wants to go after. And, you know, that's not a legitimate function of government. It's not a legitimate role of government and we don't want to have a regime of fear and intimidation.

We've got an incoming administration which doesn't seem to care about any constitutional boundaries. They're threatening to impound funds that have been appropriated for particular purposes by Congress and use them for other purposes.And that was, of course, something that Donald Trump did in his first administration when he redirected money from other lawfully appropriated functions, to building the wall in Mexico, which he had promised the people of Mexico were going to pay for. But, of course, that promise was broken. The people of Mexico, the government of Mexico didn't pay for it. And so they tried to redirect money from other places. So, you know, I have vowed that I will not allow the Constitution of the United States to be put into any kind of shredder or processor. We're going to defend the separation of powers. We're going to defend the First Amendment, the right of the people to assemble. We're going to defend the lawful prerogatives of Congress. We're going to defend judicial independence, and that's our job, and the Judiciary Committee is the frontlines of that defense. And so I offer myself to the caucus. Chairman Nadler, whose career is extraordinary, over a half century in New York politics, in the United States Congress, has endorsed me, and, you know, it's just a process that we go through Wolf as we get ready for the next Congress.

Overall, this report shows that in this majority Black city that Black residents are treated more harshly than white people who are conducting similar and engaged in similar conduct. Now, what's shocking is not just the results of this report, but also the reaction from the city that's saying -- they're saying that they're not going to enter a consent decree with the federal government. Listen to the mayor say that they're already making these changes at the local level. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It just simply would be too expensive. He claims that there's politics at play, but it's not the city playing politics. He claims that DOJ rushed this report, something that normally takes three years. They issued, he said in 15 months because he claims that they're afraid of what the incoming Trump administration might or might not do.And it begs, reminding our viewers that during his first term, Donald Trump largely abandoned these types of monitoring arrangements that were court issued -- Wolf.",

And as much as they're entitled to evaluate the data, they're entitled to assess what the conclusions were with respect to the excessive force, with regard to the unlawful stops, with regard to the discrimination and remember what he said in there was the mayor that is, is not right now. So potentially moving forward, you could see a shift in that.At the same time, I think there's something to be said for waiting and as much as you do have right as Nick just mentioned, an incoming administration that is not as favorable and is not as favorably predisposed with these consent judgments. And, you know I think if they waited, potentially they could have a whole another climate. Remember, it's the Department of Justice who oversees this. And so if you have a new mindset with respect to these consent decrees, they could be a world of difference with regard to their implementation.",

I mean, you can argue that the report and the underlying data that you need to review and you need to analyze, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence which suggests that they were running amok. The bottom line is that you have to institute reforms that are going to respect your community, that you're policing, that are going to give people a sense of empowerment and not abuse. And when you have these situations where there's force being used excessively, where you're minimizing a community, where you're stopping them for pretextual reasons, with no basis at all with this rampant discrimination, something needs to be done.I think the mayor's point is whether a consent decree that could last ten years is the proper vehicle for that, or whether there could be other reforms that are more immediate that might take something to change this. But it's certainly concerning and needs to be addressed immediately, and it should.",
