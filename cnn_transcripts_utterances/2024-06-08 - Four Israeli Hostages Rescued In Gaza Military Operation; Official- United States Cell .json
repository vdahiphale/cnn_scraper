You see, he's there in Paris with the First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, plus, the French president and first lady. And dramatic new developments in the Middle East. Four Israeli hostages rescued from Gaza. The Israeli military launching that daring rescue mission in broad daylight. The Government Media Office in Gaza says the operation left more than 200 people dead in central Gaza, with hundreds more injured. The mission ultimately freeing four hostages from the clutches of Hamas. All of them were abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7th. All right. Now, back in Israel for the first time in eight months, making emotional reunions with family members who never gave up hope, President Biden making brief remarks on the rescue earlier today from Paris.

Now, the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, did release a statement this morning about this rescue. He did not mention U.S. involvement. But he did say the following, \"Today, is really security forces conducted a successful operation to rescue four hostages from the grips of Hamas in Gaza.\" He goes on to say, \"Now, they are safe and reunited with their families, we commend the work of the Israeli security services that conducted this daring operation. So, you see there, the National Security adviser touting this operation, though not explicitly saying how the U.S. was involved. Of course, the United States is pushing for a hostage deal in exchange for a ceasefire that has been an ongoing push by the United States. President Biden laid out that proposal at the White House not long ago, and has continued that ongoing pressure. Just this week, the U.S. and 16 other countries joining together in a statement to call on Hamas to close the deal. We also know that senior U.S. officials went back to the Middle East to add some momentum to these hostage talks. It's unclear where those stands at this point. But clearly, this has been top of mind for the White House and senior U.S. officials. And today, they are touting the successful operation by the Israeli forces. But we are still trying to get more information as to how the U.S. specifically helped in this effort. Fred.",

That compared to just a few weeks ago, before the Israeli operation began there, they are around 1,200,000. So, Rafah is pretty much empty at this point.Now, the United States had warned Israel against a major operation in Rafah, because of fear of a high death toll of about just more suffering imposed upon the Israel -- the Palestinian people. But nonetheless, Israel has gone ahead with that operation and essentially turned Rafah into a ghost town. Many of those who fled have gone to the Mawasi area, which is on the Mediterranean, an area with almost nothing in the way of the basics of life. There is no running water, there is no sewage. There are some field hospitals, there's very little in the way of shelter. So, the situation in Rafah, even though we're focusing today, on Nuseirat camp, the situation in Rafah is dire. And of course, in Mawasi, where all of these people are crammed into, the concern is about health conditions getting worse. In fact, I think just the other day, we were talking about a report put out by the U.N., warning that by July, more than a million people in Gaza, will face death and starvation. Fredricka?",

We don't know what they said in private. You've got to imagine that the combination of the rescue operation itself, which tells Hamas that there's been some penetration of their system. And the huge casualties that appear to have gone along with it, civilian casualties of Palestinians. You've heard Ben say that it may be more than 200, takes you back to the brutal calculus of this war, which is that in order to achieve the means that the Israelis believe they need to both defeat Hamas and rescue hospitals, they are willing to go tolerate huge numbers of Palestinian casualties. And the question is, is that going to move Hamas at all? Does Hamas care that much about the Palestinians who are suffering because they have not reached out to the peace deal?

So, then, the question comes naturally, was there a way for Israel to do this more surgically that wouldn't carry that awful casualty counting.That casualty count is we have to caution, our listeners and viewers that it is preliminary at this point. I could imagine it getting significantly worse. I could imagine it being a bit diminished. I think the second really interesting question is what the role of the United States, Britain, other allies were here. The U.S. and Britain have hostage intelligence teams on the ground. Of course, there are many dual citizen hostages, which partly explains this. I am pretty certain by the time you are done with this, you are going to discover that there was U.S. signals intelligence for U.S. grown intelligence that helped identify where these hostages were being held. And thus, the United States was a piece of this, that is a wonderful thing, given the tensions between the president and Prime Minister Netanyahu. But it's also going to make the allies bear some responsibility for participation in an operation that obviously had this many casualties. So, it's always with these -- it's always a mixed -- a mixed bag. Right? The joy of the release, and the question of did you need it to be that brutal to civilians nearby?",

So this is what they're going to do. What they're going to do later in about a half hour, is unfurl a two mile long red banner around the circumference of the White House.

We are in a situation where people are being treated in other people's blood. The hospital is on its knees.This is just another example of a health healthcare system which is crushed, a healthcare system which has been under constant attack, and with this is also in a situation of extreme propaganda as well. There are reports in terms of, there are maps being publicized today by the Israeli army in COGAT, which indicates that we, MSF, are running a field hospital in the Gaza Strip. We are running, we are supporting the Al-Aqsa hospital. We're supporting the Nasser hospital on a number of primary healthcare centers. But we're not running a field hospital in the Gaza Strip. We've asked for permission to run a field hospital that was granted. But we have not had permission for the supplies to run that field hospital. So it is not accurate to report. It is not accurate -- the reports going around that we are running a field hospital are not accurate. This is another example of the instrumentalization of humanitarian assistance that we've been seeing in Gaza over the last few months. It's an incredibly difficult endeavor to run humanitarian assistance anywhere around the world, but particularly in Gaza, at the moment, where we have not been able to get supplies in through the Rafah crossing since it was taken by Israeli forces back six or seven weeks ago.

French President Macron is hosting, of course, the guest of honor, President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden, really lovely seeing these pictures, and, of course, seeing the military band. A moment ago, oh, there they go, on cue that was also serenading the guests as they arrive. That's a red carpet event, indeed. So as President Biden takes the world stage this week, he is making a renewed case for democracy as he honors the members of the greatest generation who helped end World War II, and in this election year, he is also reaching out to allies and issuing stark warnings about the perils of isolationism. Joining us right now with more on all this, CNN political analyst, Julian Zelizer. He's also a professor of history at Princeton University. Great to see you.",

Will it overcome the kind of opposition he has here? I doubt it. I don't think many Republicans are going to agree with how he assesses the situation or change their votes.And then within the Democratic Party, we're seeing more turmoil recently over foreign policy and these issues with regard to the Middle East.

Here's a look at some of those numbers, still above average today, in Phoenix, going for 110 degrees, when average is 103 easing back to about 106 by Monday. Same thing with Las Vegas, 10 degrees above normal today. 97 is normal. Looking at temperatures back up your 107 and then the ease up a little bit, getting down to 103. But we're still above average by about 10 to 15 degrees through the day today and into tomorrow. What's even, you know, ebbs and flows to injuries. Look at these overnight low temperatures. We're finding them sweltering in the 80s from Phoenix to Las Vegas, so that, you know, can exacerbate heat sickness, because you don't get any relief at night.
