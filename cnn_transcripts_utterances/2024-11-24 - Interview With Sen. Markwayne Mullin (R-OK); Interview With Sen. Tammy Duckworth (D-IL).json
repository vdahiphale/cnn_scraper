I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is locked in.President-elect Donald Trump officially completed his list of Cabinet secretary nominations in a flurry of announcements over the last 48 hours. Trump unveiled a number of new unconventional picks. Here's a look at the full list right now. It includes a pro-union former Republican congresswoman for the Labor Department, a Project 2025 co-author to lead the Budget Office. One of the most important jobs, Treasury secretary, will go to billionaire investor Scott Bessent. But the made-for-TV cast of characters still needs to get past the Republican Senate, which has already doomed one nomination. Trump's picks for health and human services secretary and director of national intelligence are under intense scrutiny, and his nominee for defense secretary is on defense, denying a sexual assault allegation. The fate of all these nominees rests in the hands of the new Republican Senate majority, which just elected its leaders for the next Congress. Here with me now is the newest member of the Republican leadership, James Lankford of Oklahoma. Thank you so much for being here, Senator. Congratulations. As a new member of the leadership, you are going to -- whether or not you're in leadership or not, you're, as a senator, going to be looking at all of Donald Trump's nominees. Are you planning to vote for all of them, or do any give you pause? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  No, we're planning to go through the process on this. By the way, good morning and happy Thanksgiving coming up. But it will be a long process that will go through that, that has already begun, where individuals that are -- have been nominated will come forward. We will sit down with them in our offices. We will get a chance to be able to talk. There will be open hearings that will start after January the 3rd next year, when the new Congress is sworn in. So everybody's going to get a fair shake. Everybody's going to have the opportunity to be able to go through this process, and we will let the process work out.",

But it's also someone that the president wants to know is heading the same direction that they are, because it's very important. When you talk about the attorney general, they're the key component on the prosecution of federal crimes around the country. Every single U.S. attorney around the country works for them and with them.

But we also have individuals within the FBI, and that was very well- known after President Trump came on in 2016 that there were members of the FBI that hated him that were in senior leadership that were working to be able to undercut him, Peter Strzok, multiple others that were actively working to try to undercut the president.

President Trump didn't go after Hillary Clinton after he came into office in 2017. He said, hey, we're not going to do that. Obviously, he had a great meeting with President Biden, where they sat down together in the Oval Office, talked about the transition, and seemed to work to be able to move on.

The second portion of it fixed what's called the asylum loophole that is a gap in our law that's being exploited right now. Obviously, the first part of that bill is no longer needed. No one thinks that President Trump is not going to enforce the border. He's going to enforce the border. So that portion of the bill is not needed anymore. We still are going to need a law to be able to fix the asylum loophole, and be glad to be able to work with the White House to be able to get that done.

They can get a chance to be able to do also off-campus religious education. So any conversation about the Bible shouldn't be a religious tone. I'm -- people know that. My Christian faith has impacted my life dramatically, and I am the primary teacher to my children of my faith. That shouldn't be a public schoolteacher to do that. But, saying that, the Bible is also a part of Western civilization and part of our founding. Many of our founders were very passionate about Scripture and about the Bible and studied it.

If she was compromised, if she wasn't able to pass a background check, if she wasn't able to do her job, she still wouldn't be in the Army.

That's the most dangerous thing she could say, is that a United States lieutenant colonel in the United States Army is compromised and is an asset of Russia. It's actually sad to hear her say that. When I say that -- I heard her say that, I thought, I wonder if this political because she's upset that Tulsi Gabbard left the Democrat Party because they went woke, because I know they actually got along when they were in the House, and she knows Tulsi Gabbard. She knows her heart. She has a heart to serve. And so I think that's probably more politically motivated than it actually has any truth to it at all.",
