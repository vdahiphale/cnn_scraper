      "sentences": "Right from the get-go, it's easy to see big differences between what Kamala Harris would propose and what Donald Trump would propose.On the economy, back in 2019, she proposed an estate tax to pay for an increase in teacher salaries, about $13,000 more per average teacher in this country, coast to coast. And she wanted a higher corporate tax rate. Currently, it's at 21 percent. She wanted to push it up even higher than Joe Biden proposed. All of that, leaning on the rich to pay more to make the economy work. Donald Trump points to his track record of wages rising faster than inflation in his administration. And once again, he's promising tax cuts and raising tariffs on imported goods, which some economists say actually could cost consumers, but nonetheless, many Republicans think will actually work in a positive way. On abortion, she supports legislation to protect abortion rights nationally. She's the first sitting vice president to visit an abortion clinic. Donald Trump promised to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2016. And once he got the right players into the Supreme Court, that's exactly what they did. However, he opposes a national abortion ban, perhaps mindful of the fact that most Americans think it should be legal, and he favors leaving it to states to decide. And on the border, Kamala Harris backed the bipartisan border security deal endorsed by Biden back in the winter. She's worked with countries in Central America to deter illegal immigration and oppose family separation when people are caught at the border. Trump blocked that bipartisan border security deal endorsed by Biden. Remember, the Republicans rose up against it in February and wiped it out. And he wants to resume building the wall, which he did not complete in his first term, and closing the border and promising mass deportation. So just a few areas, but areas in which they are substantially different from each other. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Netanyahu's facing a huge amount of pressure and backlash back home in Israel.He's also facing a huge amount of pressure internationally, not least from the United States. And there has been those tensions and fraught relations between Biden and Netanyahu. So the timing certainly is interesting, but that pressure is growing on Netanyahu to strike a deal. He met with the family members and representatives of hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza on Monday. And he was, again, pretty confident. He said that the Israeli government is still determined to bring back all hostages currently held captive. But, of course, it's been nearly 10 months now, and there has been growing calls from within Israel for him to do more, to strike a deal, to ensure the safe return of hostages. But what we are hearing now, as he continues his visit to the United States, is a tone of optimism, not only from the Israeli side, but also from the U.S. side. We've heard from Biden saying that he believes all parties involved are on the verge of striking a deal. The State Department said that the gaps in this negotiation process are narrowing, that there are still some issues, some sticking points. But there is a certain degree of hope now that that pressure has really reached a boiling point now that there may well be a sign of optimism from the Israeli side when they do come back with their final terms of this deal to be negotiated. So, certainly, some hope there. But, again, that pressure is mounting. And, of course, he will be addressing Congress. You saw in that footage there, we've seen protesters now occupying a congressional building. So, you know, there is a huge amount of tension, not only politically, but also just around Washington right now. There are huge protests taking place. This is a hugely divisive issue.

Hamas has maintained control of Gaza since 2007 after winning legislative elections.We've seen that division, we've seen that division result in violence between the two in the past, but this is a significant indication of where they are both heading politically and diplomatically. There have been those continued calls for more of a political solution, particularly looking towards a two-state solution in which there would be Palestinian control over both the occupied West Bank and occupied territories, East Jerusalem, and also, of course, the Gaza Strip. And what we've heard from both groups is that they believe that this is a historic junction for both groups. This is essentially laying the groundwork in their eyes to ensure that they are able to maintain Palestinian control over Gaza in any sort of post-war governance structure. And that is key because we have heard from Israeli officials suggesting that there might be some sort of Israeli security control presence in Gaza, which has, of course, drawn backlash from many in the region. However, Hamas's involvement is still deeply problematic. This deal has drawn backlash from Israeli officials, of course, but also in the U.S. The Biden administration has said that Hamas can have no role in any sort of post-war governance structure.",
