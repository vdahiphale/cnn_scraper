An Israeli official says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his security cabinet that the aim of his country's operations in Lebanon is to cut Hezbollah from the war with Hamas. The official also says the cabinet has agreed to continue to raise the level of military operations each day, as is -- and is aware of the risks. The Israel Defense Forces says it hit 1,600 Hezbollah targets on Monday. And today, Israel says it's hit dozens more targets in southern Lebanon. Well, this coming after the Iran-backed militant group fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel overnight. Amid the escalation of violence, Lebanese civilians in the south are fleeing their homes and seeking safety. Israel's Prime Minister urged people to get out of harm's way while it targets Hezbollah positions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I would like to clarify Israel's policy. We are not waiting for a threat. We are ahead of it, everywhere, in every arena, anytime. We're eliminating seniors, eliminating commanders, eliminating rockets, and counting. Those who try to hurt us, we will hurt them gravely. I promise to change the security balance, the balance of power in the north. This is exactly what we're doing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you.Well, joining me now is Malcolm Davis, a military analyst and senior analyst of defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Malcolm, good to see you. Israel obviously trying to break the resolve of Hezbollah, those pager attacks last week, the targeted strikes of Hezbollah leaders, and now this aerial bombardment, but it doesn't seem to be working. MALCOLM DAVIS, MILITARY ANALYST AND SR. ANALYST OF DEFENSE STRATEGY AND CAPABILITY, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Well, it's certainly working to a degree in the sense that they are taking down Israel -- Hezbollah's missile and rocket capability. But the question is in terms of how many missiles and rockets does Hezbollah have, to what extent is Iran resupplying Hezbollah with additional missiles and rockets, and what is the potential risk of further civilian casualties given that Hezbollah is placing these rocket systems inside civilian areas including inside homes? So it is working to a degree but there's no clear path to a quick victory on the part of Israel.",

If the Israelis can remove that threat or dramatically reduce that threat, then it becomes much easier for Israel then to focus on finishing off Hamas in the south because they no longer face a threat of Hezbollah in the north.It becomes much more difficult conversely for Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran to then try and impose essentially a peace deal on Israel that would essentially allow both Hamas and Hezbollah to reconstitute and threaten Israel again in the future. So I think that what you are seeing is an Israeli shaping operation designed to reduce that threat and prepare the path, the way to a more just peace in the sense of reducing the threat from both Hamas and Hezbollah, cutting the two parties' connections and ultimately seeing Israel able to create a peace deal that at least meets their conditions for peace.",

They're not a strong threat anymore.So really the focus is shifting to Hezbollah and southern Lebanon. And obviously if Iran chooses to come into the war, then that's a different story. And Israel will be facing a much more serious threat at that point. But Israel does have the means to strike Iran hard. And I think that's, you know, they're not overtaxed at the moment, but they could be facing a real challenge if Iran were to come into this war.",

This area of Western Pennsylvania really crucial to the campaign in case he hopes to carry the great Commonwealth once again in 2024. He won this specific county about an hour east of Pittsburgh, both in 2016 and in 2020. So if he hopes to carry the state, he really needs to boost his numbers in these specific more rural areas of Pennsylvania.Now the rally was a relatively normal Trump campaign event. The former president stuck to the teleprompter a good amount in the beginning of his remarks. He focused on the economy, on the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan and hit on fracking, of course, an important issue here in Pennsylvania. But he did drift off topic as well at one point lamenting Johnny Carson, no longer being the host of \"The Tonight Show\", complaining about the moderators of the last debate and also criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for her interview with Oprah recently. But the supportive crowd here, they really ate up a lot of what the former president was saying here, including when he spent time talking specifically about immigration. Take a listen. TRUMP: She's been in office for three and a half years. She's saying what she's going to do if she becomes president, but she's been there almost four years. She hasn't done anything except destroy our country with millions of people that shouldn't be here. Whether she was the border czar or just the person in charge of the border, it's been the worst thing ever, maybe one of the worst things ever to happen to our country.

Well that's according to sources familiar with the discussions. But we're hearing no final decision has been made. The Harris campaign is eager to close the gap with Trump on immigration. Polls show him leading on that issue and in Arizona on the whole.Joining me now from Los Angeles is Michael Genovese, political analyst and president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University. Michael, great to see you. Yesterday, it was positive polls for Harris. Now, it's strong poll results for Trump. Why the discrepancy and how seriously are you taking these poll results? MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST AND PRESIDENT, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY-GLOBAL POLICY INSTITUTE: Well, I think there's a discrepancy because things are fluctuating. They're very close. And the littlest thing can tip the scale a little bit. But for the most part, for Harris, it's been a good news-bad news situation. The good news is, in most of the polls, she's up by a few percentage points in the popular vote. The bad news is that it's not the popular vote that wins the presidency, it's the electoral college. And there's an inbred bias in the electoral college that favors rural and smaller states, meaning favoring Trump. And so the general view is that the Democrat has to win the electoral college. If they want to win, the electoral college has to win the popular vote by 4 percent or so. That's tough to do. Biden did it the last time and he won Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but not by 4 percent and lost. And so what you need to look at are the battleground states. And that's where Trump is really doing well. Arizona, Georgia states that Biden won in 2020. He's ahead. North Carolina, he's ahead. And so for Harris, the key strategy has to be, you've got to win those Great Lakes states in the Midwest. And you've got to get women out to vote in a higher number than usual. You've got to get young people energized out to vote and it doesn't look like she's doing well there. And black voters, Harris is at 83 percent. Biden won 92 percent of African-American voters. Hispanics - Harris, 52 percent; Biden won 66 percent. So she has her work cut out for her.",

My in-laws, a group of them have left the southern suburbs, as have many other people, and moved to an apartment in another neighborhood of town where there are four generations of displaced relatives, including a one-week-old newborn and my wife's grandmother, who is paralyzed and a stroke victim.

None of them have any affiliation with Hezbollah or any links with the most powerful military and political force in Lebanon, a country that doesn't have a president right now, and its government is basically bankrupt with a severe economic crisis.

We also know there was a letter now addressed to the \"New York Times\" that was found at the scene. They did test that letter for fingerprints and DNA. They have not found Ryan Routh's fingerprints or DNA on it just yet, but they did find a fingerprint belonging to someone else. The FBI agent who was testifying did not say who that person is, who that fingerprint belongs to or what was in the letter. Also they did search Routh's car. They found a Hawaii driver's license and a passport in his name along with 12 pairs of gloves and six cell phones. One of the cell phones, prosecutors say, included a search -- a Google search, from how to get from Palm Beach County where this all happened to Mexico. Also they found cell phone data that would have placed Ryan Routh in this area for about a month before this incident occurred. They said that he arrived here as of August 14th. That's according to cell phone data, pinging off the cell phone towers in the area. And finally, there was a handwritten list of dates and venues, prosecutors say, that was found in his car.
