      "sentences": "-- and 70 people received the death penalty there last year. And now, activists are telling us this year there could be even more. Among those being sentenced to death by hanging are protesters. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  Outside a jail near Tehran families of prisoners gathered to chant \"Do not hang them.\" Their pleas come as Iran resumes the execution of protesters after a months-long hiatus. The brutal practice restarted this month with the hanging of three young men accused of killing three members of the security forces during anti-government protests in November. The news sparked more demonstrations, but activists and human rights groups say the allegations against the trio are baseless. Majid Kazemi was forced to watch videos of interrogators torturing his brother, and he was subject to at least 15 mock executions, according to Amnesty International. In an audio note obtained by the organization, he maintained his innocence. CNN cannot independently verify the clip. \"They kept beating me and ordering me to say this weapon is mine,\" he says. \"I told them I would say whatever they wanted, just please leave my family alone.\" Before his execution, the family of 36-year-old Saleh Mirhashemi, a karate coach from Isfahan, tried to draw attention to his plight. This picture of his father spread on social media. \"My son is innocent,\" the sign reads -- but to no avail. Activists shared this heartbreaking video they say is Mirhashemi's dad hugging his picture as he lay by his son's grave. Iran has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The total number of demonstrators known to have been executed since last year now stands at seven, according to CNN reporting, and more executions are likely imminent. Over 100 protesters have been sentenced to death or are facing charges punishable by death, says this human rights activist. MAHMOOD AMIRY-MOGHADDAM, IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS NGO DIRECTOR:  When authorities fear protests or right after protests the number of executions go up. The aim is to create fear into society to prevent more protests. ABDELAZIZ (on camera):  Do you expect that the number of executions is going to rise even more this year? AMIRY-MOGHADDAM:  It is rising already. The Amnesty International community has got a strong move against these executions. We might be facing a very large number of executions in the coming months. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  Rights groups say that Mohammad Ghobadlou, a 22-year-old protester with a mental health issue, could be one of the next victims of Iran's execution machine. Activists are ringing the alarm. They say yet another Iranian faces death just for daring to speak out. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
