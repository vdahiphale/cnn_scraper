He was moved to tears, he couldn't even speak, but it was beautiful. And today's ceremony will be amazing as well.Julia Benbrook, thank you so much. And we'll get back to you, of course, when it begins. A new hour of the CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we continue to follow the start of the touching final farewell to the late President Jimmy Carter. The first of six days of tributes and observances is underway right now in Georgia as the nation and the world honor the life and legacy of America's 39th president, who passed away Sunday at the age of 100. An emotional moment this morning when former and current U.S. Secret Service agents who protected Carter during his lifetime and his political career carried his casket to the hearse in Americus, Georgia. And then there was another ceremony at Carter's boyhood home and farm in Archery, Georgia, right here, where the two longest-serving National Park staffers rang the farm bell 39 times.

The motorcade is now slowly making its way from South Georgia to Atlanta. And in a few hours, it will stop off at the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta, where Carter served one term as governor and as state senator.And after a moment of silence honoring his service, the motorcade will then head to the Carter Center in Atlanta, where a service will be held later on there today. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is at the Carter Center for us. Jeff, set the scene for us for the rest of today's tributes.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, each one of those stops is a touchstone of former President Jimmy Carter's life and indeed his legacy. As you said, his motorcade is making its way north up to Atlanta. He will be pausing for a moment at the Atlanta Capitol.Governor Brian Kemp, we are told, will be greeting the presidential motorcade there before making its way here to a service. And that is going to be the first of several services in this state funeral ceremony over the next several days here. And Chip Carter and Jason Carter, the late president's son and grandson, who are members of the Carter Center's board here, they will be speaking as well as the Navy Hymn, of course, recognizing the service of Jimmy Carter in the Navy. Of course, he left Plains, Georgia to go be a naval engineer. That is a key part of his legacy as well before returning to Plains, Georgia. So throughout the day, certainly one of history and legacy. But here at the Carter Center, there is no question this represents the unfinished work. Of course, his time in the White House was cut short. In his eyes, he was elected under a wave of discontent in the country in the era of Watergate and the Vietnam War, but also was sent on his way after just four years in the White House when Ronald Reagan soundly defeated him in 1980. But it was then, one year later, where Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded the Carter Center. And that would indeed be their life's work through a democracy, humanitarian work around the globe. So that is something that will be marked here as well, Fredricka. So certainly, a day of history, a day of mourning, also a day of perhaps learning more about Jimmy Carter's time as the 39th president and then nearly a half century in his post-presidency.",

And I think it's harder for many Americans and historians to look back at these as examples of success. Although when we look back, we often see how much was accomplished.Part of it was his presidency ended not in a great way, meaning even before the 1980 election, the nation was really focused on the Iranian hostage crisis, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the late President Carter had very low approval ratings. And we remember that. And finally, it's not only that he's a one-term president, but he loses to Ronald Reagan. He loses to the representative of the conservative movement that until this day has fought against many of the things that Carter stood for. And so, that I think influences the way we look back on those four years. And rightly so, I think it's a legitimate conversation to have about what he could or could not do well.",

Lyndon Johnson, of course, already had been responsible for the Civil Rights Act of '64 and the Voting Rights Act of '65. But certainly Carter represented what we call the New South, a new younger generation that believed that the region had to break free from a really horrendous racial history.And so, he did try to take steps to show his commitment to civil rights. And he himself embodied a new kind of voice for Southern leaders that until this day has been much more reflective, certainly of liberal Democrats from the region. And so he does deserve credit.

As much as he did as president, he redefined what it meant to be a post-president. He used that platform, the power he amassed in the White House, to continue working through the Carter Center on issues such as democracy and diplomacy and negotiation.And he was often very controversial. Many people did not agree with what he had to do. But the key was that once you leave the White House, public service is not over. And that was different than many presidents before and certainly many presidents since. And I think it remains a model that we will continue not only to discuss, but hopefully other post-presidents will emulate.",

He had a huge legislative record, even more than Jimmy Carter was able to amass. But at the same time, Carter, you know, shows that politics matters.And that in the end, if your presidency ends with an opposition party taking power and one that really has very different views of the world, there's a high cost. And that will be some of the criticism level that Carter -- that Biden, that he didn't do enough to nurture the strength of the party in a similar way to Carter.

The FBI also says the killer intended to use a transmitter found in his truck to set off two improvised explosive devices that he had previously placed on Bourbon Street.

And they went through her long list of accomplishments in politics, but ended with saying her nomination for president broke barriers and inspired generations.
