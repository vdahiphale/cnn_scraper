In consultation with them, in consultation with allies and partners. We've adjusted as the nature of the aggression has shifted to make sure that they were getting into their hands as quickly as possible exactly what they needed to deal with Putin's war. And that process continues. We're now very focused on air defense systems. And not just us, many other countries. And we're working to make sure that the Ukrainians get those systems as quickly as possible. But also, as effectively as possible. Making sure that they are trained on them, making sure that they have the ability to maintain them. And all of that has to come together, and it is.

Before that, of course, we had the HIMARS which they used to great effect, both in southern and in eastern Ukraine. So, virtually every single day, Christiane, the Pentagon is looking at this.

He is taking the war to Ukraine civilians and he's doing it in a very deliberate way. Going after the entire energy and electric infrastructure, to turn off the lights, to turn off the water, to turn off the heat. And that at a time when, of course, Ukraine is heading into the winter. The head of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, talked about weaponizing winter. And that's exactly what Putin is doing. It's also why not only are we seize with making sure that Ukraine has the systems it needs to defend itself, we're also seized with making sure that we're doing everything possible. Again, as quickly as possible to help them repair and replace everything that has been destroyed by the Russian onslaught. And just as we put this process together some months ago in Ramstein, Germany to get them the defensive weapon systems that they need, so too we're doing that with energy, with equipment, with transformers, with generators, with spare parts. We met here in Bucharest, not just with NATO allies but with the G7 countries and some other countries to put in place a very coordinated process to make sure that, as fast as we can, we're getting Ukraine what it needs to get through the winter. To make sure that men, women, children are not literally freezing to death. We heard from Foreign Minister Kuleba, my friend and counterpart, who just came from Kyiv and described for all of the ministers here what life is like under this Russian onslaught. And by the way, this is not normal. This is the brutalization of a country and directly attacking everything, its civilians, its citizens need to simply survive. And I hope that the world understands it and sees it that way. We are seized with this. And we're acting on it to get Ukraine everything we possibly can to get through the winter.",

We have taken steps, as you know, to sanction those who have been responsible for trying to repress people peacefully protesting. We have worked as well to make sure that Iranians have, to the best of our ability, the communications technology that they need to continue to communicate with one another and to stay connected to the outside world. At the same time, we have continued to believe that the best way to deal with Iran's nuclear program is through diplomacy. As you know, we have an agreement, the so-called JCPOA to put Iran's nuclear program in a box. Unfortunately, the decision was made to pull out of that agreement. And what we've seen virtually ever since is Iran building back its program. We've been very clear with them, and not just the United States but others including European partners that they should not take additional steps to increase their nuclear capacity, including by enriching to higher levels.

Because -- precisely because we're in a competition with China. The potential for miscommunication for not at least understanding what each other is trying to do. That is something we have to guard against. And that's necessary, particularly if, as President Biden has said, we want to ensure that the competition regulation does not veer into conflict. No one has an interest in that. So, first and foremost, the trip that I'll take early next year is about continuing that communication. Making sure that we have lines of communication that are open, that are clear even when we disagree and indeed disagree profoundly. The world also expects us to manage this relationship responsibly. To make sure that, again, to the best of our ability, we avoid any conflict. And, yes, that where we're able to cooperate, especially on issues that affect not only Americans and not only Chinese, but people around the world, that we at least try to do that. It's going to be up to China to decide whether it wants to participate in that kind of cooperation, on things like climate, on global health, on the macroeconomic environment that we're all living in as we try to get beyond COVID and pursue an economic recovery. We cannot decide that for China. We can make clear that we're prepared to engage and to cooperate where it's in our interest to do so and where the world expects that of us.

Whether it's the approach to China. Whether it is dealing with everything from climate to food insecurity, to energy. And do we have differences on certain things? Of course, we always do. But we always work through them. And so, for example, when it comes to some concerns that we've heard in Europe over some of the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act to go to creating incentives for investing in the United States.

We know Afghan women as a group more often talked about than heard from directly, and this needs to change. We need to also make sure that women participate in any stakeholder decision-making in Afghanistan. There's a lot that we can't control. But we can control who we send to meetings and who meets with the Taliban. And finally, we need to really be advocating for the full spectrum of women's rights. Educated is critical. There's no future without education. It's one of the most powerful equalizers on the road to gender equality. But what Afghan women tell me, is what happens after my daughter is educated.

And what I always say is that, you know, the fire department is the largest fire department in the country. It's almost the largest fire department in the world. It's certainly, I think, the leader in the fire service. We are in an enormous organization. There's 17,000 people. We have a $2.3 billion budget. And my role, and any commissioner's role is about running the agency. We have men and women in the field who put out fires, who respond to medical emergencies, firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, fire marshals. They are doing, you know, the work of responding to emergencies. And that's their expertise and they do it well. And that, you know, that is not my role. My role is to support them in helping them do that more safely. Making sure they have the equipment to do it. And it's really leading a large organization into the future. And I think, you know, the mayor recognized that that's something I've been doing my whole career. And I think, you know, many folks in city government, that is really where their expertise lies. It's about, you know, having the decades of experience running large organizations and managing, you know, problem sets and navigating through really difficult times like the pandemic.

It was revealed that she had been subjected to, kind of, a vicious campaign of harassment in her own house. And that other women firefighters came forward to say that they have been subjected to similar conduct.

We really are the example for the fire service. And that's a huge responsibility. And I think we need to live up to it. So, you know, really my call to our members is whether, you know, things are good in their firehouse, but maybe no somewhere else's that we all have a responsibility to figure out how we're doing, how are all of the members in our firehouses being treated? How are they feeling about their jobs? And it's really our responsibility to, you know, set the example for the fire service and change those circumstances wherever we may find them proactively and not reactively. And I think that's, you know, something our members can really -- I -- when speak to firehouses about it, they really understand that and they agree. You know, they love this department.

Losing 343 people on one daywhen it is -- it's so difficult when we lose one member. You know, to just even try to imagine how the department could go on from that, it is really difficult. You know, I think it -- there's two things I'd say. Is one, part of the reason that 9/11 is very present in this department is not only because of the tragedy of that day but also because we continue to lose members from World Trade Center Cancer on a pretty regular basis. And so, 9/11 is truly still with us and will be with us for some time. It is still taking our members. And it's something that we talk about a lot. We're talking about, you know, mental health aspect of dealing with that sort of loss. But I -- You know, I also think that what is so incredible to me about the fire department is their ability to rebound from such an epic loss, you know? I think no one would have blamed the fire department if they had not been able to respond to emergencies in the days and weeks after, and yet they did. You know, they still staffed every ambulance. Every fire truck still went out the door. And so, it's really a testament, I think, to the resilience of the organization which, you know, unfortunately has been learned through many losses. But it also, I think, is really become part of the fabric is we do understand how to be there for one another. And I see a really powerful support and connection between our members that, I think, really gets them through. And, you know, I think is really a lesson for all of us about how to come together more as a community during these tough times. I think it's certainly a great lesson coming out of COVID where people feel very disconnected. They feel like they don't have a community. People don't really feel that way in the fire department. I don't feel that way. This feels like a very close-knit community where when something tragic happens, everybody shows up.
