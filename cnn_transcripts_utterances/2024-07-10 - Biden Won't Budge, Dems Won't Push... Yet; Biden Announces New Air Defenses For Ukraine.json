President Biden isn't budging and Democrats in Congress aren't shutting him out, at least not at this writing. Despite his poor debate performance, the president insists he gives Democrats the best chance to beat Donald Trump in November. Congressional Democrats, not all convinced party leaders holding closed door meetings yesterday in both chambers, emerging with no consensus on whether Biden should remain at the top of the ticket. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO):  I've come to the final conclusion that president Biden is not ready to be rolled into an old full-time. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  President Biden is doing what he needs to do. He's not just the president, he's our president. REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY):  I'm enthusiastically supporting Biden. I'm not going to comment on what I said on a private call. REP. MAGGIE HASSAN (D-NH):  I think it's really important that we focused on the fact that President Biden has been a really excellent president. He had a bad debate. REP. MARC VEASEY (D-TX):  But I do think that at this point that there are definitely other candidates that will be stronger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jon Tester, Sherrod Brown, our Dana Bash reporting, also share his concerns about Biden potentially losing to Trump. But the reality is, Biden is not really going anywhere. We almost seems like were in this place where Democrats are just kind of saying, well, if this is what he's going to do, we're just going to have to make the best of it.",

If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago, but they cant because she's got to be their second choice. He has no choice and no chance.

BRUFKE:  So, I mean, I feel like the veep stakes, its still kind of moving there and Donald Trump kind of, I mean, he's fickle, so we'll see where he ultimately goes with that. But I've talked to some lawmakers and people within the Trump orbit that feel he's feeling bullish right now, he's feeling better than ever with the state the race and I've talked to their take was on it was that he they could see him picking somebody that's a little bit more of a firebrand whereas before to kind of help tighten the race, somebody maybe Marco Rubio or Doug Burgum, may have had a stronger shot on that front. I mean, they're definitely not out of the running at this point in time, but somebody that might be able to help with minority and swing voters and suburbs that may go to Biden otherwise.",

He doesn't want Putin to build a relationship with Trump I'm sure. So China very much get on side with Trump effectively because whether Trump is President or Biden is president, America is going to be just as important to Ukraine. I think, you know, what's interesting about those sound bites is that one of the issues with this NATO summit, huge issues, particularly Ukraine to deal with, but it's all being overshadowed by the U.S. election on two fronts. Obviously, just the fact that every press conference, everyone's talking about President Biden's wellness. That's overriding things every time he appears in even with their world leader, the discussion is going to be about Biden and whether or not he's going to pull out of the race. And then secondarily, you know, if the Democrats losing November to Donald Trump, what that means for the NATO alliance, everyone there is fully behind it, particularly from Europe. It's so central to their security, their hugely concerned that Donald Trump would come in and change that. But you're in a better position I think, Kasie, to say whether or not he's planning to -- you know, he's never suggested dismantling NATO has these just talking about this issue with everyone recognizes that most European countries don't pay their fair share.",

He's always prided himself very much on his role on the world stage when he was in the Senate on the key committee that dealt with these issues.We saw some of this same president that you saw there when he went abroad last month he is also holding it up as the reason why its important that he stay at the top of the Democratic ticket. He points to the expansion of NATO. What is your sense? What are you seeing in terms of how this is being covered where you are?

Everything's being seen from Biden's perspective. So the whole event, you know, has been weakened to some extent because when its all about security and policy and what's going to be decided, it's really just how President Biden has got to perform. But as you say, did perform well there and he is appreciated I think certainly amongst European leaders because he is an internationalist and he is taking these meetings and he is taking it -- takes Europe very seriously and democracy very seriously, and America's role in the world very seriously.
