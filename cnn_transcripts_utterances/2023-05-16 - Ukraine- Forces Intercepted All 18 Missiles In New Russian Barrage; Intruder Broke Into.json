New video into OUTFRONT tonight of them crawling -- you'll see them crawling on hands and knees, like deserting an area. We're live on the ground tonight.Plus, new pictures from the violent attack at Congressman Gerry Connolly's office that sent two staffers to the hospital. Congressman Connolly is OUTFRONT. And the New York mayor publicly breaking with President Biden as angry parents demand to know why school gymnasiums may be closed down to become the new home for migrants. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, every single Russian rocket shot down by Ukraine today, as some of Putin's forces are on the run on the front lines. These are two major developments tonight in the great European war. First, Russian President Vladimir Putin firing a total of 18 missiles at Ukraine. Take a look at that new video there. It's one of the interceptions. Ukrainian officials say they shot down every single one of those missiles down. You see one of them right there. It's like lightning in the sky. It's an important show of how sophisticated Ukraine's defense capabilities have actually become. In fact, the only damage was from the falling debris from the destroyed missiles and interceptors which set some vehicles on fire and damaged the city zoo. U.S. officials telling CNN that Russia's new strategy is to fire a barrage of missiles at Ukraine all at once in the hopes that they will overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses and that some will break through. Which, of course, when you think about is an incredibly costly strategy for Russia, right? The county facing some serious defense supply challenges, just a barrage of missiles hoping one breaks through. The downed missiles come as Putin's forces are retreating in areas north and south of Bakhmut, according to the Ukrainian deputy defense minister. And we've got some more video to show you on that front, from one of these areas. So, what you're looking at here are Russian forces. They're actually on their hands and knees here. They're crawling trying to avoid being hit and spotted on their way out. So as you're watching that, they're crawling out of an area near Bakhmut. Let me show you another new video that we just got into the show tonight. This was filmed a little bit further south of Bakhmut. What you're looking at here is Ukraine taking out what's been described as a Russian electronic warfare station that was installed on top of some silos. So that's that smoke and explosion that you see there. So it's a precision strike at that target. Meanwhile, Ukraine feeling the momentum, it comes as one of Putin's top allies who has been crucial to Putin's war effort is facing significant questions about the stability of his regime because Putin's top ally, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, we've got some new video from today, appearing to show his hand bandaged and his voice at times sounds very hoarse and strained. This is significant because it comes after several missed appearances at major public events. Lukashenko is very important. Of course, he controls the entire northern border of Ukraine. He's threatened nuclear actions against Ukraine. He's let Putin's forces invade Ukraine and massed from his country. He's now providing sanctuary and base use for Putin's air force. In a moment, I'm going to speak to the Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. She's now living in exile and has been sentenced to 15 years in prison in absentia. First, though, I want to begin with Nic Robertson, because he is OUTFRONT tonight on the ground in Eastern Ukraine. And, Nic, what is the latest there?",

He pauses, sighs, and whispers, it's hard. Tanks, too, are getting chewed up in the Bakhmut meat grinder. This Soviet-era T-72 blasted by shelling there, repairs made in hedge rows because workshops are getting targeted. The shrapnel holes don't matter, this tank commander tells us. What's important is the engine and the reactive armor. Locations of repair hideaways like this one are a closely guarded secret. Once the counteroffensive begins, they will be even more vital to keep the military and its machines moving. In a combat bunker buried outside Bakhmut, troops have no idea when or where the big offensive will come. They're monitoring the battlefield from here. We can't show you the screens that they're looking down from drones. As soon as a Russian soldier puts his head up and moves, you see it. Morale here high because they recently made gains across fields surrounding the town. Early success in the coming counteroffensive will be critical, the lessons of Bakhmut, momentum and motivation is all. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera):  Well, the air raid sirens are going off right now, and I've lost track of how many times they've gone off. That's because this area is close to the front line. And that's because it's incredibly active. And one of the commanders are looking for, they're looking for Russia to pull out forces from front lines to bring them and reinforce Bakhmut. And if they do that, if the Russians weaken defenses and some parts of the front line, this is where you may see the Ukrainian military leadership say, okay, that's the weak spot now, that's where we can attack, that's an opportunity for the counteroffensive. Right now, no one on the ground knows that.",

Nic, thank you very much from eastern Ukraine tonight.I want to go to the retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, of course, the former commanding general of Europe and the Seventh Army. So, General, let me just ask you. You hear what Nic saying that the implication there is that the soldiers, they don't know -- they don't know when, they don't know where, the soldiers on the ground, but that perhaps it may be that Ukraine is literally waiting to see where Russia pulls and moves troops away, and then creates the counteroffensive there. Do you think that's what's happening? I know that obviously you've written an op-ed talking about why this seems to have been taking so long, this much-anticipated counteroffensive. LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  There was so much, Erin, in Nic's report just now from a military perspective that would be glossed over by anyone else. But I got to tell you, what he's talking about is, yes, they are looking for activity within the Russian lines so they can -- the Ukrainians can use it to their advantage. But I got to tell you, I believe that the Ukrainians have already plotted their contingency operations for their offense. They know where they're going to go. They just want to get some last-minute information, some intelligence so they can shape the penetrations all along the front lines. Some of it may be in that Donbas area near Bakhmut. But I would suggest, we're talking about a several-hundred-kilometer frontage. They're going to go in a lot of different places, but great report by Nic.",

But truthfully we've been saying this for a long time, I don't think Russia can sustain this kind of attack any further.
