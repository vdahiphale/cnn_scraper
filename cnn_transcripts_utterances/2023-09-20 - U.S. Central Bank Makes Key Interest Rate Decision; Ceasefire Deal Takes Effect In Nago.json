It agreed to end a brief military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh under Russian-broke truce, which calls for Armenian separatists to disband and disarm. Russian peacekeepers stationed in the region say they will help coordinate the ceasefire. Talks on the region's future are due to begin we're told tomorrow. Dozens of people were killed in the offensive which drew condemnation from the West, but was supported by Turkey. It's still too early to know if the truce will hold or how it might shift the regional balance of power. Well, Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, have fought two wars over Nagorno-Karabakh. The region is internationally recognized, as you can see there on your map, as part of Azerbaijan, but it's dominated by ethnic Armenians and has its own de facto government. Armenia is historically a Russian ally, but it now accuses Moscow of turning its back on the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. Our Nic Robertson has the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Casualties from Azerbaijan's deadly artillery assault rushed to hospital in the majority-Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian death toll growing as the historic foe's fragile peace explodes into dangerous warfare, with potentially disastrous consequences.

The White House says Mr. Netanyahu has been invited to Washington for a visit before the end of the year. We're joined now by Jerusalem correspondent Hadas Gold and our senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche. Hadas, let me start with you, as you and I have discussed before, President Biden has made clear in the past that he disapproves of Netanyahu's plan to overhaul the courts.

But aside from the Saudi normalization, the issue of the overhaul is still very much on the table and could be actually heard likely in that room because there were protesters, yes, the same types of protesters we have here in Israel every single week, there were protesters on the streets of Manhattan protesting against the overhaul, protesting against Benjamin Netanyahu. And according to reporters who are part of the pool with Netanyahu and Biden, you could hear them from inside the hotel. Now, Biden did address this, and Benjamin Netanyahu did address that as well.

Many advisors had been telling President Biden that if the White House still had this deep unease about the judicial overhaul, then it wasn't a good backdrop. But President Biden's personal affiliation with BiBi worn out, and he wanted to take this meeting. He feels that he has a good relationship with him, and that there is no stand-in for personal conversations like these. Now, President Biden did invite the prime minister to Washington before the end of the year, that is something that has been in discussions for several months. But they also covered a wide range of issues regarding stabilization in the Middle East, where President Biden said they want to have a more stable and prosperous future. They also said that they had a shared goal of deterring Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And there was also a mention in the readout from the White House and from a senior administration official who briefed reporters after the meeting, about the need to end violence in the West Bank and to consult with regional partners to that end. So, certainly, there were many issues that President Biden wanted to bring up with the prime minister, but ultimately, it was that personal relationship that got this meeting on the books, even against the advice of some of his closest aides.",

An exclusive CNN investigation has uncoveredcompelling evidence that Ukrainian forces have struck Wagner-backed fighters inside Sudan. It comes as Russia tries to expand its influence in Africa, following the death of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. Nima Elbagir reports from Chad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nightfall in a war-torn neighborhood in the Sudanese city of Omdurman. You are watching a thermal imaging video depicting military forces equipped in high-tech gear. Far more sophisticated than the Sudanese have demonstrated to date. And here, a series of high precision daytime strikes raining down from the sky, in and around the same city, hitting targets backed by Russia's Wagner mercenary group in Sudan. A Ukrainian military source told CNN this is the work of a foreign military. Pressed on whether they would say unequivocally that Kyiv was behind the attacks. The source would only say that Ukrainian special services were likely responsible, which would constitute a dramatic expansion in Kyiv's theater of war against Moscow. Previous CNN investigations exposed that the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, RSF, has been heavily backed by Wagner as they fight the Sudanese army in a war for dominance. CNN obtained a series of videos of the operations show 14 different strikes on RSF weapons and equipment, believed to be provided by Wagner. We pinpointed several different locations of the drone strikes in Omdurman, an RSF stronghold that has become a focal point of the conflict. And we geolocated footage of the night raid to the same city by identifying the buildings seen here. The drone video, obtained by CNN, had already been edited but clues remained as to the identity of those behind the attacks. Text on the monitor of the drone control, as seen here, is in Ukrainian.",

Middle income countries like Colombia are proposing to swap foreign debt to be able to spend more on climate mitigation.
