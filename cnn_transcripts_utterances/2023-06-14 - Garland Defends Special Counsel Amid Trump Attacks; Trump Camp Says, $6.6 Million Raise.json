His political advisers sounding confident as they settle on a playbook for the 2024 race. And in New York, a grand jury has just indicted the former U.S. Marine who held a homeless man in a fatal chokehold on the subway. We're going to tell you what we're learning about the charges.

And just moments ago, I got off with Stephen Chung (ph), who told me that number has actually reached $7 million, that last bunch coming in just in the last hour.The breakdown here, that would be about $4.9 million in digital fundraising, that is email after email that you see saying that you need to support former President Trump, that he's -- you know, a political witch hunt, et cetera. And then 2.1 from the fundraiser last night, those were those high dollar donations, those bundlers. This is significant because there had been some concern among allies that that big boost that we saw in fundraising after the Manhattan arraignment was not going to happen again, that people might get tired of donating, legal issue after legal issue. That is not the case. Clearly, they are saying that they have raised $7 million since that indictment, again, $2.1 million from last night's fundraiser. I'm talking to a number of Trump sources who feel very good about this. They thought that this might happen but now they are convinced that they can continue to run their campaign essentially as though nothing is happening. Their playbook is to continue to change the narrative and to play this out in the school of public opinion. They want to make sure that people believe that this is a Democratic witch hunt, that Trump is taking control of the narrative. And that is what we saw when he went to Versailles yesterday after his court appearance, he went to that Cuban cafe. And that was a planned stop by his campaign committee. They knew there were no cameras in the courtroom. They wanted the only images to be of Trump smiling and being greeted by supporters on this day. And then we heard from Trump again last night delivering these remarks, calling this election interference, saying this was a hoax, saying that they were all out to get him. They are trying to clearly change the narrative here and paint him this way. And the other thing I am told by advisers that part of the plan is to essentially run this campaign full throttle despite what is going on legally. That means a number of appearances that are already scheduled he is going to continue to do. He has been meeting with his advisers on which states to go to next, where to have the rally next, where to have an event next. So, again, whether this actually works and if someone can actually be in this much legal trouble and be running for president, that remains to be seen but that is their plan right now.",

I mean, at this dinner last night Trump went back to is this candle-lit dinner with donors, we should note, it was about a thousand dollars at least to get in. These were major donors and campaign bundlers who were there.That is notable because, typically, Trump has relied on those small dollar donors in the past. As of last Thursday, when news that he had become a target, he was being indicted, when the indictment was released and unsealed on Friday, that is when you started to see them fundraising and the emails where they typically get smaller donations from. They are definitely using it to their advantage in that perspective. I still think the question of whether it puts him in legal peril is obviously a major one. We don't know exactly what that is going to look like. But what we are getting a clearer picture is of how they're going to use it to benefit the 2024 campaign to raise all this money.

We'll see a new and improved Aileen Cannon. Not as concerned with her lack of experience but there are ways she could put her thumb on the scale without getting reversed by the 11th Circuit.

Sam, where is Ukraine making these incremental gains. SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, it is striking, isn't it, that Odessa continues to be bombarded, a major port city, with cruise missiles hitting civilian areas that are, of course, being targeted by very high precision missiles, like cruise missiles. But on the ground, it is a much bloodier and more brutal conflict. If we look at what is going on south of Bakhmut, there have been now for nearly a week, I'd say, incremental but significant gains by advancing Ukrainian troops as they punch through the salient south of that very, very bitterly contested area. But more significantly, I think, Wolf, is what is going on on the southern front between Zaporizhzhia, which is Ukrainian-held, and the city of Donetsk, which is Russian-held and Russian-occupied since 2014-2015. And that is that the Ukrainians are making significant but small gains as they try to get through these very strong, very deep Russian defense lines. And the reason for that, Wolf, is that they want to be able to push through, cut off the southern front from the eastern front, split the Russian forces, and, of course, drive down towards the Crimean Peninsula. And to help them with that, interestingly enough, the Americans have recognized already that the losses being taken on that front are significant enough that they need immediate replenishment. So, we have seen America now coming forward with 15 Bradley fighting vehicles, 20 Strikers, HIMARS and other ammunition, 155 ammunition, very important resupply to maintain the momentum as this counteroffensive gets under way.

He was saying, I don't care if I go to jail, I don't care if I go to jail for life. He took off his jacket, he threw it down. He said, I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty. He balled his hands into fists, according to witnesses. And that is when the former marine took action by taking him in a headlock, taking him down.

Daniel penny has said through his attorneys that he was just holding him there as he struggled, waiting for help to arrive, and then when he let go, Mr. Jordan Neely was unresponsive. So, it took two weeks for the arrest to happen. Authorities wanted to talk to the witnesses, listen to the 911 tapes and get the report from the medical examiner. But now, it has gone to an arrest.
