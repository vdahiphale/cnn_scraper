I'm Paula Newton and you are watching CNN's continuing coverage of Israel at war.It is 3 a.m. here in Atlanta, 9 a.m. in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes again lit up the skies overnight. Israel's military says its forces have reached the outskirts of Gaza City. For the second time in as many days, Israel hit the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza with a devastating airstrike on Wednesday. Local hospital officials say at least 80 people were killed. Here's what an IDF spokesperson told CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESPERSON: You should have evacuated, you and your family, you shouldn't have been there. That doesn't mean that we wanted to kill anybody, it just means that when we warned Palestinians two weeks ago to evacuate that specific area because there was going to be major combat operations, they should have heeded the warning and they should have left. The sad reality that is unfolding now is that the civilians in Gaza are paying the price for the atrocities of Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

People have been gathering there in hopes of getting through. Now, for the first time since the war began, the Rafah border crossing opened Wednesday to several hundred foreign nationals, including aid workers who'd been stuck at that border for days.For more now on the opening of the Rafah crossing, here's CNN's Melissa Bell in Egypt for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A tired smile and a wave from one of the lucky few finally allowed to leave Gaza since the war began. These families, just some of the first foreign and dual nationals, finally permitted through the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Wednesday. The result of a deal brokered by Qatar between Israel, Hamas, Egypt and the United States that will allow all foreign and dual nationals to leave the besieged enclave. Also allowed to leave under the deal, the first Palestinians, 81 of the most severely wounded, those desperate enough for urgent surgical intervention taken one by one in a convoy of ambulances to a field hospital set up a few miles away and to other hospitals in northern Egypt. Large crowds of foreign nationals had been massing at the border after hearing at the start of the conflict that they'd be allowed out. Families desperately checking to see if they were some of those lucky enough, finally, to get through. ISMAIL ABU SHAABANE, AMERICAN-PALESTINIAN IN GAZA (through translator): I'm an American living in Gaza. We heard that the crossing was open, but unfortunately we discovered that it was open for specific nationalities at the moment and we had to turn back because the cellular network was down and we weren't aware that there was a list. We hope to see our names on the list tomorrow or the next day. BELL (voice-over): As the only crossing from Gaza to anywhere other than Israel, all eyes had been on Rafah ever since the total siege of the Strip was announced by Israel. It is the only way in and out now, and what's gone in has been painfully little. A further 20 trucks arriving on Wednesday, a drop in the ocean, say aid organizations given the needs inside. For some here it's been days or even weeks of waiting and praying. With ever dwindling supplies and under the constant fear of Israeli strikes, even here in the south where civilians had been told by the IDF to evacuate, nowhere in Gaza is safe for a small few a chance to leave and live again.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Paula, we're obviously watching these images very closely to see if any signs of movement there. It doesn't seem as if much is happening at the moment, but the expectation is that more people will be able to pass through. The U.S. says that it expects more American passport holders to pass through in the coming days.[03:05:02] A handful, varied a couple, went through on Wednesday when they weren't expected to, so that just shows how fluid the situation is. We don't know exactly if more injured Palestinians will be let through, but certainly the expectation is when it comes to dual nationals and foreign passport holders, more will come through. We do understand from sources in Qatar that deal that was brokered by Qatar did include any foreign passport holders in Gaza who wanted to get out and we know from Secretary Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State that Americans and their family's number around 1,000 in Gaza, around 5,000 from other countries in the enclave if you want to get out so a large number are still waiting. Though, this is obviously a major diplomatic breakthrough it's been, you know, three and a half weeks since the conflict started in no one barred, less than a handle of hostages have managed to get up get out up until this point but it is also worth noting that more than two million Palestinians are not on the table in these negotiations as of yet. This is just the acutely injured and foreign passport holders and there is also that separate track when it comes to the hostage negotiations. These negotiations also brokered by Qatar to try and get those some 240 hostages still held by Hamas out of the enclave. There are significant concerns. We know that process is being complicated by the accelerating ground and air offensive. President Biden was interrupted at an event on Wednesday, asked about a ceasefire, and he said that he was in favor of a pause to get those prisoners out. There is no sign at the moment, though, Paula, that pause is happening. If anything, we see that the IDF is ramping up its operations, especially in the north of Gaza.",

That is how they are justifying it. But we are seeing a surge. in international alarm and that is causing actual diplomatic protests. We've seen Jordan recall its ambassador to Israel along with Chile and Colombia. Bolivia has cut off diplomatic ties.These are sort of actual actions that are now being taken against Israel. And of course the United Nations humanitarian office has said that it thinks that these actions may be disproportionate and could amount to war crimes. So you know Israel is sticking to its guns, sticking to its idea that this was about targeting those Hamas operatives. They are going to continue to do that, they say, but they are now grappling with this surge in alarm and in opposition from what were previously allies. NEWTON: Clare Sebastian, for us, thanks so much as we continue to watch that rafa crossing for any movement. I really appreciate it. Now sources familiar with the negotiations for the deal allowing foreign nationals to leave Gaza tell CNN it came together after weeks of intensive diplomatic efforts. It is believed to be a critical first step in getting thousands of foreigners out of Gaza. CNN's MJ Lee has more now from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden personally confirming that the first group of American citizens had left Gaza and are now in Egypt. He said that the process of getting Americans and other foreign nationals and wounded Palestinians out of Gaza and into Egypt would take place in stages over the course of multiple days. The State Department has previously said that there are some 400 American citizens in Gaza that are wanting to leave. That is in addition to some 5,000 foreign nationals that are also believed to be in Gaza. The president's saying at an event in Minnesota that the administration has been working nonstop to reach this arrangement. This is what he said. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We're in a situation where safe passage for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals to exit Gaza has started. American citizens are able to exit today as part of the first group of probably over 1,000 will see more of this process going on in the coming days. We're working nonstop to get Americans out of Gaza as soon and as safely as possible.",

And it comes as the Israeli military reports advances in ground operations. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has our details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is all that remains. For the second day in a row, Israeli jets striking the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp, flattening apartment buildings. Hundreds were wounded and at least 80 people were killed, according to the director of the nearby Indonesian hospital. The IDF said it struck a Hamas command and control complex in Jabalia, killing Hamas militants. But civilians also clearly among the casualties, including children, rushed out of the rubble. Tonight, the United Nations Human Rights Office raising serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes. Israel blaming Hamas for using civilians as human shields. As it continues its offensive. A top Israeli commander now says his forces are closing in on Gaza City, Hamas' stronghold in the Gaza Strip. BRIG. GEN. ITZIK COHEN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (through translator): Were deepen the strip at the gates of Gaza city. In the last five days we have dismantled a lot of the abilities of Hamas. We have attacked strategic positions, all the explosive abilities, its underground facilities and other systems. DIAMOND (voice-over): Five days after Israel launched its ground offensive in Gaza, Israeli forces are advancing towards Gaza City from three different directions. In the north, Israeli armor and infantry have been spotted advancing from both ends of the Strip. Israeli tanks also appear to be closing in from the south. CNN geolocated this tank at the strategic Netzarim junction on the main road into Gaza City. Israel is also moving some of its artillery closer to Gaza. (on-camera): Until recently, this field was filled with Israeli artillery positions. You can see these mounds where howitzer guns or other types of artillery would dig in. And now, as Israeli forces move closer into Gaza, those artillery positions are also moving closer to support the troops on the ground. Now all that remains are these, boxes of munitions, artillery fuses used by the forces that were here. (voice-over): The question now is how deep Israeli forces will move into Gaza. MIRI EISIN, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM, REICHMAN UNIVERSITY: The only way to get to what Hamas has built over a decade inside the Gaza Strip, the only way is through a ground operation.

The leadership of Hamas is bankrupt and they have corrupted the entire population of the Palestinians in Gaza and are holding them hostage. The Israelis have no other choice other than regardless of this century or the next century. There is very little choice that they have if they want to get rid of Hamas. Now the challenge is, Hamas is the challenge with fighting these kind of wars is that when you kill a terrorist you grow three more terrorists. Hamas is an idea. You don't eradicate an idea. You can eradicate bad behaviors. You can eradicate those that are exercising those bad behaviors. But there will be a resurgence that will take place over time. And the Israelis know that. That's why there has to be a desired in-state that gets beyond what existed before 7 October. The Israelis, I think, understand that and have to reconcile that. Is that a two-state system? Is that remove the gates and have Israelis and Palestinians living together? I don't know what those good solutions look like, but I think the bad solutions look like.",
