They are very aware of the fact that Haley hasn't said what she's going to do past Super Tuesday.But to be very clear, they are not counting on her dropping out, they have already pivoted to a general election.

In Virginia, only 31 percent of Republican primary voters in these early numbers. And these will change throughout the night as more surveys come in say that, yes.Thirty-one percent Say yes, they're part of the MAGA movement, but six in 10, 59 percent of Republican primary voters in Virginia say no, they're not part of the MAGA movement. That's the least MAGA electorate we've seen in primaries today that looks more similar to what we saw in New Hampshire. In North Carolina, it's a little more MAGAfied, if you will. Thirty- nine percent say yes they consider themselves to be a part of the MAGA movement, 54 percent say they are not. Back to Virginia, we asked if Donald Trump is convicted of a crime, is he still fit for the presidency. Fifty-three percent, a majority of Republican primary voters say yes, Donald Trump is still fit for the presidency even if he is convicted of a crime, 40 percent say no. In North Carolina, even more so, 64 percent of Republican primary voters are saying, yes, Trump is fit for the presidency even if a convicted criminal. Only 32 percent, Wolf, say he is not.

Only 39 percent of Republican voters in Virginia said yes, they believe that they are part of the MAGA movement, 59 percent say no. In North Carolina, a little different, 39 percent say yes, part of the MAGA movement, 54 percent say no. JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. So, look at that doesn't mean they won't vote for Donald Trump at the end of the day. They just don't identify as part of the MAGA movement. To me, Wolf, the other numbers that were more striking or the -- was the question that followed, is he fit if convicted? In Virginia, 53 percent, more than half say he's fit to be president. In North Carolina, 64 percent, even more. One of the questions we're trying to find out here is with people who are not MAGA who might want an alternative to Trump, can Joe Biden peel these people away in November? When you see numbers like that, and let's just say as David Chalian just said, these are the first exit polls coming in. They're not -- these are the early polls, they're not the final polls.

Four years ago Joe Biden pulled off the biggest, fastest and most unexpected comeback and political history. His team spending this Super Tuesday examining exit polls for potential problems that lie ahead. I'm joined now by the governor of New York Democrat Kathy Hochul. Governor, thanks so much for joining us. As we see these new exit polls coming in, how does the President pull Republican voters over to his side when a majority in these exit polls, Republicans say Donald Trump is fit for the presidency, even if he's convicted of a crime?GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): Well, Wolf, it's great to be on your show again. And here's my advice for the Biden team. The Republicans you want to pull over are the women, especially since Donald Trump has made no disguise about his desire to continue stripping away the rights of all American women, not just Democrats, but Republican women and their daughters and granddaughters. So he promised he would stack the Supreme Court with people who are hostile to women's rights. He was successful in overturning Roe v. Wade, which is one of his goals. And now the Republican Party is going after the right of a family to get started with IVF. I mean, this is beyond the pale and contraception. So I think there's an opening for them to go after Republican women to help get him over the finish line in November. So when that comes down as a choice, someone who supports women, always has always will and someone who intentionally denigrates them, abuses them, as well as stripping away their rights, it'll be crystal clear who people need to vote for in this country and eight months from now.",

If the Republican Congress cajoled and pushed by 10 Republican members of Congress just from the state of New York, if they use their cloud with the speaker, and said, let's just pass the bipartisan bill that was supported by the majority of senators, Democrats and Republicans, if we can get that done, that will do exactly what Joe Biden said he wants done. He wants more money for the borders. He wants to shut down the border, at least give us a pause for now until we can get this under control.And the state of New York would benefit as well, with financial assistance as well as other states. They have a plan. They have a strategy. And the Republicans said they would not do it. They refused. You know why? Because Donald Trump told them not to. They are so under his control. It's pathetic. So executive actions, they will be -- they're being developed right now. I've been in communication with them. They will happen. But it shouldn't have to come to this, Wolf. There is a path. There was an opportunity. They could have solved this. Even the President went down to the border and reached his hand out to Donald Trump and said, let's solve this together. And Donald Trump said, no. You know what? You break it, you own it. Republicans now own the border problem. And we're going to make sure everybody, at least in the state of New York knows that this is going to be a liability for the Republicans running for office in November.

We felt the difference.What happened next, people went to court, they sued and the judge shut down the program and all the chaos started again. That's what the Biden administration is trying to be thoughtful about the club with a path that will be made sure that it's sustainable into the courts. So that's the pause right now, the delay.

So it'd be interesting to see if Nikki Haley actually over perform some of her recent numbers, because there are more people who maybe are a little less inclined to beat Donald Trump.But the earlier number that still sticks in my head, is that 40 percent of people in Virginia said that he was not fit if he gets convicted. To me, that says to you that those people, even if, let's say, half of them, 20 percent of that, you know, still vote for Donald Trump. There's still a big number of voters out there that are available to Joe Biden, or they're not going to vote or they go third party.
