We're learning new details tonight about the gunman who killed six people inside a Virginia Walmart, this massacre coming just days after the mass shooting inside a Colorado nightclub. And Thanksgiving travel is ramping up tonight despite soaring inflation, airfare, gas prices and hotel rates all hitting or nearing record highs as Americans return to their pre-pandemic holiday habits. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world, Wolf Blitzer is off tonight. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to our top story this hour, the Department of Justice pursuing testimony from former Vice President Mike Pence in its criminal probe of January 6th. CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz has been working her sources. Katelyn, what is the likelihood of Pence agreeing to this request?",

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, this is at the very least a starting point for Mike Pence. And for the Justice Department, a lot would have to happen before they would be able to get him to come in to testify. But our reporting Evan Perez and I have been able to confirm that Pence is open to the discussing a possible agreement to speak with the Justice Department about what he knows about after the election in 2020 and that lead-up to January 6th.Now, this is a watershed moment for this Justice Department investigation into January 6th. We know that there has been a lot of interest in what exactly was said in the Oval Office in those days, especially on the 6th. The Justice Department has tried to nail down things, including direct conversations with Donald Trump. We know that there's a special counsel that is coming in. And I should note this discussion, this request that the Justice Department sent over to Pence's team, it did happen before the special counsel was appointed. And so now we're going to be watching to see how any negotiations behind the scenes may be playing out as Jack Smith, that new special counsel, comes in and leads this investigation forward. MARQUARDT:  And Pence did reject the request by the January 6th congressional committee to testify. He said this in a CNN town hall last week. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  Congress has no right to my testimony. The very notion of a committee in Congress summoning a vice president to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House, I think, would violate that separation of powers.

I mean, if you look back historically, even in Iran-Contra, in that affair, there was a criminal proceeding that arose out of it, a prosecution of a defendant and former President Ronald Reagan did testify in court for that.

It's quite obvious that Trump is going to try to invoke it, delay it through the courts, and Pence in that clip that we just played is signaling that he thinks whatever he was talking about was part of the deliberations, which I would disagree with. I mean, frankly, the idea that you could easily, quickly resolve this is highly unrealistic. And if I were the special prosecutor and I was ready to charge, I would just go ahead charge without Pence's testimony and let the defense worry about Pence.",

Remember, the crowd was screaming that they were going to hang Mike Pence, seemingly inspired by comments that the president himself had made earlier in the day at the rally.And I think on this issue of executive privilege and separation of powers, something very important you have to consider. Congress is a separate branch of government but the Department of Justice is part of the executive branch of government. So, there is no separation of powers issued that's being presented. And there is no executive privilege that's legitimate here, because we're talking about the commission of a crime. And in Watergate, and as Katelyn pointed out, in Iran-Contra, executive privilege didn't apply. So, if they want to force Pence in, they'll have the ability to do it. And in a sense, he's a victim of this crime as much as the country was.",

I can understand from political standpoint, he would view Congress differently than the Justice Department. To Paul's point, he may think this is a criminal matter. So, you know, it's a little bit different from political motivations in Congress.One interesting aspect is there's so little case law on executive privilege, but what is the sanction if Pence did the right thing and just said I want to testify, executive privilege be damned? Who's going to sanction him for it? He's not in a representative capacity? There's no attorney-client privilege, and he's not a federal employee anymore.

As Katelyn said, this appears to be a more maturing type of investigation. And I think what you can really tell about his no- nonsense approach is he's not trying to grandstand or get in the way and say, let me take a fresh look at things.So, I think that what we can expect going forward. I mean, there's going to come a time where he has to exercise discretion and make the recommendations. But right now, it shows that he is using very good sense to use the existing work and the momentum that's already been built up. [18:10:02] MARQUARDT:  Paul, we just have a few minutes left.

It was absolutely packed, shoulder to shoulder. And local officials here have told me they expect across the Chicago airports an increased level of travelers over this Thanksgiving period. But that's in line with what we're seeing nationwide.Over the past two days, we've seen around 4.5 million people screened through TSA, which is up through the same days in 2021 but slightly down at the very least comparable to the same days in 2019. That said, the vast majority of people are going to be driving. We are talking around close to 49 million people hitting the roads over this. That's slightly up from last year, slightly down from 2019. But bottom line, people are going to be hitting the roads. So, it's not just congestion in these lines, it's going to be congestion in traffic lanes depending on when you're going, of course. Now, the air travel, AAA estimates we're going to see that up 8 percent this year compared to the last one. And one of the passengers who we spoke to a little bit earlier found herself caught in some of that dynamic. Take a listen to what she told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
