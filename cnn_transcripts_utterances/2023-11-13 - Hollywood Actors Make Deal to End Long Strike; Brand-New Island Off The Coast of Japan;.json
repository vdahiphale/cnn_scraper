But tonight, a sigh of relief, Hollywood actors have reached a tentative agreement with the major film and TV studios to end the strike. FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG-AFTRA: There is so much language in this contract that covers so much new ground that has never been in any of the contract before.",

The deal calls for actors to be able to have consent and compensation when an AI likeness of them is used. DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND, CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, SAG-AFTRA: They`re intended to be protections that not only will make sure that our members have the right to control the use of their image and likeness today. But as the technology develops and grows in the industry will continue to provide them with that kind of control. And it`s so essential because it`s really their persona that`s being used.",

The first time both entities had been on strike simultaneously in more than 60 years, proved incrediblycostly over the course of the last six months.

(On camera): While the actors are getting historically higher pay with this new deal, one industry analyst says there could be less work overall to go around for them in the future because he expects the studios and streaming services might start to reduce the numbers of TV shows and movies they order to save money.

It`s about a hundred meters in diameter reaches as high as 20 meters according to the Japan meteorological agency. There has been increased underwater volcanic activity in this area in recent years, but the agency says the formation of this new island is significant. It popped up along the Japanese archipelago or group of islands, about 750 miles south of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. Only half a mile though, from the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. It doesn`t have a name yet, so what would you call it? Ten second trivia. Veterans day began with an observance that marked the end of what war? U.S. Civil War, World War I, World War II or Vietnam war? The holiday observed on November 11 recalls Armistice Day, which barked the end of World War I. Now for a salute to the troops, Veterans Day in the U.S. is a federal holiday dedicated to recognizing the current and former members in all branches of the U.S. military. It honors the countless women and men who`ve served in sacrificed for the greater good of all of us, for the nation. The holiday is observed on November 11th each year, regardless of the day of the week. This year, it was Saturday. Many schools across the states though had Friday off to honor the occasion in recognition of all who`ve served. CNN 10 is going to give us salute by exploring the 24-note bugle call referred to as taps. It`s considered the nation`s National Anthem of Remembrance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) YARI VILLANEUVA, (ret.) U.S. AIR FORCE, TAPS FOR VETERANS: Of all the military bugle calls, not as more easily recognized, more apt to evoke emotion than the bugle call taps. Taps is our national song of remembrance. It`s a bugle call that was started during the civil war and is actually started as a lights out call. But today is used as a final farewell to our military personnel. My name is Yari Villaneuva. I am currently the President of Taps for Veterans, a nonprofit organization that helps provide live bugles for military funerals. Taps for veterans came about because we saw a need for live bugles at military funerals. In the late 1990s, a lot of the military bands were being downsized. And because of that there was a lack of military buglers available to play at funerals. The electronic bugler has taken precedents over a live musician. And this is something that we thought we could address and something that we could do better. We could have a live bugler. That was the impetus performing Taps for Veterans. We thought that it would be great to honor all veterans with a live performance of taps. And setting up a system whereby a family in need could reach out to us on our website and, and get a bugler so that we could honor that veteran we have. Well, over 1200 buglers around the country who are willing to step up and serve. The emotion of a person playing it, the music coming from their heart, you know, that goes through the tubing out. That`s out to the people hearing it is really important. A live performance is just so -- so much preferable over than a recorded one. I mean, no one wants to go to a symphony hall and sit and listen to a recording of a symphony. They want to see and hear the live musicians playing that. We understand how important it is to have the recording. But it`s really important and paramount that a live bugler be used, especially when you have one who`s there willing to give their services to honor that veteran. And at the bottom line, that`s what it`s all about, honoring that veteran for his, or her service through our country. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
