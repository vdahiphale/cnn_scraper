It's been a month and yet we're not getting much from authorities.They are saying they're looking for this car, a white Hyundai Elantra, made between 2011 and 2013. They believe that car was near the house in the early morning hours of November 13th when these students were stabbed multiple times while they were sleeping. Authorities say they're getting a lot of tips on this. They say they got so many tips, they had to change their strategy. Not only are local police overwhelmed, they're handing it off to the FBI, saying it's an easier process for them if the FBI call center takes these tips. They say it's a longer process. But one of these tips could be key to solve this case. That's why it's so important to talk to the people driving this car, or if there were any passengers in the car. They say any information these people may have could be critical to this investigation. Again, tomorrow will be a month since all of this happened. There's still just so much frustration and so much fear in this community. It is graduation weekend here. It's supposed to be a weekend where people are celebrating and, yet, there's no one here that you talk to that can just ignore what's going on. It is on everyone's mind. Everyone says they're thinking about it and praying for these families and for the victims and the friends. There was a moment of silence today at the commencement ceremony. It was emotional and a time to remember the victims. It's a weekend people are supposed to be celebrating. The restaurants are full, the hotels are full. Yet, authorities put out a statement telling people to be vigilant, to walk in groups, to essentially tell your friends and family where you are at all times. It's frustrating and scary for people to think, a month later, there's still no motive, there's no suspect, there's no weapon. It's the same thing we've been saying for a month. So, yes, it's frustrating -- Jim?",

Mary Ellen, as we were saying with Camila, tomorrow marks one month since these students were murdered. What is your assessment of the investigation a this one-month mark. I have to ask you, the fact that the police are putting out this car that they are finding to be very interesting as part of this investigation. They want to get to the bottom of what this car is all about is the area. What do you think of that? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR FBI PROFILER: Well, I think they have no choice but to put out as much information as they can about that vehicle. It does not necessarily mean that the offender drove away in that vehicle. What it means is there could have been somebody in that vehicle that saw something. It's very likely they have vetted all the other cars in the neighborhood to rule out any other involvement. It's important they be able to do this just because it has come in apparently for several people that it's a significant lead.",

Not to be grim about this, but if you kill four people on two different floors of a house, wouldn't there be a significant amount of DNA evidence left behind?O'TOOLE: There should be. And the offender likely cut himself. Blood is very slippery. So when the offender was stabbing these people, it's lick likely that their hand slipped on the blade and that would have cut himself and that would have gone onto the comforter or the floor. So the Analysts were very careful, I'm sure, to make sure they picked up all the evidence around the immediate stabbing area so they could take it back to the lab and do the Analysis. They're looking for obviously the victims' blood, but they're also looking for the blood that offender left behind. The gold standard is DNA. In a case like this, where you have four victims, multiple stabbings, excessive stabbings, it's very likely the offender left his own DNA there. What is so interesting, because your offender is watching the news, there's no doubt about that, he's monitoring the investigation. There's no way for this offender to go back in time and correct that. What's done is done.",

She says this has haunted her. She also claims, Jim, she contracted HPV, a sexually transmitted virus, after the incident. Nick Carter denying this. It doesn't seem to be going over well on ABC. On December 14th, they were going to be airing this television special called \"A Very Backstreet Holiday.\" Now because of these allegations, the entire group is suffering and they will not be going forward with it. I want to point out, Nick Carter faced a similar accusation in 2017 after a woman claimed he raped her more than 15 years ago. She made this allegation in 2017.
