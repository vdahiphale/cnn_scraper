      "sentences": "OUTFRONT\" next, abducted. New video appears to show Russian officers dragging a young man into the back of the car, forcing him to fight Putin's war. And it comes as we learn just how many more troops Putin thinks he needs on the battlefield now.Plus, former Vice President Mike Pence wrapping up his testimony before the grand jury investigating Trump just moments ago. What we are learning tonight about his five-plus hours behind closed doors today. And Tucker Carlson's pattern of offensive and sexist comments about women, it's not just about calling women the c-word. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, dragged into war. New video into OUTFRONT tonight shows the violent tactics that Russia is using right now to get young known the front lines. So, what you're seeing on this video is what's believed to be a Russian conscript, a young man, being forced into the back of a car in Moscow. The young man is resisting. The young man is screaming for help. But he loses. He's taken away. And the person filming says a police officer is standing by doing nothing. And it is scenes like this we have heard about in Moscow, right, go down on the subway, people there who can round people up. It's everywhere. We hear about this. It's happening across Russia and Moscow itself now. And while Russia has been ramping up recruiting and, of course, Ukraine has as well, Russia has been going to the extreme. According to \"The Washington Post,\" which has seen more of the leaked classified U.S. intelligence documents that were posted online by Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, Putin reportedly backed -- reportedly backed his military's proposal to quietly recruit 400,000 additional troops throughout this year for the war in Ukraine, 400,000 more. Remember, they went in at the beginning of what was estimated to be about 150 to 190, 40,000 or so are dead. So 400,000 more this year. Now, according to the documents, there is, though a big concern that doing that could turn public opinion against Putin. And that has forced Russia, as we have seen thus far, to require or rely on prisoners and local recruitment campaigns which have been in the far reaches of Russia, right? Not in Moscow. Well, this effort to quickly recruit men comes as Ukraine itself is gearing up for a counteroffensive. Today, we did hear reports of more major explosions in Russian-held parts of Ukraine. The attack that you see here is said to have targeted either a Russian ammunition depot or an electricity substation. And the reason that we are mentioning these explosions today is that our Tim Lister is reporting that they are seeing a change. There's been a definite up tick in Ukrainian attacks on Russian hubs in recent days in these past couple weeks which is the same sort of activity that we saw ramping up right before that successful counteroffensive in Kherson. Now, this all comes in the context of this incredibly massive leak from the 21-year-old Teixeira, who is accused of leaking the documents. And he appeared in court today. Prosecutors say Teixeira could still be a threat. They say he may still have more classified information which makes him a valuable asset to American adversaries, including Russia. Now, let me show this. This is Teixeira's bedroom. This is an image from his bedroom. And on the wall, we just highlighted there in the little spotlight, you see what is a pennant. It bears the insignia of the Russian military general staff. Infer from that what you will, but this is why they're so concerned. Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT live at the Pentagon tonight. And, Oren, you do have new details on the government's case against Teixeira. What are you learning tonight?",

He also asked another user what type of rifle would be good to conduct a shooting in a crowded urban or suburban environment. Teixeira's lawyers argued in court he poses no danger and is not unique in collecting weapons. Some people are car guys. Some people like boats. And some people like guns, his attorney said in court, defending his client as the Pentagon defended the process that led here. The leaked documents exposed classified U.S. intel including about the war in Ukraine. Documents revealed the limitations of Ukraine's air defenses and manpower, while also detailing Russia's efforts to recruit more troops to plug its military's ranks, valuable info the prosecutors say other countries would covet. And authorities warned Teixeira may still have more sensitive intelligence hidden away and could still be capable of causing extraordinary damage to U.S. national security. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on camera):  Teixeira remains in custody at this point. The judge hasn't ruled yet in his detention hearing but the judge may have given an indication which way the judge was leaning because he said the prosecution's evidence, quote, fairly compelling, Erin.",

And retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton, former intelligence officer, which, of course, is so crucial in this conversation. So, Ian, let me start with you, though, on what prosecutors are arguing. They're saying that Teixeira is 21-year-old is a flight risk. They say he's an attractive candidate for foreign government to recruit. Now, back to that spotlight because I felt like that showed so much, at least to me, there was a pennant in his room, the colors, symbol of the Russian government and military, right? The military insignia there. When you put all this together, Ian, what do you think? Fair to say flight risk? IAN BREMMER, EURASIA GROUP PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER:  Fair to say 21 years old, this is a kid -- we know pretty strongly from what he was sharing and what he was saying on his gaming group that this is a kid that was showing off. It's not a kid that had any significant level of access to decision making, but, of course, he did have -- access to real documents. Do I think he could make a real difference in terms of sort of Russian leadership and national security? Not really. Not from what we've seen already. But I think he is a danger to the country and a danger to himself, frankly. If there's a level of concern that would keep him under lock and key for the time being, what -- given what we know he's done, I'm not -- I'm fairly sympathetic to that argument. Let's put that way.",

So, I mean, I guess on one level this is a little stunning because you're thinking, wow, how did they not know what he got yet?

That's very different from anything that we've been seeing over the past year of this invasion where the couple points that you just made, which are important, don't get me wrong, but you know, we've known very well of Russian catastrophic failures on the battlefield and necessity to raise more conscripts, the difficulty of doing so. We've also known of their incredible brutality and the war crimes they've committed.What we're seeing is more pressure on the Ukrainians towards negotiation. That's also true as we get closer to a Trump nomination on the GOP side, and also true because of these leaks, which showed that the Americans were concerned that Ukrainians weren't going to be able to take much land. In other words, what they were saying publicly and privately understandably a little bit different on this front. And then you've got Macron going over and saying, I want a ceasefire fast. So, I think the net/net of the week is that Zelenskyy is feeling more pressure to get things done quickly and that time is not necessarily on his side.",

Now, this is according to sources who tell CNN.It marks the first time in modern history that a former vice president was compelled to testify about the president he served. And it comes just after Trump lost an emergency attempt to block Pence from testifying about their direct conversations leading up to the insurrection. OUTFRONT, Ryan Goodman, former special counsel at the Department of Defense and co-editor in chief of \"Just Security\". All right. So, we talked about the possibility of this day. I should be clear anything he said wasn't about the actual January 6th itself but about what was before and after because of -- he won that constitutional fight. But, do you think this can move the needle? Even if all he did was repeat essentially what he said in interviews in his book? RYAN GOODMAN, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL AT DEPT. OF DEFENSE:  I think so. It's a missing piece so that the special prosecutor -- special counsel can now have direct evidence from Pence himself of what the president told him at the time. And doesn't have to rely on this patchwork of what others said Trump said to Pence. And so, incriminating evidence in part because direct evidence that on January 5th in the oval office, Pence says to president Trump, I do not have the constitutional authority to try to block the certification. And in the book, Pence says that Trump responds, you want to play by the marquee of Queensbury rules, which is a boxing rules. In other words, you don't want to -- you want to play by the rules. We're trying to break the rules, because if they break the rules, we break the rules. That's incriminating. In other time, apparently, Trump says to him, you're too honest because Pence has said that he rejects the fringe litigation coming out of Louie Gohmert in the House saying that he is trying to litigate to block Pence from being able to certify the elections. He says he's being too honest by opposing that. BURNETT:  So, you're saying that even those things existed in print, they would not have been usable until they were under oath.
