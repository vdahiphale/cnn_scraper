We're about two weeks, yes, almost two weeks in and it's continuing to heat up even tonight, and that escaped prisoner, now armed, is even more dangerous. So, what's going to happen tonight? We've got a live report with all of the ups and the minute developments coming up. But I want to begin with Kevin McCarthy or shall I say Speaker McCarthy unilaterally ordering an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden even as Republicans have yet to actually prove any allegations that he directly profited from his son's foreign business deals, and it comes as the speaker is under enormous pressure from far-right members of his own party, readying to kick him out of the speakership if he does not move fast enough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY, SPEAKER, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction and corruption, and they warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives. That's why today, I am directing our House committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. This logical next step will give our committee the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, you couldn't have forgotten. We all were up to the crack of dawn watching him try to win the speaker's gavel. And after 15 rounds, of course, he in fact made it.And here we are, everyone. We're nine months later and it seems that it's maybe time to pay the piper. So, how? Is it payback in the form of an impeachment inquiry? The question is, for what? Because I haven't actually heard the exact reason or the high crime and misdemeanor that would be required there. But McCarthy says that they can open an impeachment inquiry, anyway.

It's the Biden financial records, which to me is more like a subpoena of sorts, isn't it? The real question everyone was asking, of course, is, can you actually use the impeachment inquiry process as a vehicle to get that information? That's the only way to get what you are trying to get. Let's ask the former Republican congressman, Joe Walsh. Joe is also the host of \"White Flag,\" the podcast. Also, May Mailman, former Trump White House associate counsel, is here. She is the vice president for Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections. And CNN legal analyst and former House judiciary special counsel in Trump's first impeachment trial, of course, Norm Eisen, is here. Look, first of all, again, we're all old enough to remember and young enough to remember, a high crime and misdemeanor was the phrase of the day for two impeachments in as many years. Now it's about the inquiry trying to get information alone. And a lot of people think, isn't that what a subpoena is for? Now the Republicans will say, look, we've tried a lot of ways to get this, and we're going this route. But can you use the impeachment process, Norm, to do this?",

I don't think that Republicans have a desire for every single year, every single month, every single week for there to be an impeachment.I can tell you Republicans do not want President Kamala Harris, right? But I think that there is this fear that if only Democrats unlock the impeachment power for a way that we think was unwarranted and there's never any response, Republicans continue to say, I think there should be a higher bar, I think there should be a higher bar, then what you'll always get is one side bringing the impeachment and never the other. And so, in order to end the madness, to stop, to raise the bar for everyone, there has to be recognition. You get in the mud, we're getting in the mud. And once we have that recognition, if you do it, we do it, then maybe, maybe the bar can be raised for everybody. COATES: Well, I have to say, there's a lot of mud, and people all look dirty in Washington, D.C. President company excluded. But I will say, if it really is just purely the tit for tat, and I want to focus on what I find most interesting about this, not just the idea of whether an impeachment is retaliatory or promised, we knew that was going to happen in a minute. And frankly, Democrats were concerned and should have been concerned that if you have impeachments back to back, you dilute a little bit of the power of that shock value of what's happening. But using the inquiry for the purpose of getting information is the issue to me. I mean, if there is warranted or not reasons, is this the only way you can get the info?",

That gives him possibly an advantage. He could set up an ambush.These teams behind me are coming through this area of the search perimeter behind me. He could be not far away from here, kind of trying to find his next target. This entire sequence of him getting that rifle has changed the game in this manhunt. It began -- this new sequence began at about 8 p.m. Eastern time last night when a motorist drove past on a road not far from here and saw him crouching by the side of the road as she drove past. When she doubled back to try to get another look at him, he had vanished. About two hours later, about 10 p.m. Eastern time, police got a call about shots fired. Danelo Cavalcante had gone to a garage, bolted in, picked up the rifle and a box of ammunition. The owner was right there, fired several shots at him but didn't get him, and he wasn't even injured, he got away. That sequence, Laura, has really changed the game here. It has intensified this manhunt. We have now got upwards around 500 law enforcement officers on the ground, again, combing this area right behind me. That's more law enforcement officers than we have ever had during this manhunt. And, you know, again, it is intensifying. Reverse 911 calls have gone out.

He's got to continue to find water and food, more clothes. I think he's probably going to try and steal another vehicle.

We will continue to follow what is going on.I want to bring in Mark Gillen. He's a Republican Pennsylvania State representative from a district near this very search area. You know, I have to ask you, representative, about what it has been like for the people in your state and in your community. I mean, we're talking about this manhunt. People are terrified. They're getting information on their ring doorbells, there are sightings, there is -- now, he's armed. He has taken apparently a box of ammunition as well. Are you hearing anything from your constituents about what this experience has been like for them particularly? STATE REP. MARK GILLEN (R-PA): Well, it's terrorizing them and people are constantly going to their window once they get inside their house or locking their doors. I live on a 41-1/2-acre farm. It's a substantially rural area and there's just a state forest buffering us between the activity where he was last seen. I had one child come to speak to me and I think this is probably startling and expresses it best and say, I am now locking the door to my tree house. People are being very vigilant. This is a place where you leave your keys in your car, you don't lock your doors. The whole paradigm has changed. I look at this through the window of a former correctional officer in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and as a leader and committee chair in emergency preparedness as well as veterans' affairs and a former university police officer and 30-year emergency medical technician. So, as I look at it through these different windows, I understand exactly why people are afraid.",

GILLEN: Well, I think our immigration policy administered to federal level is deeply flawed. This is not about legal immigration. My grandparents came from Italy, Hungary and Ireland, and we're certainly a very welcoming country. But you look at a 10-year window in Texas, 2011 to 2021, there were over 700 illegals charged with murder. This is not an anomaly. This has been happening on a regular basis. This invasion must end. The man was wanted for murder in another country. He found a way to get in this country and get settled. I understand that there were some illegal documents that he used, forged paperwork. We have to get better at every level, TSA, borders, detecting when somebody is using forged documents.",

Otherwise, the breadth of those who are in this country could obviously not be looked at on a day-to-day basis. Is that something that you believe needs to change?

State Republicans are threatening to impeach the recently sworn and liberal justice, Janet Protasiewicz, over comments that she made, calling the state's legislative maps, well, rigged and unfair while on the campaign trail, I should mention.Now, the state's partisan gerrymander has been called one of the worse in the country, I might add. It was a major issue along with abortion during the Supreme Court election this spring that gave liberals a four to three majority after 15 years of conservative control. Now, state Republicans say that if she refuses to recuse on cases related to the gerrymander issue, that would be grounds for impeachment. Joining me now to discuss is Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler. Thank you for joining us today, Ben. This is a story we've been following. And it is just extraordinary to think about while there are calls to impeach a president in Washington, D.C., let's not forget about the power to impeach at the state level. I'm talking about Ken Paxson, of course, in Texas. Now, a Supreme Court justice in the state of Wisconsin. The comments they're talking about, about impeaching the judge, were made while she was on the campaign trail. And, of course, voters still chose her by, I think, a commanding, was it 11 percentage points? So, what is the impact for the voters now?",

But the politicians in the Republican state legislature in Wisconsin are talking about overturning the will of the voters who had a clear choice in the election in order to lock in their power that comes from their gerrymandered maps. And that is totally unconstitutional.I mean, the Constitution is very clear. In every state and nationally, that impeachment is for things like high crimes and misdemeanors. In Wisconsin, the language is crimes, misdemeanors or corrupt conduct in office. Janet Protasiewicz hasn't ruled in a single case. So, the republican idea here is to nullify the election in order to lock in their power and, I might add, a pre-civil war abortion ban that is almost total in criminalizing abortion. That is not how democracy is supposed to work and my dearest hope is that the Republicans hear the public outrage and back off from this threat.",

It is a politically-elected position. And so, there's a little bit of a double-edged sword between campaigning for what you want on a platform and being held to account for impeachment, I guess, later on. But what is the end game here? I mean, the idea that they're just challenging her. Others who have vied for this position have had campaigning issues, of course. They've talked about the campaign funding.

They're thinking about not 2025, but 1999, when Vinny Testaverde tore his Achilles, or maybe 2005 when Chad Pennington went down with his shoulder injury, or 2008 when Brett Favre, who also, by the way, used to be a Green Bay Packer, remember when he tore his biceps? So, what's now for this team, especially with its latest in a string of surprise at a season that's not even a week old yet?
