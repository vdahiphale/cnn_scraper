It sure looks that way.We know that 46 percent of Americans say Trump should be disqualified for his actions related to January 6th. That is based on this new \"Washington Post\"/University of Maryland poll that was completed before these unprecedented bans. The person behind one of those controversial ballot decisions is joining us now. That's Maine's Secretary of State Shenna Bellows. Secretary, thank you for being with us here. Tell us, do you think that your decision will survive this appeal by Trump and possibly survive the Supreme Court? SHENNA BELLOWS, (D), MAINE SECRETARY OF STATE: Thank you for having me. What I think is important to recognize is that this is the process in Maine. Maine is unlike other states, whereby anyone, any registered voter who challenges a candidate's qualifications must appeal the secretary of state. I did my job that I was required to do under Maine law and the Constitution in holding a hearing and issuing a decision. The next step under the law is this appeal to Maine's Supreme Court and Superior Judicial Court and then the U.S. Supreme Court. And I, on the last page of my decision, I suspended the effect of my decision pending the court losses because that is what is important, the rule of law and the Constitution.",

It's also unprecedented for a presidential candidate to engage in insurrection.

He said he was the victim of cyber kidnapping.Zhuang's parents, back in China, even received a ransom photo after he vanished last week. CNN's David Culver has been tracking all of this. David, what more are investigators saying about the whole ordeal? DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey guys. Police say scammers manipulated and controlled this young exchange student, Kai Zhuang, for more than a week. They threatened his family back in China and convinced the 17-year-old to leave his host family in Utah and to go camp out alone in the snow and below-freezing temperatures, what you can see right there. That's when police in Riverdale, Utah, found Shuang. It was on a Sunday. They said he was cold and scared but alive. With him, several cell phones. That's how police say these virtual captors manipulated and controlled the teen, likely from thousands of miles away. They call this, as you point out, cyber kidnapping. They warn scammers are increasingly targeting foreign exchange students, like Zhuang, threatening them and their loved ones back in China. Here's what Riverdale police have to say. Quote, \"They tell the victims to isolate themselves and they monitor them through Facetime calls and/or Skype. \"The cyber kidnappers convince the victim, under duress to take photos of themselves that make it appear they are being held captive and send the photos to their parents.\" In China, Zhuang's parents were equally terrified, unable to get a hold of their son. Reportedly getting these ransom letters and photos and ultimately calling the school in Utah to report their son missing. But only after transferring the equivalent of roughly $80,000 into Chinese bank accounts. In recent months, police across China have been warning international students, in particular, Chinese students who are either in China or outside studying, that these scammers are impersonating officials. They claim the students when they call them are under investigation so as to scare them to comply. There have been similar cases targeting folks across the U.S. in recent years. It has the FBI now warning scammers are becoming more and more convincing. This is because of technology. A.I. is allowing people to more precisely impersonate the voices of loved ones. As for Zhuang, when they found him on Sunday, officials say he wanted two things, guys. He wanted to talk to his family in China to make sure that they were OK. And then he asked if he could eat a warm cheeseburger. He's still a kid. He did get both of those things. But it's terrifying thinking that these scammers took advantage of the family being in different country, different time zones, coercing them into handing over so much money.",

But we are interested to see how exactly they are going to go after it. Because they tend to be very good, having lived in China for three years, of tracking things down, individuals and money transfers. So in this case, if it is still in China and if those scammers are still in China, it's possible that they could track it down, but a challenge, nonetheless.",
