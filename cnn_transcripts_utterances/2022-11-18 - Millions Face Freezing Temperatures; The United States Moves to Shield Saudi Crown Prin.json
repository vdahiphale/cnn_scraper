This has the potential to paralyze, even cripple a city's infrastructure.We look back to 2014 when a similar snow event occurred. It crippled the city of Buffalo, New York, and it also collapsed some buildings just by the sheer weight of the snow that falls. Any time you see over three feet of snow, you're going to have problems, right? So, this is localized and very centralized to Western New York, but there's also some heavy snowfall occurring downwind from Lake Michigan, Lake Superior. That's where we have winter storm warnings. But I'm really going to focus on what's happening downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Here's the latest radar. There's Buffalo, there's Watertown, New York. Both of these locations have the potential to see multiple feet of snow, and you can already see that kind of almost fire hose of a band of snow that is formed. That is the lake effect snow band that has become so important and the direction of that wind is going to be so critical in who gets the most snow and who says the most paralyzing impacts from this particular winter storm. So far, rates, by the way, two to four inches per hour. And look closely in the southern suburbs of Buffalo, those are lightning strikes. Thundersnow is common in this type of a setup. It's similar to an intense thunderstorm in parts of Buffalo, but this is, of course, cold enough to see snow. We've already seen two feet in some locations, and that wind direction is ever so important because it is really going to determine who sees the most snow. If we have more of a west-southwesterly wind, that sets the heavy snow south of Buffalo. But if it is more of a southwesterly wind direction and has more of a fetch over Lake Erie, that means Buffalo gets hit hardest. Let me take you there because I want to show you what it looks like on the shores of Lake Erie right now. It is blustery and this is one of those bands of snowfall moving in. It's going to dump up to three to four feet of snowfall for this area. Just incredible.",

And what that does is it just keeps the attention and the news cycle and their own party's views on what they see as the main failures of the Biden administration from the Afghanistan withdrawal to COVID and, of course, personal issues as well, especially around Biden's son, Hunter Biden.

I think they are doubling down on the fact that most Republican voters will lean into a lot of these issues and investigations that they are planning to look into.

She did that also while shepherding Congress through some really tough periods, through COVID, changing some of the rules to keep the chamber operating, through the stormy Trump years and, of course, through January 6th. She also managed to keep her own caucus together as the Democrats themselves started to diverge in ways that they haven't really before between progressives and more centrist wings. So, she did manage to do all that. She obviously had her enemies and critics through all of that as well.

And if you add in the Scud missiles, which are the older and slower missiles that don't violate UN Security Council resolutions, but certainly still pose a threat, especially if they were all launched at once, which North Korea launched about 80 total missiles over a period of just a few days, just a matter of weeks ago, it adds up to a potentially very, very serious threat. Because missile defense systems that exist in South Korea and the United States and Japan wouldn't be able to accurately shoot down all of those incoming missiles if they were fired in this salvo -- this barrage if you will.So, North Korea essentially experts say has been demonstrating with these launches their ability to you know, engage a nuclear war that would be -- that would be catastrophic for all sides involved. And from the North Korean perspective, all my trips into that country, I was told these missiles are a deterrence just like the American and Russian, and Chinese nuclear arsenals, then the other countries around the world like India, Pakistan, Israel, the UK, I mean, all of the nuclear powers of the world have these weapons and they exist for deterrence purposes. Now, this intercontinental ballistic missile traveled on a lofty trajectory, which is a typical test trajectory for an ICBM. That means it didn't travel, you know, to another continent like it potentially could but it demonstrated the ability to do that by shooting a very, very high. You're talking about 6100 kilometers. So, it went well up into space. It was traveling at 22 times the speed of sound, Mach 22 at maximum speed, and its splashdown in the waters inside Japan's exclusive economic zone but it did not have a trajectory that would have taken it over Japan. That said, near the northern island of Hokkaido, U.S. military base there, they did actually issue a Shelter in Place alert because there was concern about falling debris. These missiles when they test them, they don't have a nuclear warhead in them, of course, but there's always the risk of this thing -- you know, some sort of a misfire or if the thing breaking apart like the ICBM that North Korea attempted to launch earlier, it just -- again just a matter of weeks ago, and it actually disappeared from radar over the sea of Japan, which is also known as the East Sea on the Korean peninsula. If that were to happen overland, Kim, obviously, there'd be the concern there could be damage or injuries. But that did not happen luckily, in this latest North Korean missile test.",
