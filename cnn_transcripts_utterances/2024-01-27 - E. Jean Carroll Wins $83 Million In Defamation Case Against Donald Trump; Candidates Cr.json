They awarded her $65 million.Carroll's attorneys had argued to the jury in closing arguments on Friday that was the only way to send a message to Donald Trump. They said that he didn't respect the previous jury's verdict, finding these statements defamatory because he continued to make them within 24 hours at a CNN town hall and continuing through this very trial. And during his brief testimony on the stand on Thursday, the jury clearly hearing that, Trump's lawyers argued to the jury that he shouldn't be held responsible for mean tweets. And they said that Carroll had asked for some of the attention that she received. Clearly the jury rejecting that argument. Now, Trump had called this judgment ridiculous.

When someone who has a bully pulpit, like the president, impugns you like that, it takes a toll, it impairs you, you know, reputationally, economically. So they did that in terms of compensatory damages. Emotional damages, again, not exactly to quantify, but it causes harm, it causes great distress. And she, of course, E. Jean Carroll testified as to that. To the core of your question, the punitive damage element is designed to send someone a specific message to stop them, to deter them, and to deter others who might engage in similar conduct. So there's not specific guidance quantifying and tethering numbers exactly like a science. But I think the issue is whether or not the amount is appropriate and proportionate to the conduct and whether it will stop the individual from engaging in it again.

It has been around for more than 70 years. And the funding of it comes partially from the U.N. budget, but also largely from voluntary donations from U.N. members. And now, it's not only the State Department that's pausing funding. It is also Canada, Australia and Italy. And potentially, there could be more as well.

Israel has a few weeks to get a report back, showing the court how it's complying with some of the court's demands. And the court will take up to years to decide whether or not genocide actually happened, but the most important part of the court's ruling from the Israeli perspective is that, it acknowledged that this is a two-sided war.The court condemned the taking of hostages, for instance, and the atrocities that happened on October 7th. So -- but from the South Africa side, they said it was good that the Israelis were warned to stop incitement. Some senior Israeli officials were quoted throughout the proceedings where they've said things like Gaza should be flattened, that Palestinians should leave the territory. And so, you know, each side has claimed some amount of victory. Israel has now several weeks to prove that it is taking measures to protect civilians, which is the same thing the White House and Britain have asked for in recent weeks.",

We asked whether there is a shortage of that, as so many states have struggled to find those drugs, and they say that they are not having any issues finding those drugs. The only other path forward there in the state of Oklahoma to doing a nitrogen gas execution is if lethal injection is suddenly deemed unconstitutional. Amara, Victor.",

Now, here's a look at where we've got right now. You can see rain across Littlerock, starting to spread into Nashville, other areas of Huntsville and even some thunderstorms down there right along the Gulf Coast, spreading from New Orleans off to the east.You do have some flood watches and even some flood warnings in effect. These are some areas they've already started to see flooding and others that are going to expect it as we make our way through the day. Now, by Sunday, that system really kind of focused right over the Ohio Valley, spreading a lot of that moisture into the mid-Atlantic and eventually into northeast. And yes, even some snow on the western side of that, up around the Poconos, up into the White and Green Mountains. Even Boston, likely to end up picking up some snow out of this particular system. But by the time we get to Monday, other than a few lingering showers right there along the coast, the bulk of that moisture finally spreads out. Now, another concern for today is going to be the potential for severe weather. That's really going to be limited across the south, basically, Chattanooga all the way, down into the Gulf Coast. The main threats here are damaging winds, also a few tornadoes and possibly some large hail as we go through the afternoon hours. Another concern is the flooding that we've talked about. Because for some of these areas, they've seen a lot of rain in just the last few weeks, so that ground is saturated, and now any moisture we put on top of it is just going to exacerbate that flooding concern. You'll see it's mostly rain down to the south, but we do also have the potential for some of that snow off today, just not quite in New York. It's been very warm there. Fun fact, guys.
