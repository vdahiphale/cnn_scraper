(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): New internal communications from some of Fox News' most prominent figures show concerns and misgivings some had about then President Donald Trump's claims of election fraud and the company's handling of the 2020 election results. According to court documents, host Tucker Carlson texted a producer on January 4, 2021. We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. The conversation continues, referring to Trump, Carlson says, I hate him passionately. I can't handle much more of this. The private communications from Carlson are a sharp contrast to his public support for the former president, as seen on his program that night.",

Dominion saying in a statement, the emails, texts and deposition testimony speak for themselves. The communications reveal Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who was furious Fox News called the 2020 election for Biden, and wrote to an email to the former \"New York Post\" editor and chief, CNN declares and Fox coming in minutes. I hate our decision desk people and pollsters. Some of the same people, I think. More than a month after the 2020 election, Fox News' D.C. managing editor wrote in a private message to a colleague he feared that the network's coverage of Trump's election fraud claims were becoming an existential crisis for the company. Murdoch conceded in an email to Fox New CEO Suzanne Scott in January 2021 that some of Fox's top talent went too far in their coverage. During his deposition, Murdoch asked, do you believe that Dominion was engaged in a massive and coordinated effort to steal the 2020 presidential election? Murdoch replied, no.",

In a conversation November 18th, a couple weeks after the election, Tucker Carlson claimed he caught Powell, Sidney Powell, who had propagated some of these theories, lying, to which Ingraham, Laura Ingraham, responded calling Powell, quote, a complete nut.
