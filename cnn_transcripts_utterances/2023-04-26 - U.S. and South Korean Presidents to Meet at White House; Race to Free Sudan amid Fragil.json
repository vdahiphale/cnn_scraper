President Joe Biden is set to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart, Yoon Suk-yeol, on this second day of Mr. Yoon's state visit. It comes amid ongoing provocations from North Korea and a leak of Pentagon documents. Their discussions will be followed by a joint news conference and a formal dinner later tonight. I want to go to Jeremy Diamond, who joins us now at the White House. It's good to have you with us. From what we have seen, quite a spectacle today. I understand the Marine band has just wrapped up. The Korean choir is singing. There is a lot of pomp and ceremony. What does this signal about the relationship right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, no doubt about it. That pomp and circumstance that you are going to see unfold today is thedifference effectively between a regular visit by a foreign leader to the White House and all of the trappings that come along with a formal state visit. It is important to note, as you look at the symbolism and the meaning of this state visit by the South Korean president, is the fact that this is only the second state visit that the United States has hosted under President Biden. The first visit was with French president Emmanuel Macron. And now you see the South Korean alliance being put up on a pedestal. Obviously, that is important for a few reasons. First of all, it demonstrates the increasing importance that the U.S. places on the Indo- Pacific region. Secondly, of course, choosing South Korea among several other allies in the Indo-Pacific demonstrates the concern about the nuclear threat from North Korea and the important role that South Korea can play in the regional dynamics there, including with China as well. You know, this visit, on the heels of North Korea test firing a record number of nuclear missiles over the last year, North Korea rejecting U.S. efforts to outreach and try to conduct diplomacy with North Korea, to get them to give up their nuclear weapons. I think you are going to see an emphasis on the deterrence aspect. South Koreans have grown concerned by those increasingly nuclear tests. As you have seen in South Korea, there is a growing call for the country to develop its own nuclear arsenal or to host U.S. nuclear weapons there. So it's interesting and a spotlight on the region that President Biden has made very clear is critical to the U.S.' future and present as well.",

The goal is to facilitate a political settlement of the Russian war. Words of this come after Xi Jinping spoke with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the first time since the war began. Mr. Zelenskyy described their call as \"long and meaningful.\" Russia says negotiations are unlikely. I want to get more on the significance of this from our international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. It's good to see you. Zelenskyy's first call with China was significant, given China's relationship with Russia. China was saying that we will always stand on the side of peace.

Remembering that they have long and historic and very deep trade relations. But on the issue of the war in Ukraine, they have been on very different positions and sides. President Xi has a long and deep relationship with President Putin. He was in Moscow about a month or so ago, putting forward his peace proposal for the war in Ukraine. But nowhere did it mention that Russia had illegally invaded Ukraine. Ukraine's position on peace is that Russia must completely pull all of its troops out of Ukraine, back to 1991 borders. So the two positions are different. But President Xi tried to position himself as a potential peacemaker. The message from Kyiv was, if that is the case, you need to speak to Ukraine. It would be great if you visited here. So this seems to be a diplomatic breakthrough, that China is sending an envoy to Kyiv and to other countries in the region. Ukraine will send its envoy to Beijing as well. They will send an ambassador there. So it is an important diplomatic step. But \"long and meaningful,\" we don't know how long and we don't really know how meaningful. But this, in the language of diplomacy, it indicates they have started something here and both sides see a possibility. Xi says, look, as far as the war Ukraine is going to go, we are not going to stand on the other side of the fire, meaning ignore the situation. We're not going to throw fuel on the fire. Neither are we going to try to profit by it. So president Xi is still pushing their position as a potential negotiator here. But have the two sides narrowed positions on it? It seems hugely unlikely.",

But there are questions about dual use equipment. There are questions about ammunition that has been supplied rather than complex pieces of military equipment, such as highly complex roads (ph) and these sorts of things.

Senior medicalcorrespondent Elizabeth Cohen joins me now to talk more about that. It's good to have you with us. The World Health Organization says polio, measles, cholera are stored in this lab. How concerning is this development? ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SR. MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Lynda, if the faction that it appears has taken control of this lab makes a mistake and these germs get out or intentionally does it, it's obviously not good. I want to talk about the three diseases that you just mentioned, measles, polio and cholera. These are not new diseases. There is actually quite a bit of measles and cholera already in the world. Whatever might come out of this lab is not really that much of an addition. There is also polio out there in the world. I'm not saying it's good if something happens with this lab but these are not some kind of new diseases or something unusual that we don't -- that people are not vaccinated for. So the part of the world that is vaccinated is heavily vaccinated against polio and measles. Really the concern is more for the immediate area, the concern for the people who live in this immediate area, where vaccination rates might not be so high. That is the immediate concern. Let's take a look at what a medical source in Sudan told CNN. \"The danger lies in the outbreak of any armed confrontation in the laboratory because that will turn the laboratory into a germ bomb and urgent and rapid international invention is required to restore electricity and secure the laboratory from any armed confrontation because we are facing a real biological danger.\" So to be clear, it is not exactly clear how much of a danger there is.

That is the first time since the early 1980s that that has happened. What we are seeing is a very visible guarantee that the United States will be there for South Korea, should it need that kind of assistance. Of course, what Washington will be hoping for is that this might quieten some of the voices here in South Korea which are calling for South Korea to have its own nuclear program, nuclear weapons program. It was a fringe argument about 10 years ago; it has significantly gained in power. All the polls have a majority of South Koreans polled saying that they believe that, as the North Koreans have a nuclear weapons program, then so the South Koreans should as well. So this is Washington's way of trying to placate and quieten some of those voices as the U.S. and many countries around the world would not want to see South Korea go nuclear -- Lynda.",

His team said that this is related primarily to two things. One, comments made not by him but by his chief of staff about President Putin and secondly about the death of a Russian journalist in a St. Petersburg cafe earlier this month. The investigators in that case are pointing the finger at Ukrainian agents working in collaboration with Navalny's office mission group, the Anti- Corruption Foundation. They deny any involvement in this. The reason he was in court today was for a hearing on that extremism case. The judge was asked to rule on the prosecutor's motion to limit the amount of time that Navalny had to review the files in the case, the materials in the case. The judge ruled in favor of that. So Navalny will have only 10 days to review the material. We're talking about 196 volumes. His daughter says each volume has 250 pages, double spaced. By my math, Navalny would need to read more than five pages per minute for 16 hours a day for the next 10 days to get through all of that. This may all be a moot point, frankly, because Navalny's team also said that, inside the penal colony that he is being housed in, he doesn't have access to any of these documents or any of these court filings.

They are expected to arrive at a quite significant agreement when they sit down in the Oval Office later today.
