We have a civilian led military. The generals at the top of the military do need to have the capacity to execute our defense policy and his vision for how we defend this nation. And if they can't do that, then that's a problem. And they should not be trying to substitute their own judgment.

It was one of the first places to have integrated housing, to enforce integrated schools on the base, to actually enforce the fair housing law when people were trying to rent to soldiers and saying, if someone were found violating that law, that the military could not allow any soldiers. So, the idea that there's something wrong with being woke, when in fact what that means is a military that's trying to reflect a multiracial country that has a lot of different types of people who have to come together and learn how to work together in the national defense, actually racial polarization is bad for military strength. And it's been used against this country many times by our adversaries, including in recent elections. So, I think this idea that we can purge woke from the military is actually ahistoric. And I also think it's dangerous because. While he's saying he's going to purge woke, what he really wants is to purge any generals who might actually stop him from using the military against the American people and in ways that the military is not supposed to be used. BERNSTEIN: Such as he threatened with General Milley, that he didn't like what General Milley said. And he decided he would like to see General Milley court-martialed because of what he advocates and what he said about President Trump. First of all, the military, we've seen time and again, is the most admired institution in the United States. And not only is it admired, it's the things that we really criticize, for instance, the Iraq War, it's not the product of the military, it's the product of the president of the United States, Vietnam, disaster, that was not the product of G.I.s or generals. It was the product of the president of the United States. So, the whole idea of the military being corrupted by these generals, and, in fact, the kind of education, military and historic and diplomacy and warfare that these generals get is probably the most unique education system in our culture.",
