      "sentences": "Quote, \"DOJ had full access to the president's home, including personally handwritten notes, files, papers, binders, memorability, to-do lists, schedules and reminders going back decades. DOJ took possession of materials it deemed within the scope of its inquiry, including six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials, some of which were from the president's service in the Senate and some of which were from his tenure as vice president. DOJ also took for further review personally handwritten notes from the vice presidential years.\"Now both the personal attorney and the special counsel at the White House said that they are trying to comply with all facets of this investigation from the Justice Department, but this comes just one week after the White House had revealed that additional documents had been found at the Wilmington home just the previous week. There have now been three different times that are known so far where that Wilmington home has been searched for documents since they first learned of the classified documents that were found at the Penn Biden Center. Now just on Thursday, President Biden responded to questions about this investigation when he was traveling out in California. He ultimately believes there is no \"there\" there. That that is what this investigation will show. He also said that he's been following the advice of his attorneys. And he was specifically asked if he had any regrets about the way that they've revealed and disclosed some of these classified document discoveries. And President Biden simply said no. Now of course it's interesting to note that the White House and personal attorneys are releasing this statement late on a Saturday night. Of course, there have been a trickling out of revelations regarding these classified documents, something that at times the White House has been criticized for for not being fully transparent in the moment. But this evening, Bob Bauer, the personal attorney for President Biden, is saying that more classified documents were found at the Wilmington residence, done and searched by the Justice Department. I will also note President Biden is currently here at his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, spending the weekend with his wife. So we will see what more details we might get about these documents in the coming days. f",

      "sentences": "And this is the fifth time, I'm told, that classified batches of documents have been found at the president's properties connected to Biden. So that is notable, too. And when you look through the statement, Paula Reid, I want to bring you in, it's notable that they say the -- I shouldn't say agents, we don't know if they were agents or DOJ officials, but it's notable that it talks about the fact that they took information, what they believe to be important for their investigation, including the sixth classified document. And then mentions these handwritten notes that they took when Biden was vice president. How might that be relevant to this investigation, Paula?PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (via phone): They're probably going to look into what those notes were about, do they reveal any classified information from a briefing or something like that. I think you really hit on it, though, Pamela, that the Justice Department, here, they are conducting the investigation. This is a shift because previously it had been the president's attorneys who are conducting these searches of his former office and his two homes in Delaware, and they had come under some scrutiny for using a personal attorney who did not have clearance to view classified information to go through and locate it, and then they'd have to bring in someone that had clearance. So the fact that the Justice Department is doing this now, that's notable, because we know the U.S. attorney who did the initial review of this matter and eventually recommended a special counsel, he did not even ask for any searches and he did not conduct them himself. So now that this is under the purview of Special Counsel Robert Hur, it's interesting that the Justice Department is leading the way on this thorough search. Now with this sixth additional what are described as materials, we don't know if these are pages or documents, in addition to the ones we've already learned about, it looks like we're getting closer to approximately 30 different documents with classified markings found in two different locations connected to the president, both a former office and his Wilmington home. And as Arlette noted, this is late on a Saturday that they're revealing this. So they are at least coming forward with this information. It's not leaking out to the press. Another shift in their press strategy. And clearly they're emphasizing as they have throughout this their cooperation because they believe cooperation is what sets this case apart from the investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information by former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.",

That's what I was wondering earlier, because typically the FBI, the investigative branch under DOJ would conduct searches like this, just as they did at Mar-a-Lago with Donald Trump. So that is notable that the FBI searched this property of Joe Biden for around 13 hours, finding at least six classified documents and they also took other information, according to this statement from the attorney, the personal attorney of President Biden.Arlette Saenz, this has not been good for the White House politically. And this drip, drip, drip, this is yet another drip, as I pointed out earlier. The fifth time a batch of classified documents has been found at a property connected to Biden. What are your White House sources saying about this?",

There has been a lot of criticism towards the White House about their inability to share the information about this promptly, but the arguments that they've been making is that they are limited in exactly what they can share.Now one thing that's interesting in this statement from Bob Bauer, he does note that this -- as they worked with the Justice Department to conduct this investigation, that there was an agreement not to disclose the search of the Wilmington residence ahead of time, so that kind of speaks to the ways that they are trying to hew to what the Justice Department is trying to pursue and in their argument trying to protect the integrity of the investigation. But certainly, this is something that the White House is continuing to face criticism from. Some allies perplexed by some of the strategy that they've had around this. Of course the president himself said that he doesn't have regrets about the way that they've decided to disclose this. And he says that he's been following the advice of his attorney. But certainly there are going to be more and more questions about this. And the drip, drip, drip nature of it is surely very complicated and frustrating for the White House.",

Obviously it was reported by CBS, broke the news of the initial batch. The White House acknowledged that, didn't acknowledge that a second batch had actually been found as well, then had to acknowledge that. And then there have been several more disclosures.Paula Reid, if you're still there on the phone, as I pointed out earlier, and I just interviewed a Republican who was trying to say that Biden is being treated differently from Trump, and of course there are key distinctions between the two investigations including the fact that there was an obstruction investigation with Trump and they had evidence that classified documents had been moved. But if you would, help our viewers better understand the parallels and the differences between what just happened here at the president's private residence and what we saw happen at Mar-a-Lago.",

It appears to, at this point, be inadvertent. But there's going to be an investigation. So far there's been a review that was pretty superficial. Now Special Counsel Robert Hur, he will conduct a full investigation. He will likely impanel a grand jury. He'll be able to conduct interviews, reinterview people who have already been spoken with.Once you do that, the turning over rocks, you'll never know what you uncover, but right now I am told by someone who's pretty familiar with what was uncovered in the review that the legal risk here on a scale from one to 10 is about a two to a three. The greatest risk being that someone says something that they know not to be true to investigators. So the fact that they found more materials doesn't increase the legal exposure. But it certainly is going to raise a lot of questions in the court of public opinion. The biggest one being how much more? Is this it?

They told DOJ they could come search the property. That is different than a search warrant and showing up and surprising the person at the house.",

So obviously they're able to do that here. But the way we got here, very, very, very different.In this case, for whatever public relations or political missteps they have had, you have to give the president's team credit for at least being incredibly proactive and I would say proactively cooperative from the very beginning. And even last week when we heard that there were documents found in the Wilmington residence, you know, at that point I was suggesting in several appearances, and I think agreed, like that was the time to bring DOJ in, give them the opportunity with the bureau to say, hey, search wherever you want, look at everything you want to look at, and you tell us what you think maybe needs to go. You know, put it on them. Get the president and his team out of the position of having to sign some sort of attestation that there are no more documents where everything has been done. Let the government do that search. And clearly that's what they were inclined to do and that's what they accomplished yesterday.",

And that would certainly account for President Biden's time as vice president. So it's certainly possible that other non- classified material that the agents came across during the scope of the search was taken to be evaluated to see if it qualifies as some of those executive records that have to be in the custody of the Archives rather than in the custody of the person who generated them.You know, Pam, when I was acting director of the FBI for three months, everything I read during the day, every note that I took, every, you know, piece of intelligence that came across my desk, all of that went into a special box, was reviewed by the staff every day to determine which pieces of paper, which documents, what have you, had to go to the National Archives ultimately at the end of the time that I sat in that chair because the same rules apply for positions like Cabinet secretaries and of course the director of the FBI.",

Do we know though, and again, this is just coming out, so that's okay, if you don't know the answer, but if some of the classified markings, some of the documents with those markings came from his time in the Senate, or some of the additional material they took came from his time in the Senate?",

We don't have timeframes for that.But certainly, President Biden has been in public office for quite some time, certainly more than three decades in the Senate, then his eight years in the White House with President Obama and then now as President for the past two years.

Here, the FBI is into the current President's home conducting a search in the way that FBI agents do, I'm sure, very thorough, documenting everything, taking photographs of the things they find and where they find those items, and doing it all under the watchful eyes of the President's personal attorneys, and the White House Counsel representatives, and that's entirely appropriate. This is a consent search. They are not there on a search warrant. And so the terms of that search can be whatever the parties agreed to.

No one can say definitively that there will not be other searches of other locations and we are seeing here, we're seeing new searches of previously searched locations. But the big difference here, and I think this really is a shift and indicative of how this will change under Special Counsel Robert Hur is that the Justice Department here is doing the search. Now, yes, the Biden team granted permission. This was not done with a search warrant, but I'm curious who initiated this. We know Rob Hur's office is not fully up and running yet. Previously, the US attorney who conducted the initial review, he did not ask for any searches. The Biden team volunteered to do them. So, it's interesting to see this shift. We have a much more thorough, it looks like search, that was done over the course of almost an entire day conducted by the FBI, though the Biden team was present. They came under a lot of scrutiny for how they personally conducted these initial searches, particularly the way that they used a personal attorney who didn't have proper clearance to evaluate the classified material to go and locate it, then stop, then wait for someone with clearance to come and then that person passed it up to the Justice Department.
