This morning, President Biden taking action even before the storm makes landfall. I'm Boris Sanchez with Rahel Solomon in for John, Kate and Sara. And this is CNN News Central.We are closely following a critical morning for Donald Trump's criminal cases. Right now, two key hearings underway in Atlanta and Washington D.C. Both expected to end with rulings from judges that could potentially shape how and when the former President faces trial. In D.C., the judge just rejecting the trial dates that the DOJ and Trump's lawyers were pitching. Federal prosecutors wanted four months from now. Trump wanted more than two years from now. The judge saying neither suggestion was acceptable. Plus, we now have an arraignment date in Fulton County, Georgia. The judge deciding Trump and his 18 accused co-defendants must be arraigned on September 6th and with cameras allowed in the courtroom through at least September 8th, for the first time in his four cases, we could hear and see Donald Trump live pleading not guilty. We begin in Georgia, where Mark Meadows is currently testifying. He's been on the stand for roughly 30 minutes. CNN's Sara Murray has the latest details. So, Sara, what is the former chief of staff saying?",

But now he's in the midst of this hearing where he's trying to move his part of the Georgia case, the charges against him, to federal court and potentially trying to get those dismissed.So he's talking a little bit about what it was like to serve as chief of staff in the Trump White House, of course, a chaotic position to be in. He described them as those were challenging times, bluntly. He went on to say, I don't know if anyone was fully prepared for that type of job. He also just finished telling the court about a daily morning call that he had in the days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. On that call was Mike Pompeo as well as General Mark Milley. And he said they were discussing the possibility that some of our adversaries could see the U.S. as weak in the wake of the events that happened on January 6th. So, again, this is all still playing out at this courtroom, this federal courtroom in Georgia. And we're looking not just for any implications of what this means for Mark Meadows, his case, his efforts to try to move this to federal court, but what this could mean for the broader case that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is trying to make against Donald Trump, his co-defendants, and the possibility that they could all end up in federal court. And you pointed out that arraignment, Boris. We're still waiting to see how that's going to pan out for Mark Meadows, for Donald Trump and others. This is a court that tends to allow people to do their arraignments over Zoom, or perhaps even waive them if the judge allows that. So we're still waiting to see if Donald Trump and his allies are actually going to end up in a courtroom on September 6th or not.",

And so far, we've learned when this trial will not be starting. The judge in this case making it very clear to Trump's lawyers that they will not get two years before this trial begins. That was the proposal on the table from Trump's team. They wanted an April 2026 start date. But the judge making very, very appointed comments today in the courtroom saying, you're not going to get two more years in this case and effectively telling the defense lawyers that they should have been ready for this indictment when it came, and there's really no excuse that they would need that much time.Now, on the other side, the judge has also rejected the Department of Justice's proposed date, which was January 2nd of next year. So we're still waiting to see when the judge will ultimately set that trial start date, but making clear to both sides in what is a contentious hearing that neither a proposal is going to fly.

I do want to read you something from John Laro just moments ago, speaking in court to Judge Tanya Chutkan. He said with a raised voice quote, for a federal prosecutor to suggest that we could go to trial in four months is not only absurd, but it is a violation of their oath to do justice. Judge Chutkan in response, said, let's take the temperature down a little bit here. It sounds like there are really tense moments in court, Michael.MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes, I'm glad to be with both of you this morning. I think the judge is right. They do need to tamp down the temperature a little bit, especially when it comes to arguing their motions. You can be a zealous advocate without necessarily having to take shots about the -- your counsel or opponent's credibility or integrity, as the case may be and it sounds like here. Look, there was no possible way this case was going to be scheduled for January the 2nd. I mean, that just was a stunt, and everybody saw it as a stunt, and so that just was not going to happen. Likewise, the case was not going to be scheduled for 2026. And so the judge now will have to weigh both the schedule that's going on next year with these various cases as well, there'll be some consideration about the election. And he is, in fact, presumed innocence that the former president is. So he has a right to raise those things and what's going on, and the claim that they would be trying to knock him off the campaign trail. At the same time, she's got to weigh the interest to move the case forward and have some efficiency. So she'll find something. But also remember that trial dates move. So even if we see a date set for some time later next year, there's the likelihood that date will get moved by appeals. An appellate court could issue a stay. There's a number of things that could happen. This is simply to keep the train on the tracks as we move forward to ultimately some resolution.",

The fact is, though, defense handed over much of those documents. A lot of those documents were produced by Donald Trump's team. So does it stand a reason that they need ample time to review information that they themselves have handed over?",

The Constitution guarantees an accused, the defendant in this case, and the former president, guarantees him the right to have an effective defense, an effective representation under the 6th Amendment. And what that means, basically, is he has a right to have lawyers who are prepared and who have the time to prepare. And so the fact that there is 12 million pages of documents, roughly, is something that the court is going to take into consideration.And remember that the government has been investigating this case for the better part of almost three years now as we've moved forward. Now, I realize Jack Smith hadn't been into that long as special counsel. But the government has had the ability to investigate this case. We've been through the January 6th commission. We've been through various grand juries. We've had now, obviously a parallel case in Georgia that mimics a lot of the federal trial. So the idea that somehow his lawyers would need to speed read through 12 million documents, the court's not going to put up with that either. So she'll want to make sure that his lawyers have sufficient time so that does not become an issue on appeal should he be convicted. So she's going to make sure that right is protected just like his other constitutional rights.",

But all he has to say state is that he has a plausible or colorable claim that he was doing his job as a federal employee. And the President is the President 24 hours a day and Chief of Staff is the Chief of staff of the President 24 hours a day. And that means he's at the Beckham call of the President.And so these things like setting up meetings, making telephone calls, those are clearly within his duties. They will argue, I'm sure the state will, that this is, you know, criminal conduct. Well, that's a matter to be proven at trial. That's -- we're not at trial at this point. We're simply at a motion where the defendant needs to state, hey, look, I was doing my job. You may claim some of those were illegal, but we're not at that place yet. I don't have to prove that at this point in the case. Remember that 154 of the 157 overt acts that the State alleges in this indictment as part of the conspiracy all occurred while Trump was the sitting President of the United States. And so that's got to have some weight, as the court considers. Were these acts done during the time that Meadows was serving and was actually President, or, you know, are these things that I'm going to let pass by? But I think the judge will give it due weight. He's a good judge, Jones is, and so he'll certainly weigh those arguments seriously I think.",

We have tropical Storm warnings inclusive of Fort Myers and Naples. And then this is also interesting to note, tropical -- these are rather tropical storm watches on the east side of the state.

This will impact southern Georgia as well as the Carolinas as well. Now, the latest information still has this at tropical storm strength, so 65 miles per hour winds. It is battling a lot of shear in the upper levels of the atmosphere. But trust me, it's got a lot of warm water. The environment will become more favorable for this storm to strengthen and that is what the official forecast track calls. This is the latest, we do have a category three hurricane that is a major hurricane impacting the Florida Big Bend region by Wednesday morning.

But most importantly, that was heartbreaking to hear the state senator's comments there. We all have lived through this all too often. That's why the President convened the United Against Hate Summit with civil leaders, with labor leaders and so many other last year, and the progress we've been making with the Justice Department to target these hate crimes. We're gathering today, as you may know, with members of the King family, Reverend Sharpton, Jonathan Greenblatt, with the Anti- Defamation League and several others, to continue to talk about this, this ongoing work that we must undo.

The President has reached out, as you mentioned, talked to the mayor, talked to the sheriff and will continue to lean in, as with this Department of Justice investigation yields more and more details, and see how much support we can provide, not only to Jacksonville, but the national support the President has been providing on making sure that we continue to tell the story of race in America and how, what he has framed white supremacy, and some of this violence as the greatest national security threat to this country.",
