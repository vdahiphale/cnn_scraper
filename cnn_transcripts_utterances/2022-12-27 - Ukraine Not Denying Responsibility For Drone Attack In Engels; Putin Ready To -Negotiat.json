There are reports that Chinese medical specialists working for the government argued that the mortality rate is very low, infection rate is very, very high. That's true. But they are using the western data to make their case for easing up controls in China.

They say they want to apply for refugee status, find work, and provide for their four children. And every single one of these migrants has a similar story. I've been speaking to them over the last couple of days, and most of them tell me that they are waiting to be able to afford a bus ticket to get to their final destination. In the meantime, many of them are out here and preparing, as the sun sets, to sleep out on the streets, because the shelters are at capacity. Camila Bernal, CNN -- El Paso, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Officials say all those on board survived the treacherous voyage from Bangladesh, where about a million Rohingya are living in squalid conditions, after fleeing ethnic violence in Myanmar. The U.N. says another boat carrying 180 refugees on a similar route is still missing at sea with all on board presumed dead.In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is describing a difficult and painful situation on the front lines as Ukrainian forces battle Russian troops in the Donbas. Mr. Zelenskyy specifically mentioned the city of Bakhmut which has been the scene of fierce fighting. He's also urging all Ukrainians to stay vigilant and be prepared for any possible Russian attacks or provocations. CNN's Matthew Chance has been covering Russia's war from Ukraine since it began and he's got the footage to show it. He looks back on his experiences in Europe's biggest conflict since World War II.

We did not know what was really going on. There were all sorts of reports about Russian paratroopers moving in to positions around the city. There was one particularly worrying report that airborne Russian special forces had moved into a airbase, north of the Ukrainian capital in an area called Gostomel. Gostomel as you see at Antonov Airbase. These troops, you could see over here, they are Russian airborne forces. I started chatting to that commander and in the conversation, I said to him so look, give me an idea of what we're seeing here, where are the Russians, I said. And he said to me, you know, what do you mean? He looked really confused. What do you mean where are the Russians? And I said, well, I'm going to go live in a minute on CNN. And I want to tell people where the Russian forces have gone to. And he looked at me and he said we are the Russians, we are the Russians. And at that point we suddenly realized that we came face to face across the front lines inadvertently. This just shows us now for the first-time, just how close Russian forces have got towards the center of the Ukrainian capital. I think what was most amazing, the most surprising, I suppose about those first few days was the level of resistance that we saw that we witnessed by ordinary Ukrainians. As well as the Ukrainian military of course. We saw ordinary Ukrainian people pick up weapons, defend their streets, their buildings, their yards.",

You know, bottles full of gasoline with rags at the top that they were going to throw at Russian forces as they can. And I asked one of the guys there, I said did you make these?They're like no, we did not make them. It is the old women in the apartment blocks that are making them and then delivering them to us. And it just really, you know, rammed home what a multi-layered sort of defense the Russians were confronting. If they thought they were going to walk into the Ukrainian capital and take it over without a fight, I mean what a massive miscalculation that was. You know, within a couple of days of the invasion we traveled to just a short distance from the capital, a bridge where there had been a battle just an hour or two before we got there. Right within the past few hours, there has been a ferocious battle here on the outskirts of Kyiv and this is one of those Russian Soviet era vehicles which is completely burned out. You can see, this is a bridge actually. There is an access point to the northwest of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. And the Russian column that has come down here has been absolutely hammered. So that was a very, very disturbing moment in the conflict. But it was also very profound in the sense that it just showed that Russia's calculation of sending light armored columns into Ukraine to take the capital to decapitate the Ukrainian government was not working. And it was not just not working but it was devastating to the Russian armed forces. I think one of the most incredible aspects of this conflict so far has been the dramatic transformation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president from an actor and comedian turned politician to president turned, you know, iconic war leader. I managed to speak to him -- I was one of the first journalists to speak to him in his bunker in central Kyiv. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It was very important for people in the United States to understand that despite the fact that war is taking place in Ukraine, it is essentially for values in life, to democracy, to freedom. Therefore, this war is for all the world. And that message should be sent far and wide from Ukraine, to people in the United States. So they understand what it is like for us here. What we are fighting for and why support for Ukraine matters.",
