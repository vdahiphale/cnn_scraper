It is 08:00 a.m. there in Chicago, where she is set to accept her party's nomination tonight. 09:00 a.m. here in New York City. Thanks for joining me. I'm Erica Hill in for Becky Anderson, this is \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next two hours, as divers work to recover the missing from a luxury yacht that sunk off the coast of Sicily, investigators are working to determine what went wrong. With hopes dwindling for a ceasefire and hostage release deal can a call between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu make the difference? Plus, India now denying a release from a dam within its borders caused this deadly flooding in neighboring Bangladesh. The stock market here in New York, opening just about 30 minutes from now, traders seeming fairly positive ahead of this highly anticipated speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which will come this week, and which could perhaps offer some clues about his plans for interest rates. So, we're keeping an eye on that. We'll also bring you, of course, the opening bell, along with a look at why a labor dispute in Canada could soon be felt far beyond its borders. Well, the headliner is now likely in final prep mode. Vice President Kamala Harris set to take the stage in Chicago tonight, where she will formally accept the Democratic Nomination for President and also make her case to the American people in what is arguably the biggest political speech of her life. Harris is expected to highlight her accomplishments and also her personal story, an effort to draw a stark contrast between a potential Harris Administration and a second Trump term. And it will also build on what we saw at the convention Wednesday night as her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urged voters to move on to something new.

We've had a convention of multiple nights in which the elders of the Democratic Party, the up-and-coming people in the Democratic Party have spoken about the character and the resourcefulness and the patriotism of Kamala Harris. Now, in many ways, she has to live up to that those expectations and show that she really is the person that everyone has been saying she is. She has to show she's able to reach another level of the political stratosphere. She's not been widely seen as a great vice president. There have been questions about her political acumen, although she has deftly worked her way into this snap election after the withdrawal of President Joe Biden. So, she has to show that she's ready for that level of national scrutiny. And what she's trying to do is present herself as the candidate of change, despite the fact that she's part of an unpopular administration. She's offering a post Trump era to American voters, and she has to flesh out exactly what that means. And if she can do that, she's got a good chance to be successful, I think.",

In mitigation of the criticism, she's only been a candidate for a month, that's not a lot of time to roll out policy proposals. But the expectations are really going to ramp up after this in the run up to the first debate she has with Trump next week and next month. And also, it's incumbent upon someone that's running for president not just to say they're going to do a load of great things, but to prove that they have the ability to do so. A lot of that, of course, depends on whether she can get majorities in Congress. One thing I think is very interesting is that the United States is embroiled in multiple challenges to its power abroad, from China, Russia, Iran. We've heard absolutely nothing this week about that any theory of the case for a very restive period going forward in international relations, or whether Vice President Kamala Harris would break from the policies of the Biden Administration, for instance, on continued funding for Ukraine's fight against Russia.

The presidentwill often jump on the phone with world leaders at these key moments, and this is certainly one of them, with Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, saying in Israel earlier this week that this may be the last opportunity to get a deal. So, as you mentioned there, the president having a phone call with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just yesterday. The vice president also joining that call. She does often join these calls that, in and of itself, was not new, but they were discussing the ceasefire deal, according to the White House. And also trying to de-escalate tensions in the region, which has been a top concern among U.S. officials. Now again, the top U.S. diplomat, Antony Blinken, was in the region this week where he was having these meetings about the ceasefire deal, and also talked about that bridging proposal we've been hearing a lot about, to try to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement here. Now U.S. officials have not detailed what that includes exactly, but we do know that one of the major sticking points here is a -- is the future of a corridor in southern Gaza. Of course, Hamas wants IDF to withdraw completely. Israeli officials have been more apprehensive about that, wanting to find some other type of solution there. So, there are still a lot of different sticking points, and we know another team is headed, including CIA Director Bill Burns, who has been critical in all of these talks to Cairo over the weekend. So certainly, these types of conversations are going to continue. I will also note that Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, more U.S. assets are going to be in the region too, and that is a show of deterrence. Again, two concerns here, making sure they can try to get this deal, but also trying to de-escalate the tensions already very high in the region.",

More detail to come, once these people are positively identified and law enforcement can flush out this case a little bit more. But Erica, like I said, they're prepared for a very long list of very creative types of disturbances. Law enforcement, though, last night very pleased with how protests went, because we had these duelling protests. There was a pro-Palestinian protest, a pro-Israel protest. And what we saw was that these protesters did not collide. Police guided them in such a way that they didn't run into one another, and further, they were peaceful. There were no arrests last night. Last night was very calm, very different from what law enforcement saw Tuesday night, when they saw at least 50 people arrested. As well as Monday, law enforcement said that around a dozen people across a few different protests, were arrested. But it seems to be at least Wednesday night was an example of what law enforcement wants to see. That is what they're looking for tonight, Erica, when there is another large- scale pro-Palestine protest planned tonight, it could be just as big as the one we saw Monday.
