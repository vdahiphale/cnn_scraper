      "sentences": "And you are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Wolf Blitzer here in Washington.We begin this hour with major breaking news. The director of the U.S. Secret Service has resigned. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been calling on Kimberly Cheatle to step down following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. During Monday's very intense House Oversight Committee hearing, she took full responsibility for the July 13 security failure, but struggled to answer many questions about how the shooter was able to come so close to killing a former president of the United States. Let's go to CNN's Arlette Saenz. She's joining us from Rehoboth Beach in Delaware right now. That's where President Biden has been recuperating from COVID. I understand, Arlette, we just have a statement from the Biden administration?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf, we have the first reaction from President Biden to this news that Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has tendered her resignation.The president in a statement thanked her for her service, noting that she stepped up to lead the Secret Service at the -- in the middle of his administration, and adding -- quote -- \"As a leader, it takes honor, courage and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service.\" President Biden went on to say that he believes the independent review into the assassination attempt against Donald Trump should continue and will continue and said that he intends to name a new director for the Secret Service soon. Now, President Biden had appointed Kimberly Cheatle to lead the Secret Service back in 2022. She's actually had a long relationship with the Biden family. She had been part of the vice president -- or then-vice president's security detail for both him and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, during the Obama administration. Just a few days after that assassination attempt against Donald Trump, White House press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had said that the president did have confidence in Cheatle, even as the Secret Service and the agency had really been under intense scrutiny in the immediate aftermath and the next week that followed that assassination attempt. Now, we are still waiting to hear whether President Biden has directly spoken with Cheatle since she tendered her resignation. He remains here at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and should be leaving in the coming hours to return to the White House. That could also be an opportunity for the president to potentially speak to reporters about this as he is departing here in Delaware. But, this morning, President Biden is acknowledging Cheatle's service, thanking her for that, and saying that he does intend to appoint a new Secret Service director soon.",

I mean, her plan, from what I'm told, Wolf, was to stay at least through the Democratic National Convention, try to make sure that everything and all the security preparations, which, of course, are a big undertaking and a big concern for the U.S. government, for the national security apparatus of this country, for her to stay through that. And in the end, what was decided, you saw very little -- you see very little in Washington that joins Republicans and Democrats to agreement, but yesterday's hearing was truly awful. And everyone at the Homeland Security Department, at the -- in the administration recognized that from yesterday's performance. One of the things that really stood out to me yesterday, Wolf, was the fact that there were simple questions that she would not answer, certainly at the beginning of the hearing, but then after getting the same questions about 16 or 17 times, she relented and half-answered some of them. And that's an indication of someone who doesn't have a lot of practice, doesn't have a lot of experience testifying before Congress. She spent 29 years at the Secret Service. And that's what you see here from the Homeland Security officials. They're thanking her for coming back from retirement to do this job, but, clearly, once this crisis emerged, there was very little from her that really inspired a lot of confidence about the way she was handling this, about the way she was responding to it. It's one of those -- it's one of those things that you see from yesterday's hearing was, it was clear that she wasn't going to last very, very much longer.",

That would have been -- that was pushed by Congresswoman Nancy Mace. The speaker of the House actually did not indicate he was necessarily supportive of going that route, believing, as he said, sheer incompetence is not enough to rise to the notion of a high crime or misdemeanor. But it showed you the pressure that she was under from Capitol Hill to step aside. The speaker himself, as he had a private meeting with the Secret Service director yesterday to raise his concerns directly to her, he reacted immediately after the resignation announcement.

      "sentences": "Well, like -- I think, like most observers, I think this was -- we saw this coming, and not just because of her really damaging day on the Hill yesterday. That certainly sealed the deal.But there's been a number of issues that have come up in the wake of this attack that have really raised questions about the former director and her team and the way they're handling communication and liaison work. They failed to show up at the first law enforcement press conference following the attempted assassination. In the days following, the director made negative statements about their law enforcement, their local law enforcement partners who worked on the site with them, which was really odd and probably uncalled for. She had some misstatements made by her communications folks in terms of whether or not resources had been denied the Trump detail. So it's been a rocky road since the -- since the attempted assassination. And then yesterday, her choice to come to the hearing without providing really any specific information about the event whatsoever was just really, really strange and obviously provoked the ire of members on both sides. And by the end of the hearing, I mean, you watched it. Evan watched it. We all saw where this was going. I think her move today is the right one. Again, she served her country nobly for almost 30 years in the Secret Service, came back after retirement to take the director's job. I think she's an honorable person who has done a lot for her country. But this situation became untenable. And it was clearly she made the choice to go.",

We also know that she said in her testimony yesterday that she had been on the call when Director Wray provided a lot of factual information to the members. She had heard that information. She was on that call. So it's inconceivable to me that she wouldn't have been able to at least share that level of factual detail. And, finally, I know from my own experience, we work very closely, the FBI works very closely with Secret Service. We coordinate on issues like this very closely. It felt to me like, if she had reached out to Director Wray and cleared ahead of time the sort of information she wanted to use and wanted to reveal to Congress, I'm sure they could have come up with some sort of an agreement that would have better satisfied the members yesterday.",

You can have an indoor rally, as he did over the past few days, but no more outdoor rallies.

The president posted on social media just a short while ago, saying that these remarks would take place at 8:00 p.m. in the Oval Office and that he would talk about what lies ahead \"and how I will finish the job for the American people.\" Now, when President Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the 2024 race in that letter posted on social media Sunday, he said that it was his intent to address the nation about his decision going forward. These likely would be the first major substantive remarks that we would hear from President Biden about his decision to bow out of the race. Just yesterday, he did call in to a meeting at the campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, where Vice President Kamala Harris was speaking. And the president in those remarks really urged his team to fully embrace her and pledged to remain fully engaged in this campaign to try to elect Kamala Harris as president in November. Now, President Biden will be returning to the White House in just a short while. He does have a few public events on his schedule for this week. He is expected, we're told, to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, as well as meet with the families of the American hostages who are believed to be held in Gaza. But, certainly, this speech from President Biden will be watched very closely after he announced that stunning and unprecedented decision not to seek reelection just a few months out from the 2024 race happening in November. Now, the president, we're still learning to hear when exactly he might be hitting the campaign trail for Harris, but he has pledged to do whatever he can to help her going forward. But this will be closely watched, as President Biden, of course, has had a decades-long career in Washington, D.C., making that stunning decision, a very personal decision, not to seek reelection, and instead turned his focus to helping elect Harris going forward.",

And I will read just a part of what she says. She says: \"As I have stated, the Secret Service will move forward with our investigatory and protective mission in a steadfast manner. We do not retreat from challenge. However, I do not want calls for resignation to be a distraction from the great work each and every one of you and do towards our final mission.\" Wolf, she goes on to say: \"It is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director.\" Obviously, she read the room. She read what happened yesterday and realized that she was not -- it was not tenable for her to remain. And keep in mind, there were more hearings that were planned. There were demands for her to show up again and answer more questions. And it is one of those difficult things that, as Andrew just noted, there were different ways for her to prepare for this hearing, for her to answer those questions that could have protected those investigations. Again, keep in mind, there is no one who is going to be tried for the crime of taking shots against the former president. That person is dead. So it does change your calculation as to what you can reveal to the public, and she just chose not to do that. And it's one of those things that really ended up costing her job.",
