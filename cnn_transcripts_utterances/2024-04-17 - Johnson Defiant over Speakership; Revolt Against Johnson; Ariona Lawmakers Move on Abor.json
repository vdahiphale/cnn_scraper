Exactly what the plan is to keep several funding bills moving through the House of Representatives. We still don't know what the plan is to fund Ukraine, Taiwan, Israel, and another fourth bill that includes miscellaneous items that Johnson says are a priority for the House. Right now, without that legislative text, House Republicans cannot begin the process of even reviewing the legislation or knowing how they would vote. This vote also would likely slip into the weekend if they reveal that text today because House Republicans have a 72 hour rule that requires them to look over that text for three days.So, that's the first item of business. Is that just not happening because it's taking time to write the legislation? Or is that not happening because there is this threat against Johnson relating to whether or not he keeps the speakers gavel? Right now we know of two Republicans who are saying that they would well be willing to oust Johnson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and then Thomas Massie announcing that during a Republican conference meeting yesterday behind closed doors. There's a level of frustration among Republicans who say it is just time to govern. It is just time to do what they have known they need to do for months now, which is get money to Ukraine that needs that funding urgently. But again, Mike Johnson still not clear on what the plan is moving forward. Just saying that he wanted to move something on Ukraine, but not precisely spelling out what that is going to look like in the days ahead. John.",

Now, first, they have to get over the hurdle that any bill typically has to be heard in committee before it goes to the full floor. So, they're going to vote first on whether to bypass that. If it does, then we have a pretty good sense of whether there is interest and urgency in getting this repealed.Right now there is a razor thin margin of a majority for the Republicans in both chambers here. So, in order for this to go through, there has to be a couple of Republicans who join Democrats and that is if the Democrats all vote along party lines here. And right now we're sensing that there is some interest. At least Representative Matt Gress (ph), who represents an area in Maricopa County, he is in a tight race and so he could potentially be one of those Republicans who votes for this. And there have been a couple of others who have, you know, expressed that perhaps this 1860s era law just goes too far. And to remind folks what it really is, it states that abortion is pretty much near illegal, except for in the case of saving the life of the mother. And it could be punishable, to the provider, for two to five years in prison. And so it is very severe. Some have called it draconian. And you've heard from former President Donald Trump even who said that this has its gone too far and he has stated that the state lawmakers could rectify this. And so what you're seeing before you today is an attempt to figure out exactly how to, quote, fix that. Right now the reason that the Arizona Supreme Court had to go with this particular law in their logic was that the 15 week ban, which Arizona passed in 2022, a few years ago, that was only valid because Roe versus Wade was in existence. Now that Roe is overturned, they said that leaves this 1860s law. And so we are going to see what happens today in the statehouse. Kate.",
