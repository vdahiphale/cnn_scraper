But this one seems to be quite outside the norm. You know, they've just announced the DOGE, the Department of Government - what is it - Efficiency. And there's a lot of questions around that. How is that going to work? It's outside government. Who's going to fund that? What kind of access are they going to have to the various agencies? He seems to have a lot of input into appointments and nominations. He made himself clear that he prefers Rick Scott to be majority leader in the Senate.This man has a lot of influence. And you're right, John, he also has a lot of government contracts. He also has a lot of businesses that rely on regulation, or a lack of regulation from the government. So, it will be very interesting to see how this plays out once President- elect Trump takes office, and what his role will be, not just at the DOGE, but sort of with the regulatory agencies.",

They're the largest caucus on The Hill, with the Freedom Caucus, trying, as you discussed earlier, with such a small margin, trying to bring the two of them together so they can sit down and get some good legislation passed. That right now is Trump's number one priority.There was a dinner on Monday with the speaker and with the different groups from The Hill, from the House. So, that's his priority.

And, you know, President Biden, for, you know, despite what many are saying that he shouldn't have run and all of the things, he is a traditionalist, and he loves this country. And the fact that he, you know, stretched out his - this invitation and this olive branch is not surprising to me in any way, shape, or form. This is who he is.

      "sentences": "Yes, John, this is a step in the wrong direction. Hopefully it's just a temporary one.We learned that consumer prices increased by 2.6 percent in October year over year. Now, that was exactly as expected, but it does mark an acceleration from the prior month where we had a three year low at 2.4 percent. It also breaks a streak of six straight months where inflation was easing. Now, it's important to note, though, when you dig into these numbers and you zoom in, you see that prices only increased by 0.2 percent between September and October. That was as expected. And it's not an alarming increase. So, that does suggest that part of this is being driven by the calendar. And what I mean by that is that inflation was falling pretty rapidly a year ago. And that was always going to be kind of hard to live up to. But when you look at the trend, we can see that we've had a lot of improvement from two and a half years ago when we had inflation at 9 percent, right, gas prices were at $5 a gallon. But look, getting back to normal, getting back to that 2 percent goal was never going to be easy. There was always going to be some bumps along the way. Looking further at some of the details here, there's some good news. We saw that prices declined between September and October for a few things, including gasoline, clothes, new cars were unchanged. Some of the bad news is, we did see a price increase for used cars. And that could be related to increase in demand related to the hurricane. Also, the cost of housing, shelter, that continues to be a big problem. I think one of the questions we get a lot is, why don't people feel better if the inflation rate has goes down? And I think that's because prices are still going up, right? They're just going up at a slower pace. And Moody's has found that the typical U.S. household has to spend $1,100 more per month for the same goods and services than they did in the beginning of 2021, all because prices have come up. John, I think the big question though for today is whether or not this inflation report is going to be good enough to let the Fed cut interest rates again next month. And we'll have to wait and see.",

You listed out some of the things that he has promoted during the campaign in terms of tariffs, tax cuts, mass deportation. When you add all of that together, then you also look at the side by side of, this is what a lot of Americans voted for. This is what helped him get elected, at least in part. What do you think people are missing if you think it could be so damaging if it all was put into practice?",

We don't rely on people to figure out what kind of nuclear reactor is going to be safe, and we don't rely on people to do complex economic analysis.And look, there are no certainties. Economic forecasts always have errors in them. But I think there would be a very strong and very widespread view that if implemented these policies are inflationary. Now, I think many people hope that these policies are being used as threats to get other countries to reduce their trade barriers. That they're being used to send signals with respect to immigration, and that it won't actually be these policies that will be implemented. We'll have to see. What I can say quite confidently as an economist is that, if these policies are implemented, it will mean a substantial increase in the price level. And substantial increases in the price level, we've seen how people react to those. You know, in many ways we're seeing something we've seen before. The large checks that were sent out in 2021 were what people wanted, they just didn't want the consequences that came with it in terms of increased inflation. The job of responsible leadership is not simply to stick your finger in the air, it's to think about what policies will be in the long run interest of the country. And I have to say that economists fight and disagree about many things, but the idea that this program, cumulatively, bashing the Fed, raising tariffs, sending workers home, bloating budget deficits, the idea that it is a highly inflationary program, that generates about as much consensus among people who follow economic things as any proposition I can remember in the 40 years I've been doing this.",

And internally, among the Trump team, sources say that they're OK with that. There is not a lot of internal backlash there.And we've also learned that she's really telegraphed this over the past few years, really taking a much less active role in this campaign compared to 2016 and 2020. She only was on hand for the announcement back in 2022, and she was on stage at Madison Square Garden a couple of weeks ago, and on stage with the family on election night. That's it.

The judge calling it unconstitutional on its face and also writing that the decision said the law - in the decision saying the law is \"coercive to students, and, for all practical purposes, they cannot opt out of viewing the Ten Commandments when they are displayed in every classroom, every day of the year, every year of their education.\" Well, immediately after that, Louisiana's attorney general said she plans to appeal.
