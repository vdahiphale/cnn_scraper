That's the word they use over and over, first of all. Second of all, the Palestinian Authority, led by Abu Mazen, cannot take over Gaza after this war. They think that the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is corrupt and they think Abu Mazen is ineffective.Three, Israel has to destroy Hamas. So, these Arab leaders are telling the U.S. government, make sure Israel destroys Hamas because they view Hamas as a Palestinian sibling, if you will, the Palestine version of the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Muslim Brotherhood is a threat to these governments in the Arab world. Four, as they're doing all of that, can the images please not be too bad. So, we're concerned about the images that you were just showing at the front end of this segment because it has domestic implications for them in their own populations. But, again, they lay out their views and then they put the caveat. But the front end of the view always include Israel must destroy Hamas. So, Israel's basically saying, we're hearing from the Arab League, we want - we want Hamas destroyed. We're hearing from the U.S. government we should - we're hearing form our own public we should destroy Hamas. So all these other items are important.

But what Israeli leaders keep saying is, yes that is true, but when the United States was fighting the Nazis, when the United States was fighting imperial Japan, when the United States was fighting ISIS, the U.S. was facing mortal threat and it had to think about removing the mortal threat.
