Just ahead, same mission, opposite approaches. With just three days to go, we look at how the Biden and Trump teams are preparing their candidates for the CNN presidential debate.One area of Russia is observing three days of mourning after deadly coordinated attacks on synagogues and churches. And tens of millions of Americans sweltering under extreme temperatures. We look at whether relief could be in sight from the heat dome. We are counting down to CNN's historic presidential debate. In just three days, a sitting U.S. president will debate his predecessor for the first time. This will also be the first major showdown between Joe Biden and Donald Trump since 2020. President Biden is at Camp David, hunkered down with his advisors preparing. He's looking at possible questions, holding mock debates and focusing on how best to frame Trump as unfit for office. In sharp contrast, his Republican rival shunned the traditional debate prep for the campaign trail over the weekend. And later today, he's expected to attend a fundraiser in New Orleans. Well, meanwhile, after spending months describing Biden as a mentally unfit leader, Trump and his surrogates are now suddenly talking him up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've seen him in the state of the union this year, that when he needs to, he can step up. But I think this is a real opportunity for CNN, most trusted name innews, to ask some tough questions, including, you know, because this is a rematch. And when we had this debate just before the election four years ago, Joe Biden looked into the camera and said, you know, that Hunter Biden's laptop was a smear campaign, Russian disinformation, called it garbage. And now we know that none of that is true. And I think this is an opportunity. I think America's waiting. I mean, CNN has got an opportunity to ask tough questions of both these candidates.",

      "sentences": "President Biden has now completed three days of debate prep out at Camp David, and we are getting some new insights into the Biden campaign's strategy heading into this week and heading into Thursday's debate in Atlanta. They've released a memo spelling out some of the things that they're doing to boost enthusiasm among their supporters ahead of this showdown.That includes 300 debate night watch parties and 1600 events in battleground states to try and ramp up energy around President Biden's appearance on that debate stage against President Trump. And I think this memo really lays clear the three most important items that President Biden will want to hammer home on that debate stage. One is the issue of abortion. And this is one that the Democrats really believe will be galvanizing for their supporters come November. President Biden really wants to lay at Donald Trump's feet the overturning of Roe versus Wade. [02:05:01] And in fact, on Monday, the Biden campaign plans 50 events around the anniversary of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that stripped the nationwide right to abortion, really trying to rally their supporters around this key issue. The second item on the debate stage that you're going to hear from President Biden is this idea of democracy and the threats that he believes Donald Trump poses to American democracy, threats of political violence. This, of course, has been an underpinning of the entire Biden campaign, and certainly he wants to hammer that point home on Thursday night. The third issue is the economy. The number one issue for many voters. President Biden wants to claim that Trump's record and agenda would only benefit the wealthy. Of course, this is a vulnerability for President Biden. Many Americans don't see the economy as improving, despite indicators that suggest the economy is doing well. It is something that he will have to talk about on the debate stage on Thursday night. Now, the other items that I think are likely to come up and that we heard from Biden's surrogates on Sunday is this idea of Trump as a convicted felon. We did hear from one key voice, Mitch Landrieu, who's a co-chair of the campaign. He talked about this idea of which Trump would show up on the debate stage. Would it be a restrained presidential Trump? Would it be a bombastic sort of ferocious Trump like we saw in 2020? Listen to what Mitch Landrieu said today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITCH LANDREAU, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, BIDEN CAMPAIGN:  It really doesn't matter how Donald Trump shows up. If he comes in unhinged like he is most of the time, or he sits there and is quiet, people are going to know that he's a twice impeached convicted felon who's been found to have defamed somebody, sexually abused somebody and gone bankrupt six times. They will always know that. And that is something that the American people have to think about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Biden, as you mentioned, is going to talk about abortion, democracy, an economic populist argument, a contrast with Trump.But, you know, I think the lesson of the history of our debates going back to 1960 is that there have been very few occasions where one side or the other, one candidate or the other has had a decisive win about a policy argument. I think the debates have been more consequential for the verdicts voters take from them about the personal capacity and character of the candidates.

And I think of those, I mean, they're all important, but the microphones being muted seem to me have the potential to really affect the outcome of this debate. And to some extent, that protects Biden from Trump, but it also protects Trump from Trump, you know.I think Biden will have a better chance of delivering a coherent argument to voters if he is not constantly interrupted by Trump the way he was in that first debate in 2020. But the fact that voters, you know, at least as I understand the way the technology is going to work, you know, whatever Trump does, voters are not going to hear and see him constantly trying to interrupt. Biden may also make it easier for Trump to have, you know, deliver a better impression, because certainly that, you know, that 2020 kind of performance did not really endear himself to anyone except his hardcore supporters. You know, there's one other interesting contrast, I think. In many ways, Trump wants to look back and Biden wants to look forward. Trump clearly wants to frame this campaign and certainly this debate as, were you better off in my four years or his four years? You know, was life more affordable? Did the border seem more secure? Biden, I think, you know, has a hard time winning that argument, whether deservedly or not. Most Americans will say they were better off when Trump was president. But that doesn't mean that most Americans are necessarily on board with the agenda that Trump has laid out for a second term, including ideas like mass deportation and tariffs that could make inflation worse. And so Biden, in many ways, wants to get voters to focus on what Trump would do if returned to power. I think Trump wants to basically kind of imprint the argument that things were better than when I was president and if you re-elect me, they're going to be better again.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  The ongoing turmoil set off by the October 7th attack by Hamas and Israel's bloody war launched in response is becoming yet another weight on President Joe Biden's reelection, with warning signs flashing over Jewish voters support for the president. For all the attention over how the Israel-Hamas war has endangered Biden standing with Arab Americans and progressives who taken up the cause of Palestinians in key states, Jewish-Americans who make up enough of the population to be determined in tight battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona have been scrambled, too. That's all the feelings brought up by the conflict, but also the pain over the surge at antisemitic incidents and rhetoric, particularly on the left in recent months. Josh Shapiro, the governor of key battleground state Pennsylvania, and an observant Jew himself, told me: From Pharaoh to Hitler, to Kim Jong-un, at what point in our history when a dictator has been leading a nation has a minority group done well? Donald Trump will eviscerate the rights of minority groups, including American Jews. Doug Emhoff, who's Vice President Kamala Harris is husband and also Jewish, has been taking a lead on this, too, calling Donald Trump a known antisemite now, Biden and Donald Trump have very different records on Israel and condemning antisemitism with Biden spending a lot of time on both over his years in politics.
