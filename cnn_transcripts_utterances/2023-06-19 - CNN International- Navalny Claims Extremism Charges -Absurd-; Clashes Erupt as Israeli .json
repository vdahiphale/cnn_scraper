Just ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with China's Xi Jinping in a high stakes trip and managing tensions between the world's superpowers. A huge firefighter erupts between Israeli Military forces and Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank City of Jenin, a live report coming up.And CNN goes in depth with more the chilling investigation into a mass grave found in Kenya linked to a religious cult. There signs of a little bit of a thought in U.S.-Chinese relations. These are pictures we weren't sure we'd actually see U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting in Beijing with China's President Xi Jinping. The meeting wasn't publicly announced until about an hour before it took place. The high stakes visit is an effort to reset strained relations between Washington and Beijing. A series of scribbles has left the two superpowers barely talking. And that's something Blinken wants to fix. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: In every meeting, I stress that direct engagement and sustained communication at senior levels is the best way to responsibly manage our differences and ensure that competition does not veer into conflict. And I heard the same from my Chinese counterparts. We both agree on the need to stabilize our relationship. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right, Max. The Biden Administration set low expectations for Antony Blinken's trip to Beijing. And they have met those low expectations, no more, no less. What we heard from both sides is that the meetings were candid and constructive. And even that some small agreements were reached.Although we don't know what those agreements are, we can say that this has at least slowed the decline of U.S.-China relations, which are at their worst points since 1979. However, big questions remain about whether or not these two powers can get along and in the long term, and also whether or not this means that China has abandoned any notion of meeting the U.S. And world demands that it stopped some of its most problematic behaviors, including its military expansion, its menacing of Taiwan, its crackdown on Hong Kong, its genocide against the Uyghurs, its repression in Tibet and lots of other stuff. So while it's very good to talk, it can also be said that a big problems remain not just in U.S.-China relations, but in the regions response to China's rise where it affects them. And none of those problems seem to have been addressed what we can expect to see going forward, Max, is that now we're going to have a line of U.S. economic officials traveling to Beijing, Secretary of the Treasury Yellen, Secretary of Commerce Raimondo and others, and this is what China really wants. They wanted to get past the Blinken visit without making any concessions so that they can engage on the economics, which is where they have the real desire to engage. What the U.S. wants is just for President Xi to travel to San Francisco in November to attend the APEC conference and meet with President Biden. And that's what President Biden said that he really wants and if everything goes, OK, I think we'll get to that, but it doesn't mean that the big problems between the U.S. and China are anywhere close to being solved.",

Russia claims a Ukrainian stronghold was destroyed by a remotely controlled tank packed with explosives.

      "sentences": "Well, certainly it represents something of a new tactic used by Russian forces. Now the details are that they were using a T-54 tank, that's a tank that went into production just after World War Two. Now, it wasn't really remotely controlled by the account put out by the Russian Defense Ministry on its telegram channel.It appears that one of the tank operators basically somehow managed to press the accelerator down and jump out of the tank, as he aimed it in the direction of the Ukrainian lines. Now, according to this Russian Defense Ministry account, it contained around -- 5 or more tons of explosives, it appears that the tank hits a mine that also was hit by an RPG. So it didn't actually reach the Ukrainian lines. It was perhaps according to the account of the foreign of the Defense Ministry about 300 meters away. So it was a huge explosion. No question about that. But it's not clear to what extent it actually punctured the Ukrainian lines. Now in the past, I believe back in February, the Russians use a similar tactic but not using the tank, but rather another sort of military vehicle. So it certainly is dramatic, Max, but it's questionable how effective this tactic actually is.",

Pakistan has declared Monday a national day of mourning.The Prime Minister is also setting up a high level committee to investigate the tragedy.

Choi's ex-husband and several of his family members face murder charges over her death. Still to come, the last time a U.S. Secretary of State set foot in China.

Joining me from Washington is our CNN Chief U.S. Security Correspondent, Jim Sciutto. Jim, you've just returned from Taiwan. So this surely was one of the big talking points there.JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: No question. Listen, Taiwan is clearly at the very center of this relationship between the U.S. and China. Taiwan itself takes the threat of military action they're very seriously that they are carrying out exercises virtually every day to prepare for that. I witnessed some of them on the Penghu islands in the middle of the Taiwan Strait preparing for a Chinese airborne assault as I was watching there. But at the same time, the Taiwanese Military, Taiwanese officials do not want to provoke China. They don't want this conflict to escalate. And there is some concern expressed privately among Taiwanese officials and others about Taiwan getting caught in between those superpowers, as you've seen in China, and to some degree here in Washington, some one-upmanship in terms of being tougher than the next person, on your rhetoric directed between Washington and Beijing. So there is concern in Taiwan about escalation that is out of their hands. Now, it is good that the U.S. and China are talking now to have a senior, the most senior U.S. diplomat visiting and meeting with the Chinese leader and others there. And they certainly discuss Taiwan and other issues. But they didn't come away with all that either side wanted you of Chinese officials, accusing U.S. of an erroneous understanding that their words of the situation in the region. And you had Secretary Blinken just a short time ago, criticizing China for what he called provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait. So it's good that they're talking no question. I think all sides believe that. But those talks show there's still great distance between the sides, certainly on the issue of Taiwan and several other issues between them.",

      "sentences": "No question. And you did have Secretary Blinken for instance make the point that the U.S. is not interested in decoupling from the Chinese economy. There's been some talk of that in recent years. But this phrase de risking has come to mind. And from the U.S. perspective, that means restricting trade, in dual use technologies.Technologies that the U.S. considers crucial to national security, but allowing all this other trade that the both the U.S. and Chinese economies depend on. And I should note the Taiwanese economy and the Japanese economy, South Korea and other partners that are trading with China, to the tune of many billions of dollars every day. So that issue is key and by the way, the economics issue factors into the Taiwan issue as well, because both sides are conscious that if that were to go to a war, particularly a war between the superpowers, there'd be enormous economic damage, certainly to Taiwan, but also to China, and also to the U.S. So they're talking and you heard the Chinese side say, there's a choice now between confrontation and a relationship here. So they're at a crossroads, you might say with the danger of heading in dangerous directions, on Taiwan and other issues in between them, including close encounters between U.S. and Chinese Military assets in the region. The fact that they're talking now presents an opportunity to keep those trend lines from worsening, but I will say one thing the U.S. did want to come away with from this meeting that they did not get and that is direct military to military communications. That scene is particularly, key because as you have these close calls a Chinese jet coming close to a U.S. surveillance aircraft a few weeks ago. A Chinese warship cutting in front of a U.S. destroyer, the Taiwan Strait just a couple of weeks ago, that those military to military communications essential to prevent escalation something small, becoming something bigger so listen certainly a long way to go here.",
