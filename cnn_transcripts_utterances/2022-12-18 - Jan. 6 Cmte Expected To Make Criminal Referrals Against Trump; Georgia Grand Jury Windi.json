Those charges include insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. Now, as you mentioned in the intro, it's up to prosecutors to decide if they want to take up these recommendations from the committee.

They've got a lot of time and treasure invested in the investigation and invested in what will be this report. So it really is no surprise, but you're worried about -- in your earlier question about whether or not this was symbolic, that's exactly what it is.I mean, you have to remember, this is a piece of paper that goes to the Justice Department and they can decide to consider it or not. There's also will be some questions, I think, as we get forward, talking about the incitement piece, and whether or not there are some First Amendment issues that come up, and I think you'll see those raised. But this is simply a sort of a one-sided investigation. None of the witnesses have been subjected to cross examination. The evidence has not been tested by cross examination. There's not been two sides to the story told in the committee, but it's supposed to be better inquiry, pointing the fingers at people involved in the January 6 incident. And so now, this will be the start if the department decides to accept that and to charge the individuals who are referred, then you'll see the start of this process. And that evidence will be tested, and those witnesses will be tested through cross examination. So it's been a long, 17 months. But this really is the end of one piece, but maybe the beginning of the true criminal investigation, or at least a criminal process by the Department of Justice and the special prosecutor.",

And I think that the special prosecutor will make a decision based on what he and his team believe the evidence shows of what they can actually prove for a conviction.Again, much of what we heard and what we've seen in some of the hearings have been witnesses who have been sort of led through their testimony. And they've given statements that have been vetted and filtered by the committee staff and that type of thing, but they've not been subjected to cross examination by lawyers on the other side.

The top line number is $1.7 trillion to fund the government next year.And, you know, you mentioned Amara, that this seems to be a repeat every year. That is the case, they passed a continuing resolution last week, which they have done in the past couple of years to fund the government for another week. So funding right now is set to expire Friday at midnight, but we don't expect a shutdown, Amara. Really want to make that clear. They have reached this deal. The text is going to come out in the next 24 hours. We don't know the details of what this funding bill is going to look like. You know, there were some disagreements of between Democrats and Republicans on domestic spending. We don't know quite yet what they agree to. But we'll know in the next day, what those numbers look like. And after that, the Senate is going to take it up. However, as you know, Amara, as you noted -- mentioned, this is not something that can pass in just a day. It's not something that happens quickly here on Capitol Hill. So the Senate is probably going to work on trying to pass this bill for a few days at the beginning of the week. Then once the Senate passes the bill, which is expected to pass it's -- expected to get at least 60 votes to advance this bill, it'll go to the House. Also, House will pass with a simple majority and then President Joe Biden's desk on Friday, where he is expected to sign this bill into signature to prevent a government shutdown. So even though they did have to pass a one-week funding bill, it does seem that there's going to be some good news here on Capitol Hill ahead of the holidays, they'll prevent a shutdown here.

So we will see, Amara, whether in the next week when lawmakers come back to Capitol Hill, whether Trump's endorsement will change any of these five lawmakers minds because remember, McCarthy needs 2018 votes to clinch the gavel, the speaker's gavel and right now he does not have that.

      "sentences": "Yes, well, the President is facing a growing threat as Title 42 is expected to be lifted this week. And the White House is really bracing for that already. Homeland Security officials have warned that we're likely to see an almost immediate increase of migration over the southern border.Now to be clear here, this is not something that the White House was not expecting. They expected sometime over the administration that the Trump era policy put in place during the pandemic would be lifted. But, of course, after Friday, when the federal appeals court blocked the last-ditch Republican effort to keep that policy in place, it seems more real. So you're right. The White House now says in responding to that appeals court decision that there was a robust effort underway to prepare for the lifting of Title 42. And I want to read you the statement from the White House Spokesperson Abdullah Hasan on Friday, where he said, \"To be clear, the lifting of Title 42 public health order does not mean the border is open. Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work of smugglers spreading information to make a quick buck off of vulnerable migrants. We will continue to fully enforce our migration laws and work to expand legal pathways for migration while discouraging disorderly and unsafe migration.\" Now in the -- lead up to Title 42, as expected to be lifted, they released a six-point plan outlining some ways that they are trying to prepare for it. And that includes surge and resources and personnel to the border, establishing temporary facilities for processing, ramping up air transportation, among other things, trying to get more people out of the area. But when you talk to White House officials, they point out two things. First of all, they point out the $3 billion that they have requested from Congress to try to get more resources really in the immediate after effect, after Title 42 is expected to be lifted. And then secondly, talk about congressional reform for the future, trying to say that they can't do much without Congress stepping in and reforming the system. But of course, as we know, Boris and Amara, that is unlikely to happen both in this lame duck session and also next session when the House is taken over by Republicans. So it kind of leaves the White House and the Biden administration alone dealing with this threat, or excuse me, this challenge at the border come Wednesday, as Title 42 is expected to be lifted. Boris and Amara?",

And he was essentially a celebrity, a beloved mountain lion here in Los Angeles, with a Facebook page, an Instagram page. But unfortunately, about a month ago, the experts that track him started noticing changes in his behavior. They say he was getting closer and attacking dogs, even dogs on leashes, that were close to people. They also say he was getting a lot closer to urban areas and deeper in to these urban areas. They believed that he was in distress, which is why they decided to capture him.Once they captured him, he went through a medical evacuation. They already thought he'd been hit by a car, but the medical evaluation revealed that he had trauma to his eye, to his head, and some internal organs. They also discovered preexisting illnesses, including kidney disease, some infection in his skin, weight loss. And so, when they took all of that into consideration, they essentially decided that putting him down was the best scenario for P-22. This week, after he was captured, some of the experts that have been tracking him for years, spoke out saying that his legacy, his data, will live on. Here's one of those experts.

He's a clinical psychologist and an assistant professor at Ohio State University and the clinical director of Strive, the Suicide and Trauma Reduction Initiative for Veterans. Dr. Baker, we're grateful to have you this morning. Thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us. Perhaps the most painful part about finding out that a loved one or someone you admire has died by suicide, is being unable to recognize that there were signs that something was off. In the case of \"tWitch\", for example, he posted a video dancing with his wife just days before he died. And Naomi Judd, another name that we mentioned, she was set to enter the Hall of Fame and announced a tour with her daughter. What signs could we look for in loved ones that they may be struggling? DR. JUSTIN BAKER, CLINICAL DIRECTOR, SUICIDE AND TRAUMA REDUCTION INITIATIVE FOR VETERANS AND ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE:  Yes, I think that's a great question. And you got -- thanks for having me here this morning. I think, we all want to be able to point to what are the warning signs, what are the risks so that we can hopefully get in front of someone who's struggling with suicide and prevent death -- their death. The difficulty is, is -- you know, while some people may have some signs like increasing depression or fearfulness or increased, like, sleep, there's a lot of people that don't show any signs. And so, it's not that, oh, did I miss something? It's that, well, maybe there weren't any even actually signs to see.",

I think, you know, we think back on, what could I have done differently. What didn't I do? What did I do?
