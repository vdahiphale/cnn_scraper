We talked a lot about the rearview mirror, but voters are looking for what the second term of either president will be like.I think one thing is clear here when you see, as President Biden is trying to remind people of the Trump presidency, President Trump is trying to remind people of what's going on now. This isn't something that is going to be issue by issue. Voters are going to look at this and see who they are comfortable with. But you said things are different, Sara. It is so clear, going back to watch the old debates, it's amazing how many things have changed. The Dobbs decision, for example, the invasion of Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, immigration certainly is at a different place. So, so many different issues.

He's served as president United States, and if this is about the policy records of both presidents, and this is about their actual policy vision for the next four years, this debate is going to be good for America.

And that ought to be a nonpartisan issue.But for President Trump, the top areas of focus are the areas that matter to Americans right now -- fixing the mass influx of illegal migration into this country, reviving the economy, and think about stable foreign policy as well. We're closer to World War Three than we've ever been this century. It was very different under the Trump years. And I think that that should be the area of focus at the debate tomorrow night. I think that's what's affecting Americans at home. And the more this goes into relitigating personalities or past accusations, the worse it's going to be for the country. And so I'm looking forward to hopefully what is a policy rich debate that actually informs Americans of facts they need. I'll also tell you something I told President Trump and I'll tell you as well is I give him a lot of credit for doing this debate on the terms that were effectively set by Biden. Hosted by CNN in Atlanta without a live audience would be the equivalent of Joe Biden agreeing to do a FOX News hosted debate in Alabama with 3,000 live audience members. So I give Donald Trump a lot of credit for that. If you're going to lead the country, you've got to be able to show up. And that's exactly what he's doing.",

There's no filter there.On the aggressive tactics, the reason I did bring that up because Trump himself seemed to acknowledge that four years ago in the first debate he came out too hot. He told \"The Washington Examiner,\" I was very aggressive in the first one.

You have to be strong enough to protect your kindness. Strong enough he is, and most Americans know that about him, that he's a fighter. But I'd like for Americans to also see the side of him that I've had a chance to see since I've left this race, which is the Trump also cares about leading the entire nation. And yes, dare I say, uniting this country. That part, I don't think has come across through the filters. I do hope it comes across tomorrow at the debate.And the reality is this. The last debate, let's talk about a lot of the things that happened. This is last time around during COVID. There were claims that Biden made, that he had no involvement in his son's dealings. We were in an era of social media censorship. We were in an era where the Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed on the eve of the last election. I hope everybody has learned those lessons of the past to say that, you know what, we're not going the way of censorship this time around. We're not going the way of distorting the information the public gets. This time around as a country, let's learn from our mistakes of the past, give the information to the voters so they're able to make their own decisions. And one of the things I really worry about for the country right now, John, is this, I think it's a very real possible scenario is that Biden is coming in -- you're talking about coming in hot -- probably going to call Trump a convicted felon. Well, let's play this out. A lot of legal experts believe this is going to be overturned on appeal or by the Supreme Court. And I worry about a scenario where, God forbid, we have another federal election, if Biden won it by a narrow margin and then the Supreme Court overturns it after the fact, and we know that actually affected the views of voters, I worry about this country. That's even worse than the suppression of the Hunter Biden story on the eve of the last election. So this time let the voters have the facts, and I hope this country, from the media to the political establishment, has learned the failures of 2020 to do right by Americans this time around.",

And after hearing a couple of hours of these arguments yesterday, the judge really just basically shut it down and said to the defense that she didn't really understand or didn't see their point of this being overly broad. She looked at the search warrant that was signed by a magistrate in that district and said that to her, it seemed like it was pretty standard compared to other types of warrants of the same kind. So the former president's lawyers were insisting, however, that they viewed some aspects of this to be off limits, certainly as part of the search. I will note it also, John, that as part of this, things got a little heated with the prosecution once again, because they wanted to push back on some of the comments that were being made by the former president's lawyers, and she shut down and abruptly ended the hearing.
