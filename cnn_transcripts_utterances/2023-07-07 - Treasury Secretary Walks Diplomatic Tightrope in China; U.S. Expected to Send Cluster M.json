I'm Rahel Solomon in for Christine Romans.We begin with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen meeting right now in Beijing with Chinese Primer Li Qiang. Yellen facing a tough challenge during her two days of meetings with Chinese officials. She's there, of course, to try to stabilize a tense relationship strained even further just this week when China retaliated in a tech war with the U.S. CNN's Anna Coren live in Hong Kong. Anna, so what's Yellen been saying so far? What's the message been so far?",

She was with him at the Paris Finance Summit last month where she said the world expects China and us to work together.Now, you may have seen both of them smiling at each other. And the Chinese premier, he spoke first just a few moments ago and said that there was a rainbow when Yellen landed yesterday. And it was symbolic of the U.S./China relationship. So who knows? Perhaps there's some hope on the horizon. But in her opening remarks, the U.S. treasury secretary said that the Biden administration seeks healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all but can benefit both countries. And she went to say and let me read it to you: the U.S. will in certain circumstances need to pursue target actions to protect its national security and we may disagree in these instances. However, we should not allow any disagreement to lead to misunderstandings that needlessly worsen our bilateral economic and financial relationship. Now, earlier, she met with representatives of the U.S. business community and, Rahel, there we got an insight into the enormous challenges that she's facing on this visit as she tries to improve relations and communication, you know, between the world's largest economies. She expressed concern about China's punitive actions taken against U.S. firms in recent months. Remember there have been a number of raids on U.S. companies. Also she is concerned about China's decision this week to control exports of critical minerals used in technologies like semiconductors. This as we know is a huge issue between the U.S. and China and will no doubt dominate her talks. The Biden administration is preparing additional restrictions on U.S. technology, trade with China, including potential limits on advanced chips and U.S. investment in China citing national security. We know this will anger China. But Yellen, Rahel, is a voice of reason. She's an economic pragmatist. She's pushed to maintain economic ties with China, argued against tariffs, warned against decoupling saying it would be disastrous. Let's take a quick listen to what she said a bit earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  The United States does not seek a wholesale separation of our economies. We seek to diversify and not to decouple. The decoupling of the world's two largest economies would be destabilizing for the global economy and virtually impossible to undertake. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN is reporting exclusively that one focus of special counsel Jack Smith's investigation is a chaotic Oval Office meeting in the final days of the Trump administration. So, multiple sources tell CNN that investigators have asked about the December 2020 meeting during witness interviews and grand jury testimony. Sources say prosecutors have asked about three outside Trump advisors who were at the meeting. Former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, former national security advisor Michael Flynn, and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. Participants have already testified that the meeting devolved into a shouting match as the outside advisers faced off with West Wing lawyers. They fought at length over the advisers just really stunning suggestions that the military seize voting machines, that Sidney Powell should be named special counsel investigating supposed voter fraud and that Trump could invoke martial law. Secret service meantime investigation into who left the small baggy of cocaine in the west wing apparently nearing its conclusion.

They are going through the security camera footage that may exist of that West Wing entrance on the ground floor of the West Wing. But what they haven't gotten back yet is the DNA and fingerprint analysis that's being conducted on that small baggie of cocaine. Now, that same official cautions me that it is very possible that the Secret Service simply doesn't get to the bottom of this and that is in part because of the number of people who go through that entrance every day, whether it'd be visitors coming to go on the West Wing tours or White House officials, military officials who all pass through that entrance. Part of this is also that baggie was found in a cubby and it's not clear whether the security cameras are pointing to those cubbies. But nonetheless, the White House, for now, they say that they are allowing the Secret Service to carry out this investigation. They are prepared to assist in any way that may be necessary. But they are also very much leaning in the direction of this is likely a visitor. They're not saying that outright, but they repeatedly pointing out, for example, that this is the West Wing entrance where those tours start. Those cubbies are where visitors are asked to leave their phones before entering the West Wing. So this investigation still ongoing, expected to wrap up early next week. Whether or not they actually have a suspect in hand is another question. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, look, this is another step of President Biden as he tries to lower costs for both middle class Americans and also working class Americans, a part of the platform that he continues to call Bidenomics.Now, you're right. Today, he will focus on health care, taking aim at those short health care plans that White House officials say really provide or basically leave patients stacked with these really hefty type of bills. So part of this plan, we know that President Biden -- or this proposed rule President Biden is expected to announce today is going to do a couple things. First, it would limit the length of these controversial plans to three months with option of one month extension. Now, it would also require the plans to provide consumers with clear explanations of their benefits which are typically less comprehensive than those long term plans. The headline, though, as you can see on that second point there, is that it's going to roll back what president -- former President Trump did while in office which was to expand these health -- these short term health care plans to 12 months with allowing them to be extended for up to three months. Now, also, President Biden is expected to strengthen rules protecting what patients know about surprise medical billing, something that he has talked about frequently. All of course under the umbrella of Bidenomics, as President Biden tries to lower costs for Americans across the country, including those working class and middle class Americans focusing, on the pitch that he continues to refer to. Now, we heard this pitch in earnest yesterday when in South Carolina, he was focused on manufacturing and providing goods to Americans, really trying to keep their costs down as administration officials really try to get Americans to associates what President Biden has done with the economy, positive things that he's done with the economy. With his platform trying to really set their sights on 2024 and that election campaign message. So we know from polling that right now, Americans do not associate President Biden with positivity when it comes to the American. This, of course, what we are going to hear today, what he heard yesterday and what we're going to hear going into the 2024 season is really trying to reverse that. But, today, of course, he's going to focus on health care, something that he talks about frequently to the American people -- Rahel.",
