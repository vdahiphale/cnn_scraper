      "sentences": "Right now, Vice President Harris is on her way to visit the southern border in the key swing state of Arizona. Harris will be briefed by border officials before she delivers remarks on border security and immigration, and she's expected to go on offense during her speech and hit former President Trump for killing the bipartisan border bill. According to an excerpt, she's expected to say, quote, the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games.Let's talk more about this now with the mayor of Mesa, Arizona, John Giles. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us. I wanted to talk with you about this because polling yesterday from Fox and Marist in your state shows no clear leader in the state. Trump has a bit of an edge, but it's within the margin of error. But then when you look at Fox's Arizona polling specifically on the issue of the border, Trump leads by 15 points. What can Harris's visit do for how voters see her and her message on the border? MAYOR JOHN GILES, (R) MESA, ARIZONA: Well, I think this is a very important visit, particularly for the very close vote in Arizona. This is an issue that border states care about. And I think the vice president has a great story to tell. She is the former attorney general of a border state, and she has a great deal of experience in prosecuting crimes on both sides of the border and in dealing with the challenges that the border presents. Also, she's got a great story to tell about the administration's efforts to cooperate with Congress to get a bipartisan border security bill. Executive orders are no substitute for congressional fixes to our broken immigration system. So it was entirely appropriate and it was the best plan A to address this problem for the administration to work with Senator Lankford and Senator Sinema in a bipartisan way to actually solve the broken immigration system that we have to add additional resources to the border. President Trump clearly does not want that to happen. He's delighted to use this as a wedge, as a divisive issue, as he wants to take advantage of this problem rather than treating it as a problem to be solved. KEILAR: Harris's last visit was in 2021. I wonder if you think she should have come more often, if she should have come sooner before a trip to the border might be dismissed by her opponents. By the way, you're a Republican who is behind her, but many Republicans are not, obviously, and they are dismissing this simply as a campaign move when she's behind on the issue of the border. Should she have come sooner? Should she have come maybe when the numbers were higher during the crisis?",

      "sentences": "Well, I tell you, as an Arizonan, I've kind of become numb to national politicians coming to the border, putting on a jeans jacket and using it as a as a photo op. I mean, that's a major part of the Arizona economy is the tourism around campaign people coming to visit the border. So it's become a pretty much of a stunt.And so the vice president, again, is very familiar with the border as the former attorney general of California. As the vice president, she had a specific assignment to work with the triangle area of Central America to work on the root causes of migration. And she was successful in that. Now, the folks that you're seeing at the border crossing are in large part not from that region any longer. So absolutely, it's important that she's here. Unquestionably, people in Arizona appreciate her being there, appreciate her being proactive and aggressive in identifying what her -- what her campaign position is. But the fact that she has resisted the urge to be part of the long string of folks who know nothing about the border, but they come down here to for photo ops, that's not impressive to folks in Arizona.",

And one of those big loopholes for the last several years has been asylum seekers. Before that, it was unaccompanied minors.It'll always be whatever loopholes that we have in our immigration laws. And so that's why Congress needs to take action. The blame for this problem lies in the United States Congress, not so much in the executive branch. And there are some very necessary reforms that need to take place addressing the current system for asylum seekers being at the top of that list.",

You have to prove the campaign finance violations. The elements of those offenses, if they prove what they say they're going to prove via the indictment, are there.So to say it's nothing isn't really true. I mean, we'll see what motions they make and the success they have with Judge Ho next week. But I think he's just doing a defense lawyer's job, right?

It takes the parties to make their motions and the judge to decide is excluded from Speedy Trial Act purposes.So, you know, usually even though the Speedy Trial Act will say, you know, 70 days, what it ends up being is up to a year, maybe even two years sometimes because of all the time that's excluded. And a lot of that time will be automatically excluded by the judge. For example, the time it takes to make and decide motions. But if Eric Adams and his counsel do insist on a speedy trial, then they won't get the kind of automatic adjournments that typically happen. And I would expect if they really want to hold the government's feet to the fire, that we could see a trial within a few months, as opposed to what it would usually be, say, a year or more.",

Yes, this time yesterday, you wouldn't have been able to see straight to the hospital like we are now. There would have been trees and structures, but all of that underwater downstream now. Currently, we have just a handful left on top of the hospital. We've had a constant stream of helicopters picking them up and dropping them off into the city and safe places.

And that's why I brought together some 50 countries some two and a half years ago to meet and discuss how we're going to continue to provide security assistance. And we've done that consistently every month. We meet every month, either in person or virtually, and our support to Ukraine has been unwavering. We're going to continue to focus on giving them what they need to be successful on the battlefield. And again, one specific weapon won't be the answer to every problem on the battlefield. And I think, you know, what we've seen recently is that Ukraine has the ability to now produce its own weaponry in terms of UAVs that are proven to be very, very effective in that fight.
