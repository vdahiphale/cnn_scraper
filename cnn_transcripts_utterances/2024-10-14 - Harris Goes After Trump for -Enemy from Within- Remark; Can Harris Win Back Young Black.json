And new accusers file suit against Diddy. What's different about these claims? I'll tell you more tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" So, with 22 days until the election, Kamala Harris did something tonight, frankly, right out of Donald Trump's playbook. I mean, we haven't really seen her do a whole lot of, if ever. And she did it in Erie, Pennsylvania of all places, a critically swing county in a critical battleground state. Now, Harris has told voters before to actually watch, watch Trump's interviews, watch his rallies for themselves so that they can then judge what she says is the difference between herself and him. But tonight, she said forget you watching it, take legwork out of it. About 20 minutes into her stump speech, she actually played Trump's own words for the crowd and for the cameras.

So, if you go to Webster online, you're going to find that fascism is defined as -- it's usually nationalistic. It's far-right. Okay, let's see. So, that's certainly the Trump campaign. And Trump is going to be intolerant of dissenting opinions. Okay, we got to check on that. There's a contempt for the rule of law or only the laws they want to follow. Hmm, we got to check on that. And then also unquestioning obedience to the supreme leader. Okay, check. And then lastly, it's this concept of a supremacy, of a race or a religion. Well, check, check. White and Christian are the backbone of his people. Here's -- that is actually the definition of fascism. I encourage your viewers to look it up themselves and draw their own conclusions. Well, Mark Milley, extremely well-educated, he's very articulate, very smart man. He and I worked together in the Pentagon many years ago, literally person to person for a long time. If he, as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is calling the president a fascist, I am so proud of him for breaking that barrier to say, to speak to the truth, that he is. The challenge is, because most MAGA Republicans, and please understand, I am not referring to Republicans in general, but the very far right, the hardcore, they don't understand what fascism is. The reality is, they are in fact fascists themselves by the definition. And here's the sad part: The people who vote for Trump, they don't realize that they are also supporting a fascist. And that is very bad for our country, and it's done out of ignorance in most cases. It's a very sad state of affairs that we have a fascist running for the president of the United States.",

They're just different and coming of age quicker than any other demographic.That don't mean an excuse for them to be Democrat or Republican.

      "sentences": "Hey, Laura. So, the bottom line is Republicans are running on this issue because it's a winning issue for them. In fact, it's a rare issue that unites Republicans and divides Democrats. So, take a look here. Think transgender athletes should only plan teams that match their birth gender? Look at this. Forty-eight percent of Democrats, the slight plurality, actually agree with that idea. Forty-seven percent opposed. Among Republicans, it's a blowout. Ninety-three percent agree with the idea versus just 6% opposed.But it's not just that we see Republicans overwhelmingly agreeing with this idea and Democrats split down the middle. Take a look at the trend line here because I think it's illustrative of something that's going on here. Again, it's, think transgender athletes should only play on teams that match their birth gender? You go back to 2021, 62% of Americans agreed with that. You look at 2023, look at that number now, up to 69%. The movement is actually growing here, that believe that, in fact, transgender athletes should only play on teams that match their birth gender. I think there's something else that's also going on here, Laura. And that is Democrats have been running, of course, on the idea that abortion should be legalized nationwide. It's a social issue that works for them. And indeed, 65% of Americans believe that Roe v. Wade was wrongly overturned. That is very close to the 69% of Americans who believe that athletes should only play on teams that match their birth gender. So, I think Republicans are trying to essentially find a social issue of their own. Of course, you may be asking yourself, could Republicans go too far? And I think that they could, because take a look here. Even though most Americans believe that transgender athletes should only play on teams that match their birth gender, they also believe, get this, should society accept that transgender people as having the gender identity they identify with? Fifty-six percent of voters across key battleground states agree with that idea. So, look, Americans don't want to chastise transgender folks, they just don't want them playing on teams that don't match up with their birth gender. Laura, back to you.",

They're not talking about this being a motivating issue for them to vote.But Harry made the right point of saying 93% of Republicans are all about this because if we don't, if they don't motivate each party's people to come vote, then you're not going to win because most folks have picked a side at this point. And we're looking for issues. Democrats use abortion every day to motivate women, women are overperforming men at every stage of this election because it's a motivational factor, and Republicans think they can do the same with this issue. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And also, just to say to compare abortion to transgender athletes playing in sports, I mean that is a niche issue that has been blown up to -- to be like a moral panic by the right, whereas abortion does affect, you know, the 50% of women in this country.

Quote -- \"Don't you want to break into the business?\" -- unquote. The new findings come on the heels of the announcement of Combs's federal sex trafficking trial date, May of next year.
