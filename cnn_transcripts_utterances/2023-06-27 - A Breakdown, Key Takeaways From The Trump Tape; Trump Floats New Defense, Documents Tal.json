Polls show that most Republicans think this prosecution is politically motivated and they'll take Trump's word for it.That's why I stress the importance of actually getting the case to trial. I think it's very hard to say, if Trump is convicted, that the 12 jurors, whoever they might be, are agents of the deep state, and that somehow the deep state in front of a Trump-friendly judge, so far, they managed to find 12 people that were instructed by the deep state to convict him.

Trump responding today, insisting that he did nothing wrong, then he later said it was all bravado. But does the tape put his legal defense on the back foot?Joining me now to discuss all of this is the lead counsel who represented Trump in his second impeachment trial, David Schoen. David, thank you for being here tonight. So, Trump today told report reporters that he had, quote, a lot of papers and copies of different plans on his desk. And he later told reporters on the flight to New Jersey tonight that he was talking about plans to a golf course. Do all of these shifting explanations help him or hurt him in this case? DAVID SCHOEN, LEAD COUNSEL FOR TRUMP'S SECOND IMPEACHMENT: Well, generally, I think shifting explanations probably don't help. And I would say that one would be hard pressed to say that having a tape like this is better for the defense than worse for the defense, but maybe there's a theory by which it is. However, I don't like the way that sort of everyone has him convicted already based on the tape. I think any criminal defense lawyer who's handled a lot of cases knows that tapes can be very valuable for the government, but they also aren't magic. There are ways to cross- examine tapes. And part of this thing is I think I know Ambassador Bolton made the point, it's going to come down to also what the witnesses said. You can be sure each of the witnesses who was present has been interviewed by the government, and they know what those people intend to say. So, that's going to give some sort of flavor to what happened here. But I don't think it's quite as simple as people think. It's a serious matter. But every criminal case -- almost every criminal case has serious issues that have to be fought. And there are some defenses to this. They have to fit it within their defense theory. I think part of the problem right now is he doesn't really have a real criminal defense lawyer on his team. He's going to have to have that.",

If they believe and they think they can prove that they were authorized to have the document, whether classified or not, because the president has the exclusive right, without judicial review, of determining that something is a personal document, and he believed this to be personal document, let's just say for argument's sake, because he felt he had been in the past under siege, people had told lies about him, he wanted to be able to defend himself, and in this case, that he thought General Milley was doing a disservice to the country, he wanted the country to know we were prepared.

Back to you. PHILLIP: Erin, thank you for that. And joining me now from the state of New Hampshire is Former Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd. He is seeking the GOP nomination of the 2024 race and he's also a Former CIA Officer. Congressman, thank you for joining us. Look, you have been critical of President Biden's silence as this unfolded over the weekend. Although many other experts did commend his distance, basically saying, look, the United States should stay away from appearing to be involved in an internal Russian dispute. So, what was so wrong about Biden staying out of it? WILL HURD (R), PRESIDENTIA CANDIDATE: Well, anytime that you have chaos and uncertainty, it's actually an opportunity. And what we should have been doing is working with our allies to double down on our support to Ukraine in order to end this war quickly. That was the thing that I was critical of. And this is an opportunity for us to make sure that the Ukrainians have all the resources that they need and to stop worrying about this notion of escalation on our side. This notion that if we provide more support to help the Ukrainians who we are already helping and who is our ally, that we're going to see an escalation from the Russian side. I think this is the events of this weekend is an example of how when Vladimir Putin was faced with somebody coming down the highway, trying to get him, what did he do? He actually capitulated. And this is a lesson that we should take into account when it comes to supporting our friends in Ukraine.",

One of the other criticisms I have of the Biden administration is Tony Blinken on Sunday. He said that the United States' goal is to help the Ukrainians push the Russians out of the territory they've gathered and they've invaded since 16 months ago, since back in February. I hope he misspoke. I haven't seen any clarification of that. We should be supporting the Ukrainians and pushing the Russians out of all of Ukraine to include Crimea and Donbass.

The United States Supreme Court today really affirmed the check and balance of a judicial where they can overrule legislative laws that are unconstitutional. That's a foundation in our country.
