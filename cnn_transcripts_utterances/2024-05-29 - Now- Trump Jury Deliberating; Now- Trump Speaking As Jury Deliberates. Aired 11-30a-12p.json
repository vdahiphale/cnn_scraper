And there was a gentleman who I'll never forget, he was a bartender, and he was the guy who sort of was like, well, what about this and what about that, and he just evolved as the leader of the jury room and brought us all around myself included to a particular place. Again, it was civil, so it wasn't -- it was not about a criminal conviction. It was about liability. The thing that fascinated me the most about it was all the things as trial lawyers, you think matter didn't matter. It wasn't about the show. It wasn't about the performance. It wasn't about the expression on your face to make sure that oh, I look incompetent in front of the jury. It was none of that. It was none of the things even the spin. Juries are like -- they're BS detectors, right? They can tell when you're spinning. What we tried to do and what every single person in that room tried to do was to get to the bottom of what the truth is. OK, I could tell she was trying to influence me by doing this. And I can tell he was -- that was a little too showy for me. But what I saw was the fact that Melania Trump wasn't there standing -- sitting by her husband. You know, they see those things.

But as we discussed already, those six alternates have not been excused. The judge thanked them for their diligence. He said we're not going to excuse you just yet. Please remain with us because there might be a need for you at some point during deliberations. Judge Merchan is now clarifying the instruction he gave earlier.

Not seeming to believe there's going to be a positive outcome as he claimed that Mother Teresa could not be the charges that are facing him there.You see, he is surrounded by his entourage. He also made several false claims while he was there. We'll get to those with our fact check -- fact-checker, Daniel Dale in a moment. And, Paula Reid, though, just to hear Trump, you know as he was -- as he chose not to speak last night, he chose not to speak this morning coming into the room, and then you saw that remarkable moment that we have not seen so far in this case. Typically, it's quite clear when Trump is leaving the courtroom that he's going to speak to cameras. He carries his comments in hand that he's going to read to the cameras. He came up and decided to criticize the case, criticize the instructions that the jury just heard, and claim falsely that this is being done at the behest of President Biden, which it's not. But what is important there is not even just the words themselves, it's that he clearly does not believe there's a positive outcome for him waiting at the other end of these jury deliberations.",

Prosecutors have continued to try to rebrand it from the hush money case to a 2016 election interference case. And the Trump team doing the same thing, arguing that these have only been brought in an election year.This is his argument in the court of public opinion. It includes falsehoods, trying to link this prosecution to President Biden which again, that is just not true. But this is how he's trying to frame it and definitely does not appear optimistic about his odds here. And as I've been told repeatedly, they believe the best likely outcome for them -- for most people, the best outcome would be an acquittal. For them, the most likely outcome is a deadlocked jury.",

Of course, he was indicted by a jury of his peers here and it is the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg who brought this case. DANIEL DALE, CNN REPORTERHe also used this figure. He said 15, 16, or 17 million people being let in over the border under Joe Biden. Those are wildly exaggerated figures. We are under 10 million so-called encounters, that includes many millions who were sent back under Title 42 after they were encountered. So, not all of them were let in. And I think a point of clarification, he says something true. He said that Judge Merchan had donated to President Biden -- to Joe Biden's campaign. That is true, but I think it's important to note that the amount of the donation was $15. So, just a point of fact there.",

The jury actually deliberating when Donald Trump was claiming that it was rigged. I do think that's notable.And, Kaitlan, you were wondering what that group of people was talking about with all the lawyers. Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles, Donald Trump Jr., and Donald Trump. Well, I think they were talking about Mother Teresa because as Donald Trump, the former president was out speaking in the microphone, Donald Trump Jr. at the very same exact moment, maybe even seconds before was tweeting out the comments about Mother Teresa.

You know, sometimes defense attorneys take that on -- head-on and they tell the jury, look, this is an all-or-nothing case. You shouldn't return a mixed verdict. You either believe it or you don't.

No -- even experts who've been in many cases have said that as well.It is remarkable that right now we are in jury deliberations for Donald Trump. I mean, the two of us covered Trump in the White House.

So, the fact that here he's charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records, I think that is shocking. I think that Alvin Bragg is probably shocked that this is the first criminal prosecution of Trump that is actually going to trial because of course, there are three other criminal cases. And it was widely expected that the January 6 federal case brought by the Special Counsel Jack Smith, that would go first.
