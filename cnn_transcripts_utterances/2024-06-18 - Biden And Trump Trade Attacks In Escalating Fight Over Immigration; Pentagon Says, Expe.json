Stand by to hear how Trump is hitting back tonight.Also this hour, an extraordinary scene in North Korea, as Kim Jong-un embraces Vladimir Putin and gives him the red carpet treatment. The U.S. watching warily as these adversaries of the west are cozying up and increasing their military cooperation. At a moment of reckoning, that's what one senator is calling a tense hearing about growing worries for the over the safety of Boeing jets. We're going to tell you how the testimony of Boeing's CEO played with lawmakers and with relatives of crash victims who were there in the room. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with President Biden's new move to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation, its impact on families, and the heated politics surrounding it all. Steve Contorno is standing by at a Trump rally in Wisconsin. But, first, let's go to CNN's Kayla Tausche. She's over at the White House. Kayla, what does this do for immigrants? And what is the president hoping it does politically?",

But after today's executive action by President Biden, those individuals can stay in the country during that application process as long as those couples have been married for at least ten years, and they were married before yesterday. Here's what President Biden said this afternoon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: These couples have been raising families, sending their kids to church and school, paying taxes, contributing to our country, living in the United States, all this time with a fear and uncertainty. We can fix that. And that's what I'm going to do today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A statement out today from Biden campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, says families belong together.Now, with 550,000 people impacted by today's move, it's the most sweeping executive action since DACA, which, in 2012, allowed some 832,000 young people whose immigrant parents brought them here to live and work freely in the U.S. But like DACA, this is also expected to face legal challenges. But the Biden camp believes that because these individuals were eligible for green cards already that they should be able to prevail. But there's been one question, Wolf, that the White House has faced repeatedly today amid months-long standoff in Congress on this issue and an election just months away is why did the president choose to do this now, and the White House would only say because immigration is broken.

The number one killer of children in America is gun violence, in our communities, by suicide, in our schools, by accident. And so I just think a reasonable country goes after the number one killer of children and it should be a non-partisan thing.What we did in Michigan was start on those areas of common agreement. We passed legislation on safe storage. You have someone under 18 living in the house, you got to store it. And if not, you're going to be charged if they commit a crime with that weapon. We prosecuted successfully the mother and father of the Oxford High School shooting because they basically gave the child a gun. So, it's accountability and the gun owners, I know, of course, understand that. It's red flag laws, if someone is having a mental illness breakdown, you should be able to go to a court and get a document that allows you to take those weapons away temporarily. And then universal background checks. I don't even know why we're not talking about this anymore. If you go to a gun show, or you're buying a gun on the Internet, you got to go through a background check, just like if you go to one of our big box stores. So, those to me, we passed here in Michigan, we're a big Second Amendment state. That isn't easy. We did it with bipartisan support. And that's what we should be doing at the federal level, like a reasonable country that cares about our kids.",

I mean, he was -- that changed his life, changed a lot of people's lives, obviously.But July of 1981, when they first started to get evidence that there was this new virus that was being transmitted, that's where he decided to spend a lot of his life. And we talked a lot about what happened during COVID, and a lot of people got to know Dr. Fauci during COVID, including the antagonistic parts, people really going after him. A lot of that happened during HIV/AIDS as well, Wolf. You may remember, I mean, they were burning effigies of Dr. Fauci at that time. But he says he sort of referred to that time period as good trouble, meaning the activists were trying to get things done, whereas now, he thinks it's just people trying to create trouble for no good reason. So, he really drew a distinction. Wolf, again, seven presidents, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008. I've interviewed him several times over the last 20 years. Zika, Ebola, Anthrax, H1N1, HIV/AIDS, and obviously, COVID. It's kind of a remarkable career and we did this interview in his house, Wolf, in Washington, he's lived in that house since 1977.
