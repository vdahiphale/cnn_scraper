Straight ahead, Donald Trump again using shocking and threatening language against his political opponents. Hear how Liz Cheney is responding to his violent rhetoric directed at her.And Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail with J Lo last night. Today, Harris heads to Wisconsin with Election Day just around the corner. And the cleanup in Spain from deadly floods continues with warnings that more bad weather is on the way. The death toll is now above 200. And we begin on the U.S. presidential campaign trail, high anxiety with four days until Election Day, continued outrage over comments made at a Donald Trump rally Sunday when a comedian called Puerto Rico, an island of garbage. Actress Singer Jennifer Lopez, whose roots are in Puerto Rico, campaigned with Kamala Harris on Thursday night in Las Vegas, in the heavily Hispanic state of Nevada. J Lo said Trump is alienating all Latino voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER LOPEZ, SINGER/ACTRESS: He has consistently worked to divide us. At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels. It wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day. OK, it was every Latino in this country. It was humanity and anyone of decent character. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As the two candidates crisscross the swing states, they will be both of them in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in that area this evening.And that's where we find our Jeff Zeleny, right now. Good to see you, Jeff. So, I mean very wild claims coming from the former president, very dangerous rhetoric, and he is saying quite emphatically that he wants to see Liz Cheney subjected to gunfire. Liz Cheney has responded, but has there been any more response coming from even the Trump campaign. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, I mean, this is where things stand four days before an election. That is the language from the man who is applying to be Commander-in-Chief once again. There's been no reaction from the Trump campaign or other Republicans. But look, if past is prolog. Things will follow a similar pattern of outrage and perhaps denials. But moving forward here, the question is, politically speaking, does any of this actually move the electorate? My guess is no at this late date. But Liz Cheney, of course, has emerged as one of the biggest surrogates and supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris. And you really do not have to look much farther than that to show just how politics here in the U.S. sort of upside down in this election. She, of course, a long-time conservative Republican supporting the Democratic candidate to try and block Donald Trump. All of this comes together as voters in these seven battleground states have been watching this campaign up close. There's exhaustion from it. There is no doubt. We have been talking to many of them, if they make up their choices, what is on their mind here in the final days. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But also here, over the morning we have seen Fredricka how they have been removing all the cars, all the vans that got trapped in this point. I actually talked to some national police that was deployed here in this very position, and they told me that while they were removing these cars to lead -- the emergency service to get to their way to the Chiva, they found some bodies here from people that got trapped when the flood waters overflowed from the river very, very fast. This is actually a very dramatic image that keeps repeating in many different points and many different cities. And actually, we are being told that inside of Chiva, the Mayor is asking for water, for food, because they are now somehow trapped inside, and all that they need cannot get inside.

So still, a lot of uncertainty about whether or not Iran will respond with the scope of that response will look like and how quickly it will indeed come. The Israeli government and the military have of course, made clear that if Iran retaliates, Israel will retaliate once again in turn, but I think that will also depend on what this Iranian retaliation actually looks like. Will it be another round of ballistic missiles hitting Israeli bases, hitting civilian areas inside of Israel? Will it cause any casualties? Or will it be something more limited, something fired, perhaps not from Iranian territory, but from another country in the region where Iran has proxy forces as well.

They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man. So, I'm wondering from you, Leslie, you know, how do you think this is all resonating among global leaders?LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF U.S. AND THE AMERICAS PROGRAMME AT THE CHATHAM HOUSE: I think people across Europe. I sit here in London with a very heavy footprint in the United States, but I can tell you that conversation, those optics and those words from the former president are not well received in Europe, because I think the difference for people sitting here is that they are watching America through the media. They are watching intensely focused conversations. They are seeing the words of -- hearing the words of the former president, but they're not really living America in a daily way. And so, the threat is, it is very significant. I think the concern for all of us about violence surrounding this election is very real. But there's not a broader understanding that there are actually a number of people in the United States, across both sides of the aisle who are working this election and are dedicated to having a free and fair election. So, what we're seeing amongst global audiences is an even more intensified concern about America's ability to deliver not only a result from this election, but to see it certified to see a peaceful transition. Because, of course, a Europe and much of the rest of the world depends on America's democracy functioning at a high level, you know, in a symbolic way, in a material way, in all sorts of ways. And in a year where, you know, well over a billion people have been voting elections across the world, it's really this election that people have been sort of hanging their hopes on and very concerned and very much waiting to see. But the problem, the concerns for violence, are significant. I think our audiences globally also don't understand the level of preparation. You and I know that January 6 has been designated a national special security day by the Department of Homeland Security. There are measures in place. We've seen this happen before. It isn't going to go without advanced preparation. Doesn't mean that it couldn't be very difficult. And I guess one of the questions is, you know, of course, who will win and by what margin? If this is a close race, the possibility for it to be contested seems extremely high. Legal confirmation is fine. But when, when you start to talk about extra-legal contestation, in other words, violence, that is the deep concern.",

So, with this busy election season and the focus on campaigning, it can be hard to lose sight of the fact that Donald Trump is still dealing with a slew of legal troubles. Earlier this year, he was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, and he's also facing three other indictments.Some say Trump's best chance at possibly avoiding prison time might be an Election Day victory.

A number of the criminal cases that are he's still facing are federal cases.If he wins and he's in the White House, he can make those go away. The one case that actually did go to trial, the New York State hush money case, he is supposed to be sentenced, on that -- on those charges, on that conviction, just three weeks after Election Day. And lawyers and retired judges I spoke to say they believe if Donald Trump loses the election, that, that sentencing will happen. It might get delayed again, but they expect he will be sentenced. However, if Donald Trump wins the election, they say, then they're not even sure that sentence will happen, or maybe it won't happen for four years. And part of the issues there is what the first step will be, that the state judge must decide this decision on presidential immunity. The Supreme Court had ruled, Trump has challenged the conviction on that. That ruling is expected the week after the election, one week from Election Day. Now, after that, Trump's lawyers, if they lose, that, they're going to move to appeal that they're going to move to postpone the sentencing to allow them time to make these legal arguments. And they're going to go, we expect, to multiple courts, the state courts, and possibly back to the Supreme Court. That all adds to potential delays in this. Now, if and lawyers that I speak to do think that if Trump wins the election, that one of these courts will grant the delay in the sentencing to allow him to challenge this immunity decision if it goes against him. Now, one of the other issues, of course, is that he has other legal challenges he's going to pursue, all of this does take time. And so, if Trump is heading to the White House, you know, big question will be, does any judge want to sentence him before he takes his seat in the Oval Office?
