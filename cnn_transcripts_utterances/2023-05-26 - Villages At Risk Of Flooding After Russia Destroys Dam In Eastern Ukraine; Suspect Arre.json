Ukraine says the dam on the Karlivka Reservoir was the target of constant Russian shelling. This video appears to show the water gushing through the structure.Officials say communities in the area have already been warned of the dangers and that civilians will be evacuated if needed. To the north Russia has begun transferring some of its tactical nuclear weapons to neighboring Belarus. That's according to the Belarusian state news agency which quoted President Alexander Lukashenko. The two countries announced the plan in March, but the U.S. said at the same -- at the time that there's no need to change its nuclear posture. Russia said those weapons will still remain under its control. Now, Ukraine says more than 100 of its soldiers are coming back home after a prisoner swap with Russia. It says they were captured during brutal fighting in Bakhmut. Ukraine is praising them as heroes saying their fate prevented Russia from advancing further or faster. Dozens of them were considered missing before the swap. All of this happening as Russia's Wagner mercenaries say they began their pull out from Bakhmut. Fred Pleitgen with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Just as the Ukrainian military save their forces are retaking ground on the outskirts of Bakhmut, Wagner boss Yevgeny Pregorgen says his mercenaries are moving out. That's it moving out in 10 to 15 minutes he tells these tankers. Everyone leaves before June 1st. We'll rest, prepare and then get a new task. Wagner's exit could mark a turning point in one of the bloodiest battles in Europe since World War II. The mercenaries assaulted Bakhmut for months often using human waves to try and storm Ukrainian positions. Pregorgen trying to prove to Putin his hired guns can get the job done where regular Russian units fail. Even during the withdrawal a swipe at Russia's defense minister. Pregorgen joking he'll leave to scrawny fighters behind to help the army when they take over Wagner's positions. That is Bieber and that's Deutlich, he says. The moment the military are in a tough position they'll stand up and block the Ukrainian army. Guys don't believe the military. While the Ukrainians tell CNN they cannot confirm Wagner is really pulling out of Bakhmut. They believe a withdrawal could give them a boost in key its quest to retake the city. SERHII CHEREVATYI, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator): Compared to other units of the Russian army, Wagner did fight better and conducted more offensive actions, but this was literally due to bloody discipline and threats of execution.",

Now, using data like this and expert analysis, CNN was able to identify eight vessels that exhibited suspicious behavior in the Caspian Sea. This is one such vessel. It's a Russian flag tanker that was seen in early January, leaving Iran's Amirabad port making its way across the Caspian Sea to Russia's Astrakhan port. Now, we cannot independently verify what this tanker was carrying. But experts tell us the shipment was likely linked to the arms trade. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): And there are signs that Tehran could be air mailing arms to. The U.S. and Ukraine both accused Tehran of sending supplies to Russia by plane. CNN analyzed the tracking data of for Iranian cargo planes flagged by the U.S. Commerce Department for potentially carrying drone shipments. Collectively, the aircraft made at least 85 trips to Moscow airports between May 2022 and March 2023. Iran has admitted that it sold a small number of drones to Russia, but it says the sale was a few months prior to the war in Ukraine. CNN has reached out to Iran and Russia for comment, but has yet to receive a response. But given the much larger volume cargo ships can carry the Caspian Sea corridor is likely the primary conduit and experts say it is the new frontier for weapons trade between Moscow and Tehran tucked away from Western interference.

You should think of the Treasury as sort of the building block upon which much of the other front of -- the rest of the financial system other markets rest. So for example, Treasuries are generally considered the safest of safe assets, everything else is benchmarked against them in terms of how risky they are. If suddenly, U.S. debt, U.S. Treasuries are revealed to be riskier, that has some cascading effects that basically reset the perceived riskiness of everything else. Treasuries are also often used, for example, as collateral in a lot of other trades, if that collateral suddenly becomes worth a lot less than people thought it was, which is what happens basically, if we default on our debt, then then that can affect lots of other markets as well.

In fact, if you look at the data in 2022, there were four cases, four deaths related to gun violence. That's out of a population of 125 million people. So, as you can understand this case is getting a lot of attention.Again, to run down what we know so far, four people are dead, two of whom are police officers and now this 31-year-old man described as a suspect is charged in one of the police officers death. The ban (ph) was taken into custody after barricaded himself inside his family's home. His father again is a local politician, a little local city council member. At the time, the 31-year-old suspect the man he fled to the family's home. At the time his mother and his aunt were inside. They were able to flee to safety. But the big lingering question behind all of this is motive what prompted this? Why did this happen? Police are starting to brief reporters. And so hopefully we'll get a little bit more detail as to what was the motivation behind all of this in the hours ahead. Finally, Michael, on this topic of gun violence in Japan, gun ownership is also very rare. But this is a case where this suspect according to public broadcaster NHK, he actually had licensed to own four firearms. Now that does seem a little bit attention getting. However, it's also important to remember, this man lived in a part of the country Central Japan where there are farmers, the suspects, his father are farmers. So it's not unusual for them to perhaps own firearms, in addition to hunting is also -- it's also common in this part of Japan. Still a long list of questions, Michael, including motive.

As you remember when the feds arrived at Mar-a-Lago, some teams they came to the storage room, that's where the documents are, you can do a search. They would not let them in the boxes. So what we've reported is that the boxes were previously moved after the subpoena arrived, and then the night before federal officials came to Mar-a-Lago they were put back into the storage room. We're also reporting that federal investigators probing the classified documents (INAUDIBLE) former President Trump have multiple witnesses who have told them, he displayed classified information to visitors, left it out, and showed it to others. And we're also reporting that before this time where they do not give the documents back, they went through what was called an apparent dress rehearsal, according to a federal judge when the National Archives asked for the documents back before.

So the impacts are getting worse, and worse. As we see one of the important findings of this study is that compared to previous mass extinctions, we have a massive amount of declines and a very small amount of species that are increasing. Therefore, we have a net loss of species. In previous mass extinctions, you have as species are lost, other species takeover, those species that become available.

PINCHEIRA-DONOSO: So in terms of your first question, the situation is more alarming because the traditional method to estimate the magnitude of this extinction crisis has been based on the conservation categories which is basically a snapshot about how well or bad a species is doing right now in time. The method we have used instead, takes into account the trajectories species population trends over time. And as we measure with the previous or traditional method, we know that 28 percent of bio diversity is threatened with extinction. With this measure of population trends over time, not a snapshot, we have found that it is 48 percent. So the amounts of species that are declining is a lot more severe than based on the previous method. But also it shows that some of the species, we have found that out of the species we have today, classed as non threatened, so doing well, 33 percent of those are declining which means that many of the species of toady have not crossed the line from being safe to being threatened will very likely be threatened in the next couple of years.",

And all the species in every ecosystem are connected between them. So the problem is like I always say is like you need to think about the engine of a car. Every engine of a car is made of multiple parts, small parts, big parts, but all of them operate together to make the engine work. In this case, we have ecosystem working in the same way. So every species interacts with other species and every ecosystem interact with other ecosystems like a system. So if you start removing species from those ecosystems, you know that the ecosystem is going to collapse overtime. So we should worry about it, because as somethings happen, as we find that there are epicenters of extinction, those will send shockwaves. But also all species are related to each other, and we are part of this ecosystems. We are animals that belong to this ecosystem. And our welfare depends on the functioning of those ecosystems. So it is -- it is worrying because -- (CROSSTALK)",

And probably is down the line. The question then is, as it always is, can it be turned around? And turned around in time to mitigate the worst of the potential fallout? PINCHEIRA-DONOSO: That's right. So a realistic solution depends on a realistic agenda and at the moment, we cannot get ahead of ourselves. We are in a situation where we need to concentrate on trying to mitigate the situation, this increasing rate of climate change, of habitat destruction, of species decline. We need to focus on how we mitigate that. Once we are there we can start thinking about how we revert it. But at the moment, we need to start finding solutions for the most immediate problem which is this increasing rate which is going to take us global cooperation, it's going to take us a couple of decades.",
