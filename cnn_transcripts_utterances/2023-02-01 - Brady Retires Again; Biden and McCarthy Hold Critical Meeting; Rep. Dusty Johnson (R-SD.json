So, 43 percent of the time that Tom Brady played he ended up in the Super Bowl. It's just greatness that we've never seen. It will likely never be matched again. And even if you break up Brady's career by his 20s, 30s and 40s, hewon, you know, three Super Bowls in his 20s, and then he won two more in his 30s and then two more in his 40s. He always said he wanted to play until he was 45 years old. You know the saying in sports is, you know, there's no beating father time. Well, you know, in terms of beating him, I mean, Tom Brady came the closest. I mean he had the TB 12 method working all the way till the end. Still threw for a ton of yards even in his final season there with the Bucs. But, he owns so many records, guys. I mean it -- this is a career that we're never going to see again. And you have to just go back to the way it started. Picked 199th overall in the 2000 draft in the sixth round. He came into the league as a true underdog, as a guy that wasn't expected to even make it, and he turned into the biggest champion we've ever seen.",

And I'm going to take him at his word for that because, like I said, he always mentioned he wanted to play until he was 45. He got there.

That they will not be making any concessions.Whereas McCarthy, and Lauren just laid out, is very much eager to negotiate. He has been fielding requests from members and there are members of his caucus who are pressing him to get these deep spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. So, needless to say, the two sides are pretty far apart as they go into this meeting. And the expectations are pretty low. There was one interesting moment from last night when President Biden was at a fundraiser in Manhattan when he talked about Kevin McCarthy. And I just wanted to note that. He said that in order to become speaker, Kevin McCarthy had to get commitments from some of his colleagues that were just absolutely off the wall. Those were the president's words. And then he turns to Chuck Schumer, who is the New York senator, and says, Chuck, I can't imagine you making one of those commitments. So, certainly seemed like a bit of a jab at McCarthy, where the president was sort of indicating that, yes, he is speaker, but he also realizes that politically he is a pretty compromised one and that his role is pretty diminished and that he is sort of very much beholden politically to many of these colleagues as they go into these negotiations, or talks, I should say. I will just finally note, too, the issue, of course, is that they know they have until early June to get this sorted, and that is a long time in Washington.",

That's why I'm proposing at the next council meeting an ordinance so that the Memphis City Council would have the authority and to receive body cam footage whenever there is an allegation of excess force.

SMILEYis this, if we watch the videos that Chief Davis, when she speaks on the incident, I think she's done a better job than any other police chief when it comes to just - you can sense the sincerity in her voice. But when it comes to where we are now, I think she has a very direct duty to make culture changing decisions. The clock is ticking. The clock is ticking. We are having a mayoral election this upcoming year. And the number one question posed to every mayoral candidate is, what will happen with Chief Davis in your administration?
