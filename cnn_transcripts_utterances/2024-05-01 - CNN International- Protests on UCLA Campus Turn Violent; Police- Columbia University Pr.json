      "sentences": "Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us around the world. I'm Max Foster. It is the 1st of May, 9 a.m. here in London, 1 a.m. in Los Angeles, where protests on the campus of UCLA are turning violent, as you can see. According to local media, things came to a head about two hours ago when pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters got into a confrontation. KABC reports fireworks were thrown inside the pro-Palestinian encampment. Campus police say they're responding to the incident.Of course, college campuses across the U.S. have been swept with protests over the last several weeks, but we haven't seen this level of violence up until now. Demonstrators demanding an end to the war in Gaza and for their universities to divest from Israel as well. We're trying to get a proper sense of what's happening on the ground. There are clearly clashes between protesters and other groups, but it's a chaotic situation, so we're trying to define exactly who's clashing. And as you can see, we're not seeing a lot of police there, so these aren't clashes with the police from what we can see. It's a fast-developing situation. Tensions just running extremely high, as they have been on other campuses, particularly at Columbia in New York. But this feels like it's taking a different turn. The big test, of course, for authorities, for the police, this is a state university, is to figure out how to respond. We did see in Columbia, you know, police dressed in protective gear going in, not necessarily heavy-handed, but a very clear response to clear protesters out of one of the buildings there. This is a different university, a different part of the country, and a different protest, so the police will be trying to work out exactly how to deal with this, because when things turn violent, of course, people need to be protected. News cameras rolling on that campus, but also at Columbia University, as police moved in, as I say, a few hours ago, and pro-Palestinian protesters there were evicted.

      "sentences": "More than 100 demonstrators were arrested on Tuesday, mostly at Columbia, but some also from nearby City College. Police were able to empty out one of the main buildings at Columbia that had been seized by protesters for nearly a day. Officers entered Hamilton Hall from a second-story window using an elevated ramp.Very dramatic scenes there. Inside, they found the doors barricaded with vending machines. Chairs and tables and windows were covered with newspaper. Police used flashbangs to clear the building. No reports of injuries. Any students who were inside are now facing expulsion. That's the decision for this private college. Authorities say the encampments that were once removed, only to return, are going away now for good this time. So there will be a big presence there as that is enforced. Police have been asked to stick around until at least May the 17th, two days after the school's graduation ceremonies. Earlier, a former faculty member, who's now a professor at a nearby law school, spoke about how that'll affect the mood on campus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXIS HOAG-FORDJOUR, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF LAW, BROOKLYN LAW SCHOOL: I don't think it's going to be a comfortable place to be for students. I don't think it's going to be a comfortable place for families to come. It's not, you know, for graduation and celebration. The climate is going to be chilled. It's going to be a different place to be at. And really what Columbia has done in bringing in the NYPD is to overwhelm the student population with just the sheer presence and numbers of force. Just being there is going to make a difference. I can imagine that students will still demonstrate in whatever way that they can. They feel very strongly about Columbia divesting from supporting what's going on in Gaza. And so I don't imagine that that will end. It might look a little different, but I think we're still going to see students demonstrating. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The NYPD say that they think about half of the protesters occupying Hamilton Hall were non-affiliates, what they're calling outside agitators. Since the arrest took place, and there were nearly 100 people arrested at Columbia, there has not been an official disclosure of how many students there were and how many outside people there were. People are going back and forth on this question.Video has circulated on social media of people climbing into windows on Columbia's campus last night when people occupied Hamilton. However, there has been an official university policy restricting access to campus to only Columbia affiliates. So technically, any outside agitators would have had to disobey university policy and sneak by the university-sanctioned public safety. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "They have a right to protest, but they don't have a right to trespass and take over buildings. What they were saying was not against the law. Where they were, that was against the law.It comes down to when does the university cease to be a university? When does it stop teaching students? When does it stop functioning? At that point, they've essentially killed the university, at least temporarily. And so it comes down to how the university wants to handle it, how the government wants to handle it. I was surprised that they came in so quickly. I'm not disappointed they came in so quickly, but usually there's some, as you say, there's some risk to that. And I think part of it might have been, Rosemary, that they had information, according to the chief of police and the mayor, that outside organizations were teaching them how to resist. And so once you occupy a location, you do things like run piano wire and guitar string across openings of door openings and things like that to where police can't move from room to room to room. And they put booby traps in. And I think the police probably thought we're dealing with groups who might be doing that kind of thing. And it takes time for that type of -- those type of obstacles to be in place. So they might have been thinking we can do it tonight and it's going to be 100 times easier than doing it a week from tonight. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

According to local media, the skirmishes erupted during dueling demonstrations between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters. We're hearing fireworks.These are the images you've got right now. There's a really sort of high sense of tension. Just before the break, we saw someone going forward to one of the protest groups and grabbing the barrier. Really tense situation. The L.A. Times reports the university had declared the pro-Palestinian encampment unlawful and said students who didn't leave risk suspension or expulsion. The Times also saying that counter-protesters tried to pull down the barricades around the encampment. This is happening right now in the heart of L.A., the United States' second largest metro area. We're going to speak to Paula Hancocks now, who's been reporting, of course, on the Middle East crisis, the tension between Palestinians and Israelis for some time now. And Paula, we're seeing this now transpose, or the tension at least, go to America. We've seen it build up, of course, across campuses in America. But this is the first time we're really seeing violence flare up.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, and this really speaks to the intense emotions that are being felt not just in America but around the world when it comes to what is happening at the moment in Gaza. Now, the protesters have been calling for the end of that war in Gaza. They've been calling for divestment of funds of anyone who is selling arms, for example, to Israel or involved in any companies that could be seen as supporting this war.And this is really bubbling over now, this particular protest here in UCLA, the pictures we're looking at. It's been a couple of hours that we have seen this intensification and violence spilling out. It's not just chanting now, it's not just anger, it's not just passions, but those passions are now spilling over into physical action. We have been seeing attempts to pull down some of those barricades, to pull down some of the encampments of the protesters themselves. And interestingly, Max, we haven't seen a police presence here over the last couple of hours. Now, I did just a minute ago see an image of a police car arriving. We don't know if they are now going to intervene. But certainly there hasn't been an intense police presence, despite this going on for one or two hours, this protest. But there is intense feeling among these students, and it really has been bubbling over. When you look at what is happening in Gaza, when you look at the death toll, you look at the desperate humanitarian crisis that is ongoing and the fact that still not enough humanitarian aid is getting into the Palestinian civilians who desperately need food, water, shelter and protection, of course. So this is really what we are seeing now, these feelings of passion bubbling over into what appears to be violence between the two separate camps. You have the pro-Palestinian camp and the pro-Israeli camp here on the UCLA campus -- Max.",

You have got the pro-Palestinian camp there on the right, surrounded by the barriers. Then you have got pro-Israeli protesters pulling at the barrier, effectively trying to evict them, because this is what the university has called for.But the optics of that and the microcosm that it sort of shines a light on is worrying, isn't it, in terms of tension?",

You had a huge amount of police turning up and making a huge show of force. This is a public university, and you probably expect the police and the authorities to be more on hand. They could be on their way, but there's a -- they'll be aware that this is on TV, and they're probably concerned about how they're going to play this and what they're going to get caught up with themselves.",

      "sentences": "Getting a sense of where UCLA and these protests sit within Los Angeles, of course a huge city, and we're seeing there people from the counter-protesters throwing into the encampment and also some things being thrown back. We also see that there's a -- when some of the counter-protesters go up and try and pull the barriers down, they're being sprayed with something.And I'm seeing on the LA Times that they're using pepper spray to defend themselves, some of the people within the camp. So potentially dangerous in itself. But at the moment, there are these very isolated moments of violence, as you could describe it, but these are counter- protesters trying to pull down the barriers, which is off the back of the message from the university, was that this camp needs to end because it's no good for the university and it isn't helping anyone. But they have effectively got this pro-Israeli group trying to get the barriers down and get this group broken up. And this is a worrying moment. And as Paula's been pointing out, we don't see any police there currently. It's not to say they don't have observers there and they're not ready to go, but we haven't seen any evidence of it yet. We're getting very little information from any of the authorities at the university or indeed the police. So it's difficult for us to tell you anything apart from just talk through these pictures that we're seeing, Paula. We've got one guy there who's really leading the charge, and he seems to be being forced back all the time when he's being sprayed, we presume, with pepper spray. The concern is, isn't it, Paula, that they decide to go in as a group harder and this is an encampment which is going to protect its position, it seems.",

And if you do have a number who are more forceful than others, there is always that fear of mob mentality, that there could be more violence than would ordinarily be the case. Now there does appear to be, it seems, some photographers there who are taking photos, so potentially some media coverage on the ground at this point as well, but we're not hearing exactly what is happening.You can see that individual is now speaking to the crowd, whether he's telling them to hold off, it's not clear. He, I don't think, was the one who was actually trying to pull down some of the barricades. So potentially you have someone there who's trying to defuse the situation. But again, we simply don't know without being able to see and hear. And then again, you can see the spray being used to drive some of the protesters back as they're trying to hit those barricades with sticks. And it's not a good situation. It's a very volatile situation. And again, you see that one individual in the middle potentially trying to defuse the situation, but we simply don't know.",
