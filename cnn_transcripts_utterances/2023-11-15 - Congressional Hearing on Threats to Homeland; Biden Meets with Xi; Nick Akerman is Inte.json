Thanks, guys, for coming in. Bonnie, the goal, just to keep these two sides talking. I don't think people are wrong to hear that and think, that's the expectation? It's that limited?

This morning I think we've been hearing news that of the potential outcome on agreement on climate change. We're likely to see a resumption of military-to-military ties. There also may be progress on the Chinese willingness to curb down on precursors that are supporting the trade in fentanyl. So, I think we might see more, but I - but the administration has been trying to keep expectations low.",

And you know what really strikes me is, when you think back about the meetings between Chinese and American leaders that had real substantiative elements to them, President Obama meeting with his Chinese counterpart in 2009 and basically setting up a way that the two countries were organizing their economic activity to pull the world out of what was at the moment a really, really scary recession. Work together on North Korea, where the Chinese were actually the host of the year's long talks about North Korea's nuclear program. Worked together on Iran, where the Chinese joined the Americans in containing the Iranian program.So, while the list that Bonny gave you was absolutely right, and I think we'll hear about those, and an interesting one on artificial intelligence and keeping it away from - from command and control of nuclear weapons, the opportunities here are pretty limited. The Chinese had made a commitment before on fentanyl in 2021 and didn't stick with it. We have had various moments where they have turned on and off military communications, yet when the balloon incident happened back at the beginning of the year, no one answered the phone, and so that led to a lot of the tensions there. So, the question is, how many of these are for sort of show and which ones stick? Even the environmental agreement that they reached with John Kerry, the special envoy on climate issues, does not include a commitment of any kind to cut back on their coal burning plants.",

I think one of the reasons President Xi Jinping is interested in coming to the United States now, in addition to the optics of better managing U.S.-China relations by meeting President Biden, I think he's probably also hoping that during this CEO dinner that he will have with a number of American business leaders, that he will be able to convince them to invest more in China.We know that China has seen declining foreign investment. And with the economic problems that China is facing at home, the - the -- it will be important for the Chinese leader to be able to go back to China and say, hey, this meeting not only helped project a more powerful China on the international stage, but now we are see -- going to see more investment, including from U.S. corporations, into China.",

If it's growing slowly, the administration is hoping they've got even more leverage and more time because China couldn't risk the sanctions.But these are very hard to predict because countries sometimes do things that are not in their immediate economic interests. Think Russia invading Ukraine, right? And the hope here is that if anything the economic slowdown will make Xi Jinping think twice about any military adventurism.",
