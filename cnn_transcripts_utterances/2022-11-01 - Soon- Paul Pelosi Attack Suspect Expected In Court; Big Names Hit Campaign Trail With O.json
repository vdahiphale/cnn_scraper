Now, Chief Tom Manger said a plan would add redundancies to the measures that are already in place for congressional leadership.

There's no -- nothing you need to prove beyond the physical acts in those cases, really. The federal charges are a little more complicated because those get into the issue of motive and intent. What was the reason behind the attack?And if you look at the federal complaint that was filed yesterday, the argument is this person, Mr. Pelosi, was targeted because he's an immediate family member of the speaker, and that the effort was one to try to intimidate or retaliate for Speaker Pelosi's politics. And so that's what makes this federal. Like you said, Bianna, there is not a double jeopardy problem here, so both of these prosecutions can proceed at the same time.",

However, a strange loophole, there's no crime that attaches to domestic terrorism on its own. Now, there have been various legislative proposals in the House and the Senate over the last few years to close that loophole to make it a crime, but they've not gotten through. So, there are various statutes -- laws that can be used here, like the assault, like the attempted kidnapping, it's a crime, for example, to intentionally target a place of mass transit, a subway, or something for political purposes. But domestic terrorism, as it's defined in the federal law is a sort of standalone definition without a crime attached.",

She seems to think or at least wants to convey to us that these negotiations are serious.I just can't see a scenario where Donald Trump would testify under oath, A., because we know Donald Trump. He has said many times before he wanted to testify in front of Mueller, they worked out this deal for a written agreement for written answers, which really ended up being meaningless.

How do we get on TV and a local news? It's good for that. I do think there'll be Republicans who didn't rage because they don't like Liz Cheney anymore. And so it may motivate them a little bit.

They don't pin that on the current administration in Florida. They pin that to Washington, to the Democratic Party. They're concerned about immigration. They're concerned about crime. Think about what's going on in our country right now. People are getting mugged. They're getting mugged on the city streets, but they're also getting mugged when they go to the grocery stores.
