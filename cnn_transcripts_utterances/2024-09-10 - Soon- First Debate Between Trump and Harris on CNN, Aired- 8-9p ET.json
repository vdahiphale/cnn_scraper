Now, the Trump campaign previewed as much this week, essentially, indicating that the former president would pursue those lines of attack against Harris on the debate stage and presented with that, Harris aides and allies expected the vice president is going to paint Trump as unserious and essentially describe his policies as unpopular. All of this to essentially avoid taking the bait. That includes one of those labels that the former president often uses for Harris calling her the border czar. Of course, the vice president was not tasked with border security, instead tapped to address root causes of migration. But she will be presenting that case on the debate stage today. All of this, Anderson, really boiling down to Harris flipping the script here and using Trump's own words and actions against him.",

So, it will be the first time the two candidates have ever met one another face to face. And they certainly will not be allowed to bring props or briefing papers. There also will not be opening statements. There will be closing statements. And because of a coin toss earlier this week, Donald Trump will have the final word here. But we also got a sense earlier today of what the stage actually looks like. This video from ABC News shows the podiums, first and foremost. Look how close they are. Six feet apart. This is very close range after these candidates have been sparring at long distance for so long. These clocks, perhaps one of the most important things here. The candidates have two minutes to speak. These clocks right here will count down and they are color coded as well. The rival will have two minutes to rebut. But finally, the microphones, this was the most contentious issue of all among the candidates. Should the microphones be muted or not? The agreed upon rule is when the rival is speaking, the person's microphone will be muted. So when the former president is speaking, vice president Harris' mic will be muted and vice versa. We will see if that actually happens or if we can hear the crosstalk between them or not. But after the debate, after that 90-minute debate, all of the advisers and supporters will come right here to the spin room. It's already getting pretty busy in here. We've seen several senators come in. We've seen RFK, Jr. just a couple of minutes ago come in. He of course, is supporting former President Donald Trump. But for all the talk of spinning this debate, what actually happens in the debate on the debate stage that is going to resonate with voters. So, yes this room will fill up.

Harris aides wanted the mics to be live and hot the entire time, they even tried to goad Trump into agreeing to it and they suggested that the Trump campaign were cowards for not going along with it. But eventually, the Harris campaign agreed to these terms. The mics will be muted. Here's the interesting scuttlebutt, though tonight, Anderson, we're here in the spin room at ABC News, there is talk that ABC producers may open up the mics if something really newsworthy happens, if something editorially significant happens, maybe the producers will in real time, make a change. ABC says no agreements have been made about that but it will be very curious. Also, there will be a small group of outside reporters inside this debate hall, so they'll be able to hear whatever happens between Trump and Harris. Even if television microphones don't pick it up.

What are his weaknesses, do you think?CHRIS WALLACE, CNN HOST \"WHO'S TALKING TO CHRIS WALLACE\": Well, I think his biggest strength is he doesn't talk like a politician. I remember taking part in the first debate that he participated in August of 2015 in Cleveland, a year before the Republican Convention. And there were, I think ten Republicans on the stage governors and senators and all kinds of people and he was there. And at one point he made that point that, you know, I don't talk like these politicians. I talk like a real person. And it was true because when you started hearing a number of the other people, you realize that he talked like somebody on the street, which I think made him much, much more accessible. There are no bounds to what he will say. One of the clips there was cut maybe censored before we got to it was when he got in a conversation with Marco Rubio in Detroit, and Marco Rubio was making fun of his having small hands and he proceeded to say, yeah, you know people think that's an indication of something. And let me tell you, there are no complaints. And so whatever you think is the bottom that he would go to. No, he would go further than that. If that's his strength, his weakness is a lack of discipline. And the fact that when he's told, you know, stick to this, don't do that. I'll give you just a quick example. I was talking to one of his top aides the other day, and I said what happens about if he is brought into a conversation about 2020? He said, he wants to talk about it and I can't say that he won't talk about it but he's been told that it's a bad idea to talk about it, and you should be forward facing, which to me basically meant we have -- it's his top aides. We have no idea whether if that gets into a conversation about re-litigating 2020, whether he'll do it or not.",

And he has slowed down himself in a lot of ways.He's not as quick on his feet. He doesn't talk like a politician, but it makes a lot less sense than even compared to four years ago. And that is part of the dynamic that will be much more pronounced on the stage tonight than it was with Biden, because of how Biden really, really struggled, Trump is struggling. He's struggling with putting sentences together with making points make sense. And he struggled at the debate that you all moderated.

Donald Trump has attacked her falsely saying that she didn't identify as Black until recently, and he reposted something on social media, a crude suggestion that she had exchanged sexual favors to get ahead in her career. There's been zero evidence for that, and it's disgusting, sleazy, slimy thing to say. I have to believe that his advisers are most worried of him going there.",

Or maybe it's not their known weakness, he can turn it into one against them.That is what he's going to try to do with Harris and her policy reversals on that debate stage tonight. And also just the fact that he has been on a presidential debate stage obviously, many more times than she has. That's what his team is counting on. But what Donald Trump is also about to do is be on a debate stage with a woman for the first time in eight years. And Donald Trump does have a woman problem when it comes to voters. His campaign is acutely aware of this. They look at the numbers, and when you look at single women and the deficit that he has with them, including in recent polls, those numbers have not changed, that's something that he's going to be dealing with on that debate stage tonight. And so, that is what really, when you talk to his aides and his allies about what they're the most concerned about tonight, is that that will resurrect itself on the debate stage, because she is going to be trying to get under his skin. I was at Trump tower on Friday, when he held a press conference just hours after appealing the E. Jean Carroll defamation and sexual abuse verdict. He essentially just ranted about it for over 60 minutes and you could see what a sensitive issue it is for him. Basically, making clear to the Harris campaign, this is something that she could use that she could invoke to get under his skin and may very well do so tonight.

You see the yellow, those are the seven toss up states plus Nebraska's second congressional district. Nebraska, like Maine, awards Electoral College votes based on congressional districts.I could go through a number of scenarios here. I'd be wasting your time in the sense that these states are so close. Donald Trump could win all those yellow states. Kamala Harris could win all those yellow states. They could split all those yellow states. So let me do it this way instead. The way the map is right now. Look how evenly matched they are. Deep red, solid Republican. Deep blue, solid Democrat. The lighter ones mean they're likely. 225 to 219 right now. The battleground states will decide this. Pennsylvania, where they are tonight, by the way, the biggest prize, 19 electoral votes right there. And I will say these three states right here, the so called blue wall, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, they have voted together in every presidential election since 2000. So if that happens again, that's an enormous advantage. Let me do it this way, instead of going through all the scenarios I could punch through states at a time. It is quite conceivable that Kamala Harris, with a strong debate tonight and a strong finish, could recreate this. Joe Biden's victory in 2020. That is possible. These states are so close, those battleground states, remember them here and across here, that that could happen. But equally plausible is this. Donald Trump recreating the map he had in 2016. That is why the stakes of this debate are so enormous as these two candidates go in. So I'll go back to this map, so it doesn't look like I'm taking sides. We'll put up the 270 map here, and we'll go through some of the dynamics heading into the debate tonight. To me, this is the most critical one. Advantage Trump, challenge for the Vice President. 76 percent of the American people, forgive me for turning my back, in the New York Times/Siena College poll over the weekend, think the economy is in fair or poor shape right now, economic conditions today. 76 percent say fair or poor. And so then you ask them, well who -- which candidate, which candidate do you trust more when it comes to the economy? And Donald Trump's advantage here, it's a lot of nostalgia, I can tell you from my travels, for the pre-COVID Trump economy. People remember that. All right, 55 percent say Donald Trump is better handled, better able of these two candidates to handle the economy. That's the Vice President's biggest challenge tonight -- to narrow that gap, to narrow that gap, to make herself more plausible when it comes to the economy. A couple other quick things I just want to bring into play here. This one is really interesting to me. These candidates enter this debate essentially as equals, not only in the polling, but what the American people think of them. 46 percent favorable, 46 percent favorable, 52 percent unfavorable, 51 percent unfavorable. Again, who can win this? Who can change minds? You should like me more. You should be open to my positions more. That's a huge challenge in the debate. They're so competitive that it's not just policy, it's what do people think of them as a person coming out of this debate. It's incredibly important there. Let me move that out of the way. I just want to show you one more thing. This is it, whether it's an advantage or whether it's a challenge, I'll leave to the smart strategists at the table. But people do know Donald Trump. Not that many people know much about any vice president. This is not a criticism of Kamala Harris. Do you need to know more about? Only 9 percent of likely voters say they need to know more about Donald Trump. So whether you're voting for him, whether you're against him, whether you're still undecided, you think you know him, except for 9 percent of the American people. There's an opportunity. It's also a challenge. Nearly 3 in 10 Americans, Anderson, say we need to know more about her. So she has a chance tonight to fill in that slate. Donald Trump also has, of course, the chance to fill it in for her.",

If you're -- let's start with Vice President Harris. Can you get to 270 without Pennsylvania? Yes, but you, you know, you'd have to win Michigan. You'd have to win Wisconsin. So then you're at 250.And so then what happens? You could recreate what Joe Biden did, right? Joe Biden flipped Georgia. Hadn't gotten Democrat in a very long time, built way back. And then you come out to Arizona. I hadn't gotten Democrat since Ross Perot was on the ballot. You could do it that way. The so called Sun Belt strategy. It is doable to do it that way. The question is, you know, these states, are they going to stay? Will they flips or blips? Nevada is a state where she's had trouble. So you can see it, you can do it without Pennsylvania. The problem is that's 19, right? So 19. The winner of those 19 gets a huge advantage. So let's flip it around the other way and come back here. Can Donald Trump get there without Pennsylvania? Well, if you're not winning Pennsylvania, Are you winning Michigan, and are you winning Wisconsin? That's an interesting question, right? So can Trump do that and not win Pennsylvania? North Carolina, you won it in the Obama campaign in 2008. Historic African-American turnout. It is in play. The demographics say the Democrats should be able to compete there. I will lean at Republican until proven otherwise, right? Until proven otherwise. It's available to Kamala Harris, but they have to do an enormously, almost perfect job in turning out voters. So can you get Trump? If Trump wins Michigan and Wisconsin, if he's not winning Pennsylvania, will he do that? I mean, a lot of people are going to say no. But there, you can get Trump there this way, you get him right there. You win North Carolina, you win Georgia, and you win those two. Now, if she wins the blue wall, so take these off, right? Let's just do this. If the Democrats hold those, Trump gets the Sun Belt, Trump gets here. This is where it gets really interesting. If Trump holds Arizona, 269 and 262. If Trump can win Nevada I'm not doing this to get people anxious, it could come down to one congressional district. Harris wins it, she's president. Trump wins it, it goes to the House, he's president, because Republicans control the House. Now, that scenario is most unlikely to happen.

This race was close in 2020, and it broke for Biden.And so, will they all break together? Who knows? There are different issues in different states. The different -- the economy matters differently, how the economy matters, inflation matters differently. But we have lived in a climate where we're in a very nationalized climate. The interesting part to me is can anybody do sort of a state by state like they used to do it in the old days? I don't see it. Which is why I think the state -- this debate is so important. If someone comes out of this debate with momentum heading into the end, it's huge. Just ending on your point about Pennsylvania, by leaps and bounds, tens of millions of dollars.

And then you come all the way over to the other side of the state and you come up here and you get to North Hampton County up here again. These are the swing counties, like, they're like this, right? They're like this. So what is key there? This is the key challenge, I think, for the Vice President tonight, in the sense that there are a lot of voters, more blue collar voters, people who work with their hands in these places, who remember the pre-Trump COVID economy. Democrats have had a problem with blue collar voters, high school educated voters. Can the Vice President convince these people she's a better steward for the economy? She'll stress tonight, we're told, her middle class upbringing. Try to contrast, I get the middle class, I get struggle, Donald Trump doesn't. We'll see if that works.
