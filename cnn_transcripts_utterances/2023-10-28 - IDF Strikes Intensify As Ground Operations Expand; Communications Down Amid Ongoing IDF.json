It is Saturday, October the 28th, 10After what Israel called to targeted raids over the previous two days, the IDF now says that it's expanding ground operations into Gaza. One hospital in Gaza city received 22 bodies through the intense overnight bombardment, along with hundreds of people injured. The Israeli strikes came exactly three weeks after Hamas mastered more than 1,400 people in southern Israel. More than 200 hostages are still being held by Hamas and Gaza. As you can see, in this new video, the strikes have continued into the daylight hours. Nearly all communication networks and Gaza, are reportedly out of service, and have been for many hours. CNN's Rafael Romo joins us from Tel Aviv. So, several things going on here, the immense amount of strikes, unprecedented probably, but also this communication blackout.",

They were not very specific as to when this was happening.But it appears based on all the signs that we have seen here, that that is the purpose, getting ready for what would be the large ground operation, that not only Prime Minister Netanyahu, but also his defense minister.

So I suspect that this is the start of the large-scale of assault. But I don't think they have very long for it.What surprises me most, I suppose, is that the Israeli air force are dropping, reported to have dropped more than 7,000 or 8,000 bombs over the last few, few weeks. That has caused significant damage to the buildings in the Gaza city, and north Gaza. So I would think about now, is about the right time for an idea of ground incursion. I would also ask, what is left now? Hamas is a fairly small organization, and that is an awful lot of bombs. There are issues about the war expanding from the north, and that would be tying up various ground forces in the north, as well, and economically speaking, the war is certainly damaging Israel. But the Israelis seem to be losing, or I wouldn't say losing interest, but becoming more, and more concerned about the possible casualties here. Hamas is assumed to be ready and waiting and wants the Israelis to advance and be attacked. Hamas cannot -- attack Israel very well apart from some relatively small warhead rockets. So they need the Israeli army to come forward, if you like, so they can score some pyrrhic victories, and die in some sort of hero -- some hero manner. The Israelis are mounting these raids, which are getting more intense, and the bombing last night, was very intense. It looks as though this is the prelude to the ground invasion. And as he just, said the domestic situation in Israel is turning against a full-scale invasion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The director general of the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry tells CNN that the hospital is used to treat patients only and they're not hiding anyone. Hamas also rejected the allegation calling on the U.N., and Arab, and Islamic countries to immediately intervene and stop the madness of bombing and destroying the medical system. [05Live now to Cairo, Dr. Mads Gilbert, the clinical director of emergency medicine at the University Hospital of North Norway. Thank you so much for joining us. What do you make of that briefing that we heard from the IDF suggesting that Al Shifa hospital, that you know is being used as a command center? DR. MADS GILBERT, CLINICAL DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY: Well, it's really yesterday's news, we have heard there since 2009. They had the same claims that, and also during the attacks in 2014. Same claims were raised by the Israeli army. I have been working in al Shifa since 2006, on and off, and during all of the latest incursions. I have been able to walk freely wherever I want in the hospital. I have been filming, picturing patients and staff. My camera has never been controlled. I have never, ever seen any signs, or any proofs, or any people belonging to political leadership in al-Shifa. So, these claims are reiterated again, and again, in order to validate, or justify attacks on the hospitals. We have seen a large number of hospital attacks, and primary health care clinics during the last three weeks. So the total capacity of the medical system is largely diminished, due to the bombing. They've also killed 101 medical staff. So these claims are, you know, not substantiated. As a medical doctor, I would never work in a hospital that was used for military purpose. The international organizations, like the International Red Cross, the UNRWA, all have stakes in al-Shifa hospital, the new medical complex that has been built has been checked, and controlled by international agencies. So, you know, I challenge the Israelis, show the proof. Currently the situation in al-Shifa is extremely precarious. They have hundreds of patients, and around actually, around 40,000 to 50,000 refugees have taken shelter in the hospital. In addition to the thousands of wounded and their families. They are lacking electricity, they're lacking water, they are lacking everything you need to run a hospital. So I don't know which word we are going to use now, because it is no longer a catastrophe it is a massive civilian, historical disaster what is going on now. And for the last three weeks, more than 3,000 Palestinian children have been killed during the bombardment. That is 1,000 Palestinian children a week. Imagine that some military organization would kill 1,000 U.S. kids a week? I mean there would be a reaction. (CROSSTALK)",

Also their supplies, to the extent that they house of lies. So losing your communication system, your mobile phone, your texting system is of course an extremely difficult thing, during such a massive patient -- as the Palestinian health care workers are facing now. That adds to the lack of fuel, the lack of electricity, the lack of water, and the lack of food. We know that the medical supplies are running short, running dry. They do not have anesthetic, they don't have suturing materials, bandages and so on. So it is impossible to even try to treat the thousands of wounded.

We have a very difficult situation on the ground, before last night's intensification.And there was a debate that was sparked by President Biden when he doubted, and he cast doubt on the death toll coming out of Gaza.

Near endless stream of funerals echoes throughout Gaza. And as Palestinians bury their loved ones, doubt is cast by the U.S. and Israel on the death toll being released by Hamas. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, no elections have been held since. The militant group is the political military power here.

And so, at this point, this now begins the next phase of the investigation for officers to figure out, okay, what led up to the actions that they say he carried out over the course of Wednesday night and why did this happen? So, that is one aspect of the investigation that continues. However, the main priority that everybody has been looking for of trying to locate this person is now over, it is a sigh of relief for many in this community, it's a sigh of relief for many of the leaders in this community as they laid out in their latest press conference. We also learned that they found the body at to 7:45 p.m. Eastern Time Friday night. It wasn't until hours later that they announced, what they said they were doing in the meantime was they were notifying the families of victims. They also said they notified the family of the suspect as well, the family, they said, had on the whole been cooperative throughout this entire process. And, while there are still more investigative work ahead, there is a lot more grieving ahead for many of the families here affected. At least 18 killed in total, but so many more lives shattered based on the lives that they touched and, as one resident told us, they are not just numbers, they are people. And it is those people that are going to live on in this community for much longer than this 48-hour manhunt. Omar Jimenez, CNN, Lewiston, Maine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
