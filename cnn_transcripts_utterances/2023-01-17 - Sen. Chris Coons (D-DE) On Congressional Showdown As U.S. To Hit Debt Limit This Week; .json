Defaulting would cause irreparable harm to the United States economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability. She's talking about you -- your money, your mortgage, your job, in addition to Wall Street and the global markets.And this warning comes ahead of what could potentially be the most bitter political fight we have seen yet on raising the debt ceiling. House Speaker McCarthy says he will not raise it without conditions. What does he want? Spending cuts, even though the debt limit is about money already spent -- not new spending. So let's talk about this and a lot more with Democrat senator from Delaware, Chris Coons. He is in beautiful Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. Of course, you're there to have these discussions, Senator, about the economy, but also to keep a light shining on the war in Ukraine. So thank you for your time this morning. And let's begin with the debt ceiling. Here is the position of the White House on what McCarthy is saying. Let's play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We will not be doing any negotiation over the debt ceiling. It is one of the basic items that Congress has to deal with and it should be done without conditions. So there is going to be -- there is going to be no negotiating over it. This is something that must get done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Poppy, this puts us at real risk. In the next six months, at some point, Treasury Sec. Yellen will run out of those extraordinary measures and our bill comes due. And for us to even come close to defaulting on paying America's national debt I think would be reckless and irresponsible. I agree with the White House that we shouldn't be negotiating over paying bills that we have already incurred. So, raising the debt ceiling, as you know -- as you said in the opening there, is simply paying for things that have already been spent. So, federal investments in our defense, in housing, in education, in infrastructure. We can and should have a robust debate about spending going forward if that's what the new House majority would like, but to threaten to not pay America's debts would put all of us at risk.",

She and her colleagues came up with a different measure, which is using dexamethasone. So, dexamethasone is a steroid that's used to treat cases of severe COVID. And she and her colleagues found that in cases of hospitalizations that do not involve dexamethasone, it's very unlikely that the primary cause is COVID. And so, the state of Massachusetts actually turned to use this measure. So they're reporting both the total hospitalizations with COVID as well as the total hospitalizations with dexamethasone, which are the hospitalizations for which COVID is the primary cause. And they found that about 30 percent of the current hospitalizations are actually for COVID as opposed to 70 percent with COVID. So I think that's the kind of distinction that we need to be making that helps hospitals better gauge what's going on in their own system and it allows people to understand their own risks a lot better, too.",

There is a way for us to look at death certificates and also to look at the medical records of individuals prior to their death. And I think this needs to be separated into three categories.One is the COVID as a direct contributor -- the primary cause of death. The second is could it be a secondary contributing cause. So, for example, somebody with kidney disease. COVID then pushes them over the edge to have kidney failure. That's COVID as a contributing cause. And then, the third is COVID as an incidental finding. So, somebody coming in with a gunshot wound or a heart attack and they happen to test positive. I think that we need to separate out and look at the percentages of each. That percentage would have shifted over time as well. In the beginning, probably a lot more people were dying with a primary cause of COVID. That probably has shifted. And I think, again, we need to understand this. Another reason to understand this, too, is a lot of people are wondering when they should get a booster next. When do we need a second booster or another booster?

If we find that the people who are getting severely ill are all individuals with certain underlying medical conditions but not others, that allows us to better advise those individuals to take special precautions.By the way, none of this is to minimize the risk of COVID. There are still so many millions of Americans who are severely immunocompromised, who have chronic underlying medical conditions who really desperately need better vaccines and better treatments. I'm saying that we need to have better data so as to -- so as to focus our attention on these people who are truly vulnerable and allow others who have put their lives on hold to maybe resume a lot of things that they might be too scared to do at the moment.",

That vaccines are very effective, they're very safe, and vulnerable groups, including pregnant women -- pregnant individuals should be getting vaccinated.
