Huge crowds packing the streets there to pay their final respects to the late president, Ebrahim Raisi. Right now, the funeral procession is heading towards Freedom Square. The ceremony is part of Raisi's days-long funeral event. The country's foreign minister and seven others were also killed in the helicopter crash this weekend. They're being honored too. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers earlier. Offices are closed today and a public holiday is being observed for the day of mourning. Now, the capital is just the latest stop in the funeral ceremonies that began on Tuesday in the northwest city of Tabriz. They will conclude on Thursday night in Mashhad, where Raisi is set to be buried. CNN's senior international correspondent, Fred Pleitgen, joins us live from Tehran -- Fred.",

I would say hundreds of thousands of people that we saw obviously following those caskets of Ebrahim Raisi, but also of the others who were killed in that air crash. Among them, of course, also the foreign minister of this country, Hossein Amir Abdollahian. It certainly was a great deal of grief that was very publicly shown. But I think you can also see behind me that in general by the government, there has been a big effort to make sure that all the mourning that takes place in this country is very public and is very large. The kind of billboards that you see behind me have sprung up across the city in the last two and a half days since the air crash happened. And also while we were inside that procession, which was an extremely large crowd, we saw a lot of people with posters also commemorating those who were killed. And the people that you speak to obviously say that they are in mourning, that many of them are in shock about the death of the president and also the foreign minister and of course of the others who were on a helicopter as well. But many of them, of course, also now also looking forward. One of the interesting things that we saw today was that the Supreme Leader of this country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he led the prayers for the funeral procession. And he then also before that said that while the country is mourning the president and the foreign minister, that at the same time there will not be a disruption in the government. And that's certainly something that those in power here are definitely trying to portray also at events like the one that we've seen unfold here today.",

You know, it seems pretty implausible that you would have many Western countries supporting the ICC decision a few years ago.Now you have the likes of Belgium and France saying that they support the ICC's independence. And even Western countries that, you know, took issue with the equating of Israel and Hamas have said, look, yes, we support the court's independence, sort of a tacit approval of what has gone on here. And so we have seen bits of, you know, European resistance in going along with what the Israelis are doing. Many of them have already cut off weapons shipments. In fact, not long ago, it was the Spanish who actually rejected a request for a ship carrying arms bound for Israel to even dock in its port. So, yes, this is in some ways symbolic, but perhaps it could also be the catalyst for other countries to follow suit -- Max.",

Meanwhile, Trump's team called just two witnesses with about two hours of testimony. The majority of that time came from former adviser to Trump's ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, Robert Costello.

Once the judge gives them the instructions, they'll also get their verdict form. They will then go back into a room, and this is the first time that the 12 jurors are going to be allowed to talk to each other about the case and about the evidence and about how to go about reaching a decision and see if they can reach a decision.
