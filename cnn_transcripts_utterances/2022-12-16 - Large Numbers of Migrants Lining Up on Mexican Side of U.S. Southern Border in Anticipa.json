They have been released from Border Patrol custody at different points, so they congregate around the bus stations as a safe gathering point for them.But this is what they've been dealing with in frigid temperatures. As we've been reporting, the shelters overcapacity, Border Patrol processing centers overcapacity as well. So this has been a great concern.
