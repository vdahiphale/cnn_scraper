What we're seeing is overlapping failures that compounded the situation and worsened it as time went on. I mean, we're hearing reports that the shooter was up on the roof for anywhere for two to three minutes, potentially. I mean, that is alarming to hear. However, if the law enforcement officers or the Secret Service were actually covering that roof, that would not have been a problem.So I think when we start laying out the timeline of when this threat or suspicious individual that then transcended into a threat, as that timeline really starts to codify, we understand what that pre-attack behavior actually was, we're going to find more either communication errors, breakdowns, or just a misunderstanding of what their role and responsibility was in the overarching security plan.",

President Biden speaks from the Oval Office for the first time since giving way to Vice President Harris.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to Congress today. Why dozens of lawmakers say they will skip the address. And this morning the director of the FBI testifies before lawmakers as new bodycam video shows the moments immediately after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner and Kate Baldwin. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. BOLDUAN:  And breaking overnight, a bullish new campaign memo fresh off the presses from Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign. How her campaign operation now plans to go about defeating Donald Trump. The campaign looking beyond the blue wall, the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, which was seen as really the only and very narrow path to victory for Joe Biden. Harris's campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, saying in a campaign is not only going on offense there, but also re-expanding the map to what she calls an expanded universe of swing voters, a universe she argues is now opened up with Harris at the top. At the same time, President Biden is preparing for an address to the nation that will echo through history, an Oval Office address explaining why he is not seeking reelection, and also laying out in his words what lies ahead. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. She's joining us now. Arlette, let's focus in on this new -- the new moves by the Harris campaign. What more are you learning about what their strategy is in this moment?",

Dozens of Democrats in both the House and the Senate have said they're not going to be there for the speech, protesting the ongoing war because of its heavy civilian casualties in Gaza, and, of course, the humanitarian crisis that it has caused.CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox joining us now. Lauren, what can you tell us about, you've got this schism where you've got all these Democrats that are saying we're not going to be there.

And I think one of the messages you are going to be seeing that a lot of members are looking for today is what is Netanyahu's path forward? Many lawmakers who I've been speaking to on both sides of the aisle among Republicans and Democrats want to see a clear explanation for how this war begins to come to an end as well as how Benjamin Netanyahu plans to try and get the remaining hostages back home to their families. That was something that I heard from Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee last night when we were discussing what she hoped to hear.As you mentioned, there are dozens of Democrats in the House and a handful in the Senate who planned not to attend this speech at all. Notably Senator Patty Murray, who could have been presiding over the speech, will not be attending today. Instead, Senator Ben Cardin, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will preside over this address. There's also going to be counterprogramming for many members, including Pramila Jayapal, the leader of the House Progressive Caucus, who said in a statement, quote, \"Instead of attending Netanyahu's address, I will attend a panel discussion led by the Center for American Progress and other organizations on the path to peace. This event will feature a Palestinian leader, a Jewish Israeli leader, and a former IDF soldier, all of whom are dedicated to finding a path toward peace and security.\" And last night in the leadup to this joint meeting of Congress, you saw a number of Democrats go to the floor and express some of their concerns about Netanyahu's policies and his leadership over the last several months. Here's one, Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JACK REED (D-RI):  Mr. Netanyahu and his government have failed to develop an exit strategy for Gaza. They have no plan for a sustainable future for the Palestinians, and no plan to establish security and rebuild Gaza's destroyed. With Prime Minister Netanyahu in Washington this week, I am again compelled to say that the Israeli government must change its path. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
