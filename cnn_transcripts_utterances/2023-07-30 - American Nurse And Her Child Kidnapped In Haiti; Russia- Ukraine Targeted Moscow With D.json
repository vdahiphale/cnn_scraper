Very bright.All right, I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Good to see you. We begin this hour with the overseas kidnapping of an American nurse and her child, Alix Dorsainvil, who was reportedly abducted Thursday morning while serving in their community ministry in Haiti. The two were taken from the organization's campus near Port-au-Prince according to El Roi, Haiti's website. Dorsainvil is married to the director of the Christian humanitarian aid group. CNN's Paula Newton is following this story for us and has details on this alleged abduction.",

      "sentences": "So the charity, El Roi did, in fact, confirm the abduction and the details are quite disturbing. Remember, this is a nurse from New Hampshire. She was in Haiti working for the charity, El Roi, she was abducted along with her child, and this was actually on what they call is the campus of this charity close to Port-au-Prince.Now they announced this abduction on their website El Roi, and in a statement, they say that \"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home, the Haitian people, her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus.\" Now, US officials say that they are aware of this abduction and the statement to CNN also said that the US State Department and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas. It is interesting here that the US had already asked for all Americans to leave Haiti. They made that call again on Thursday on the day that this nurse and her child were abducted. But also, they made it seem as if it was much more urgent for Americans to leave, and that is because they also evacuated non- emergency personnel that worked for the US government there from Haiti. Now, this is unfortunately a state of terror that so many Haitians live in day after day. Many people are released sometimes for no reason, sometimes for ransom, but clearly, this is a dangerous situation for this family and the charity at this hour, saying that they are asking for everybody's prayers, and they are also asking for privacy.",

GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, FOUNDER AND EDITOR, \"THE HAITIAN TIMES\": Well, Fredricka, they have been happening for quite some time now. I think what's happening is that they feel that, the gang leaders, they feel that their days are numbered.

You know, how do you strike that balance? Where are you on this?PIERRE-PIERRE: Well, you know, as you say, it is really tugging at everyone's heart. At the same time, we want to see Haiti restore some sort of normalcy, and at the same time, it's dangerous. We have friends that have been kidnapped, colleagues that have been kidnapped. Our staff in Haiti had -- one of our reporters had to flee her neighborhood because it was dangerous.

Here in Zaporizhzhia, we've heard the sirens during the day in the last 24 hours. Two dead, two injured from a Russian barrage against a residential area here and north of where I'm standing, in Sumy near the Russian border, two dead and 20 injured from another Russian barrage against a school, a high rise, and dormitories as well. Russia continually pounding civilian areas over the past months, possibly because they think they're trying to hit military targets or possibly because they simply don't care and want to sow panic. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy painting today to point out progress of their counteroffensive in the east, slower progress more gradual in the south, and also saying how the strikes against Moscow were a sign that the war is gradually returning to Russian territory.  To point out Ukraine, like often with cases of attacks against Russians mainland has not directly claimed responsibility, but their Air Force quite obliquely said there's always something flying in the sky around Russia and the tranquility of its backwaters was very much now in question. So a psychological impact certainly, but the broader thrust of Ukraine here in the south about trying to break the Crimean peninsula away from the Russian mainland, that's occupied parts of Ukraine, slower progress but a lot of pressure certainly because the NATO suppliers of weaponry, the West surly wants to see some kind of change in the battlefield before winter sets in -- Fredricka.",

I think it is a bad habit that our FBI and DOJ have gotten into, intervening and creating crimes that would not have existed, but for their action.

You may be thinking why does the coral reef matter so much to us? Well, they are part of an interconnected ecosystem. It acts as habitat for marine wildlife, so any impact on the coral will have an impact on the entire water ecosystem, and something a lot of people may not realize, it is not just ocean life that relies on our coral reefs being healthy.
