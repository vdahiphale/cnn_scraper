We just learned that the Manhattan grand jury hearing evidence in the Donald Trump hush money case will not meet today. That is a big development given they were expected to meet today and could vote soon to indict the former President.As that plays out, we have new movement in the Justice Department's probe into Trump's mishandling of classified documents. A federal appeals court is now weighing whether to force a Trump lawyer to testify, after sources say a lower court judge has seen compelling evidence that Trump used the attorney to help further a crime. We're covering every angle of all of these fast-moving developments. And I want to start with CNN's Kara Scannell, who is outside of the Manhattan DA's office. Kara, what more are we learning about this grand jury in Manhattan not meeting today?",

They have met on Monday, Wednesdays and Thursday afternoons, according to our reporting. They just had heard testimony on Monday from Bob Costello, who was a witness at the request of the Trump attorneys. They wanted him to go in because he said he was going to provide contradictory testimony to Michael Cohen.Now, Cohen has gone in twice before this grand jury and is one of the key witnesses in the government's case here because he is the person who had made these payments and was reimbursed by the former president. Now, sources tell us that the DA's office is regrouping following that testimony on Monday. You'll recall, Cohen was on standby, but Costello's testimony went until the end of the day. He was there to be a potential rebuttal witness, but he wasn't called. And source tells -- sources tell our colleagues that in the last 24 hours, the DA's office has reached out to an attorney for one witness, saying they may want that person to appear again for testimony before the grand jury.

But there's been a very significant lead up to where we are right now in this court fight. There was a trial judge that looked at the Justice Department's argument saying that they really needed to get in before the grand jury again, Evan Corcoran, Donald Trump's Defense Attorney because they believed that conversations that Corcoran had with Trump would show that Trump was trying to break the law somehow.So very significant conversations they're trying to get testimony about. We know now, too, that the Trump side has rushed to the appeals court to try and get Corcoran not having to go into the grand jury right away. That's before three appellate judges at the D.C. circuit right now. All Democratic appointees, Nina Pillard, Michelle Childs, Florence Pan. They haven't decided yet today, but they put things on a very tight schedule, demanding within hours, the Justice Department respond about what to do next. They haven't come out and said exactly yet whether they're going to have Corcoran testify. But we also know that this is significant just because of the history here. This is a lawyer who was beside Donald Trump throughout the entire classified documents probe and talking to the Justice Department at a time where they were saying, there's no more documents here. He was talking to Donald Trump. And at the -- at the end of the day, there were additional documents at Mar-a-Lago. Brianna?",

He is a former Federal Prosecutor. And we have Ambassador Norm Eisen. He was special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee in Trump's first impeachment trial. Renato, to you first.

You know, I have been practicing criminal law for around 20 years or so, and I have never seen a prosecutor invoke the crime fraud exception to the attorney client privilege, much less obtain a ruling from a federal judge. And this is not the first time that that has happened to former President Trump, very significant. And here you have an attorney who potentially has his own liability. This is an attorney that allegedly caused false statements to be made to the Justice Department. That is a federal crime.And so I could see reasons why that attorney may cooperate with the Justice Department against the former president. So a lot of danger for the former president, in many ways, something he should be more concerned about than this Manhattan case that we've been talking so much about.",

So this is significant.I think Trump does have greater peril on the federal side from the Mar-a-Lago documents case, where there seems to be such strong evidence that he intentionally withheld these documents, maybe even deceived his own attorneys more than the federal January 6 crimes. But I have to disagree with my friend, Renato, the Manhattan DA investigation is just as serious. You have a potential felony there for falsifying financial records and for campaign prosecutions, campaign finance violations, and New York has prosecuted that before, Brianna. There's nothing novel about it. The Clarence Norman case, it's been done around the country as well. That is also a great jeopardy to Donald Trump.",

So first of all, what we're seeing in Manhattan, I think based upon what's reported, because obviously we haven't seen the charges yet, we don't know exactly what they look like and what the evidence is. But based on what's been reported, Brianna, I think there are significant questions about that case. I disagree with norm. I have great respect for regarding how novel some of the potential charges are there, the reported charges are there. I think there are also factual issues there that are challenging, like the reliance on Michael Cohen's testimony and so on.I also just think, as a practical matter, the likely sentence in that matter is going to be less than it would be in federal court. And I think the jeopardy that comes from having the United States Justice Department interviewing your attorney and the grand jury about matters in which you not only withheld top secret classified documents that you knew existed, but also potentially obstructed justice, lied to law enforcement. I just think that the jeopardy there is more significant.",

And we have filings in the district court and now in the appellate court that are all under seal, it's possible that Corcoran has gotten immunity. He may have his own exposure. There is a law that would allow prosecutors to immunize him so he can't assert the Fifth Amendment and testify.I just don't think we know if he's a cooperator or not. But by piercing the attorney client privilege, they not only get his testimony, they can get documents, records that can corroborate what happened.",

We have Ron Brownstein, Senior Editor for The Atlantic.OK, so, Ron, when asked if an indictment in the hush money case could help Trump politically, west Virginia moderate Senator Joe Manchin said, it just emboldens him. He's the type of person that sometimes -- that's sometimes emboldened by more outrageous things. There's many reasons not to be for him. And I think that when the court system is perceived to be used for something different, it could have a completely reverse effect. What do you think about that? And what do you think about, politically, what this does for Trump?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think there are issues about what this does for Trump and also what it does for the party. Thinking about the Republican primary, I think it furthers the divide that we see. I talked to a number of Republican strategists this week. There's no question that for a portion of Trump's base, this will be a galvanizing event. This will be proof of his frequent argument that they, the establishment, are going after me because they really want to silence you.But there is also, Brianna, a significant piece of the party, especially after 2022, that is worried that he cannot win again. And for those voters and donors and strategists, I think this is confirming information. It's sort of a mix. So I think this will reinforce both sides of the Republican divide. The biggest political impact, I think, of what we have seen so far is that it has further stamped the House Republican Party as essentially remaining subservient to Trump. They are going to extraordinary, unprecedented lengths to try to intimidate and interfere with this investigation. And sending voters a very clear signal that if Trump is returned to power, their posture will be the same as it was when he was in power the first time. Maybe even more so in terms of a willingness to defend him from consequences for almost any of his actions. So I think that is a very clear message in the Republican primary, I think it furthers the divide which is emerging about Trump himself.",

I do think the challenge for Republicans is that they have now put a stake in the ground that they will go to these extraordinary, unprecedented lengths to try to interfere in this investigation if this is what they will do over the Manhattan investigation, what Scott calls a seven- year-old paperwork mistake.Norm Eisen obviously thinks and others think is more significant than that. But if this is what they will do over Manhattan, what's coming when these further investigations reach fruition? I mean, the House Republicans are going to be in a position of whack-a-mole, where they are going to try to discredit every investigation as a political hit job. And it really raises the question for the other Republicans in the presidential field because Donald Trump is the biggest figure in the Republican Party. I mean, right now he is polling at about the level he did in 2016 when he won with about 41%, 40% support. He's winning support for about half of Republicans without a college degree. Again, exactly what he did in 2016. If you want to displace him, you have to give her voters an explicit reason why. And you see DeSantis kind of tiptoeing, you know, basically trying to have it both ways, criticizing the DA, but jabbing Trump over his conduct. That exemplifies his strategy of offering Trumpism without Trump. I'll fight the same fights that he does. I'll fight these liberal DAs, but I want to have all the personal baggage. I do think that ultimately, if you're going to be Donald Trump, you're going to have to give voters a more explicit reason in the primaries than his opponents have been willing to do so far.",

They were school administrators.At this point, the weapon has not been recovered. That male student, the accused shooter, has not been put into custody yet. So there is an intense manhunt right now surrounding the school and, you know, throughout Denver searching for this alleged assailant. As they move forward, Denver police are going to be contacting as many people as they can to find out as much information as they can about how the student obtained the gun. Who may have seen this shooting incident. Brianna, I can tell you that it just so happened that inside the school on another -- for another reason, paramedics happened to be inside. So fortunately, they were able to rush outside or rush to the faculty rather, and administer life-saving aid within seconds, Brianna, just by sheer luck. So those faculty members being transported to the hospital. We don't yet know their condition.

And when -- you know, I worked in Denver, this is a state, this is a city that is just all too familiar with shootings at schools. It rocks you.

The suspect fled the school, according to the police chief. And like you said, the search for him is still underway.

But, you know, it does raise questions. If you know that someone presents a dangerous threat, why is this person allowed to continue to go back to school? And those are the questions. And that's the balancing act that Denver Public Schools are going to have to face. Denver police are going to be questioning as well.
