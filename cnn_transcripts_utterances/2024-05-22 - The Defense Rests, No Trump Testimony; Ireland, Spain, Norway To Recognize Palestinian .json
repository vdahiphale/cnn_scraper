So, look, no one is surprised or you shouldn't be surprised that Donald Trump decided not to testify in his own defense although I guess you could be forgiven for thinking that he would considering what he has said about it in the past. Watch. Do we have that? We might not have that. We're just looking for all the times. He said that he would not testify or that he would testify in his own defense, which were many but ultimately, he wouldn't actually answer questions about why he wouldn't testify in this case.

He was out there doing some local interviews. As we reported there, he's going to be fundraising. Obviously, one of the major issues on the trail this cycle has been abortion rights in the fall of Roe versus Wade. And one thing Democrats have warned or tried to emphasize is that they believe that there may be Republicans who try to interfere with people's ability to get contraception, right, which is of course different from the abortion pill, different from some of the other things that we talk about here. Much, much farther down the line, I guess you could say. And Donald Trump was asked by a reporter that Trump was talking to whether or not he would restrict contraception.

The prime ministers of Ireland, Spain, and Norway plan to formally recognize Palestinian statehood later this month.While this move is purely symbolic, it's straining relations with Israel. Israel's foreign minister quickly responded by recalling their ambassadors, writing this: Ireland and Norway intend to send a message to the Palestinians and the whole world today. Terrorism pays. After the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has been, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state. Joining me now is CNN's Max Foster. Max, good morning coming to you. So less than half of E.U. countries recognize Palestinian statehood. Most are Eastern European countries.

And it was -- they're all saying in response to what they're seeing in Gaza.So maybe they wouldn't be you doing this if it wasn't at this time, if it wasn't what happened in Gaza and its pretty clear that they're trying to build some momentum here, trying to get other countries to follow suit. So, obvious countries to look to are the United Kingdom and then that obviously raises questions about the United States who have been talking about a two-state solution, but not statehood. So it does put the us in a difficult position to really clarify themselves on that because some people see it as contradictory, but of course this is absolutely against what Israel, the current government there stands for. And I think there'll be some people in the U.S. would argue actually working towards a two-state solution. Ultimately, this might just get in the way.",
