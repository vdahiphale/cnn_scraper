A remote operated vehicle is searching the sea floor for the submersible lost as it headed to the Titanic. The Horizon Arctic arriving at the search site and deploying a remote operated vehicle early this morning. Also headed to the site, the Magellan Remote Operated Vehicle, which has been to the site of the Titanic more than any other such vehicle.CNN's Tom Foreman joins us now. Tom, can you tell me a little bit more about these assets and if researchers really have all the things they need to rescue these folks that are stuck in this submersible?",

Now, Modi is highly popular in India. He's also a controversial figure. Actually denied entry to the United States back in 2005 for his alleged role in anti-Muslim violence there that killed more than a thousand people in India.Up until today, President Biden has hosted just two other state visits since he took office, one for the French leader and also South Korea. Biden sees India as perhaps the most strategically important partner for the United States in the 21st century. CNN's Arlette Saenz, she has more from the White House. Arlette, what is the White House hoping to get out of this visit?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden is really navigating a fraught situation. On the one hand, as you outlined, there are concerns over Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's human rights record, as well as this drift towards authoritarianism that has been seen in his government.But on the other hand, the president and the White House really view India as a key strategic partner in their overall Asia policy, especially when you think about Russia and China and the influence that they have had in the region. And so that is why the White House says the president has invited Modi here to the White House for this state visit, even as he is facing criticism for hosting such a lavish affair for Modi. Now, it's about to kick off in about 30 minutes when Modi arrives there for this arrival ceremony on the South Lawn. They will have Oval Office meetings, as well as a state dinner later this evening. They're expected to make some key announcements in defense and technology areas, and that includes India purchasing some drones, as well as this agreement to have G.E. manufacturer engines for India's military aircraft in India. There's also some initiatives when it comes to visas and semiconductor manufacturing. But one of the key moments that will be watched this afternoon is when the two men stand before the press to take questions. We did not know up until yesterday whether that would, in fact, happen. There were some very delicate and lengthy negotiations with Indian officials initially balking at the idea of a news conference. But they have settled on having one with each side getting one question. So that would be something that people are really watching this afternoon.",

And a lot of western equipment headed Ukraine's way to give it what it needed. But, early on at least, the expectations not being met really on any front in the combination of things, Ukrainian forces having trouble breaching Russian defenses and Russian forces proving more competent in many ways than expected.What western assessments are seeing is that as Ukrainians forces try to breach those Russian defensive lines, they're running into literal minefields, but also the Russian forces have had success using missiles against Ukrainian armored columns, also doing a better job of coordinating with Russian air power, which is something that U.S. officials, western officials, had not seen early in this campaign. Now, it is early. Western officials remain optimistic going forward. But, at least in these early stages, they're not making the progress that was expected.",

He faces really strong charges of espionage, which, of course, he denies. Charges \"The Wall Street Journal\" calls outrageous.CNN's Nic Robertson is live in London with the latest.

They said he seemed a bit agitated, a bit nervous. The U.S. ambassador, Lynne Tracy, was also able to enter the courtroom today. She said he was showing remarkable resiliency. His family, his parents, Ella and Mikhail, actually were able to speak to him during a break in the courtroom sessions. Perhaps that lifted his spirits a bit.But the reality here is that the U.S. is not getting the access it wants. The ambassador said three times Russia has knocked back requests for consular access to Evan. And he, the ambassador said when she came out of the courtroom, he continues to be wrongfully held. Just a journalist, just doing his job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: The charges against him are baseless. He is an innocent journalist who was carrying out journalistic activities, and has been wrongfully detained. Such hostage diplomacy is unacceptable. And we call on the Russian federation to release him, as well as Paul Whelan, another U.S. citizen who has been wrongfully detained. And we call for that release to occur immediately. ((END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTSON: And I think perhaps the day's proceedings were summed up mostly by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" who said, look, this was not unexpected, this outcome, but it is, nevertheless, absolutely outrageous. The point, he is a journalist and he was practicing journalism, not espionage. Trumped up charges.",
