Joe Biden won by 7 million votes last time, but really by the margin of 44,000 votes in the three closest states. And that's how presidential races are run. Forty-four states are going to watch this year in six states are going to determine who the president of the United States is going to be.And, yes, I think right now in polling, on the average, he is, you know, even or a little less than even in a lot of these states. Some states he's trailing. In those six states. And that is going to be the focus of the campaign. And there will be a lot of data analytics and a lot of focus on how to prioritize those states and how to prioritize resources and how to prioritize where the focus should be. One thing I want to add, by the way, to my last answer to Kate. One thing you do when your quarterback maybe can throw as far as he used to, maybe can scramble quite as well but has a lot of experiences, you use your supporting cast.
