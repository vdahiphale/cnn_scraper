A source tells CNN that Trump's lawyers have changed their strategy. They are now planning a longer cross-examination of Daniels in their attempts to protect Trump's reputation after she provided lurid details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump -- an encounter that she seemed to suggest was not entirely consensual. Daniels told prosecutors on Tuesday that after agreeing to have dinner with Trump he greeted her at his hotel room in satin or silk pajamas. Daniels testifying that she asked Trump \"Does Mr. Hefner know you stole his pajamas?\" And later, after Daniels went to the bathroom, Trump -- she came out to find Trump on the bed between her and the exit, wearing just a t- shirt and boxer shorts. Daniels testifying that although she was not threatened by Trump his blocking the door made her aware of what she called an \"imbalance of power.\" Daniels also detailed an incident with a magazine that she had previously disclosed to Anderson Cooper back in 2018.

He is trying to obviously contrast his record with Donald Trump's. But the reality, at the end of the day, is that he is president and people simply don't seem to feel about the economy the way he claims they should, basically, by saying well, actually, I have saved the economy. How do you see this playing right now? And I know he was in Wisconsin. You focus a lot on Nevada. Nevada is possibly, like, the prime example of how the economy and inflation, et cetera are going to affect what we see come November. GABBY BIRENBAUM, D.C. CORRESPONDENT, THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT:  Yeah. I mean, people like to say if the U.S. economy sneezes, Nevada catches a cold because it's such an economy based on tourism and people having that money in their pocket. And I think this is something -- when I talk to economists in Nevada, they'll tell me it never has the economy been so good and we've felt so bad about it. And I think that's because there's this disconnect between job creation, which is really positive, wage growth. Unemployment is low  although, in Nevada, it still lags most other states.

Well, Jalen Brunson channeling his inner Willis Reed last night. So, Brunson would leave the game here in the first quarter with a foot injury. He did not play at all in the second quarter, leaving Knicks fans very worried. But Brunson would emerge from the locker room at halftime, getting a big roar from the Madison Square Garden crowd. The Knicks were down 10 at the half, but with Brunson back, they'd go on a 14-0 run in the third quarter. And in the final minutes, Brunson just coming through in the clutch like he's done all playoffs long. He scored 24 of his 29 points in the second half. Knicks win 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in the series. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
