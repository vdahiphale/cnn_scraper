It is all part of the sweeping indictment against the former president and his allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. There, you see a key architect of that scheme, the lawyer John Eastman, leaving the jail this morning. In about 48 hours, Trump himself is expected to surrender there. Thursday will mark his fourth booking on criminal charges. The remaining defendants have until Friday at noon to surrender.And now one of them accused of leading the fake electors scheme in Georgia says he was acting at the direction of the 45th president. CNN's Zachary Cohen is outside the Fulton County Jail. Katelyn Polantz is outside the courthouse. Zach, first, who has surrendered? We should note it's a temporary surrender under the agreements they have negotiated with their lawyers. Who has surrendered and what happens actually when they're booked, as it's known? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  Yes, Jim, right now we know of two co-defendants, two of former President Donald Trump's co- defendants, who have surrendered here at the Fulton County Jail, which is right behind me. One of them is a local bail bondsman. His name is Scott Hall. He's charged with several crimes as part of this sprawling indictment, including crimes related to his alleged role in the breach of voting systems in Coffee County, Georgia, a rural Georgia county about 200 miles south of here. The second person we know who's turned themselves in today is conservative attorney John Eastman. As you mentioned in the lead-in, John Eastman is described in this indictment as one of the architects of the broader effort to overturn the 2020 election. We know John Eastman went in around 10:20 this morning. And we saw him leaving just before noon, so he was in there for a little under two hours. He told us that he was fingerprinted. He took a mug shot. He was searched. And he was treated really like any other defendant that comes here to turn themselves in at the Fulton County Jail. And maybe we're starting to see a pattern established here that the defendants who are turning themselves in as part of this Trump case are being treated almost like anybody else. Now, that will be -- remains to be seen if that will happen for the former president. Obviously, there are special circumstances that go into a former president surrendering himself to a jail, sort of uncharted waters in itself. But we're already seeing people come here to the jail, turn themselves in, be processed and then released.",

We want to put it in the federal court system, a different court system, one where there's no cameras allowed and they play slightly different rules there whenever you have a court proceeding. And so the most prominent motion to do this so far has come from Jeffrey Clark, the Justice Department official who Donald Trump considered installing as attorney general to try and overturn some of the results in various states. And Jeffrey Clark, he's asking the federal court to put the whole case on hold, get all of the defendants, all 19, moved out of state court into federal court before a federal judge, rather than a state judge, perhaps a judge that could have been appointed by Donald Trump. And so he's asking for that to happen. The timeline on this is, he wants something to happen fast. Mark Meadows already has a hearing on one of these similar motions set for Monday.",

And I think they also have a burden on their shoulders to really prove that Donald Trump's been a fake Republican for four years. He talked all about draining the swamp, and we really spent four years watching him fill the swamp with $8 trillion worth of additional debt. He built a wall for photo-ops and not really for security. I think it's an opportunity for these Republicans to do something about it, and Donald Trump's going to do what he's going to do.

If that's the only stakes that they're playing for, then they're going to turn it into much less of a debate than it should be. What really needs to happen is, if they're going to really be true to their own campaign rhetoric, they have to start talking about a post- Trump era. That's really what they're all calling for. They're saying the Republican Party has to move beyond Donald Trump. And without getting into the ins and outs of why, they really have to start laying out a vision of what that might look like.

DeSantis is not saying much about, say, Nikki Haley or any of the other candidates that are trailing far behind him, because it's not in his interest to do so.That same logic applies to Donald Trump. It's not in his interest to go and get a bunch of knives in his backs and kicks in his butts and have a bunch of people take shots at him, and that's why he is staying away. I'm sure Ron DeSantis would do the same if he could get away with it, but he's not in that position.

I'm certain he can't police himself on the issue.Look, I don't even speculate what would happen if Donald Trump would violate what a judge would say. At the end of the day, this is a deteriorating situation for Donald Trump. I mean, just a few days into this, we're already watching the handful of folks who've turned themselves in, like David Shafer, really starting to point the direction right at Donald Trump in the Oval Office and saying he was directed by his attorneys to do what he did. You're watching others point to shiny objects. But what you're not hearing them point to is that the election was rigged, because there's no facts that are going to back that up in this court case.",
