A source that I spoke with this morning said that the 2019 congressionally appropriated funds for border barrier had to be used by the end of fiscal year 2023.That means that the administration had to make a choice. They either use the money or they don't use it, and they decided they're going to use it for these border barriers in South Texas. As you mentioned there, this is an area of the U.S.-Mexico border that is highly trafficked by migrants We have talked about it repeatedly. And the numbers reveal that. Just from last October to August, there were nearly 300,000 encounters in just this one sector of the border. So, in the notice to the Federal Register, the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, made note of that, citing -- quote -- \"high illegal entries.\" Now, to do this and to do it in an expedited manner, he also had to waive certain laws. That includes, for example, the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Endangered Species Act. Waiving these laws is very similar to what the Trump administration did when they were trying to build a border barrier. What is very different here is that these are funds appropriated by Congress. Remember, under the Trump administration, they also used Pentagon funds. That is not what is happening here. And, last month, Customs and Border Protection sought public input from the community as they set up plans for these barriers. But, of course, all of this is a politically precarious issue for a White House that, as you mentioned, Sara, had said for a long time, they weren't planning to build any wall.",

They can't do anything right now, because the House speaker has been ousted. And I know that Zelenskyy, the president there of Ukraine, has been watching all of this, probably nervously. What are we hearing from him about what is happening in the United States? WARD:  So he's in Granada in Spain today. He has been meeting with E.U. leaders. He has been putting a brave face on it. He has said essentially that he believes Ukraine continues to have bipartisan support, that this will be worked through. But, underneath, I think there is a very palpable sense of unease, because even if this immediate hurdle, Sara is cleared, there is a sense that this could continue to happen again, and again, especially as the U.S. goes into an election year. And right now, on the front lines, that counteroffensive, which has been grinding away, not making a huge difference in terms of being able to push forward, but burning through a huge amount of weaponry, and a huge amount of munitions, and the U.S. really is a critical ally for Ukraine in this capacity. The Europeans have stepped up the aid that they have been giving both militarily and financially. But, according to one expert in the industry, the Europeans could only begin to supply maybe 5 to 10 percent of the munitions that Ukraine needs. So, Ukraine is more reliant than ever before, really, on U.S. support in this moment, Sara.",
