I'm Kaitlan Collins. Tonight, President Trump is here as he embarks on a campaign unlike any other in the history of US presidential elections. He is the first former president in more than a century to seek a return to the White House, and he is currently leading the Republican field; also facing multiple criminal investigations and an indictment. Just yesterday, he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation. No questions are off the table and we agreed to no conditions. We're here to give voters the answers that they deserve. Our audience is made up of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to take part in New Hampshire's Republican primary. They'll get the chance to question the former president directly. These voters and the issues that they care about the most will help decide if former President Trump will get a second chance to take on President Joe Biden. Please welcome the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, former President Donald Trump. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]  DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Kaitlan. How are you?",

Now, energy is at a level that we've never had to pay before. Nobody can afford to continue to pay what's happening with energy, but we were energy independent.
