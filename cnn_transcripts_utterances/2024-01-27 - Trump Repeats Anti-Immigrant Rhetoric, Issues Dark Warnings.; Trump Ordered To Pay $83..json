For all the bluster about the chaos at the border and the \"invasion\" that they're talking about, he and his Republican Party are tanking the best offer that they're ever going to get from President Biden and from Senate Democrats. President Biden and Senate Dems have conceded on almost every major point without getting any new provisions for DREAMers for legal pathways to citizenship. This is really a Republican dream bill and he has torpedoed it, because he'd rather use this as a political issue in November. So it's very clear now that the Republican Party is all for chaos on the border, welcoming the disorder and the lack of security that we're seeing in Texas right now, not just from Donald Trump, but exacerbated by our governor who openly muses about shooting migrants, who is defying the Supreme Court, the US Constitution, the federal government, potentially precipitating a constitutional crisis, and definitely inspiring civil war dead enders from across the country who are promising now to come to Texas and to shoot people, just like they did on August 3, 2019.

The president has thrown his support behind it.You mentioned it is a Republican dream bill, but do you think he should take it? He should sign it? O'ROURKE: Not without gaining new provisions for legal pathways for people to come to this country. Jim, the biggest problem is that there are so many people who are fleeing countries from which they cannot stay or they'll die, and they don't have enough legal opportunities to come to this country. That's why you see folks crossing in between ports of entry, risking drowning and death and potentially being pushed back into the river by Greg Abbott's DPS troopers. Let's see more asylum appointments. Let's adjudicate those asylum requests more expeditiously. Jim, that means that if you've qualified and you're able to stay in this country, we welcome you. If you're not, we send you back to the country from which you came. I think every Republican, Democrat, and Independent can agree on that much, but Republicans are withholding the authority and the resources from President Biden to be able to get that job done. And not that we want to make this a competition about deportations, but you look at the number of people that President Biden has deported, compare that to President Trump and it is very clear that you have an enforcement heavy administration right now, who is effectively, Jim, being kept from doing their job. Literally, Border Patrol agents are being kept by Department of Public Safety troopers in Texas from accessing the border so that they can apprehend and arrest migrants who cross in between ports of entry, and to save those who are unfortunately drowning in the river right now. This chaos that you see, is totally owned by Republicans.",

They call black, white; war, peace. They describe the president manufacturing a crisis to enjoy the political benefit when they're literally admitting that they're doing that. Mitt Romney, the senator this last week, said as much. Donald Trump just said that in the clip that you just played, they want to run on this issue, and they're creating chaos to benefit from it. But showing that clip of Ted Cruz reminds us that one of the most competitive Senate races in the country this year, the best pickup opportunity for Democrats is right here in Texas, and that we don't know who the Democratic nominee will be yet. We can beat him. We got really close in 2018. Our group, Powered by People, is registering hundreds of thousands of voters right now to show up and to vote on this very issue. Texans don't support this march to secession, this incitement to insurrection, this idea that our governor is welcoming shooting migrants, that Ted Cruz is going to torpedo the best hope we have at a real border deal. They want governance, they want accountability. They want to see us move forward to a safe, orderly, and legal process for people to come here the right way. That's what Democrats stand for.",

Senator Jones, great to see as always. Really appreciate it. Let me ask you about the president's event tonight. He is expected to make the case that Trump is a threat to communities of color. Recent polls have him underperforming though among African-American voters by double digits compared to 2020. You had that support obviously, when you won that Senate seat in Alabama. What do you think of what's happening right now? Why is the president underperforming in that category versus four years ago? How could he turn that around? DOUG JONES (D), FORMER US SENATOR: Well, I think, Jim, he is going to -- he has been turning it around. I think if you see things in the country today, you're seeing consumer confidence up. You're seeing people feeling good about where things are in this country. And that's going to happen in communities of color as well, particularly with Black men. I think right now, as people start seeing the contrast, they're going to see a president in the United States that has worked for them consistently his entire career or for over 50 years, not just when he was president, but as vice president, as US senator. They are going to be reminded of that. People are going to be reintroduced to Joe Biden, the public servant, as well as Joe Biden, the president and all he has done over the last three or four years. And when you make that comparison, there is no comparison, and I think once we get into this campaign, as we're seeing now and the contrast between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, those numbers are going to shift. Those numbers are going to tick back up. I have every confidence in that.",

That's what the jury heard. They didn't hear anything about Democrats or some plot to keep him off the ballot. What they heard was his words and the defamatory words. So I think that this is going to chip away, it is a myriad of problems that I think he faces in the campaign.

He is doing the same thing, Jim, he did in 2018. When I first got to the Senate, he had set some parameters to work on DACA, to work on border security. And there was a group of bipartisan group of senators that got together and for about two months, we met at least once or twice a week, and crafted a bill to do just that, and it came up about three or four votes short, because at the last minute, Donald Trump says no, it's not enough, I want full scale border and immigration reform. He is doing the same thing now. He does not want a deal. He wants to run. He wants to make it an issue. I am hoping that Republicans can find at least 10 votes to get across the finish line in the Senate exactly whatever they come up with, because Democrats, I believe will support it, some will support it reluctantly, because it does not go as far as they would like on a number of issues. But yet, if they can craft something that will pass the Senate, it will be a major milestone in immigration reform, and I hope the House will take it up, pass it and let the president sign it. And just let Donald Trump squawk about it and complain about it, but at least this Congress will have gotten something done on it.",

Now, UNRWA moved very swiftly. They fired those staff believed to be involved. They - the UN is organizing a thorough investigation, an independent and complete investigation of the situation. However, it's escalated today, the United States, along with the U.K., along with Germany, Australia, Canada, Italy, Finland, nine nations altogether have said they're suspending their funding from UNRWA. So this is critical to the future of UNRWA. The Israeli defense forces said that their intelligence directorate has investigated and found that there's evidence that Hamas facilities - terrorist facilities have been operating out of UNRWA locations. Again, this is very damning. They haven't presented evidence for it. But it's leading the foreign minister here to say, there must be a thorough investigation. The head of UNRWA must or the leadership in UNRWA must be replaced and is going to call for international support to end the role of UNRWA in Gaza. That is a situation that I think few Palestinians in Gaza could imagine what it would look like. They depend so heavily on UNRWA and that's why the escalation of this is potentially very damaging.",
