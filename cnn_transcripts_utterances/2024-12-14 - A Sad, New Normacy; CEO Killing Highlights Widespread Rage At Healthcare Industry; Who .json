      "sentences": "Yes. Always good to be with you, Michael. Like the definition of intelligence is the ability to hold two thoughts in your mind at the same time. And this was a gruesome murder, as you articulately pointed out. A lot of loss for the Thompson family. What's also gruesome is a healthcare system that has figured out a way to weaponize government and has healthcare systems, including United, that reject one-third of claims. A healthcare system where despite the fact that we have invented the majority of pharmaceuticals in the world and distribute and manufacture them, we pay on average $1,500 per citizen and the rest of the world pays 500. A world in which we have the strongest economy in the world, but the number one source of bankruptcy is medical debt.U.S. Consumer healthcare is the biggest business in the world, but it's been optimized, like everything else in the United States, for shareholders. And that is the way you really bring this down to a ground level and explain some of the rage felt by people across America is, you know, in the New York Times they have that section called vows where they highlight and celebrate people been recently married. There was one very poignant one, and that is they usually don't allow people, they don't feature people unless they can show proof they have been legally married. And they made an exception for a young woman who decided just to have the ceremony and not be legally married because she is suffering from brain cancer and didn't want to encumber her spouse with medical debt. So the level of anxiety, despair, and distress that the nation and its regulatory capture through our elected Representatives have levied on the American public means we really don't have a democracy. We have a capital accuracy and that is we do vote for our elected representatives. But it's money. The number one spender on lobbying isn't the defense industry, it's not big tech. It's a healthcare industry. And two thirds of those lobbyists are former government officials. This is no longer about the nation. You know, our elected representatives no longer optimize for our nation. They optimize for the NASDAQ.",

So here in the U.K., while the NHS has its issues, you have universal coverage. 70 percent of America, Michael, wants universal coverage and price caps. And yet they never happen because see above, the number one Lobman group.Realistically, we're not overnight going to have universal health care. I like the idea of taking Medicare down a couple years, every year, until everyone's covered by it. But at the end of the day, we have to hold these, our elected officials accountable and say, how much money are you taking from the pharmaceutical and the health industrial complex? We talk about an axis of evil being Russia, North Korea, and Iran. I'll give you an axis of evil in the United States, the industrial food complex that puts all these dyes and pesticides and preservatives in our food. The first thing I notice in London is that food actually rots. Why? Because there are 1,100 chemicals, they don't allow in our food. The result is 70 percent of Americans are obese or overweight, and then they hand them over to the medical industrial complex where they make $13,000 per citizen. So again, is America about serving the people, or is about serving shareholders? The top 10 percent benefit from this system because we own 90 percent of the shares. But until we start electing a democracy, a democratic government that represents the bottom 90, and we get rid of Citizens United, where it's no longer just about. Shareholders are wagging the entire dog of the nation here. And it manifests in some very ugly ways, including a healthcare industrial complex where pharmaceutical Companies are spending 88 billion on R and D and 100 billion on marketing, on lobbying. So obviously they're optimizing for shares. The pro, the for-profit incentive we have in this nation above all else, is having terrible externalities, including healthcare.",

But I remember well what the climate was like when President Obama had this plan to create exchanges very Amazon-like and allow people to go on and purchase private health insurance. And it was derided as socialism and people hung Gadsden don't tread on me flags.So I don't know that the American people, as upset as they are with the current system, have the stomach for that political battle.

And the strange thing, Michael, is I believe the bottom 90 percent understands it and supports it because they believe at some point they might be in the top 10 percent. So we have decided that the most anxious, obese, depressed generation of young people in history, people who have claims for wheelchairs for their recently paralyzed kids being rejected. We have decided to accept that and normalize it such that the NASDAQ reaches new highs. We are no longer optimizing for the nation, we're optimizing for the NASDAQ. And if you want to be enraged at someone, look at the man in the mirror.We continue to vote for people who will delay and obfuscate any healthcare reform if they get money from the healthcare industrial complex such that they can get reelected. We chose this system. This is not -- we're not victims of this. We're the culprits. We have purposely opted for a system that shoves money from the bottom 90 and despair. We trade despair and distress at the bottom 90 such that the top 10 can get wealthier and wealthier. And we have chosen this system.

I don't think so.

ASSEMBLYWOMAN DAWN FANTASIA, (R) NEW JERSEY: Well, the first thing I saw at a briefing was complete government ineptitude. But if you're talking about what I saw at in the airspace above Sussex County and above District 24, I've witnessed two. One, I've seen in my hometown, hovering over my home and our neighborhood. But the second one was a bit more troubling. What I saw was I was driving towards a corridor that leads directly into Route 80, which is a national highway. Now, please keep in mind that we are prohibited from flying drones over heavily trafficked areas. And this drone was flying very low and headed directly along that corridor towards Route 80.
