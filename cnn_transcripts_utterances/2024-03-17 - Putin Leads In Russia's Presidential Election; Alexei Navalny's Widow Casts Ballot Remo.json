      "sentences": "Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield and we begin with this breaking news.Polls are now closed in Russia following a three-day presidential election. And with no genuine opposition candidates appearing on the ballot, the outcome was never in doubt. Vladimir Putin is expected to win the vote that will keep his grip on power through 2030. He has already Russia's longest-serving ruler since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. We've got full coverage for you. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Moscow. Fred Pleitgen in Berlin. And also with us CNN contributor and former Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty. So, Matthew, you first. What is the significance of the election results that are coming in?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's pretty significant in the sense that we've had 50 percent of the vote counted so far, more or less according to the Central Election Commission. And Vladimir Putin has, one, an astonishing 88 percent nearly of that vote, which is extraordinarily high. And the highest result that he's had in the five times that he's been elected president.And so that's something that's significance, and undoubtedly that's going to be used by the Kremlin as a way of saying -- a way of claiming that they have a strong mandate, well, Putin has a strong mandate to, for instance, continue his war in Ukraine, what Russia calls its special military operation. But of course we also have to bear in mind that this is an election that's been carefully choreographed. Opposition figures, for example, were not allowed to take part. And so it's an incomplete view of the political landscape, if you like, inside Russia -- Fredricka. WHITFIELD: And then, Matthew, yes, I mean, despite the lack of opposition, there were acts of defiance. How significant was that?",

I mean, look, you've seen, we've seen over the course of the past three days of voting polling stations being attacked with Molotov cocktails, with firebombs. We've seen individuals go into polling centers and pour green dye or blue ink all over the sort of paper votes that have been cast, trying to ruin those votes that have been cast as well.And there have been various other sort of acts of defiance. Earlier today the opposition group associated with Alexei Navalny, the late Russian opposition leader who died last month in an Arctic penal colony, called for Russians to come out at 12:00 local time all over the country, across the time zones in a sort of rolling act of defiance, and come and vote at that point. And I was at a polling station at 12:00, at midday in Moscow and suddenly about 150 or 200 people suddenly arrived there and went to cast their votes. And so that gives you an indication of just how much sympathy there is for that opposition cause, at least in Moscow and other places around the country as well. Take a listen to one of the people we spoke to there about why they'd come at that time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what we saw there is there were some people who were actually publicly displaying that they were for Vladimir Putin. They had Russian flags on them, but there were also a lot of people who apparently had followed that call from the opposition that midday against Putin to show up at the Russian embassy here in Berlin. Some of them with posters against Vladimir Putin, posters against the war in Ukraine. There was even one woman with a blue coat with yellow writing that said stand with Ukraine, who was Russian and went into the embassy to vote there. But of course, no one more prominent than Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Alexei Navalny. She came there, she thanked the people for the support. She waited six hours in line to be able to get inside the embassy and inside the polling station. She then also said that when she did get to vote, that she just wrote the name Navalny on the ballot because she obviously feels that her late husband, Alexei Navalny, was the main opponent of Vladimir Putin and obviously died in prison before the election took place. She got quite aggravated actually when she was asked if she had a message for Vladimir Putin. This is what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, WIFE OF ALEXEI NAVALNY (through text translation): You are probably wondering what I wrote on the ballot papers, who I voted for. Of course I wrote Navalny's surname because it just can't so that a month before the election and already during the presidential campaign, Putin's main opponent, already imprisoned, was murdered.

This is usually an annual celebration, but of course this time around what was looming over the visit by the Irish prime minister was the Israel-Hamas conflict.This is a situation that has drawn deep concern within Ireland and around the world. But in Ireland support for the Palestinian cause runs deep. They see parallels in history between their own, with colonialism and oppression. And so this was something that coming into the meetings here at the White House over the weekend, was a top concern. In fact on Friday, the Irish prime minister said from the get-go that one of the priorities that he wanted to touch on with President Biden was the situation in Gaza and making sure that there was a ceasefire as soon as possible. During that exchange, President Biden nodded his head and said, I agree. Of course the president has said that he wants a temporary ceasefire as well to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, as well as to get hostages who are held by Hamas out of Gaza. So this again today is going to be celebratory, but there is no doubt that here as the president and the Irish prime minister continue their meeting that this is a topic of discussion and an important one, especially for Ireland and its delegation.",

And of course this comes as the campaign has said, this is a rematch that is only crystalized over the last week as President Biden locks up the Democratic nomination.So these numbers mean even more to them this time around as they say that there's more enthusiasm among donors as well as that grassroots fundraising. They continue to see record-breaking months seeing around 97 percent of donations under $200. So again, they call that a barometer of enthusiasm.

He kind of just continue to do what he does, which is to use dark rhetoric. And to be honest, he worked from him in that election. It didn't continue to work for him after that politically as much as it did, especially in 2020.And then in 2024 what you're seeing him do is on certain speeches that are more scripted, he doesn't do necessarily as much dark rhetoric, but in speeches that are more unscripted, such as the one he had yesterday, where basically he said his teleprompter wasn't working or he couldn't see it because of the wind.

Effectively, how far they can go in what they will agree to. Now, we heard, last Thursday, that Hamas counter proposal, which was they would like 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released. And, in return, then they will release the female hostages, including IDF soldiers and those who are weak, elderly, or sick. Presumably, around 40 hostages. That is the estimate, at this point.

He is now saying to the Russian people, look, I got this vote. We are all together. And the implied message, I think, is that there's no nobody who doesn't agree with this. Because, of course, anybody who doesn't agree has been eliminated in one way or the other. So, where we go from here, I think it's probably Putin saying he has the mandate. He will do whatever he wants. And, at this point, it looks as if he will continue the war in Ukraine. He will continue repression at home.
