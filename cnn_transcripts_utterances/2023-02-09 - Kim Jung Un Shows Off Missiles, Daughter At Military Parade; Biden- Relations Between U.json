So every time that we see her it does raise that question once again -- is this Kim Jung Un saying that this particular child is going to be groomed for great things.Now, a little bit about the parade itself. One significant part was the fact that we saw almost a dozen ICBMs -- the intercontinental ballistic missiles that North Korea says can reach mainland United States and many experts believe they may be right. This is the most amount of these larger ICBMs that we have seen in any kind of parade in North Korean history as well. And also a solid fuel ICBM -- a mock-up they showed us showing what they are intending to do. That this is the next thing that they would like to be able to achieve. Solid fuels mean it's much easier to assemble. You can move it around far quicker as well, and it's much harder to track -- Christine.",

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENTPretty soon China is going to be preoccupied with the National People's Congress, which is going to kick off in early March. And the U.S. House speaker is reportedly planning a visit to Taiwan which, if and when that happens, that will provoke the ire of Beijing. Earlier today we heard from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Once again, they said that the balloon is a civilian vessel that blew off course, but the United States says it is a spy craft. And not only that -- it was part of a wide Chinese military surveillance operation that spanned multiple continents. So what did MOFA have to say about that? Let's bring up the statement for you from Beijing. This came out earlier today saying this. Quote, \"The U.S. side claims that this balloon is part of a fleet of aircraft. I do not know that. I think this may be part of the U.S. side of the information and public opinion warfare against China. The international community can see clearly who is the world's largest spy surveillance monitoring country.\" Christine, a rather bold and unsubstantiated claim from Beijing at the end there.

According to multiple reports, Kevin Durant is heading to Phoenix. The Suns getting Durant and T.J. Warren in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, and four first-round picks. Durant now joins Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and Deandre Ayton in just a stacked Suns lineup that is now the favorite to win the Western Conference, according to the oddsmakers. It's also the end of what was just a disastrous era in Brooklyn. Just a year ago Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden were supposed to be the big three that brought the Nets a title. Now, none of them are on the team and Brooklyn owes the Houston Rockets their first-round picks for the next five years. If you know a Nets fan you might want to give them a hug today. Elsewhere, Russell Westbrook's time with the Lakers is over. He's part of a three-team trade that has him reportedly headed to Utah. The Lakers getting former all-star D'Angelo Russell from Minnesota, as well as Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt from Utah in the deal. Mike Conley headed to the Timberwolves in that trade. All right, Kyrie Irving, meanwhile, making an instant impact in his debut with the Mavericks last night after his trade from the Nets just a few days ago. He scored 24 points, leading Dallas to a 110-104 win over the Clippers. The Mavs never trailed in this one. Luka Doncic -- he missed his third consecutive game with a heel injury. He was on the bench for the game. We could see Luka and Kyrie together for the first time tomorrow when the Mavs play at the Kings.

Google may still need to work out the kinks in its new artificial intelligence chatbot tool Bard after the Bard was caught making a mistake in a demo this week. When a user asked Bard about the James Webb Space Telescope, one of Bard's responses was that it took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system, but NASA says that is incorrect. Let's bring in CNN media analyst Sara Fischer. This has been remarkable to watch here about this generative technology and how quickly it is moving through the information sphere.

And so, a lot of people are looking at these results. They might put in a query, get an answer, and say well, it's written in a way that seems very accurate even though it's technically inaccurate.And now the other challenge with generative AI is they often don't tell you where they're getting their sources from -- where they're pulling this information. If you talk to the people who create this technology even they will have a hard time explaining to you exactly where a certain query is going to get its information from. And so, I do think it's going to have a lot of implications for misinformation. As far as journalism goes, Christine, there's a way to look at it and be optimistic or pessimistic.
