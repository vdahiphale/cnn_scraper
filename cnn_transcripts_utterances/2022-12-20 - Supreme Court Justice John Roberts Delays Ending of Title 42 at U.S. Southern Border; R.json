It seems like now they are mobilizing quite actively.Let me walk you a little bit just to show you what has taken place here. You can see what was really a staging ground, and this is what you should understand about that side of the Rio Grande is that this, of course the U.S. side is where a lot of the migrants were staging once they had crossed over the Rio Grande. That's an illegal crossing. But then they would wait there, and they would line up, and where you see all these Humvees, and now are state trooper from Texas vehicles flashing there, the lights there, that was covered with migrants waiting this morning around 4:30. They had campfires lit. And then suddenly this mobilization moved in, those fires were extinguished, and they were moving those migrants to be processed. Some, though, came back over to this side, the Mexican side, and we caught up with one of them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So a lot of these folks who are working on that 21st timeline, they're thinking perhaps they still try to cross. Maybe they hold off for a bit. They're waiting if what could be a new date and deadline for them to fixate on to then determine their next steps here.But you have this state of confusion and really limbo that a lot of these folks are finding themselves in, and now they're looking across and seeing the space they used to easily walk across onto. It was so simple for them. They'd step over stones and be there. Some of them going back and forth to help others.

KEVIN CRAMER, (R-ND):  The people who were responsible for January 6th were the people that illegally came into the building, the people that stormed over barriers and broke through windows and doors and illegally trespassed on the United States Capitol.

And Congressman, I want to get to your time in Congress and whatyou're looking back on in a moment, but first, what happened yesterday on Capitol Hill, what you just heard from your fellow Republicans there, do you believe that the committee has shown that it is Trump who's responsible for what happened that day? REP. FRED UPTON (R-MI):  Well, first of all, I look forward to reading their full report when it comes out tomorrow, but I think they've done a pretty good job. You can't just sweep this under the rug. I once chaired the Oversight Subcommittee, and our role was to investigate fraud and abuse and then go back and correct it. So that's in essence what they did. You'll remember that former President Trump actually opposed a bipartisan commission, one that was equal with Republicans and Democrats, subpoena power, staff, all of that. They were supposed to get their work done a year ago, by the end of 2021. He opposed that, and this was the -- and despite it passing the House, the Senate didn't get the 60 votes to get it done. And so, we ended up with the current commission that's there now, which is a little bit slanted, but they were unanimous yesterday, a little bit slanted in terms of Democrats to Republicans. But they were unanimous, and they have now submitted their recommendations to the Justice Department. So that's step number one. But step number two later this week is part of the omnibus appropriation bill, we're going to have electoral reform. So this is fixing the problem. This is to make sure that not just one member of the House and Senate together can object to a state's certified electoral count. It's got to be at least 20 percent of the body, 20 senators, a good number of House members as well, and that will then -- would then trigger what the insurrectionists tried to really do on January 6th to block this from happening. But the commission that is going to issue their report did their job. We'll see what the Justice Department does. They've got, what, 1,000 different interviews, transcripts, all that. They'll make that decision.",

So I'm not sure what type of impact it would have on him.But he has a strong following among the base. even this week you see polls, 30 percent of the Republican voters want him to run again. and if you get other folks, other candidates in, whether it be DeSantis or Pompeo and others, that 30 percent all of a sudden looks pretty good.",

Somehow he has to whittle that number down to get to 218.I suspect that we're going to have multiple ballots, and it may take multiple days before a successor to Nancy Pelosi is named.

And it was a welcome change. It's obviously what did take down Speaker Ryan and Speaker Boehner, just that threat to vacate the chair, they in essence said enough already.

Veronica, I know we were talking earlier about thousands without power because of this. What are you learning so far?VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, we understand that as of now, about 70 percent of Humboldt County remains without power. That's about 70,000 people in the dark as officials assess the damage. Aftershocks continue from this very large earthquake in the coastal -- near the coastal community of Ferndale, but officials are saying that there is no tsunami threat at this time. There are reports, however, of damage to roadways, debris on roadways, cracks on a large bridge that connects the community, Fernbridge. And the CHP right now shutting down that bridge out of an abundance of caution as they assess the damage. We're also hearing reports of damage to homes in the area in terms of what's happening inside. We're seeing videos of shelves knocked down, glassware, and Chinaware broken as people wake up and assess the damage. Again, 70 percent of those people in that county were without power this morning. And the Humboldt County Sheriff's office asking people not to call 911 unless it's an immediate emergency. Kaitlan?",

Border towns had been bracing for days for a surge of migrants because this pandemic-era Public Health Authority that was put in place by the Trump administration allowed border officials to quickly expel migrants. It was set to expire. It raised a lot of concerns.So, joining us now is Judge Richard Cortez of Hidalgo County, Texas. It sits on the U.S.-Mexico border. He is a Democrat who has said that ending Title 42, he fears, would be a nightmare. So, I just want to thank you for joining us this morning, Judge. And what's your response to what you saw from the Supreme Court because the problem here, and I assume your view is that it's just temporary and not a permanent fix? RICHARD CORTEZ (D), JUDGE, HIDALGO COUNTY, TEXAS: Yes, well, quite honestly, we're relieved that Title 42 has been extended. We were preparing for the worst. We made all the preparations we possibly could to be able to accommodate large inflow of people. You know, we were pretty -- almost already to capacity in some of our locations that we hold some of these immigrants. So, thank goodness, it gives a little more time to adjust and to hopefully reflect on the successes and the failures that this board and policy has had. So, we're -- I think most of us are very pleased with the extension.",

Here again, you know, every time we talk about border issues, we're talking about what's wrong, the problem is that we very rarely talk about the solutions. The solution really is that the United States of America is trying to solve this border problem with an enforcement-only policy and it hasn't worked.The blame really to me is in Congress. Congress has the right to look into comprehensive immigration reform and put laws that are -- that are proper in today's environment. All economists that I've spoken to, articles that I've read, America needs immigrants to maintain and grow our economy. So, if that is true, and we all want immigrants to come here legally, then the only way we can make -- have that happen is for Congress to change the laws. So, that to me is my best contribution, you know, going forward because continue to put as many resources and still having the problems that we had -- we had over 73,000 illegal immigrants come to our area. They're coming in from multiple, multiple, multiple places. What are the facts? We know that our worst asylum seekers are coming in. Many of them have not been adjudicated yet. And those that have been adjudicated only 10 percent qualified. The ones that tell you -- telling you that our system isn't working.",
