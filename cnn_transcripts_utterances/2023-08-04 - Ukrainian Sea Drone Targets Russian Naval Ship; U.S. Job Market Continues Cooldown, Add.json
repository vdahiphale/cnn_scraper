This is the port the war took place right there on the Black Sea.I'll pull out a little more to show you in relation to the entire Black Sea where that is. It's right here. The exact port's not on the map, but you can see where it sits there. I'm joined now by Steve Anderson, a retired U.S. Army Brigadier General. General, great to see you. So, when we're looking at the Black Sea, and the ability of Ukrainians to strike Russian vessels inside Russian territory here, what's the strategic value of that for the Ukrainians to keep the Russians from feeling safe there? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Well, thank you, John. Now, what it means is there's no sanctuary for the Russian ships in the Black Sea. I mean, there's just about nowhere that they can't hit. You recall last April when they took out the Moskva you know, the battleship and the flag ship. They've been able to hit the Kerch Bridge a couple of times. Now, most recently, about two weeks ago, they took out the Markova or at least damaged it back in October. I mean, this should not surprise anybody that they have the technology to be able to do this. I mean, that Ukraine has always been essentially the premier intellectual capital in and technology developments Center for the Soviets. And Ukraine, it -- was behind the development of like the Antonov-124 and the helicopters. Igor Sechin -- Serkinski -- excuse me, Sikorsky is from Ukraine. So, the fact that they have this technology and they can leverage it, shouldn't surprise anybody. They've been able to make these surfboards on steroids carrying almost a thousand pounds using onboard cameras and a joystick. I mean, every 11-year-old's dream is to be able to drive one of these things in new ship and make it blow up. And that's exactly what they've been able to do. They're leveraging their technology, and they're taking it to the Russians. We've already seen the air drone attacks on Moscow. Now, they're doing the same thing to this port. This very, very vital port of which two percent of the world's oil goes through, then able to hit that.",

CNN just asked the American people should the U.S. Congress authorize more funding for Ukraine. And for the first time in our polling, a majority says no. 55 percent say no. The U.S. should not authorize more funding for the battle in Ukraine.From a military perspective -- you know, look, Ukrainians can see this. They see our polling. So, when they see this, what actions might that spur for them or what concerns might it raise?",

I just don't believe that the Biden administration has done a good job of selling this. The need to make this fight.These people, the Ukrainians are fighting for all of us, not just themselves. I mean, the world order will change if this outcome goes against the Ukrainians. We've got to step up. We got to continue to support. Recall 15 years ago, John, the United States was spending $300 million a day supporting the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. What we've done thus far for the Ukrainians is about two and a half months' worth of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And this is a far more important. This is an existential threat to our nation. And we've got to support the Ukrainians. They've got to win. So, when I see polls like that, it disappoints me greatly. And I believe it's because the Biden administration simply hasn't sold the war to the American people like they absolutely need to do.",
