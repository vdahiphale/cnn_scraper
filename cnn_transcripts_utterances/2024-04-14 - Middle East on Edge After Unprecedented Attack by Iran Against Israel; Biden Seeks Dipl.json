      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington.Breaking news in the Middle East we are learning new details about the unprecedented attack on is Israel overnight by Iran. U.S. Central Command now says U.S. forces destroyed more than 80 Iranian attack drones, at least six ballistic missiles launched from both Iran and Yemen. The Israeli military says Iran and its proxy forces across the region launched some 350 drones, missiles, and rockets in total into its territory or at its territory. This Iran says was in response to a deadly attack on its consulate in Damascus earlier this month, which it blames on Israel, though Israel has not taken responsibility. With me now CNN's Nic Robertson in Jerusalem and Priscilla Alvarez at the White House. Nic, you heard earlier CNN analyst Barak Ravid reporting that the Israeli response was actually put on hold right in the midst of this Iranian attack, that there was a case made in the war cabinet to begin the response as the attack was happening from Iran. Where does that leave the Israeli response now and was that a step towards de-escalation?",

      "sentences": "Well, it gives a space for de-escalation, but I think the rhetoric that we're hearing that the pause is at the moment to decide when to strike and how to strike. It's not about deciding not to strike, but in the absence of a decision to go ahead, then that leaves the space.But look, we heard that both -- from Barak Ravid that both Gadi Eisenkot and Benny Gantz, both former chiefs of staff within the IDF, wanted to strike back at Iran while Iran's missiles were in the air. Now President Biden had cautioned Prime Minister Netanyahu to notch this up, cautioned him about a quick response, about retaliating, and the decision has been taken clearly to pause, to think about it more, hand it off to the IDF in part to come up with a plan of action about what they could strike. The part of the strategy going forward appears to be to build out a broader international coalition. So Israel doesn't have to go it alone, or at least has its allies standing closer to it, although President Biden has been very clear that if Israel responds, the United States is not going to be part of that response against Iran, but we know that right-wing members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet want a forceful response, a deterrence response. And that's why I think that, although there's a pause at the moment, Israel's go-to position to deter its enemies in the region is to hit them back harder than they've already been hit. The deterrence, that's how it works. And Israel has stood by that and it's believed in it for decades. So that's the position they're at today, and they don't seem to be backing away from it. They seem to be considering how best to put it into effect and not isolate themselves from the allies that did so much to help them last night -- Jim.",

And so in this phone call with G7 leaders that occurred earlier today, President Biden and the leaders talked about coordinating a unified diplomatic response, diplomatic response being the key words there. Really moving forward with non-military actions.What they want to see is the region to stabilize. There have been heightened tensions and there was real fear and concern that this could escalate at any moment, which is part of the reason that President Biden in his phone call with the Israeli prime minister yesterday evening said that the U.S. will not participate in an offensive action against Iran. It said cautioning and telling the Israeli prime minister to think carefully and strategically about next steps. Now part of this stems from the fact that the U.S. has assessed this should be largely a success for Israel. They were able to take down missiles and there wasn't any major damage to infrastructure. And that is exactly how National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby framed that this morning. Take a listen.

Yes, I think we would respond because you want to deter that kind of activity, that kind of threat in the future.So I think that it's right for Israel just to take their time, figure out what they're going to do. But in the end, just because you took a swing and the punch didn't do too much damage, doesn't mean that you're not going to strike back because if not, then Iran is going to think, hey, we can just launch missile after missile after missile and Israel is not going to do anything.

And it was also a signal to Iran that, hey, you know, we're not with you on this fight and don't use our airspace and don't try to get us involved. And we're going to shoot down your stuff.
