But we now have Intel about what they asked one of his personal aides. Direct conversations about Trump himself. Plus, a conspiracy theorist taking center stage, and it went exactly, as you might expect, off the rails. RFK Jr., denying he said what we've heard him say. But Democrats roll the tape. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, the city of Odessa is staring down another attack. Just moments ago, air raid sirens were blaring, as the Ukrainian city, on the Black Sea, is bracing for more.

Russia says it is retaliating, for Ukraine's attack, on a critical bridge to Crimea.And Ukraine says that Moscow has used almost 70 missiles, and 90 drones, in just four days. President Zelenskyy says that some were shot down. But he warned that his country's air defense, as it stands, right now, can't protect the entire Ukrainian sky. Now, key infrastructure is in ruins, including major grain terminals, like this one that you see here, burned to the ground. CNN's Alex Marquardt is live, in Odessa, where he has been all week.

      "sentences": "Well, Kaitlan, it was very startling to hear that air raid siren, go off, just a few minutes ago, because of how, on edge, this city is, of course bracing for a potential fourth night of strikes. We did hear that air raid siren go off. It has since ended, for the time being.There was a warning, from the Ukrainian military that there was a missile threat. Now, whether those missiles were indeed fired and landed elsewhere, and we didn't hear them? Whether that was a false alarm? That we don't know. We will certainly learn that in the coming hours. But the fact that this city is so on edge, so anxious, really speaks to an assumption, fair assumption, that these civilians, are fearing, the worst, because, over the past few days, they really have seen the worst that had been fired, at this city, since the beginning of the war. Kaitlan, you talked about those 70 missiles fired, over the course of the past few days. Last night alone, we saw four different types of cruise missiles, being fired, from long-range supersonic strategic bombers. We saw drones being fired, at this city, not just last night, but over the last three nights. You could hear them buzzing right over this city. Ukraine says that Russia is lashing out, hitting Odessa, because this is the most famous port city, in the country. And Russia has just pulled out of that grain deal. It is retribution, it is a message, Ukraine says. I would also argue that Russia does not only want to destroy different infrastructure, around the country. They're also looking to terrorize the population. So, when you launch missiles, when you cause those air raid sirens to go off, you're waking people up, you're sending them, into the basement, you're scaring them. That is effectively terrorizing the population, of a city, like Odessa, and all across the country. Now, Kaitlan, Russia is saying that they have been striking Odessa, because of that attack, by Ukraine, earlier this week, on the Kerch Bridge, Russia saying that they would continue, to retaliate, for that brazen attack. Whether they will continue to do so tonight? We are waiting to see. Kaitlan?",

So, it's that.They're trying to destroy the grain, at least a million tons of grain there, which is also horrific, because it's going to cause food insecurity issues, around the world, particularly in Africa. And there's some speculation that they're doing that to raise grain prices, globally, which of course, would happen. And that would help Russian grain exports. So, there's a lot of factors to play here. Also, the drones that struck the Kerch Bridge were launched from Odessa. So, that's another factor. And I'd say probably a third one is the fact that this attack, on Odessa, distracts the Russian people, from the ongoing drama, with Prigozhin and Wagner, and everything else that's happening, in the upper ranks, of the Russian military.",

And so, there, you're not able to prepare layered defense, like you can do, with Kyiv, which is further in the interior of the country. So look, they're going to have to quickly move air defense assets down, as close as they can, to protect Odessa, and then maybe put some aircraft up in the skies, as well, to help out. But of course, the whole aircraft issue gets into the whole matter of why we didn't provide Ukraine with F-16s sooner.

That means the Executive branch can't share information, doesn't have to share information, with the other two branches, Legislative branch or Judicial branch. And it's interesting, because Jack Smith, as part of the Department of Justice, is within the Executive branch. And P.S., the current president holds it, right?

Which I should note, this was first reported, by \"Politico.\" McCarthy called Trump, last month, to apologize, apparently, after he questioned, in an interview, whether or not Trump was really the strongest Republican candidate, in 2024.In that subsequent call, we are told that Trump and McCarthy were speaking, as McCarthy backed an effort, to expunge Trump's two impeachments. And essentially, it would just be symbolic. It wouldn't actually obviously erase the fact that Trump was impeached twice. But we are told that McCarthy did not promise to bring that to the House floor, for a vote, which is probably a good thing, because members of his own Conference don't think it's a good idea. Some House Republicans pouring cold water on the prospect of doing so, just today. Mike Lawler, saying, quote, \"I really don't see the purpose.\" Garret Graves, \"I am not going to take a position.\" Andy Harris said, \"I'm concentrating on appropriations.\" Chip Roy said \"This is a new body. So I'd say onward.\" And Tim Burchett of Tennessee, \"I don't care about that. It doesn't amount to anything.\" Here to discuss, Van Jones, a former Obama administration official; and Scott Jennings, who was a Special Assistant to President George W. Bush. I mean, Scott, those -- a lot of those names that I just read are Republicans, who are in districts, that President Biden won. And voting on something that's basically meaningless, just symbolic, and would send a message, doesn't necessarily help their campaigns. SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes. And you might also get into a situation, where it fails. I mean, what if he puts up like that on the floor, and you don't expunge it? I talked to one House member, today. He said, \"Well, maybe the first one might get expunged. I'm not sure about the second one.\" I mean, think about -- the optics of this are all bad. And so, and then you tack on the political, you know, empirical political data we have, which is when voters are thinking a lot about Donald Trump, and the things he did, and what he represents? We lose elections, just like we did in the midterm. So, all these people want to look forward. These votes would be looking backward. And going into a presidential cycle?

Two border medics, saying that they witnessed a 4-year-old girl, who passed out, in the 100-degree heat, and a 19 year old woman, trapped in razor wire, having a miscarriage. I do want to warn you now these images are incredibly difficult to look at. But these are the injuries, a direct result of that razor wire, that's along the border, according to a Texas DPS report. We know that the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has added additional razor wire, along the border.

And what they're saying is that what they're doing is inhumane, in the way that they're treating these migrants. And one of the issues is? You talk about this razor wiring. But what they have done is the way they have placed it, according to these allegations, from these troopers is that they're making the migrants go to the deeper end of the water. So, in the shallow end, you have all the razor wiring. But the migrants have figured out, if they go to the deeper end, they may be able to get around it. And what's happening, on the deeper end, is they're drowning. I mean, this one State Trooper wrote about how there were five deaths, just in that one weekend that he was there. And most of them, as a result of drownings, kids, babies, mothers carrying their kids, over, and are dying in this water. And he also describes how they come across a large group of people, some 120 people. And basically, what the troopers are told to do, and the National Guard? Push them back in the water, force them back in the water, make them go back to Mexico. And these people have spent, enormous amount of time, getting there. So, they're tired. They wanted water. They weren't given water, according to this Trooper. The Department of Public Safety's denying a lot of these allegations, saying they don't have the directive, where not to give water or anything like that.
