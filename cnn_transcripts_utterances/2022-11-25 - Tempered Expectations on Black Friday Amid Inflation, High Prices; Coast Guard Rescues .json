The National Retail Federation estimates that more than 166 million Americans will shop this weekend. That's actually up by almost eight million people from last year. I'm going to speak to the CEO and president of the National Retail Federation in just a moment for his perspective. Plus, he spent more than 12 hours floating in the Gulf of Mexico. This after going overboard from a Carnival cruise ship. Ahead details about the U.S. Coast Guard's incredible rescue mission. Let's begin this morning with CNN Business correspondent Alison Kosik. She is inside the Herald Square Macy's in New York City. Alison, you know, the predictions for today actually despite inflation are for a busy shopping day. Folks out looking for deals I imagine. What are you seeing there on the ground?",

Adobe Analytics saying that 64 million people in the first three weeks of November have shopped online and that doesn't include what's happening here in the store.So let's talk about Black Friday. 115 million people just today Black Friday across the country are expected to get out and shop. More than half are expected to be in store. Once again, prove here at Macy's that in-store shopping is happening. I was here way before they opened doors and there were a couple hundred people waiting outside in the dark in the cold to get in here. Why? I talked to shoppers because they wanted to get those discounts. They also want to come in the store and touch things again. You know, we were stuck inside during the pandemic. Many still didn't come out and shop last year so getting to -- you know, come into stores and actually touch the products, Jim, it's a big deal. It gets you into the holiday shopping spirit.",

One of course is that consumers have enormous amount of spending power still in the form of savings in excess of the pre-pandemic levels so we're probably close to a trillion and a half dollars in excess savings that all of us in America households have accumulated over the past two and a half years, so people are relying on that increasingly at the lower income levels to meet the difference between their monthly spending and their monthly expenses.That's part of what continues to power the economy. Now we've had 31 consecutive months of retail sales growth even in October. Sales were up 8 percent relative to October of 2021 so a lot of resilience there. I think that's part of it. I think the other thing that we're seeing and you heard it in the previous segment with Alison's conversations, people are aware of price increases, inflation is making a difference in the way they behave and spend. They're more intentional looking for the right gifts. I think that's also a reason we'll see this feeling more like a pre-pandemic holiday.

Well, I thought you asked a really interesting question which was, you know, what can we learn about the broader economy from what we're seeing this weekend and specifically today. And I think that's a bit of the challenge and the conundrum for the Federal Reserve thinking about how to set interest rates and how to diminish demand without slowing the economy so much that we have a real downturn.And the challenge is that because we have all this excess savings, this $1.5 trillion, might be a little more, might be a little less, but that's allowing all of us to rely on that savings to continue to consume. And so as long as we consume, we're going to see prices, you know, maybe sustain at slightly higher levels. We're going to see sustained demand and that puts pressure on wages. That puts pressure on the labor market, makes it a little more challenging for the Federal Reserve.",

And those prospects will certainly dim even more when the president loses the House come January.The president also is contending with a lot more in this lame-duck session. He's trying to get a government funding bill to avert a government shutdown. That will include if the White House gets its way funding for COVID, also funding for Ukraine. There's no question that the president is sincere in his desire to try and get this assault weapons ban passed, but the White House is very clear-eyed about the prospects of that whether in the lame-duck right now or in the next Congress when they lose the House. The president, though, isn't doing himself any favors when he uses this language of semiautomatic weapons. That would include pistols, as well. Semiautomatic pistols. The president in the past has made clear that what he's seeking is simply to ban assault weapons. We've asked the White House for comment to try and clarify those comments but they have yet to respond.

And we know the FBI is now also involved in this case but really all the video that we see on social media you must wonder why it took so long for authorities to make this move. And the big question right now is, which person are they looking for? Because the name hasn't been given at all.Those six friends who went down there to Mexico all returned back to America after she died.

And we know from the death certificate that apparently she died from a severe injury to her spinal cord. So there are so many questions involved in this. And I've watched the video that's online. Jim, there is a video that lasts for more than 30 seconds of someone being beat inside a hotel room. We've talked to the father of Shanquella Robinson. And he says that's his daughter. She's not fighting back. So you understand the pain that's involved in this case. In fact, take a listen to her mother talking about all the twists and turns involved in her daughter.
