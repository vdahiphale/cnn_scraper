And it wasn't really even close. 1.38 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. That's 2 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than before we started burning fossil fuels. And that shouldn't be a surprise. Because nine out of the past nine years have been the warmest on record. And so, I think at 2023, it's going to make that ten out of ten without a doubt.And El Nino is likely, at least partially, mostly to blame. [04:35:00] Because we have the cold water that's supposed to be off the West Coast of the Americas now being replaced by warm water from the western Pacific. And when that happens, we change the weather globally. We even can effect the Atlantic hurricane season. That can all be associated with an El Nino event. The U.K. was over a degree warmer in June from the record. Beijing was 41.1 -- never been that warm in any June day ever. And obviously this big heat dome we had over Texas for most of June, all, all of that contributed to June 2023 now being the warmest June ever. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
