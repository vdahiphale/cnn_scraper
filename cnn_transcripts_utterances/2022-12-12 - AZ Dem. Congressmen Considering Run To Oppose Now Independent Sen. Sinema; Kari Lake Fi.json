      "sentences": "New reporting, tonight, on two races that have dominated political headlines of late.In a moment, supporters of Republican House Leader, Kevin McCarthy's bid, to be the next House Speaker, deeply critical of the House Conservatives, who want to see new blood leading the party. But we start with the Senate race that isn't for another two years, but will be heavily influenced, by decisions, being made right now. Arizona senator, Kyrsten Sinema, as you likely know, left the Democratic Party, last week, to become an Independent. At least, officially, Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, says she will keep her committee assignments, signaling the balance of power probably won't change, and that she may remain a, if sometimes, frustrating vote, for the Democrats. But now, at least two Democratic members of Congress, in Arizona, are maybe kicking the tires, for a possible run, for her seat; Congressman Greg Stanton, as well as my next guest, Ruben Gallego. The consideration for both is the same, whether a three-way race could split the vote enough, to throw the seat to the Republicans. Congressman Ruben Gallego joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us. You've said your decision, on whether to run for the Senate seat, would be based on what's best for Arizona. What are you hearing from your constituents and your family? REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ): Well, from my constituents, I've heard nothing but encouragement on every channel you could ever imagine, whether it's text, whether it's Twitter versus Facebook. Over the weekend, even though unprompted, I was in Ukraine, for the weekend, at www.gallegoforarizona, we had a huge, a huge, amazing show of support that really has encouraged me. And my family, they're always behind me, a 110 percent. We're going to talk over the holidays, and then we'll go from there. COOPER: So, to those -- I mean, you know the pushback, to those who say, if you run for Senate, in Arizona, as the Democratic nominee, against Senator Sinema, who's now an Independent, it would split the vote, and hand Republicans that seat. What would you say to that?",

She's aligned herself with Wall Street hedge funds, and pharma, which I think is not popular with Democrats, definitely not with Independents. And I don't think she's going to have much of a home with Republicans. So, if anything, I think, it actually helps out Democrats.

Andy Biggs is one of the members, who is vowing to challenge McCarthy, on January 3, got 31 votes, when his party voted to nominate McCarthy, for the Speakership, last month. Of course, that would mean that McCarthy has some room to make up. But in talking to Republicans today, there are ample questions, about what would come next, if they don't get 218 votes, a situation that has not occurred, since 1923, when the Speaker's race went to multiple ballots, and a lot of the Republicans are concerned that the conservative law hardliners, are making -- could make a mess, of their new Republican majority, they're saying.

But Anderson, in talking to members, they acknowledged that is a very difficult scenario, to see play out because it would require the two sides, to get behind one person, who they believe could essentially push forward, an agenda that they believe in. And, in a partisan institution, like the House, it's hard to see that playing out, a lot of Democrats said there's no way they can vote for a Republican Speaker candidate. And a lot of Republicans simply don't believe this is a possibility as well. But it's something that no one is quite ruling out here, because we could be in a truly unprecedented situation. And McCarthy is on the floor, unable to get the 218 votes, in his narrow House majority. And there are still questions about who could become Speaker. So perhaps, they could look for an alternative that's one thing that members or both sides, are looking at, as we head into January 3. COOPER: Yes. Manu Raju, appreciate it. Thank you.",
