Vance has really been tapped by the Trump campaign to be the attack dog, to be the one who kind of lobs the criticisms back at the Democrats. Of course, Donald Trump is still doing that, as you just heard, but they want him to focus on the issues, whereas Vance really has been given the mandate to be the one to go hard after Democrats this week in particular.Now, we did hear Vance. He spoke to our own Jake Tapper last night, and he was asked about what Congressman Jamie Raskin. Remember, he was a key leader on the House committee regarding January 6th. on the Capitol attack. He brought that up during his speech at the DNC last night, where he said kind of give a warning, honestly, to Vance saying, look at what happened to your potential predecessor. Look at what happened to Mike Pence on January 6th. But Vance said, look, I have no reservations about that. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I can't help but laugh at what Jamie Raskin said. These are people who somehow always make themselves the victims. I have no reservations about taking this job because I know that if we make Donald J. Trump president of the United States, he's going to deliver rising wages, lower prices, and a secure border. That is all worth it for me, whatever the media or Jamie Raskin says about me. (END VIDEO CLIP) TREENE:  So, John and Sara, this is kind of the line we've been hearing from Vance. And he's kind of mirroring as well what Donald Trump has said, which is that they're not talking about the border. They're not talking about the issues as much as they should be. Instead, they're focusing on going after Donald Trump. I think you're going to hear a lot of those same attacks today when both of them are at the border. Trump is in Arizona, of course, but Vance as well will be at the border in Georgia.",

Not in the same place. He's going to be in Glendale later in the day.But we do have some new reporting. One is that we have heard and learned that he is expected to end his campaign and that he is in talks with the Trump campaign for a potential endorsement. Now, when I talked to some senior Trump advisers as well as sources familiar with his plans, they told me that there's a couple of reasons of how they've gotten here. One is that a Donald Trump Jr., Donald Trump's son, has been really pushing for this behind the scenes. He's been talking to the RFK Jr.'s campaign, trying to see how they could get him to end his campaign and back Donald Trump. Two other people who have been crucial in these talks, I'm told, our former Fox News Host Tucker Carlson as well as Omeed Malik. He was someone who was donated to RFK Jr.'s campaign in the past, but is also a Trump donor. So, they have been key in these talks. And, really, I was told that the change of how they viewed an endorsement from RFK Jr. was when Biden ended his campaign and Harris became the likely person to replace Biden. They said that they weren't sure whether or not to bringing on RFK Jr. on to, you know, having him as a Trump surrogate having his endorsement would benefit them. But they really believed after Harris was the one to top the Democratic ticket that it would work in their favor. And so stay tuned for that announcement tomorrow.",
