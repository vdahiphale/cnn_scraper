They killed 25-year-old Jayland Walker following a traffic stop in June. Ohio's attorney general says the panel concluded the officers were legally justified in their use of force.

In Akron this morning, things are quiet, but there certainly is a sense of frustration and even some outrage. Many people here wish that there would have been charges filed so that the cases would have played out in open court in front of a jury trial instead of come to a conclusion behind closed doors with the grand jury. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SANDOVAL (voice over): Jayland Walker's family left devastated after a special grand jury failed to indict eight Akron, Ohio, police officers who shot and killed the 25-year-old in June of last year. BOBBY DICELLO, LEAD COUNSEL FOR JAYLAND WALKER'S FAMILY: The family of Jayland Walker's hearts have been destroyed. His body has been destroyed. And our faith in this community, its leadership, has been destroyed. SANDOVAL: Walker allegedly fired one shot from his car as he drove away from a traffic stop attempt and then led the officers on a car chase and later a foot pursuit. According to the Ohio Attorney General's Office, he exited the vehicle in a ski mask.",

The governor threw the idea out as one of several retaliation options after Disney attempted to avoid a state takeover of its special governing district. In February, the board of Disney's self-governing district quietly voted to hand over power to the company before a DeSantis appointed board could take control.

And so, you know, it's like, OK, kids -- I mean, people have said, you know, maybe -- maybe have another -- maybe create a state park. Maybe try to do more amusement parks.

However, these latest actions that he is threatening would turn Disney in - Disney's special district into basically his -- his own operation. I mean he's already appointed five of the board members. Now he is threatening to use that new board to potentially tax Disney's property, putting in state inspections, selling off the utilities that operate in that district to other private companies.
