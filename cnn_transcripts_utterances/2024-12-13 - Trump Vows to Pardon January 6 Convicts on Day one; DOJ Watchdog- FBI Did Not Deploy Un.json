This is what the FBI has been telling us since January 6th about their own activities with informants.And to be clear, what the IG determined was there were no FBI undercover employees, not a single one at the rally or on the Capitol that day. There were three informants. These are private citizens who provide information to the FBI under their own -- you know, for their own reasons. Three who were actually sent, asked to attend the rally and went and reported back on the domestic terrorism subjects that were -- that were under investigation and who we knew would be there. And there were an additional 23 informants who just went because that's what they do. They are people in these communities, in these extremist groups who also report and provide information to the FBI. And they spend time with these people. So about 26 in total, many of them provided positive reporting back to the FBI. I think only four actually entered the Capitol on that day, and none have been accused by prosecutors of doing anything violent or committing crime. So the truth, once again, is very different from what people have been hearing on right-wing television and from Republican politicians.",

That's what we do as an intelligence organization. You have to recruit sources of information. You have to convince people who are members of these groups to report back information to the FBI.And they do it for all sorts of different reasons. Once someone is an informant for the FBI, they are admonished that they have no authority to engage in any criminal activity and that if we find them committing crimes or participating in criminal activity, they will be arrested just like anyone else. So people on that day who might have been asked, hey, you are helping us in the investigation of a particular domestic terrorism subject, we know that that person is traveling to the Capitol to attend this rally. Why don't you go with that person and let us know what they're doing? It's a way of keeping track of people who you think are potentially engaging in violence. It's a way of understanding what they're doing and giving you the opportunity to prevent acts of violence and terrorism from taking place. So they'll -- you know, under those circumstances, that person would travel with the subject of the investigation and make phone calls or send texts back to a handling agent saying, here's where we're going to go tomorrow. We're going to stop here for breakfast. And then we're going to walk to the rally. Here's what I'll be wearing so you can identify me. Here's what the other person looks like. Just basic information that allows agents to keep some understanding, maintain an understanding of what a subject of an investigation is doing and to potentially collect evidence of that person's wrongdoing that might be necessary later in a criminal prosecution.",

That absolutely did not happen. Now you have the inspector general who absolutely would have reported that if they found it in their investigation that included hundreds of interviews and many, many years to complete, which is a separate problem.

Number two, regulations are strangling the economy. Donald Trump is going to embark on a big deregulatory campaign. That also can help bring prices down.
