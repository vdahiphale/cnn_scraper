      "sentences": "Hello and thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. It is the final weekend of campaigning. And with just three days left until Election Day, both candidates are hitting the trail in key southern swing states today.Former President Donald Trump will speak soon at a rally in battleground North Carolina. It's one of three rallies he has planned for today. Two of those campaign events are in the Tar Heel state, the other in Virginia. Vice President Kamala Harris will also hold a campaign event in North Carolina later on today as she makes a last-minute push to get out the vote in that battleground state. Today is the last day of early voting in North Carolina. So far, more than 4 million people in that critical swing state have already cast their ballots, exceeding the total number of early voters four years ago. CNN's Alayna Treene is covering the Trump campaign and joins us now from that rally there in North Carolina. All right, so Alyana, what is Trump's closing message in these final days there?",

      "sentences": "Oh, well, look, we actually received, Fred, some of Donald Trump's prepared remarks for this speech in Gaston. And I can tell you, it looks like it's going to be a very dissolute message if you only look at what's going to be loaded into his teleprompter.However, we know that Donald Trump, particularly in recent weeks, veers off script, likes to go on different rants and air his grievances. So it's unclear exactly what he's going to say on stage. So I want to read you some of what his campaign sent around about those excerpts because it does get to the closing message. Excuse me, something he's going to say in those prepared remarks is, quote, I have come today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote on Tuesday, I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion and I will bring back the American dream. And I will bring, excuse me, and then it goes on to say, this is all you need to know. Kamala broke it. I will fix it. So that's what his campaign, Fred, wants him to be discussing today. But something else that I can tell you, I know from my conversations with Trump's campaign that is very much on Donald Trump's mind is you mentioned the incredible early voting numbers here in North Carolina. What we've seen in early voting and some of the returns that are coming back is that women are outpacing men when it comes to early voting. Now, that is a problem for the Trump campaign, because as we've covered thoroughly, Donald Trump and his team have yet to solve for the gender gap. So far, it has been very clear that women favor Kamala Harris more than they do Trump. Now Trump kind of talked about this day as well as some things that have been percolating, including in a Harris ad that perhaps some women are lying to their husbands about who they're going to vote for. We heard Donald Trump address this during an interview with \"Fox and Friends\" this morning. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Can you imagine a wife not telling her husband who she's voting for? Do you ever hear anything like that? Even if you have a horrible -- if you had a bad relationship, you're going to tell your husband that it's a ridiculous thing. It's so stupid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Something that drew a ton of backlash, including from the Harris campaign. So this is something we have to see whether or not he continues to talk about on stage throughout these series of stops today.Now, I do also just want to get back to North Carolina, given that we're here now, he's going to be here later, but he has four stops across North Carolina over the next few days. That is a lot of time that he is spending in a state that I would remind you, Donald Trump won in both 2016 and 2020 and hasn't seen a -- a Democrat win actually since 2008 when Obama won the state. So it's interesting that they're trying to spend so much time here in a state that a lot of people, I would argue earlier this year had expected to very much be an easy win for Donald Trump. So I'd keep that in mind as, you know, we listen to his speeches across North Carolina and -- and really see him trying to turn out the vote as much as possible here. Fred?",

After that six-week ban went into effect on May 1st, we saw a cut by my -- more than 30 percent of abortions in the state and that led to a dip in 7 percent of abortions nationwide.So there was an average of about 5,400 abortions in the state from May and June, down from more than 8,000 a month from January to May. So we see the impact of that ban going into effect in Florida and that's because it was one of the few states in the region where abortion remained legal. After the overturning of Roe v. Wade, More than one in 10 abortions in the country were held in Florida. And in 2023, about 9,000 people traveled from out of state to Florida to get an abortion there. So those are people coming from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and a lot of the ballots, the measures in the ballots this election cycle are aiming to restore abortion to up to the point of viability. But I want to talk to you about Missouri. Missouri was a state where -- where the first state to go into an abortion ban after the reversal of Roe v. Wade, they went into the most restriction -- restrictive abortion laws at that. In Missouri, there are no except -- exceptions for survivors of -- of rape or incest and providers are at risk of legal liability. Now, there is an exception there for some medical emergencies, but not all of them. And as you mentioned Nebraska, we have also up to the point of viability in the ballot. But in the other states, we're seeing this big effort of nationalizing the conversation through some of the high level celebrities. We had Beyonce with Vice President Kamala Harris in her rally in Houston just last week. And now Chrissy Teigen lending her voice in Arizona, telling her own personal story of needing a late term abortion to this conversation.

You look at what the Donald Trump MAGA extremist Republicans are -- are trying to do in terms of taking away our freedoms to vote, you know, our freedom to organize, our freedoms to breathe clean air and drink clean water.They're talking about going back to their playbook of Project 2025, which is totally devastating. And so, yes, women understand that we need to make sure that we stop this national abortion ban that Donald Trump wants to implement, but also that we need to make sure that we have the -- the resources for childcare, for good quality education. We have maternal mortality rates that we have to deal with in terms of our healthcare.

But if they do, it certainly helps connect with other women who are going through these struggles. And also the dangers of -- of what is taking place under Roe are made very prominent and very clear. Look at the women who have died as a result. Look at -- look at what has taken place just since the enactment of Roe. It's outrageous. This is a matter of life and death. And so, yes, the women who are brave enough and who are courageous enough to talk about it are really making a difference. I co-chair the Pro Choice Caucus with Congresswoman Diana DeGette. And I am telling you, we have organized around the country and we know good and well that the majority of people want the right to make their own decisions. And that is what is at stake at this point in terms of our freedoms, to control our own bodies and -- and our own bodily autonomy, but also our freedoms in general, in terms of our democracy and in terms of the right to live in a country that recognizes that our freedoms are constitutionally right -- correct for us, including women, and that we have to codify and put into federal law the National Women's Abortion Act so that we can have abortion once again accessible to all women around the country.",

Sources say Homeland Security's Cybersecurity Agency is actively calling out foreign disinformation efforts this year, but is less aggressive in calling out lies being told by Americans, something it actively did in 2020. CNN's Rafael Romo has been looking into all this. He's joining me right now. Rafael, great to see you. So one the latest attempts at misinformation has been this fake video purportedly, you know, showing a Haitian immigrant claiming that he voted several times.",

It had well over half a million views before it was deleted. And the problem is that it continues to circulate on social media. It shows purportedly a Haitian immigrant claiming he voted several times for Vice President Kamala Harris, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told CNN Friday night, the video is obviously fake and likely part of a Russian disinformation effort.Raffensperger also said that, one, immigrants don't get citizenship papers, a driver's license or anything that would allow them to vote in six months. Two, Georgia, the secretary said, has a very robust citizenship verification process. And three, Raffensperger says the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to Georgia state officials that the video came from Russia. Raffensperger also says the state of Georgia is fully prepared to tackle lies and disinformation efforts coming from abroad. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R-GA), SECRETARY OF STATE: We knew there -- it just didn't smell right. So we checked it out, came to a conclusion real quick. So we responded very quickly, you know, on Twitter and then also with a press release just to let people know it's fake, don't fall for it, because in effect, what people want to do, these nation state actors is really get us fighting among ourselves. We got enough that splits us. We don't need to have the Russians or other bad actors try and split us further. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So that was where the uniform that grows was born. It grows six sizes and up to 12 inches in length. It adjusts in various parts of the body to provide a well- tailored fit to put their uniform on for the first time. That's one of the most joyous experiences that we see. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
