      "sentences": "Yeah. I think we have. I mean, look, we've been seeing an escalation in rhetoric coming from the Kremlin over recent weeks that perhaps began to become more apparent when the United States agreed to allow Ukraine to fire U.S.- supplied weapons systems just over the border into Russia, because Russia was using the safety of its own territory to launch missiles into civilian buildings in Kharkiv and then in the northeast of the country.Where are we now today? Well, President Putin has said the world is very close to -- or the West is very close to a point of no return, and we're seeing him put naval assets in Cuba, very close to the United States, as an obvious message there. He'll be taking a trip. He is expected to take a trip to North Korea, North Korea, one of those countries that's helping Putin with weapons to fight in Ukraine. I mean, these are all signals coming from the Kremlin that are intended to send a message that Putin isn't happy about what's happening. Another announcement that came yesterday was from the White House about additional sanctions to, again, limit Russia's ability to get the technology to make the weapons that they're using to kill civilians in Ukraine. So, yes, I think in broad terms, we can say that the Kremlin has responded by this -- with this forward-leaning message coming from the Kremlin, sort of, as we've seen in the past, an unspecified threat, but nevertheless saying you're going too far. We don't like it.",

He sees the haves, the have nots, the big multinational companies that make massive profits, and the developing parts of the world where people are struggling to find water, to find food, and he would like to make it a more equitable place, and he believes that AI is a way to level up, if you will, to make sure that development is equitable. And he said, no single country should be left behind. No single group of people should be left behind.So, his message to the G7 leaders is AI is powerful. It's a scientific tool. God, if you will, gave us the intellects to be able to come up with scientific developments, to be able to come up with the ideas that have developed AI. And he would like to see it used for good, rather than, let's say, being used for automated weapons systems where AI is literally choosing the target, aiming the gun and firing the gun. And the language that we're hearing from the White House about AI and the sort of center of the discussion there really mirrors that. They're saying, look, what we want to do at the G7 is to try to find a way where we get some commonality on the governance of AI, more joined up approach to it, which, it's a global issue, you have to approach it globally, and at the same time as well, make sure that it's done and its benefits are felt across the world. The scientific advancements, the healthcare advancements, the agricultural advancements, all these things that AI can bring, make sure they reach everyone. So, it's a common language here. But, of course, they got to find common agreement.",

They had an official response on Tuesday, Hamas, and they had suggested a number of amendments.

Now, Hamas, for its side, says that they believe that they have shown necessary positivity. They say that the changes that they are asking for are in the interests of the Palestinian people. Now, we know one of the changes they're asking for is a timeline on the permanent ceasefire in Gaza. We know that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been keen to keep that vague. Certainly, the first phase of this proposal is for a six-week ceasefire. And then, through negotiations, it's expected to evolve into a permanent cessation of hostilities.But, it appears as though Hamas is looking for more clarity and more guarantees that that will happen, also pushing for more guarantees that there will be a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. At this point, the first phase, the first stage of that proposal is only that the troops should pull out of the populated areas. So, there are differences of opinion. We've heard from Blinken saying that these -- there are discrepancies. He believes the discrepancies can be narrowed, but there is not a guarantee that they will be. Fred.",

And so, that's one part of this.It really does show you, though, Fredricka, that in order to pass any gun laws in the United States, you're going to have to get Congress to do it, which, of course, is an extremely difficult thing to do with where Republicans are on the issue of gun rights, no matter what happens with these mass shootings, which, as you know, in this country are a regularity.

As you noted, Fred, the 1200 building has not been touched since the mass shooting. At first, it was preserved as a crime scene for the trial of the Parkland shooter.

A bankruptcy judge is hearing the arguments, and he may as well rule today that not only have Alex Jones' personal assets already been requested to be liquidated, that his company as well. This is -- his company is called Free Speech Systems. It is the parent company of the infamous Info Wars conspiracy theory platform.And what the families are requesting, they're requesting that the court appoint a court-appointed trustee who will liquidate these assets so that the proceeds from those sales will help go towards paying that $1.5 billion -- almost $1.5 billion that they are owed. Those families have not seen a single cent from the amount that they awarded in those 2022 trials. And even if all of these companies are liquidated, even if Alex Jones' personal assets are liquidated and all of that money goes to the families, that will only make a small dent in what they're overall owed. What's important to know is even if the judge rules that these companies should not be liquidated, they will still be owed that money, and it will still come to them in some way. And most likely, for a very long time, Alex Jones will be paying these. But, what's important here is that if the judge rules today that these companies must be liquidated, it will essentially take Info Wars out of the hands of Alex Jones. What's really interesting actually, it's just in the last two days, the families also requested that Alex Jones' social media accounts, his X/Twitter account will also be liquidated, arguing that this Twitter account -- his X account is essentially like a customer base. It will be really interesting to see how the judge rules from that. Now, Jones, for his part, for the last few days has continued airing his shows, has continued peddling lies about who is behind these cases. He was broadcasting even on his way to Houston to court. Now, for the families, they actually -- I spoke to one of the lawyers for the -- some of the Connecticut families, and he says that they are trying to find the most amount of accountability that the legal system can deliver, and that the money is just one component of that, and not the most important component of it. For them, the most important component of this is to essentially try to get Alex Jones' damaging lies and conspiracy theories that he continues to peddle off of the airwaves.",

He had Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand on his show yesterday. He could go, team up with Tucker Carlson and go with him. He is allowed on the platform X. He could still broadcast on X.But, what they're trying to do is just dismantle as much as they can of Alex Jones' empire. And again, it is still important to note that he will still continue to owe money to these families. Now, there are -- the plaintiffs have been arguing that Alex Jones has been trying to move his money around, give some of it to his father, try to route business through to his father, through to others, and they trying to get as much of this money that is owed to them as possible, unlikely that even in his lifetime, though, Alex Jones' will to pay this for almost $1.5 billion that he owes these families.",

In Beijing, they could see temperatures over the average of 30 degrees Celsius next week, possibly getting 39 degrees. That's 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Chinese officials say the weather threatens to impact agriculture in the north and central provinces. This year was the hottest spring on record, while 2023 was China's hottest year on record. And officials in northeast India tell CNN that heavy rains and landslides have killed at least six people and left 2,400 tourists stranded. A local official says the state would provide support to those residents impacted by the flooding. Local officials say deadly flooding from heavy rainfall has also brought havoc to the Bengal region. And South Korea and the U.S. are concerned over a potential trip by Russia's Vladimir Putin to North Korea. The two countries held an emergency phone call over the possible visit, and in a press release, they said Mr. Putin's visit should not undermine stability in the region. They also warned that North Korea should not deepen military cooperation with Russia, which would violate a UN security resolution. And before Pope Francis headed to the G7 summit in southern Italy, he met at the Vatican with more than 100 comedians from 15 countries. Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Jimmy Fallon and Conan O'Brien are among those who were invited. The Pope's message to them, they have the power to spread peace and unite people with laughter.

He has called for a treaty to regulate its use. He is not saying that AI is bad, per se. He is saying it's a tool that can be used for good or for ill. But, he also called for joined up political action on this topic.Now, France has said that politics is sometimes seen as a dirty word or a distasteful topic, and politics can be petty.

And recently, this has become Taylor Swift and her support of Joe Biden. And I do want to be clear, Fred, Taylor Swift has not endorsed Joe Biden this cycle. She did endorse him in the past election. And we know that the Biden campaign was trying to see if she would endorse him again.But, she has been supportive of him in the past. And it's something that has graded on Donald Trump. And a big part of that is, and we know from just covering him so thoroughly over the past several years, that he cares a lot about celebrities, about Hollywood elite, about people who have a huge fan base, who could have swayed, particularly when Taylor Swift case, with young voters, and that is something that really bothers him. He often seeks the approval and the sway of a lot of these people. So, to not have it and also to be concerned that Taylor Swift could endorse President Joe Biden, it's something that's still, as you can see, Donald Trump is preoccupied with.",

Yep, outside the stadium, outside the legendary Allianz Arena, which is, of course, normally where the legendary club Bayern Munich play, and the gates to this arena are going to open in about, let me check, about 10 minutes from now. There is already a lot of Scotland fans and Germany fans who are lined up that way, trying to get in. We got in ahead and that's why we're already inside the secure area.And you're absolutely right. The Scots have already been very loud, very vocal inside the city center of Munich. In fact, there was one German press report that I read that apparently they managed to drink all of the beer in some of the bars, and you have to drink a lot of beer to be able to empty a bar a year in Munich, here in Bavaria. So, the Scots, definitely very good vibes coming from them. But, in general, we were down there a couple of hours ago, and we did see some pretty good vibes in general between the German fans and the Scottish fans, everybody, obviously, very merry, very much looking forward to this tournament beginning. And ahead of the tournament beginning, I managed to speak to the head of the tournament, the director of the tournament, also a legendary German footballer, Philipp Lahm. And here is what he said what he believes are the most important things he hopes this tournament will achieve. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHILIPP LAHM, FMR.
