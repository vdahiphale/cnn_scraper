He did entered that not guilty plea through his attorney. He has been linked to at least four attacks against the homes of two slate legislators and two county commissioners following his 2022 House election loss in New Mexico. All four of those officials were Democrats.Now last month a grand jury in Bernalillo County indicted him on 14 criminal charges which include three counts of criminal solicitation to commit shooting at a dwelling or occupied building, two counts of conspiracy to do the same thing, two other counts of transportation or possession of a firearm and numerous other charges. And while he pleaded not guilty, Albuquerque police say Pena was fueled by essentially election lies. He was a staunch supporter of former president Trump. He believed that his own election in November had been stolen despite being defeated by nearly 50 points. And prosecutors allege he then concocted this plot targeting these four lawmakers. Now we are expecting him back in court in about 30 days according to the Albuquerque DA and he is awaiting trial behind bars -- guys.",
