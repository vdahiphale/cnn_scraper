So many factors threatened to sweep the economy. For starters, interest rates, central bankers have hiked them to the point where economies have slowed down to kill inflation. And now they`re trying to hit that target 2% without them knocking themselves off. Global growth is expected to slow this year. I hope it`s not going to spiral it all down.",

AI is like a curling stone. Heavy, once set free may be difficult to control. And even if we do the right things, well, accidents can still happen. It`s unbelievable. The world of curling can teach us much about today`s global economy, having raised interest rates and then still trying to keep things going without coming to a complete stop. And then when all set and done in a competitive environment, you want to knock your competitors to one side, but you don`t want to completely ruin the game. Richard Quest, CNN Davos.

That was the last time humans set foot on the moon during the final lunar landing mission in NASA`s Apollo program, Apollo 17. Last week, the U.S. launched its first Lunar Lander mission in more than 50 years, there was no crew on this craft, but the moonshot, this time was not successful due to a critical fuel leak, the Peregrine spacecraft had to turn back from the vicinity of the moon and head back towards earth. Astrobotic, the company that built the Peregrine Lander under a 108 million contract with NASA said the spacecraft was about 218,000 miles from the earth. There were options to crash land the Peregrine on the moon or leave it to the Cosmos. But Astrobotic decided that the safest option would be to turn the spacecraft back and allow it to smash into the thick atmosphere of the earth at high speeds. If the Peregrine`s mission had been successful, it might have become the first U.S. spacecraft to land on the moon since Apollo 17. All right, we possibly have some good news for air travelers. The airline industry is set to have its first quote, \"normal year since the pandemic. Airfare is at a 15-year low and more passengers are now ditching the economy seats and upgrading to more premium seating arrangements, did you know?
