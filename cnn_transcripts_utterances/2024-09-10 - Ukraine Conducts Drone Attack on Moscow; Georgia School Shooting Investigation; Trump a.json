Tonight on stage in Philadelphia in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will face off in a historic presidential debate, one that could be the most consequential moment of the 2024 race for the White House.It'll be not only the first, but perhaps only debate between the two candidates, also the first time these two have ever shared a stage face-to-face. And with just eight weeks until Election Day, this 90- minute showdown comes at a pivotal time in the campaign. CNN's brand-new poll of polls out today shows the race is virtually deadlocked, no clear leader in the race for the White House. We have all angles of this story covered with a team of correspondents. Priscilla Alvarez is covering the Harris campaign and Kristen Holmes is covering the Trump campaign. Priscilla, let's start with you. Talk to us about the vice president's mind-set going into tonight and how she's preparing. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Boris, sources telling me that she has been doing robust debate preparations. Of course, she spent the last several days in Pittsburgh where she was with her group of advisers preparing for this consequential moment tonight. Now, part of that preparation also included identifying the issues that they can needle former President Donald Trump on. And one of those, according to sources, is going to be reproductive rights. She is expected to lean in on that, going after his muddled messaging on this very issue. Of course, the vice president has been a key voice on this issue, and Democrats see it as a galvanizing one for voters. And, of course, she is trying to capitalize here too on her edge in the polls that show that she does have an advantage over former President Donald Trump on this issue of reproductive rights. But in addition to that, she has sought out advice. She has the advantage of being able to also talk to Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama about this debate, both -- particularly Clinton, who has gone up against Donald Trump in the past. Now, all of this will culminate, of course, in that first face-to-face encounter tonight, one that the vice president has been waiting for, I'm told.",

And I'm curious to see how prepared these -- both these candidates are, how disciplined they are, how focused they are on putting out their message.Because Harris is absolutely going to say, let me finish or I'm talking or stop interrupting. And Trump has a perfect line for that, which would be, if he was paying attention, yes, you're talking. You're always talking. And what the American people want is doing. And you're not doing enough. And there's so many of these types of responses that Trump can do. And in his case, what she can do to him is, for all the mothers out there and the daughters and the sisters and the nieces and the grandchildren, stop interrupting and start respecting. And that's a really powerful statement for her advantage, which is among women. Both of these candidates have clearing weaknesses that I have not seen in a debate situation like this, but both of them have go-to lines and go-to strengths. In Trump's case, his advantage is on the issues, on the policies. In Harris' case, her advantage is her character and her persona. So whichever candidate gets the focus on that advantage is the candidate who wins.",

In fact, I could make the argument that if Trump does try to say that, he's actually helping Harris, rather than hurting her. We asked the public, can you name one thing that Kamala Harris has done that's had a meaningful measurable impact on you? And 70 percent could not.

And Trump is at his weakest and Harris is at her strongest when she's talking about abortion, because that's what turns out younger women.Harris' strongest addition to what Biden was doing was among women 18 to 40. And to keep them, the abortion issue is so important, and for women 55 and older, the number one issue is health care. So that's where she's at her strength. But there are a lot of women who care about inflation. In fact, inflation is the number one issue for the female voter, and that's where Trump is strongest. So for him to talk about shopping for gas, food and fuel, shopping for a house, that every woman wants to have a home, a home, a place to call their own, and under the Biden administration, it's become incredibly expensive, that is where Trump does best among these voters. So, in the end, you talk about the issue where you're strongest. You talk about the attribute where you can make a difference. And Trump should be talking about the failures of the Biden administration. And Harris should be talking about the failures of Donald Trump. In fact, in a single sentence, do you really want this chaos again and again for the next four years? And Trump responds with, are you better off today than you were four years ago? They're so equally matched. They're so -- America is so evenly divided that I would argue that tonight's going to be the most important night in American politics, potentially, of the lifetime of you and me.",

The Russians are saying that they took down more than 140 Ukrainian drones overnight. They claim they have thwarted that attack. However, it appears as though the Ukrainians caused some pretty substantial damage. One of the things that we have to point out is that the Ukrainians just about a week ago also launched a really large drone attack against Russian regions, but really this time one of the focal points was the Russian capital. The Russians saying they took down some 20 strike drones there. However, there was one strike that killed a 46-year-old woman and that hit happened right next to one of Moscow's main airports. It disrupted, of course, flight traffic at that airport, but also at two other airports in the Moscow region as well that has a fourth airport in the north of the city that apparently was still operating. The Ukrainians, of course, for their part have been saying that they believe that the Russians are using their airports also for logistics purposes to fuel their war against Ukraine. And at the same time, of course, the Russians also have unleashed a massive aerial campaign against targets in Ukraine, Ukrainian cities, Ukrainian critical infrastructure, but the Ukrainians now showing that they are able to punch back. And one of the things that they say is one of their main focal points is trying to increase their long-distance strike capabilities.
