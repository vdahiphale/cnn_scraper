Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour at the United Nations in New York, where more than 100 world leaders are gathering to discuss pressing world issues, from climate to grinding poverty. President Biden called for cooperation in the face of these challenges. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  My fellow leaders, we gather once more in an inflexion point in world history. With the eyes of the world upon all of you, all of us, as president of the United States, I understand the duty my country has to lead in this critical moment, to work with countries in every region, ranking them in common cause, to join together with partners who share a common vision of the future of the world.

The Ukraine war dominate so much of the agenda here in the Assembly, in the halls and corridors of power. Is it so diverting attention from other vital priorities, like climate change or promoting global equality? Ireland's Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, told fellow leaders, we are not where we need to be in meeting these sustainable development goals. And he's joining me now for an exclusive interview outside.

Bonds and stocks were sold with deceptive material, false promises. Banks failed with great regularity, and when they failed, you lost all your savings almost overnight. Mutual funds, main stay of our current investment life were basically private piggy banks for the brokerage firms that sponsored them. So, that was the world that FDR knew.

And he laid out the specific financial reforms that he intended to implement. You know, there's a lot of conventional wisdom that no one really knew what he planned to do in the new deal. He was kind of vague. And that really all he had to do was not be President Herbert Hoover and he would get elected. But the evidence from the newspaper coverage of his campaign just does not support that at all. He was explicit. He was going to regularity stock changes. He was going to improve the regulation of banks. He was going to make sure that securities were sold with honesty and truth, not with deception. He was going to make sure giant holding companies couldn't stuff all sorts of overhead cost on the backs of their consumers. He was very explicit. So, you know, I think we -- because of so much that happened in Roosevelt's career as president, one of the most eventful, probably in this country's history, the role of financial reform in the very early days of his campaigning and of his presidency has been, kind of, obscured. And part of what I wanted to do with this book was correct that. To show how central financial reform was to Roosevelt's thinking and for a good reason, Walter, that's still ran today. He was firmly convinced that a healthy democracy required a healthy economy.",

And the moment that Joe Kennedy saw, and perhaps more clearly, because of the world he occupied, was an America that was just about to come apart between the angry demands on the left, a rising interest and communism and socialism, and even scarier forces on the right. People who were looking at fascist authorities in Germany and in Italy and saying, maybe that's what we need right now. Stamp out these labor unions, you know, get business in charge. And Kennedy saw all of that is adding up to a time of, perhaps, terminal unrest in the United States. He felt it was essential that democracy show it could work in this moment. It could address this economic crisis. He said once, I would -- I decided in those days I would give half of what I had to be able to enjoy the other half under law and order.

As youknow, Walter, when Roosevelt was sworn in on March 4, 1933, we were in the midst of the most serious banking crisis the country had ever experienced. Around 3:00 in the morning on the day Roosevelt was sworn in, New York became the final state to shut its banks. The -- they were being shuttered across the country to protect them from panicky runs by their customers. And with the banks shut, particularly the money center banks, the stock exchange closed, the commodity exchanges closed. The financial machinery of the country had come to a dead stand still by dawn on in inauguration day. So, job one for Roosevelt was to get those banks open again. And the tale of how he did it, to me, is one of the best bits of the book. It was really remarkable. The lessons he brought from his governorship were brought to bear. He understood that the banks were in trouble not because people didn't trust the new deal, they were in trouble because people didn't trust the banks. And so, his idea was to intervene a bank moratorium, to give regulators in every state and in the Treasury Department time to sort which banks were strong, which were weak, which needed new capitol. What could be done to rescue them. And then he had a fire side chat, the first of those radio addresses to the American public that became so famous was on the banking crisis. And he explained to them in just every day kitchen table language how the banking system worked. How it had gotten in trouble. What he was doing to try to fix it. And what they should do when their banks reopen. And he assured them that any bank that reopened after this moratorium could be trusted. And so, within 10 days, banks started to reopen. And in defiance of Herbert Hoover's predictions, people lined up to put money back in. So, it was a remarkable display of how much in the infusion of confidence could matter just as much as an infusion of capital.",

He bragged -- President Trump bragged in his 2018 state of the union that he'd done more than any administration in history to reduce financial regulation. And that's not just Trump hyperbole, he did, and he will again. His track record was to put appointees in charge of regulatory agencies who were openly hostile to the mission of those agencies.

So, we've got to have people who are committed to financial protection, to investor protection, but who are going to work together to produce with industry. A modernized financial reform that can continue Roosevelt's work to have a Congress full of people ready to tear all this stuff down would be disastrous. Because we've got our 401(k) plans, our pensions are tied up in the stock market. Our mortgages are important to our financial security.
