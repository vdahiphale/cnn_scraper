Hezbollah claimed the targets included the Ramat David air base and a defense factory outside Haifa. But it appears those rockets that weren't intercepted hit other areas, causing a few injuries and some damage to property, while Israel continues to strike targets in southern Lebanon, more than 300 between Saturday and Sunday. In Beirut, Hezbollah held a funeral for Ibrahim Aqil, one of the group's senior commanders killed, along with more than a dozen other militants in an Israeli air strike on Southern Beirut Friday. The strike also killed more than 30 civilians, including women and children. At the funeral, Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassim vowed that Hezbollah's strikes deep inside Israel were an installment in what he called a battle without limits, and said, despite the pager in walkie talkie attacks and Friday's strike on Beirut, the group will continue to fire into Israel.

They're getting to know more about her. And most importantly, I think when you step back and think about where we were in this election just a few months ago, poll after poll show that voters were extremely dissatisfied with their choices when it was a rematch between President Biden and former President Trump. They wanted to vote for -- well there are many voters who wanted to vote for anyone else, really, other than Trump or Biden. And Harris is actually giving voters that opportunity.

In fact, when then-candidate Trump debated Hillary Clinton in 2016 two out of their three debates were held in October. So it's not too late. It's just that, you know, doesn't want to I think remind a lot of voters, which is what happened during the debate, what it is that they don't like about him, you know, when he's abrasive, you know obviously going after Harris in very personal ways.

But when you get within -- when you get behind the curtain a little bit and go into the details, Trump's version of ending this war oftentimes what he and his advisers say is it would entail Russia essentially holding on to a fair amount of Ukrainian territory, which is of course a non-starter for President Zelenskyy and Ukrainians. So, you know, I think the concern is that Trump would not support Ukraine or continue to providing U.S. aid to Ukraine if he were back in the White House.

In a letter to Republican lawmakers, Johnson wrote \"Our legislation will be a very narrow, bare-bones CR including only extensions that are absolutely necessary.\" He said while it's not the preferred solution, it's what he called the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances. The trimmed down bill excludes any mention of the Save Act, a Trump- backed proposal that would require people to show proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote despite the fact that that already happens because its illegal for non-citizens to cast a ballot. That measure was included in the previous spending bill, which House Democrats rejected last week. Top Democrats say they're ready to pass this stripped-down, stop-gap bill.
