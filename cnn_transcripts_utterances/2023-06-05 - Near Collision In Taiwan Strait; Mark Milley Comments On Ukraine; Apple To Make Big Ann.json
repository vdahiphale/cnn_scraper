This is the moment the two warships nearly collided. We're freezing the video so you can just see how close the two vessels really got. The Pentagon says it was within 150 yards, forcing the U.S. ship to abruptly slow down to avoid a direct hit. CNN's Anna Coren joins us from Hong Kong, tracking the very latest on this.

Within hours of the incident, China's defense minister accused the U.S. of provocation and creating chaos in the region.
