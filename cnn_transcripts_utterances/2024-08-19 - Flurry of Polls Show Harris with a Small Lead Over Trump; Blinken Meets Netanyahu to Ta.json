It is 08:00 a.m. there in the Windy City, here in New York City, it is 09:00 a.m. I'm Erica Hill. Good to have you with me. This is \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next two hours, while the Democratic Party is touting united by a unified front. Protests over the war in Gaza paint a different picture. This as the U S Secretary of State is back in the Middle East urging a ceasefire, and Ukrainian troops forging deeper into Russia now as the tide of that war shifts. The markets here in New York set to open in just about 30 minutes from now. To give you a quick look at the futures there, up slightly a little bit of green never hurts on a Monday morning. Of course, the S&amp;P coming off its best week since 2023 now. So, we'll continue to watch those again the opening bell just about 30 minutes from now here in New York. Anticipation, enthusiasm and some pressing questions for Democrats as their convention opens tonight in Chicago. By the time it wraps on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris will be the party's official presidential nominee. Before getting to that moment however, prepare yourself for a who's who of democratic heavyweights who will take the stage. You see some of the lineup there among them former presidents and first ladies, and of course, the man Harris hopes to succeed in the White House, President Joe Biden, who will deliver his speech tonight. All of this looming over what should be a week of celebration inside that convention hall. Looming outside is the war in Gaza and the enduring anger over continuous U.S. support for Israel among many Americans. Protests in Chicago started over the weekend. Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian activists are expected to march outside the convention security perimeter throughout the week. CNN Politics Senior Reporter Stephen Collinson, joining me now from Chicago. So, Stephen, in your latest analysis online, you talk about the elevation of Harris, seemingly overnight, saying it mark, sort of the most audacious power place in modern political history. And in your words, an astonishing mood shift. There's a lot of focus on that mood, on that vibe, if you will. And the question of course, of whether it can last, how it lasts? Does it seem there's a plan for that to sustain it?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that is going to be the most interesting thing. Vice President Kamala Harris has had a verystrong start. She has now rolled out her economic plans, a very populist message. I think she will certainly get a boost from the Republic -- the Democratic Party uniting behind her all of those former presidents and key officials and first ladies that you mentioned. I think the next thing we will look to after this week, because we're assured that she will come out of this probably a lot stronger, at least among Democratic voters, is the debate with Former President Trump, the Republican Nominee, on September the 10th. I think that will be the key determining factor into whether she can keep this momentum going. And this, of course, is a very condensed campaign. There will only be a couple of months at that point until the election. So, if she can continue her strong start, that will put a lot of pressure on the former president. We're already seeing polls now showing her moving, at least in the national picture, several points ahead.",

Before I let you go, there is a lot being made of the protest, which already started, of course, over the weekend outside of the DNC in Chicago. Two questions to that are -- how large is this group of protesters, in terms of a voting bloc? And how much impact could that then have? Is there a firm sense of those numbers and that impact?",

We saw in the primaries, tens of thousands of voters in some states decidingnot to vote for President Joe Biden in a largely uncontested race as a protest vote at his solidarity for Israel as the war in Gaza went ahead with thousands of Palestinian casualties. I think it's a really interesting question over whether that will also apply to the vice president and in a general election race, which, of course, is separate from a primary? If she can create enough momentum, for example, in the crucial swing state of Michigan, she may lose some progressive and Arab American voters because she's associated with the administration's position on Israel. But if she can get a bigger turnout in places like Detroit, for example, in the cities, and then, to some extent, cut down Trump's margins in rural areas. The power of the dissident vote, if you like, on the Gaza question may be a little bit more muted that it would have been had President Joe Biden been on the ticket. But it's something we're going to have to watch very closely. Her polling in swing states suggests that she's doing better than Biden, so it may not be quite such a massive issue for her at the ballot box in November.",

All of this, of course, coming as the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is in Israel. And as he's warning now, this moment could, in fact, be the final chance to secure a ceasefire and to get the Israeli hostages' home. CNN International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv, as is our State Department Reporter Jennifer Hansler, good to see both of you. Jennifer, I want to start with you. Secretary Blinken, in the region, meeting with a number of officials, but of course, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They met for about three hours. What do we know about that.

I mean, I think -- you knowthere were several things that happened yesterday evening, just as Secretary Blinken was arriving into Israel, you had Hamas putting out its statement, with which seems to hint at a broad rejection, although that's probably partly posturing ahead of talks, but it doesn't indicate that they have any positivity at the moment. You had a barrage of missiles coming in from Hezbollah in the north, from Lebanon into the northern parts of Israel, and you've had more barrages today, actually killing one IDF officer and critically wounding another, lightly injuring three others with smoke inhalation. And as well -- you know it was round about the same time that Secretary Blinken landed here, within an hour or so of him being on the ground, that that terror -- that terror attack, happened alone it appeared to be suicide bomber. He was spotted walking down a street here with a backpack on his back, and then the explosives went off a massive blast. Authorities here have taken that seriously enough to put up the alert level for people, but I think to a degree, people don't really need to hear from the police. The alert level has gone up. This has shaken the residents of Tel Aviv. It's almost two decades since there was a suicide type attack in the city here. There have been other sorts of attacks, but not a suicide bomber. So that's a level of concern people have here. And that, again, is indicative of the tensions the police here are trying to track down precisely who the attacker was, precisely where he came from. Very likely they'll be on top of that already. And critically, was he working alone? Could there be more attacks? So absolutely, and the notion of a last chance to get the hostages back. I think that speaks to the fact that the conditions that they're being held in, if a deal doesn't happen now, and things fall apart because of an escalation, the chances of a deal could be so far off in the future, their chances, the hostages\\ chances of survival in these conditions, could just be dwindling to zero.",

It's very clear at this point that while Ukraine is making progress, the pace has slowed quite a bit since that first week of the incursion, where clearly, they were driven forward by the element of surprise. Russia was sort of blindsided by the whole thing. Now Russia is, you know, at least making an attempt to defend, if not effectively counterattack and push Ukraine out. But Ukraine is, as you said, the operative words being reinforcing its position. We see clear elements of consolidation here. They have set up a military administration, essentially a military office in the town of Sudzha, which they now claim to have cleared the Russians out of completely they have been attacking bridges. There are at least two bridges that Ukraine, we believe has now destroyed across the River Seine, which runs east to west through the Kursk region, some 50 or so kilometers north of the town of Sudzha that will be to try to stop Russia bringing in more reinforcements and supplies. And there's talk of this sort of buffer zone, security zone, which they hope to keep hold of to stop Russian attacks back across the border into Ukraine. But meanwhile, of course, Russia, we know, bringing in reinforcements from various areas of Ukraine, much less so from the Donetsk region. And that is very likely, because this is where they're making their biggest push now, around the town of Toretsk which is a, you know, a sort of small strategic town, and even more so, towards Pokrovsk which is a much bigger military hub, where the military administration there is now really stepping up evacuations. They are giving people one to two weeks maximum to leave the 53,000 people still there, and families with children are now being forcibly evacuated because they say they are now in range of Russian heavy weapons. So, this would be a pretty big blow for Ukraine if Russia was to take that city.",

Mr. Biden is expected in that speech to tout the record he and Vice President Kamala Harris have achieved. Now for her part, the Vice President is facing her biggest stage yet, an important opportunity to, of course, deliver her message to fellow Democrats and to voters watching at home, but also to address some lingering criticisms, including the bitter debate of the administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a CNN Political Analyst and White House Correspondent for \"The New York Times\" who has covered Kamala Harris for nearly four years, traveling with her to Europe, Asia, Africa, and of course, across the U.S. His most recent piece is titled A vice presidential learning curve, how Kamala Harris picked her shots. As always with me now, nice to see you, my friend. So, as we look at this, it's a great piece from you and Peter Baker, and I love the way you describe some of Kamala Harris in terms of the way she's been approaching this job, deliberate, disciplined, cautious at times, risk averse, and a team player who wasn't always sure her team had her best interests at heart. How much of that still rings true in this moment for her? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I do think a lot has changed. You know, over these past nearly four years, we are absolutely at a moment where, now the Vice President has captured, you know, so much momentum for the Democratic Party has the support of this White House, and the west wing has found her footing on, you know, issues, specifically after the Supreme Court decision, she on Dobbs, she became a leader in terms of abortion rights. But in terms of this arc, in order to describe the arc, you have to talk as well about the first year, in the first two years, and I remember talking to some of her allies that had supported her since her days in California, that were concerned that she had been sort of strapped with intractable issues addressing the root cause, causes of migration, as well as trying to find a way on voting rights with such a slim majority in Congress and as well, that she was not being set up for political wins by this administration. I thought it was interesting that while we were reporting this story, that the Former Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, even said that, look, the vice president was doing work behind the scenes, but he said that the White House could have done a better job to amplify some of that work. The question I've had throughout these past four years is, why was it behind the scenes? Why weren't voters sort of seeing some of that work that we're seeing now and that you're also seeing and this moment in the campaign trail?",

KANNO-YOUNGS: That is -- it's interesting Kate said that that is so Kamala Harris. I mean, in my reporting, even for the story we were talking about over the past four years, this is somebody that has not always wanted to sort of, or felt the need to lean into solely her identity, her historic nature of her role. She's a prosecutor. She's a lawyer. This is somebody that wants to be judged off merit the evidence that she has displayed. I remember traveling with her to Ghana, actually, and she delivered a speech at the Black Star Gate. And that was a time where she leaned into sort of the historic nature of her role more so than I had seen before. But this is somebody that is want to show that she has the policy chops as well.

The leading U.S. presidential candidates, meantime, have been touting their plans to lower costs for Americans. Some economists were warning that their ideas could actually have the opposite effect. In fact, two analyzes have found Kamala Harris' proposed tax subsidies and federal program expansions could increase the deficit by about $2 trillion. Higher debt they say could actually mean higher interest rates, and as for Donald Trump, 16 Nobel Prize winning economists have slammed his plans to extend tax cuts and hike tariffs on imported goods, saying those proposals could, in fact, reignite inflation and hurt America's global economic standing. For more now, I'm joined by my colleague, Julia Chatterley. So, Julia, as we look at each of these plans and these proposals, give us a better sense of what they're each offering.",

But it's no surprise to me, having heard what we heard last week from both candidates, that a lot of economists are wringing their hands now and saying, what on earth is taking place? Just to give you a sense again, of Kamala Harris' potential policy plans, she was talking about support for building 3 million new homes. The challenge with that is we know, just on a very basic level, we don't have the construction workers at this stage. $25,000 worth of support for first time homebuyers. That's a direct cash giveaway. Just on a basic level, that will add to inflation. The belief is that would just add that money to the purchase price of houses, the tax credits for children or for parents, a big bumper on $6,000 for the first year of life for low-and middle-income families as well. I was trying to do the math in my mind, on Thursday of, sorry, on Friday of last week, and I sort of gaged around 1.5 trillion dollars addition to the deficit. The key to remember is that this is over 10 years, so it's not an instant hit when you're thinking about inflationary terms. But over the course of a 10-year period, it feels inflationary if you're increasing your deficit and not funding it, it is going to mean higher interest rates because you have to borrow that money and you have to incentivize people to lend to you. Trump, on the other hand, you said it. I can go through all of his individual policy plans and proposals, but it's all about the tariffs. When he's talking about 10 to 20 percent tariffs on a whole host of imported goods, it's no surprise that people are looking at this and saying, hang on a second, as Kamala Harris described it, it's a national sales tax. It's something that's paid by U.S. companies as they import goods, and they then pass it on to consumers. That's going to mean higher prices. I didn't even talk about the price gouging plans from Kamala Harris too. But the fear with that, it will actually cause shortages of food and raise prices for consumers too.

You add that to his immigration restrictions, which will also have an inflationary wage impact, they're talking about a 1.1 percentage point increase in inflation next year. Now I don't think that's big enough, based on what we've got to see the Federal Reserve having to hike rates further, but it will definitely slow them down in bringing rates down, and that's going to be a problem for borrowers all across the country. So, Erica, for me, that's the real kicker. If you can soften that blow somehow, economists perhaps will sit down in their seats.

Youknow, up until last season, no club side in England won the top flight title for four straight seasons. Now they're trying to further extend their own record. A wonderful start from city on Sunday, they beat their rivals Chelsea in Chelsea's own backyard. It was all very comfortable 2-0. You'll never guess Erica, who's good for city.
