Sidney Powell is being accused of a variety of things, mainly involving voting machines and this election breach in Coffee County.And they're saying this is like oil and water. These two schemes don't go together. They shouldn't go to trial alongside each other. That Chesebro didn't have any direct communication with Sidney Powell, and essentially he should be allowed to go forward on this alone. And Chesebro, of course, has entered a not-guilty plea as has Sidney Powell. We now have 10 of the 19 defendants in this case who have filed not- guilty pleas, waived their arraignments. Just today, we got Ken Chesebro, Harrison Floyd, Scott Hall, Mike Roman and Bob Cheeley all entering their not-guilty pleas.

It is in line with what we've seen pre- pandemic, and it signals a continued cooling of the labor market. 187,000 jobs added in August, and June and July's numbers were actually revised down by over a hundred thousand jobs, so a softening in those months even greater than what we saw.The unemployment rate, as you mentioned, though, ticking up from 3.5 percent to 3.8 percent, and that is because of what you heard President Biden talk about there. You have more people coming off the sidelines. Labor force participation rate is up and that means that more people are in the labor market looking for jobs. Now the industries that saw the biggest gains in terms of jobs added are construction, health care, leisure and hospitality. Those all saw tens of thousands of jobs added. And then some of the sectors that we saw job losses are the sectors that we've heard about in the news recently. So you have trucking, a loss of 37,000 jobs, that's because one company here in the U.S., Yellow trucking, went under, laid off 30,000 people. You see that reflected in those numbers. And then if you've been following the actors' and the writers' strikes over the past couple weeks, you see those numbers reflected in motion picture and sound production. That's the ripple effect, 17,000 jobs lost there. The Fed has a duty ahead of them to figure out whether or not this report is good enough to pause interest rates, Alex. We'll find out at the end of September when they have their meeting and see if they're going to take that pause or continue to raise rates to get inflation under control. Alex?",

And then there are a number of conservatives who say they don't want disaster aid to be linked to Ukraine aid. That is something that the White House has requested and that there's been early discussions about attaching that to a spending bill all that remains to be seen. But we should point out here, Brianna, that Kevin McCarthy doesn't actually need the support of hardline conservatives to get something like that over the finish line because, presumably, it would have Democratic support. But the challenge for McCarthy is that he also doesn't want to enrage those very conservatives who could force a vote to oust him as speaker at any given moment. So it's a very tricky balancing act for Kevin McCarthy. He's been working in recent weeks behind the scenes to try to convince them to back off.

And it's very indicative of the campaign realizing and DeSantis supporters realizing that this is a critical moment and something has to change as we get closer and closer to the Iowa caucuses.

When you look at polling around Biden, Democrats tend to point to the age issue as a reason why they want to see someone else other than Biden as the nominee.

That's why we saw the statement that came out saying this is how it operated with dehydration and so forth.
