Like me, he's a senator from Ohio. He's had an interesting journey, you know, started out kind of as a -- as a never Trumper, I think he even voted for Evan McMullin for President in 2016.But his sense said, I was wrong about Donald Trump. Now, his journey is not that much different than a lot of other Republicans who didn't support Donald Trump in 2016, who have now mostly come around to supporting him. And he has become one of the high priests of Trumpism and of MAGA, inside the Republican Party and in American politics, he's very young. And so, choosing someone like this for vice president is a clear signal of a passing of the torch when Donald Trump finally exits the stage. Whenever that happens to be, obviously Vance would be in a position to carry it forward.",

      "sentences": "Who's been a very, very vocal supporter of his. The thing with Vance is this. Yes, he has kind of taken up the Trumpist mantle of populism, a very different direction that the Republican Party is going.But having worked for Vice President Pence and seeing how they interacted in the White House, that what Trump wants in a vice president is not someone who's going to outshine him, not someone who's going to drive more headlines than him, who's going to get more attention when he travels on the world stage. I've always been skeptical of this pick for that reason. We also know that loyalty is a big factor. And I think it's hard to be truly convinced that somebody who called him America's Hitler as recently as 2016, a moral disaster and reprehensible is truly a convert to Trumpism. Now, I would not rule out a wild card here, but there is -- I also think he's a bit of a risky pick. I think that he's extremely polarizing. He doesn't add anything Trump himself doesn't have. But he does have the family support and that's big.",

I'm not sure that J. D. Vance is somebody who gets you there as you're thinking about what a vice presidential nominee can add to your ticket.I think, you know, as Alyssa was saying, I mean, he really doubled down on some of the most alienating things about MAGAism for that universe of people. So, I think, you know, it is -- it is an interesting choice. He's certainly somebody who, you know, has a big megaphone and can go out there and carry the -- carry the flame, carry the banner for Donald Trump. I'm not sure that he actually does the persuasive work that I think ultimately is where the selection is going to be decided. I absolutely agree that I think there's still a dark horse candidate out there. I still think, you know, I'm sure I'll be -- I'll be shouted down later. But I still think Nikki Haley is a possibility here. You had Donald Trump, you know, come out of the events this weekend, say he wants to put forward a unifying message. He said, he's alluded to the fact that his choice is going to be a surprise. If you want to -- if you want to send a message that you're about unifying --",
