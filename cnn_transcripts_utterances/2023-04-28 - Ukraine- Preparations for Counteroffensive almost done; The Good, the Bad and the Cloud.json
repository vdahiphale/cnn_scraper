And just ahead on today's show Ukraine underattack, Russia launches a wave of deadly airstrikes on Kyiv and other cities. The largest in months, more than a dozen people killed will have a live report. Plus, ceasefire extended Sudan's warring generals agreed to a fresh truce, but clashes still being reported across the country. And in business news, tech turbulence, Amazon warning of slowing cloud computing growth, and so out with its largest quarterly loss ever we'll discuss with tech Analyst Dan Ives. U.S. inflation numbers also out this is the Feds preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE index, it eased a bit year over year but so clearly well above the Fed's 2 percent target 4.6 percent You can see there, the rise month over month coming in as expected all of this ahead of the Central Bank's critical policy meeting next week. And as markets digest all of this data we've got a softer U.S. open on tap their banking jitters also helping pressure the major averages you can see the S&amp;P, NASDAQ and DOW all off between about a quarter of a percent too, let's call it a quarter of a percent. Europe also mixed disappointing Eurozone GDP numbers hitting sentiment there. Asia meantime, higher the NIKKEI jumping almost 1.5 percent after the Bank of Japan's latest policy statement Chairman at the helm but no big policy changes here see NIKKEI up about 1.4 percent, HANG SENG about a quarter of 1 percent, lots to get to you today. But we want to begin with the latest from Ukraine. A wave of Russian missile attacks on Kyiv seas including Dnipro and Uman. Missiles hit residential buildings early Friday morning killing at least 17 people, some of them children. Nic Robertson has the details now.",

They say they're not going to stop searching here until they've gone through everything and turned it over all the debris here. 109 people registered living in this building. And as I'm talking to you here, behind --, there's a line of people just waiting here to find out what's happened to their loved ones. What's happened to their friends, a lot of emergency workers here? The Ukrainians sadly are getting all too experienced about clearing up after Russian strikes like this 21 of the 23 missiles Russia fired into Ukraine last night went to center. This is what happens when just one gets through. And this is the fear that we've been hearing from neighbors here. Not knowing if this is going to happen again. A lady who lived in the building right here told me she heard the bush of the missiles put her kids in the bathtub, put a blanket over their house and just hope that they will see the daylight come up in the morning.",

They've dug trenches; they sent a lot of people to those areas. And so some analysis thinks that if Ukraine gets bogged down in a war of attrition along that long defensive line, it could potentially find success much harder to reach its potential for victory here is to move fast. And we've heard a lot of pinpoint strikes over the past week or so particularly high value Russian targets yesterday, a lot in Novomoskovsk, some in Melitopol as well. And that many I think assess is a way of trying to soften up Russia's defenses here quite what else may be happening. As we hear this increased drumbeat towards Ukraine beginning this counter offensive is unclear. But as I say, it's up to Kyiv really to show to its western partners here who've supplied training, weaponry financing for a counter offensive key of and so much of NATO want to see to be decisive, to be able to affect something relatively quickly and not get caught in a long war of attrition that ultimately may play into the blundering sort of mass nature of Russia's force in that area.",

But to get here, they first have to get to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. And that is a 500-mile journey from Khartoum to the east of the country, in the middle of a war zone in the best of times. That's a 12-hour journey but right now, it's taking up to 30 hours, at least one person told CNN, and when they get to Port Sudan, they have to try and get on one of these Saudi ships that's coming across the Red Sea here. So far, the Saudis say they've evacuated at least almost 3000 people, only about 100 were Saudis. The rest were from 80 different nationalities, including Americans and nationalities from all over the world. So that is one key operation that's getting as many people as possible out of Sudan. It's not just foreigners who are trying to leave Sudan; many Sudanese people are trying to leave as well. Some of them go to the Egyptian border, or to Chad, or to South Sudan, or to Ethiopia, but a lot of them are heading to that Port Sudan rather than over here to Jeddah because then they can go into different parts of the world. So the American government still insists that it's still not safe to coordinate an evacuation of private U.S. citizens. That's why so many people are making across to Port Sudan and over here, but other countries like France and Germany and the Indians, the Chinese have run some evacuations from inside Sudan or to Port Sudan. That's one way why you see so many people coming over here to Jeddah, and then to other parts of the world. After just two weeks of constant fighting, so many people already killed more than 500. It just doesn't seem like this is about to come to a close anytime soon, Rahel.",

And turning to business news, that cloudy picture for the cloud Amazon shares under pressure pre market after it warned of softer growth and cloud computing, you can see shares are off about 2.2 percent pre market. The same issue is also facing Microsoft's cloud unit. Amazon however, back in the black in a very big way after last year's losses, also strong guidance for the quarter as well. Clare Duffy joins me now. So Clare, this list is not just back in the black. This is a pretty big swing from a loss of 3.8 billion in the quarter a year ago to now a profit of 3.2 billion in this first quarter. So how did they do it? What do we learn?",

It has been nixing products that weren't getting traction, for example, a Telehealth service and some wearable products. And it's also been slowing its expansion of its physical retail stores. And you know, pause construction of its HQ2 and so the company has really been trying to cut back on costs. And at the same time revenue was up 9 percent year over year during the quarter and so sales are going strong. I think with a lot of these big tech companies, what you're seeing is this sort of continued recovery process from the switch up that happened where they were growing with really rapid speed during the start of the pandemic and then things really slow down in a way they didn't necessarily expect.

And it's been cutting back on the costs of sales and fulfillment. And so I think that part of the business is looking, you know, maybe even stronger than expected, what we are seeing is that it's businesses that are pulling back on their spending. And you've talked a little bit about this this week with all these economic reports. This is a broader trend. But that is really reflected in Amazon's cloud spending, which has seen growth decelerate and again, they said that they expect in the current quarter the growth to continue to decelerate and I'll be interested to see if the same thing will happen to its advertising business of some of these businesses that are trying to cut costs will also pull back in that area.",

They're the firewall between recession and --. And they're hanging in tough there, you know, they're not spending with people aren't spending with abandon, but they're kind of doing just what they need to do to keep the economy going forward. But the real kind of fault line in the economy think that this looks like it might be more of an issue is that businesses appear to be growing more cautious and starting to pull back their investment, spending money on equipment, information processing equipment, transportation equipment, that's down and weakening. And that may be a leading indicator to some layoffs down the road here. So I think if we're going to go into recession, it may not be consumer led, which typically is it may be in fact business -- which would be very unusual, but everything about this economy as you know, Rahel, we were discussing is unusual.",
