That storm right there is on the ground producing damage. We do know that it is a large and damaging tornado right now that just moved through Winnie and parts of Arkansas, just to the north west of Memphis, likely misses Memphis, but we'll keep watching that. Iowa City, big storm just to your northwest, was rotating for a while, tornado was on the ground. That thing just went on the ground since Ottumwa, Iowa, a long path. So, this area here from Chicago through Davenport all the way down to Louisiana and Mississippi, all part of the same system with EF-2, EF-3s and larger likely with this.

But outside of court, Wolf, we are seeing this immense security, these barricades all across the building. You have court officers that are standing guard. You have the NYPD here, which is standing guard outside the district attorney's office. This, Wolf, actually could be the location where Donald Trump walks into on Tuesday afternoon to surrender.

It involves a cooperation and a discussion between the United States Secret Service, the New York City Police Department, the court officers who are responsible for the security of the building, Trump's lawyers, the D.A.'s office and now the judge. Apparently, a judge has been assigned to this arraignment. And the judge will be able to dictate what goes on in his or her courtroom, whether there are cameras in the courtroom or not.And there's something of a conflict of interest at work here, too, Wolf. The U.S. Secret Service, they are part of DHS, as you pointed out, I was a protectee of the Secret Service as well, the Secret Service is responsible for the protectee's physical security. That is their sole focus. And so the Secret Service, if they had their way, Mr. Trump would enter through a back entrance. He would be escorted quickly into the courthouse for the basics of the arraignment and then he'd be escorted back out the backdoor again and go back up to Trump Tower. I suspect that former President Trump himself wants a much larger spectacle. He probably wants to be led through the front door. He wants to be able to be seen by the cameras, to be seen by his supporters, however many there are there. And so a lot of this is going to have to be between him and his own protection detail. And it will be a complex exercise. But I noted you had John Miller and Bill Bratton on earlier, former top leaders of the NYPD. The New York City Police Department and the Secret Service know how to do this kind of thing in Manhattan Island. This particular event is unprecedented, involving a former president, but we know how to handle U.N. General Assemblies. As you've noted, the NYPD knows how to handle high-profile defendants who are arraigned at 100 Centre Street. So, I'm confident that this will be a well- orchestrated, well-organized event with lots of security.",

No mention of peaceful demonstrations, if anyone is inclined to come out and demonstrate on his behalf, and I'm very concerned that some form of violence someplace could be inevitable as a result of this. His base may be shrinking but it only takes one or two, as you know.

Not only did the judge not grant Fox News, they're asked, which was that they be declared the winner ahead of a trial, but the judge is actually dismantling some of Fox's legal arguments in this 130-page decision.One of those arguments is that what was broadcast on Fox was opinion, so it's protected under the First Amendment. The judge says, no, no, no, no, no. He says -- he writes in his opinion, he says, the contact supports the position that the statements were not pure opinion where they were made by newscasters holding themselves out to be sources of accurate information. He rules that there were factual assertions or mixed opinion, which is a real blow to Fox News. But he even takes it a step further, Wolf, and he says that even if this was opinion, it's still not protected under the First Amendment because there was an allegation of a criminal conspiracy against Dominion. He writes in his opinion, he says, the statements also seem to charge Dominion with the serious crime of election fraud, accusations of criminal activity, even in the form of opinion, are not constitutionally protected. And I should note here, Wolf, that Fox has fought tooth and nail over the past couple of years to avoid this moment, to avoid going to trial, a judge now saying that this will go to trial in mid-April.",

That portion of the opinion is really historic together with the January 6th Committee report or that special grand jury report in Georgia, both also saying that the former president's claims were utterly false and ungrounded.

That brings you right over to Little Rock. And I know everybody has seen the damage photos and videos coming out of that area. I want to show you my graphics because we have a large and very significant tornado outbreak that's unfolding across the central us as we speak, and I want to bring it right in 12 states right now.

But the National Weather Service just issuing this information that downstream from this storm. Is conducive for more long tracked intense, significant tornadoes, and I'm looking at you. If you're in Nashville, Tennessee, they included that within this mesoscale discussion that meteorologists look to for information so getting into kind of a detail. This is the storm that we heard the sirens prompted a few minutes ago just north of Memphis, and it is this classic super cell structure that actually gets meteorologist fearful to see because what it's doing is this drawing into the environment and really tapping into just a very, very unstable atmosphere. We currently have eight tornado warnings with this widespread tornado outbreak that's unfolding. So taking you further north towards Chicago, line of thunderstorms for you, none of them warned. But just to your west, this is where it gets dangerous. This is where it gets serious. Every pink box you see is a tornado warning. So heads up Davenport, into the Millersburg region as well, as just to the north and west of West Point.
