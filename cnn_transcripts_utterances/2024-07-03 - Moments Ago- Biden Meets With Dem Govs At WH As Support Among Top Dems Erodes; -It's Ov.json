Plus, a whistleblower's new allegation that Boeing put parts painted red, that means bad, onto planes that it then delivered to airlines. Good evening, Jim Sciutto here sitting in for Anderson tonight. Democratic governors have just emerged from a meeting with the President at the White House, all voicing strong support for him and his candidacy. It's just the latest in a whole string of breaking news at the end of what was another difficult day for President Biden. Six days now since his halting performance on the CNN debate stage in Atlanta. Late today, a Democratic lawmaker told us this about the President's candidacy: \"It's over. We were just waiting for the announcement. He,\" meaning Mr. Biden, \"is not there yet. We'll take a bit of time to get there, but it's over.\" That's the view of one lawmaker. That was followed in rapid succession by word, as we said, of serious doubts setting in within the administration itself. A senior official characterized the erosion of support among Democrats as, quote, \"Waves crashing into the shore.\" Also breaking tonight, Democratic congressman Seth Moulton went public with his own doubt, saying in a statement that he now has, quote, \"grave concerns,\" unquote, about the President's ability to win in November, which in turn follows Arizona congressman Raul Grijalva today becoming the second lawmaker to call for the President to leave the race. And two new polls showing him falling further behind the former president. In the words of a Democratic lawmaker, I spoke with today, the campaign is at an acute stage. It is imperative over the next week that the President demonstrably show he has the energy and the ability to win the race and to do the job. And with all that as a backdrop, that meeting at the White House, which is where we begin tonight with CNN's MJ Lee. MJ, the meeting just wrapped up and from at least those three governors that we heard from there sounded like full-throated support. Do we know if that was a unanimous view among the governors?",

One adviser described it to me as simply sending the message that he's with her.However, as questions mount here in Washington about the future of the Biden candidacy, I am learning tonight that several Democratic advisers and party officials across the party are discussing contingency plans, that should he decide to not run, what would happen. And the plans, according to these Democrats, would be that he would throw his support behind Harris and urge other party leaders to do the same in hopes of avoiding a contentious Democratic convention fight. Now, all of that is hypothetical if President Biden does not make a decision to not run. He, of course, he says he is running. But Jim, all of this simply is raising a spotlight on Vice President Harris, who finds herself in a historic holding pattern. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So I look forward to hearing your views on where you see this going. Governor, if I could begin with you, you hear the support the President is getting from these Democratic governors tonight, at least the three who came out from the White House to speak about it. But you are hearing lawmakers, Democratic lawmakers who put their name to it, saying he should leave the race and others raising serious questions. Do you sense a direction as to where this is leaning right now? Because the President's own statements and the White House's own statements have been steadfast that he's staying in. HOWARD DEAN, (D) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think you have to take him at his word. The President has a great record for the last four years, including supplying a whole lot of jobs to red states that are not going to vote for him because he's the President of the united - of all Americans, not just the few. And I think he's decided to run. And that's - if he runs, decides to run, he's going to run because that's the way the Democratic apparatus works. I do think some things have emerged out of this that I find to be very encouraging. One is, should he not run, Harris actually looks very, very good. If she should become the nominee, I would suggest Roy Cooper or Josh Shapiro as a running mate. But I think Biden's going to run. And this is Biden's nomination. He's won it. He's done a great job for four years. And he also has the benefit of not being a convicted felon. So you can make - take your choice.

We've never deleted evidence. All you have to do is Google it and it's all over the Internet. But that should be a time when you make the case in response to that.

Does it have to be Harris? Are there no circumstances where the party could say, well, you know, this is a team effort here? We got to open it up and see who's the best candidate. ETIENNE: Well, Jim, I hate to disappoint. I don't know the inner workings of the party that much, but I've been told by the campaign that that is the case, that the money would be transferred to Harris. But here's the reality is, is, you know, big donor money, it matters, you know, because it does signal to other big donors, you know, where they should put - should they continue to invest in the campaign. But what matters most, it's not the end all be all, but what matters most is what we just saw at the end of the - this past weekend after the debate, which is that the President raised $33 million and that was from small donors, everyday Americans writing checks. And there's one thing I know having worked on four presidential campaigns, is you don't write a check to a campaign that you think is actually failing. So the fact that they've raised the most money that they ever had - have among grassroots everyday Americans over the past week is impressive and that says a lot. And that says that the American people have some level of confidence in this president and in this campaign. So we're in, you know, Reed stepping down, that what matters most and is a bigger indication of momentum and strength is these small dollar donors and they're there for the President.",

Now, these are both Republican women. The two Democrats in our group told us that they have decided not to vote for Donald Trump. They are considering a third-party candidate, but they haven't ruled out voting for Joe Biden yet.

It has also led to allegations from whistleblowers about the company's safety oversight. And now, CNN's Pete Muntean sat down with the latest whistleblower for that whistleblower's first TV interview, alleging the company knowingly used defective parts in its planes. Here's his report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If Everett, Washington is a Boeing company town, then Merle Meyers was a company man. A 30- year veteran of Boeing, Meyers says his job as a quality control manager put his kids through college. It is a family tradition. His late mother was a Boeing inspector, able to unilaterally decide if a new airplane just off the factory line was fit to fly.",

This is his first TV interview inspired by the January 5th door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9. Spray painted red, bad parts deemed not up to Boeing's standards are taken from Boeing's Everett plant and sent to its scrap facility in Auburn. But then one day in 2015, Meyers says a crate of bad parts were improperly sent back from Auburn to Boeing's Everett factory. Meyers alleges the practice continued for years, telling that more than 50,000 parts escaped Boeing quality control. MUNTEAN: 50,000 parts?",
