And that is the cinder blocks that make up a wall. It is a home foundation. And then just look above that and you see what's basically like a ski slope caked in mud. That is the mud slide that came down around 2:00 in the morning. We're going to follow it down here. You can see the foundation of the home. So the home, where is it? Out in the middle of the street here. It's been swept away. And you can see behind me this is all pretty thick mud as we're stepping around. This is a car that's been buried. We're told by one neighbor there were about five cars that were swept away, four homes damaged altogether. But these are some of the personal artifacts left behind here. You can see some of the lawn furniture that's been pushed aside. Fortunately, no one was inside this home at the time. We're told it was unoccupied. And the neighbors, though, were home, did experience the damage firsthand. And they're now trying to deal with this cleanup. I'm just showing you a little bit towards the street here. I won't push too close because I don't want to go off this hill. But it's a rushing almost river on this street. That's what it's becoming. And the debris has flown really from this hill down, and it's now going down the stream. You can see even -- Christie (ph), do you see the piano there? That's a grand piano just behind that local news photographer there, a grand piano that came out of this home. So what are we seeing around this area? This is obviously one of the worst-hit portions because of this storm. But let me show you some of the driving that we did to get to this portion of the Hollywood Hills and roads that are sometimes two, four lanes now down to one. And that's because, along the sides, you see a lot of the rocks that have come down. You see basically rivers running on each side, the current so strong that folks are having to figure out how to direct their own traffic, because, at this point, it's happened so suddenly that you don't have a lot of first responders out here trying to direct traffic because they're being called elsewhere. And it's really just too difficult to get to these positions at this point. But this is the concern that's going to last for several more hours now, Boris. You have got this mudslide and landslide concern and the flash flood warning that's going to continue here up until about 3:00 local as of now. But neighbors tell us, because of the rain that they have experienced over the past few weeks, they're worried that this ground is so soiled right now that the wetness is potentially going to cause even more of these mudslides and landslides to cause damage like you see behind me.",

And subsequent tests have identified a form of cancer. So we're being told that the king has commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which he's been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties. So we won't be seeing him. Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake state business and official paperwork as usual. So he remains head of state and will be able to carry out those king duties, but we won't be seeing him in public. I'm told the king is grateful to his medical team and the recent hospital procedure which made this diagnosis possible. And he remains positive, we're told, about his treatments and looks forward to returning to public duties. He's chosen to share this diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope that it may assist public understanding for those around the world who are affected by cancer. Additionally, a source telling me they won't be sharing any more exact details at this stage, but they do want to note that it's not prostate cancer, as some people (AUDIO GAP)... (CROSSTALK)",

And we should underline here that, according to Buckingham Palace, when King Charles went into the hospital, it was for, they say, a benign prostate enlargement. But this cancer diagnosis is a separate issue, according to the palace. Talk to us about why the king has felt this need to be transparent with the British public.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think there are two separate issues you can look at here.So he didn't necessarily have to announce that he was going in for a test for a benign enlarged prostate, because it wouldn't affect his public work. And they do feel that the royal family has a right to privacy, particularly when it comes to medical privacy. So that was very much announced because he wanted to raise awareness of the issue. And it had a huge impact, because there are a lot more inquiries to hospitals about prostate concerns. This, they did have to announce, because it is the head of state with a serious medical issue, which cancer is regarded as, of course. So it does affect how he may carry out his public work, which is why they're also emphasizing he is able to do his key constitutional duties, which are those of head of state, signing in new laws, opening Parliament. He will be able to -- the mechanics of the constitutional monarchy continue. So there won't be a threat to the public, but he won't be carrying out his other public duties, and where he's seen as a figurehead, as it were. It is interesting, I have to say, Alex, but, today, we had a note from Kensington Palace, which represents Prince William, saying that he would be resuming his public duties. He's been off work looking after his wife, who had an operation recently. And I think that the messaging there is that the Constitution does continue. Prince William will be stepping in for King Charles in his absence.",

I can say that, as an impartial journalist, because I follow him.And when you compare him to other royals, he's doing so much behind the scenes, but we also see him very much in public. So, this -- as you point out, in his early monarchy, more important than ever that he's seen out in public, establishing himself as head of state, and replacing Queen Elizabeth, who was iconic in her role, and they are very big shoes to step into. So, this is significant to his monarchy. He won't be able to represent the monarchy in the way he had hoped,and, as I say, huge amount of responsibility now for Prince William to step up and really show that the monarchy is still strong. We did see King Charles at the weekend, and he looked really healthy. It was just a still photograph of him, and that was sanctioned, I think, by the palace. So, I think, at the weekend, they felt very confident, and he looked very confident when he left the hospital. So, I think this would be a real shock to the family and to the palace, and there will be a lot of work behind the scenes to try to make sure the mechanics of the system continue, and that the king is still able to carry out that really crucial official paperwork, because, without the king being able to sign documents, the Constitution literally grinds to a halt. You can't bring in new laws. You can't appoint prime ministers. You can't get involved when the rare serious matters of the state. So, it is crucial. And they will, frankly, have to be considering, what does happen if the king gets more ill and isn't able to carry out even the essential duties? So, that would be where the regency would come into effect. And as an insurance policy, they will be considering that at this point, but that's a very well-rehearsed, regularly rehearsed practice anyway. So, I think that's just a matter of ticking a few books and expecting Prince William to very much step up. MARQUARDT:  And we are looking at live pictures outside Buckingham Palace. It is just past 6:00 p.m. in London right now, with the news from that palace that the king of England, the king of the United Kingdom, King Charles III, has been diagnosed with some kind of cancer. They are not saying what kind. He has just left the hospital several days ago after being treated for what they're calling a benign prostate enlargement, during which time they noticed a separate issue of concern. Max Foster, I'm going to ask you to stand by. We will get back to you when there's more news. In the meantime, I'm going to toss it over to Boris.",

That's why she was in Kenya when she became queen. No one knew. He passed away without anyone realizing it. He had the surgery actually at Buckingham Palace. They set up an operating theater in Buckingham Palace. It was so secret. And we see a completely different way of dealing with health with the royals. We were told that Kate was going into hospital, she would be there for some time, and that the king would be going to the same hospital. We were told when he was staying one more night. I think he said very clearly that he wanted other men to raise awareness of prostate cancer, but wants to -- not that he has a -- he wants to raise awareness of enlarged prostates and that condition. And now I think that -- although he's not saying now, we probably will be told at some point what kind of cancer the king is suffering from, and I think for the same reason.

This apparently raised a separate issue of concern, a form of cancer. The palace says that he remains wholly positive about his treatment. What do you make of that? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST:  Well, Boris, it seems like, in the course of his treatment for his procedure, surgical procedure for his prostate cancer, they discovered another problem. And when you're admitted to the hospital, you often get tests like a chest X-ray. So a chest X-ray might have found a lesion in his lungs. You have basic blood -- preoperative bloods obtained, so that might show that he's anemic and that might have led to a further workup.

But there is a level of privacy that any human deserves. And that is decided by the palace and by the king. So there may come a point when they do need to tell us more. But I think, probably, the only updates we will get is on progress, though, to reassure the public that he's getting better or to reassure them that there are systems in place to support the monarchy if he gets worse. And that, of course, is bringing in -- and Kate will tell you a bit more about this as an expert on the history. But there are there are accounts of the state that step up and take over the king's duties, if that's necessary. If, for example, he has to go into an operation, he's incapacitated, there has to be a system in place for the matters of state to be carried out. So, you will have the queen and Prince William and Kate and also Edward stepping in and Anne stepping in to carry out those official duties on his behalf. But, really, it's down to Prince William, who will be taking the lead if that does happen. So I think they're much more focused on that than revealing the exact details. And it could be that they don't want to -- it could be something that people associate as a very serious, degrading illness, and they might have it in check, and they don't want to worry the public that things are going to get much worse much more quickly than they actually are.
