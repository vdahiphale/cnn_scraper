Now they say the Justice Department request for a December start will come in the heat of Trump's presidential campaign. Sara Murray joins us on set with the latest. He was always a candidate when the charges were brought. You could argue the presidential campaign is happening now. What are we supposed to take from this filing?",

And in this filing they make clear, Trump and Walt Nauta's team, that they don't think that a trial can proceed fairly as long as Donald Trump is running for president of the United States. It would impact the outcome of the presidential election, as well as the ability for both Donald Trump and Walt Nauta to prepare for trial.So here's one of the lines in this filing that sort of cast - shows how they're casting this as, you know, Donald Trump versus Joe Biden, even though there's a special counsel in this case. They say proceeding to trial during the pendency of a presidential election cycle wherein opposing candidates are effectively, if not literally, directly averse to one another in this action will create extraordinary challenges in the jury selection process and limit the defendant's ability to secure a fair and impartial adjudication. So essentially it's going to be really hard to get a fair trial in the middle of a presidential election. They also say, look, there's a lot of evidence we have to go through, including so far at least nine months of security footage.",

Around 30 of these drones being targeted at both the Kyiv region, the capital where I am, as well as the southern port city of Odessa overnight. Almost all of them, those Iranian made kamikaze Shahed drones, they were almost all taken down we're told by Ukrainian air defenses. There was some damage to buildings here in the Kyiv region. At least two of the drones getting through in the port city of Odessa and hitting administrative buildings, we're told. [06Thankfully it appears that there have been no casualties. But as you note, Pam, this is coming at a time of this critical NATO summit. Ukraine hoping for some very concrete results from this summit. They're hoping to be told how and when they can expect to join the NATO alliance. But this morning, Pam, it is not clear whether Ukraine is going to be getting those answers. We heard earlier today from the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan saying to not expect a timetable for Ukraine to join the NATO alliance. He talked about reforms that Ukraine needs to undertake. And then just moments ago, Pam, a rather angry tweet from President Zelenskyy saying that they're starting to hear about certain wording being discussed in Vilnius without Ukraine. I want to read part of this frustrated tweet. He writes, it's unprecedented and absurd when time frame is not set, neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine's membership. While at the same time vague wording about conditions is added even for inviting Ukraine. It seems there is no readiness neither to invite Ukraine to NATO nor to make it a member of the alliance. He goes on to say, Pam, that this means motivation for Russia to continue its terror. Now, we have not yet been told whether President Zelenskyy will actually be attending the summit. An official tells our colleague Arlette Saenz that he is expected to meet with President Biden while there, but we - but President Zelenskyy has been clear, Pam, that he's not going to be going to Vilnius for fun, as he says. It is clear that they really do want concrete outcomes from this NATO summit. Pam.",
