We have to hope that this ceasefire will hold, but also anxiety, because we know that in 2006 once we reached a ceasefire and an end of war agreement, Hezbollah use this time, obviously, with Iranian support to build divisions and divisions of a terror army targeting at Israel.Both 200,000 rockets and the -- an army of Hezbollah operatives ready to raid Northern Israel.

For example, China makes a sneaker. A U.S. company buys it, pays the import tariff and then makes a choice, eat the cost, or pass it to you. Before the higher tariffs announced Monday night, Americans could expect to spend $2,600 more each year under Trump's original tariff proposal. Inflation is expected to rise by one percent.

But the mass deportation program, that is the other pillar really of his -- of his domestic agenda, is widely considered to be inflationary by reducing the labor force in key areas like construction and agriculture. So, you know, this was -- this was a challenge for the Harris campaign all the way throughout. I mean, you had analyses from Moody's and J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms consistently concluding that if Trump actually moved down the roads that he proposed, that prices would be more likely to go up than down in his presidency. And yet, for most voters, you know, the immediate comparison, their frame of reference was that prices were more affordable when Trump was president than when Biden was president.It was hard to get them to look forward, not back. I think Trump, you know, believes that perhaps, that he can bluster and move these other countries in this direction without actually imposing these tariffs, but he is obviously taking an enormous risk, both with the domestic economy and with U.S. international relations.",

We import over $1.3 trillion I believe, is the figure in 2023, of goods from these countries.So, if in fact, he does go forward with these tariffs, you are talking about a major impact on American consumers on a lot of different fronts. Auto industry in particular but, you know, agricultural products, apparel, toys. People would feel this in a lot of different ways. And one other point about this that's worth noting. This is not the only threat he has made toward Mexico. It's not only an economic threat. You know, explicitly and repeatedly during the campaign, he said he would pursue unilateral U.S. military action inside Mexico against the cartels, with or without approval from the Mexican government. And he also said he would use the U.S. Navy to, you know, to blockade Mexico to prevent the importation there of the precursors for fentanyl. So, there are a lot of different threats that he is, you know, kind of brandishing here already and it can lead to, I think, a very turbulent period. Might work out for him.
