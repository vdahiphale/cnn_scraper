He's basically getting questioned by the state about particular financial statements which come into question for this entire trial. But let's begin with the opening statements which were earlier today on the state's side, they basically presented a case to judge that Trump and his sons and Trump Org conspired together to commit years of fraud, inflating their assets in order to get better interest rates, better business loans and essentially said they knew that they were doing.They said they're going to call a bunch of witnesses to the stand. One of them you're very familiar with, it's Michael Cohen. He said that they will be called to the stand to show basically why -- they believe that they inflated these assets. If you can remember, this whole case was brought based on Michael Cohen's testimony to Congress where he said, just that. Now on the defense's side, the defense attorneys said what you already mentioned, that Trump has made his billions off of a real estate business empire doing good business, and doing it by the book, saying in sum, there is no illegality, there was no fraud. There are no victims. They even said that there were banks eager to do business with the Trumps. Also eager is Trump himself. We know that he wants to testify in this trial. We don't know when that's going to happen. But we do expect it. And I can tell you, Jake, the optics of this, as you've already shown your viewers, he's gone in and out of that courtroom to make statements to the press about what is happening behind closed doors. He, however, has not really acknowledged to the attorney general who made those statements at the courthouse steps right behind me, only acknowledging a little bit today but passing by her multiple times in this courtroom, only his son Eric Trump who is hitting behind him has gone over and shook her hand. But again, this is just a start of a very long civil trial we're expecting it to last about three months, Jake.",

There are no victims. Everybody got paid back.

You might have a John and a prostitute, where is the, quote/unquote, victim here?Our society is really built on a number of laws being on the books because society is offended and even though somebody has not been a so-called victim in a traditional sense, it is still nonetheless against the law. And that's the core of the prosecutions argument? It doesn't matter if there wasn't an ultimately, maybe even an insurance issue or a tax benefit, but they claim there was. The fact that you have engaged in fraudulent behavior, misstating, misrepresenting that which is actually objective, right? You know what this scare footage is and what the assigned cost per footage would be, square foot, and you've inflated it for a number of reasons. This trial today is less so about whether a fraud was committed, though, Jake, and more about what you sought to gain from that and that's where the notion of a victimless crime or not victimless is going to come into play.",

First, the one count found for the attorney general against Donald Trump, it doesn't matter if there is a provable victim or provable loss. That does matter with respect to the other six counts which are still at play in this trial.But, Jake, I think bigger picture, people may look at this case and say we're talking about tens and hundreds of millions of dollars of over-inflation, why is this only a civil case and not a criminal case? Now, I have to sort of put myself inside the mindset of the attorney general and the D.A., which is part of this case earlier, but I think the fact that there was no provable victim, there was not someone who was, say, swindled out of money, who was robbed, who was never repaid -- these were banks, made loans, got repaid with interest, still technically a civil violation. Could also technically be a criminal violation but it makes it a less appealing case to bring in the criminal context. So, that may be well why this is a civil case and not a criminal one.",

Despite, Mohammad bin Salman or MBS has denied direct responsibility. Khashoggi was Saudi born but a long-term resident of the United States, and a fierce critic of the oppressive Saudi regime, which is presumably why he was killed for his words, for his ideas. On October 2nd, 2018, Khashoggi went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get paperwork that would have allowed him to marry his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. He was never seen in public again. In the days ask weeks that followed, brutal details of his killing came to light, including his dismembering with a bone saw inflicted by Saudi agents sent by MBS, as was the premeditated plan to murder Khashoggi. What did not follow, however, was any serious effort to hold MBS directly accountable. In fact, MBS's only consolidated power since then. So, how does a world leader get away with ordering the murder of a renowned \"Washington Post\" journalist and U.S. resident? How does that happen? Well, a month after his murder, the U.S. sanctioned 17 Saudi government officials, but not him. Not MBS. Not the crown prince. A few days later, then President Donald Trump weighed in, and he sowed some seeds of doubt saying maybe MBS knew about it, maybe he didn't. A year after Khashoggi's killing, then candidate Biden promised to make Saudi Arabia a pariah nation. And when Biden took office in 2021, he ordered the release of that intelligence report, making it clear that MBS ordered the hit. Following that report, 76 Saudis were banned from getting U.S. visas, but MBS was not one of them. Some Saudis were also sanctioned, but again, you guessed it, MBS was not sanctioned. When asked why, Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
