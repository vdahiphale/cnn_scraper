They increased 3.3 percent on a year-to-year basis. Joining us now, we have Jared Bernstein, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jared, thank you so much for being with us. When you look at these new consumer spending numbers, do they signal to you that the Fed will not hike interest rates when it meets next month.",

We try to preserve their independence. We know how important that is. What we are seeing is a transition to steady, stable growth. And the inflation numbers we got today are in keeping with that. And we know the Fed watches those numbers very carefully. Probably one of the most important numbers is, if you look over the past three months, which is the right way to do it to get the recent trend in how inflation is moving, the PCE price index -- that's the one that came out this morning, and again, the one that the Fed watches most closely -- rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent. Now that is within spitting distance of pre-pandemic trends. So, look, the Fed is going to do what it's going to do. From our perspective, we want households to have some breathing room. We want their real wages to keep going up. This report is consistent with that.",

And now we're seeing real wage gains.Again, this is the interaction of that labor market I just described with consistently easing inflation. As real wages grow, consumers are able to go out there into the market and get what they want and what they need. Now we're in almost 70 percent consumer spending economy. So as long as the job market stays tight and people are getting real wage gains, we should expect to see solid numbers as we did this morning in that regard.",

When we start throwing around big numbers, we really have to base them on something.Now, one of the things I did about an hour ago, because I thought we might be talking about this, is I looked at credit card debt, the number you just mentioned, in relation to the disposable personal income, that's income after taxes. That's what people have to service that debt. In fact, it is below where it was before the pandemic. It is below its pre-pandemic share. It's around 5.5 percent, something like that. That is a historically low amount. That would suggest that debt service, what people have to pay to service their debt, is also low. And, yes, I looked at that too. And outside of the pandemic, when it was even lower, that's also at historically low rate. If you base these numbers on some of the other economic dynamics that are a lot more favorable, you see people are handily able to service their debt right now.",

Of course, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates that -- pretty quickly feeds into mortgage rates. Nobody should be surprised about that increase. I think the thing, from our perspective, that matters the most here is doing what we can to increase the supply of housing. That's not a weekly, quarterly, monthly effort. That's something we have to really get down to over the longer term. If you look at our budget, we have some really ambitious proposals to increase the supply of affordable housing. And I think that's one of the best things we can do in that space. The market is going to go trumble along in the way we described. I think that's all pretty expected.

Military family life comes with a number of financial hardships, like out-of-pocket housing expenses and moving costs. But we've also seen some alarming trends of food insecurity in the military.

They sued Marshall after he said this on a podcast last year.

MEAGAN BURROWS, STAFF ATTORNEY, ACLU'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM PROJECT: Yes, Jim, thank you so much for having me. So it is blatantly unconstitutional. Attorney General Marshall's threats, as we've alleged in our lawsuit, pose a number of constitutional violations. First of all, they violate our plaintiffs who are providers of comprehensive reproductive health care in Alabama. They violate their First Amendment right to provide information to their patients and other pregnant Alabamians about legal out-of-state medical care. The threats also violate due process because Attorney General Marshall is threatening to use Alabama criminal law in a manner that is far beyond the scope of these laws. The laws that we're looking at here, he points to, first, a very old 1896 conspiracy statute. That the Alabama Supreme Court has effectively authoritatively, definitively said only applies to conspiracies formed in Alabama to engage in conduct in other states that are illegal, that is illegal in those states.
