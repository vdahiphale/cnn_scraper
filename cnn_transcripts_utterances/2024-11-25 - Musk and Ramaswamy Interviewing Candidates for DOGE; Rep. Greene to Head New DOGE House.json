The Washington Post reports the two men are looking to experts in both D.C. and Silicon Valley. For advice on this advisory panel. Musk tweeted this morning that he still can't believe DOGE is real, but he believes it's going to work.Meanwhile, Georgia Republican and devout Trump loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene has been tapped to chair a new oversight subcommittee that is apparently going to work with DOGE to investigate federal waste. Here's what she told Fox over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  We'll be looking at everything from government funded media programs like NPR that spread nothing but Democrat propaganda. We'll be going into grant programs that fund things like sex apps in Malaysia, toilets in Africa, all kinds of programs that don't help the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What did you make of what Marjorie Taylor Greene there had to say about federal cuts and going after things like national public radio? JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND CO-FOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES: Look, I mean, if we were really serious about looking into waste, fraud, and abuse, which Republicans have been running on for many years, there are plenty of people. I mean, I agree with them, but there are plenty of people in the Republican Party who actually know a thing or two about where that waste, fraud, and abuse is buried. Marjorie Taylor Greene is not one of them. She's completely disinterested in policy. I don't think that she's ever looked at a budget. She's very good at being on TV and very good at sending out kind of an invective to piss off the other side and her own side as well. But this is not exactly somebody who I think is serious about reforming government. And I think it remains to be seen, the devil is always in the details as to what they come up with. Toilets in Africa, I hate to break it to the congresswoman, are not going to do anything about our federal budget and balancing it. So, I'd be very curious to see what programs they actually do want to take the axe to and how many people that will harm, if any, once they do that.",

You know, Julie, I hope that Democrats or Republicans can unite because I do think we need to try to figure out how to trim waste, fraud, abuse, and I think there's probably plenty of it.You know, the trick comes, Jim, is that you know that the discretionary part of the federal budget is pretty small. It's about 26 percent of the overall federal budget. It's about -- in '23, I think it's $1.7 trillion is what the discretionary budget is.

Of course, he believes Pete Hegseth, based on what? I guess on the police report.Well, if that's true I call on Markwayne Mullin and every Republican who's going to be vetting Pete Hegseth to ask Pete Hegseth to release the survivor from her nondisclosure agreement so she can go ahead and tell people what's going on. Because right now, we're hearing one side of the story, but of course, in typical fashion with NDAs, the survivor is gagged forever and she can't say a word about what happened. I think this is incredibly important information for Senators to know if she's subpoenaed, she will obviously be able to bring that NDA and testify under oath. But I think it's very important, if Republicans right now are already going out there saying there's nothing to this story, then right now, before there's any kind of federal subpoena, before the Senate calls her in to testify, Pete Hegseth should release her from her NDA so that she could tell us exactly what happened.",

This requires that the airline gives you the money back within seven days, if you paid by card, 20 days if you used another form of payment.

And President Biden said to use that presidential pardon power just moments from now for these two lucky birds here on the South Lawn for foul reasons, you might say, as he is set to talk turkey and dish out some presidential puns moments from now at this Thanksgiving roast and later today, heads to the New York area where he will have a Friendsgiving dinner with American troops.But let me just dish out a little bit of presidential history here. The rumors of the first turkey pardon actually date back to the Lincoln administration, when the president's young son asked him to spare his pet turkey from the Thanksgiving table. Then in the 1920s, during the Wilson administration, a pair of turkeys duked it out on the south lawn here from Kentucky and Texas. But the first documented pardon happened during the Kennedy administration back in 1963. And for modern presidents, a moment of levity and a cornucopia of dad jokes, Jim.",
