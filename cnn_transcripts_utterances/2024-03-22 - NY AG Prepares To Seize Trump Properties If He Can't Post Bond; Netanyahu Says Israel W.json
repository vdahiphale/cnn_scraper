Netanyahu also expressing that there was no way to defeat Hamas without going into Rafah. There are, of course, more than a million Palestinians in Rafah who have taken shelter there to escape the war. Here's more of what contrary Blinken had to say after their meeting.

      "sentences": "Well, listen, I think these two issues are kind of proceeding on separate tracks. But there's no question that they impact one another.If there is no ceasefire deal going forward, then that increases the likelihood of the Israeli military ordering this large-scale military offensive into Rafah. And of course, if there is a deal, that could potentially forestall a potential military offensive in Rafah for some six weeks at a minimum. But what I think is really important here is the fact that the U.S. is trying to change Israel's mind, trying to change the Israeli leadership's mind about the military necessity of carrying out this large-scale offensive. And so far, the U.S., including Secretary of State Blinken today, appeared to be failing at that task. Because moments after meeting with the secretary of state, the Israeli prime minister released this video statement in Hebrew to the Israeli public. Saying that he conveyed to Secretary of State Blinken that going into Rafah is a military necessity and that Israel will carry out that military offensive with or without the United States support. And so even as the Israeli prime minister is indicating that he will listen to the U.S.'s ideas, that he will send a delegation of some of his closest advisers to Washington next week to hear U.S. alternatives. He's also basically saying that I will listen to you, but I will not change my mind. At the same time, the secretary of state is trying to impress upon the Israeli prime minister and the Israeli public as well what the risk is here of going into Rafah. Talking not only about the risk to Palestinian civilians, some one- and-a-half million who are currently believed to be sheltering in Rafah, but also the risk to Israel, to Israel's long-term security and to its reputation saying that going into Rafah risks isolating Israel further around the world. And those are the stakes as the United States sees them. But despite that, Israel appears to be pressing ahead with these plans. Nothing is imminent, of course. But as we talked about with those ceasefire negotiations, so much uncertainty about whether or not a deal can be reached. On that front, the secretary of state saying that progress is being made, gaps are being closed. But the last mile is often the toughest in these negotiations -- Erica?",

But if you've been tracking what's going on with Kentucky over the last couple of appearances here off the big dance, you might have clue into it. Every year, we love meeting these new heroes from these small schools. This was an incredible night for Jack Gohlke. The senior for the Golden Grizzlies made 10 three pointers, you guys. He put up 32, which is the most points ever in the tournament for a player who did not make a two-point shot. Oakland pulling off the upset over the third seed, the Wildcats, 80, 76. And what a win for Greg Kampe, too, who has been the head coach at Oakland for 40 years, and now he's in the round of 32 for the first time. Conversely, this is a very tough pill to swallow for John Calipari. Kentucky now 1.4 in their last five tournament games. Here was Jack Gohlke after the big upset. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
