And, finally, Hannah Perry, she's 79 years old. We have worldwide coverage of all these very dramatic, historic developments unfolding. Let's begin with CNN's Clarissa Ward. She's over at the children's hospital near Tel Aviv in Petah Tikva, where some of these people will be treated. Clarissa, what stages of the process are these hostages in right now?

They're awaiting. There's a sort of a press conference that is anticipated to be given at some time. We don't know when that will happen, because we don't know yet, Wolf, when that helicopter or when that transport with those now free hostages may arrive here at the center. But it is certainly very much the expectation that at least six or so of those hostages will be coming here to the Schneider Medical Center, where so many staff have been working around the clock. They told us they did not sleep last night. They have been working very hard to ensure that every possible preparation has been made for their arrival, Wolf.",

So, we are very happy today, but still very worried, because we have to remember that my uncle, Ruthi's husband and Keren's father is still in Gaza, held in captivity by Hamas, and with him 200 other hostages.

We're very happy that they were released. Again, we're waiting for Avraham and 200 other hostages. And it's been a nightmare so far, 50 days in a nightmare. They have been abducted from their homes, in their pajamas, from their beds. Kids -- today, four kids have been released. There are over 30 more kids that still need to be released as well. We can't wait for everyone. We have all become one big family, all the families of the hostages. We need all of them back. This is just the beginning. It's not even close to being the end.",

And I just want to point out, Ohad Monder -- there's Keren Monder, who is 54 years old. Ohad Monder is only 9 years old. There's a picture of him, a little boy.

The recovery will be days, weeks, months, difficult for the experience that they have had. Wolf, I'd love to give you some details about their condition, but that's one of the things that we don't talk about, of course.",

We had a doctor with them, so he would have given them all the medical check and make sure that they were able in condition to move through Gaza in the back of the vehicle, and, of course, ask them if that's what they wanted to do. Of course, they all wanted to do that. So those conversations were taking place in terms of offering a humanitarian voice, a voice of support, a new face of safety, let's say, because, clearly, they were in distress for those seven weeks. And we were happy to be able to move them to that new point of safety, into their arms -- into the arms of their family.",

So far, among the 13 Israelis who have been released, they're either for the most part elderly women or young little children. Is that going to be the case? Are you going to be allowed by Hamas to go visit the other Israeli hostages who are still being kept?",

It's absolute anguish, the depths of despair. People have trouble sleeping. It's all they can think about. They're consumed by the fact that they're no longer with their son or daughter, separated from their spouse. So, of course, we want to be able to visit the remaining hostages. We have been insisting in our conversations with Hamas that we'd be able to do so, so that we can allow these hostages to communicate with their family, so that we can do a medical check with them. So now the question was, are we going to be able to visit them? We're insisting that we be allowed. We don't yet have the permissions that we need to be able to do so.

Last week, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross traveled to Qatar. She met with the political head of Hamas, had this discussion with him directly. One of the modes of operation of the ICRC -- and we use this phrase, bilateral and confidential -- it means that, when we meet with governments or we meet with military groups to try to further humanitarian goals, that conversation is private, and we don't share the details of it. People know that. The people we meet with that know that. And it gives them the faith and the trust to allow us to have those difficult conversations and make humanitarian progress. I wish I could give you some details, but I'm not able to do so.",
