And just moments ago, an official told CNN that the operations in the two areas are now over as long as there are no new rocket fires.And these attacks happen just hours after dozens of rockets were launched from Lebanon in what's considered the largest barrage fired from there in nearly two decades. This all follows the Israeli forces- led raids earlier this week on one of Islam's holiest sites, the Al- Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. And today, the IDF began mobilizing Military Reserve units while vowing to de-escalate the situation. We have reporters covering both sides of the conflict. CNN's Scott McLean is in Beirut. Let's first go to CNN's Fred Pleitgen live near the Gaza Strip. Fred, what more do we know about what the Israeli Defense Forces struck this morning? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Hi, there, Fredricka. Well, they say that they struck several targets inside the Gaza Strip, a lot of them being tunnels but then also what they call research and development facilities from Hamas, from the militant group that obviously controlled the Gaza Strip. Obviously, the Israelis are saying that in some cases, Hamas is actually building rockets there that have been fired towards Israel. And you mentioned the fact that overnight, there were also a lot of rockets that came from Gaza towards Israeli territory. The Israelis managing to intercept a lot of those rockets. Some of them landed in open fields, but one actually did land, an account -- in a town called Sderot, which is also right near where I am right now, on the edge of the Gaza Strip as well. Nevertheless, you're also absolutely right, Fredricka that the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman told me that Israel wants to de-escalate the situation. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES: We want to de-escalate. I mean, there's a very, very sensitive weekend ahead with Passover, Ramadan, and Easter all aligning. And we're looking for a -- hoping for a quiet weekend. Although we had another attack right after the prayers in Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, but we look -- we are looking to de-escalate.

You did just mention that a source in the Israeli defense structure said that right now these operations are over if there are no new rocket launches from Gaza and from South Lebanon.What we're seeing right now here on the ground on the edge of Gaza -- and the lights that you see behind me, that is already Gaza. As the Israelis obviously having some pretty tense calm here on the edge of Gaza, there are still drones in the air all the time. So, clearly, the Israelis watching the situation very close, while at the same time, obviously, right now it is calm here on the edge of Gaza, Fredricka.",

Hezbollah figure -- even saying earlier today that the deterrent power balance remains in place. In other words, the war would not turn out well for either side.Now, the foreign minister also said that his government has worked hard to try to convince all the various factions to turn down the temperature. But given the reality in this country and the complexities in this country and in the wider region, he also acknowledged that essentially, he is relying on Hezbollah to relay his message to these Palestinian factions. He's relying on the United States to relay the message to Israel to turn down the temperature. This is essentially a game of telephone with some pretty dire real- life consequences. And complicating things further, Fredricka is the stark reality that Lebanon simply does not effectively control large swaths of the country. Case in point, the minister suggested that these rockets were actually manufactured in Palestinian refugee camps -- in Lebanon camps that have been there for decades and decades, and yet, Lebanese security forces have really no way to effectively police those areas, Fredricka.",

So, the Lebanese military has a hard time coping with the militias given the domestic crises in Lebanon.The reality is, there is a moment of calm right now. But the problem is that long-term, the central issues between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel, and Hezbollah, two different layers, one kind of local, one regional, still have not been resolved. And so, the potential for more tension is real, whether it's in the next 24 hours or the next few months.

Meantime, the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5 percent.CNN Business Reporter Rahel Solomon is here to break down the numbers. Rahel, great to see you. So, this is the first Jobs Report in a year that came in below expectations. What is going on? RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER (on camera): Fred, good to be with you. Yes, so let's take a look at the numbers, right? So, 236, it was slightly below expectations. And we can show you sort of what we're looking at over the last year, how this compares with the last year. So, 236, to put that in context, the expectation was closer to 239. Definitely on the lighter side. But this, you could argue was just very vote -- robust job growth. And so, what we're seeing is a gradual cooling, a normalizing so to speak. I can also tell you in this report, Fred, we saw a job force -- labor force participation. The share of Americans actually participating in the workforce, we saw some nice gains there. Almost half a million people joined the workforce either decided they were going to look for a job or they actually started working. So, that has to be music to the ears of people at the Fed who have needed to see a greater supply of workers. Let's take a look at unemployment. The unemployment rate, as you said, falling to 3.5 percent. That's pretty much -- I got to work on my penmanship. It's pretty much a 50-year low. But, Fred, take a look at this. This is really noteworthy. So, the unemployment rate for black Americans continues to be above the national average but falling to a record. This is the lowest it has ever been since the BLS started taking this data since 1972, falling to five percent for black Americans overall. And for black women, actually fall into 4.2 percent. That is also the lowest it has ever been since 1972, Fred.",

Well, we're still spending. We're still going out to restaurants. We're still traveling. We're still participating in the services side of the economy. But also, the government adding almost 50,000 jobs in professional and business services. So, this is sort of a nice and easy type of report as JPMorgan put it today, a gradual cooling.

We'll have to see. But my sense is that you know, a three-and-a-half percent unemployment rate is kind of where we want it to be, you know. Very low. We want people to work. We mentioned the 5 percent black unemployment rate, that's fantastic. But I don't think it's too much that it will result in the kind of wage growth that's going to result in the inflation that the Fed will have to raise interest rates and ultimately push the economy into recession. So, three and a half percent feels pretty good to me. By the way, Fredricka, that's where we've been for a year, you know. Give or take three and a half percent per year. So, I take it.",
