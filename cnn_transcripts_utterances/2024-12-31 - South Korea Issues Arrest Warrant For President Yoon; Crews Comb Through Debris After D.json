The president was swiftly impeached and suspended from power after he issued a short-lived martial law decree earlier this month. He's facing charges of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion.Yoon's martial law decree led to public protests and mass resignations from his cabinet. CNN's Marc Stewart is following developments from Beijing. And as we've said, a very dramatic turn of events here.",

According to investigators, the arrest would have to take place within seven days after a warrant such as this has been issued, but it is also something that could be extended. So we are just going to have to wait and see how this all plays out. But let's get to the context in all of this because it is very important. Even though President Yoon has been suspended, he is stripped of his powers, he is still at the presidential residence. He is still protected by his security team. And this warrant is not necessarily something that happened out of the clear blue. This all stems from that declaration of martial law, that unprecedented declaration we saw back on December 3rd. As a result, there was an investigation that took place. The nation's Corruption Investigation Office actually offered -- issued three summons for the president. They want to talk to him, asking for his cooperation, but he refused. And that is what led to this arrest warrant. During that period of martial law, which we saw unfold live on television, he allegedly ordered his defense minister list of several high ranked politicians, civil activists, even judges. And that has obviously prompted a response by the government as a whole. Now, we are hearing from you his attorney. He is fighting back, saying that this arrest -- this arrest warrant, the mere issuance of this arrest warrant is illegal and invalid. He did issue some hints that the president comply with the warrant, saying that there are some serious issues with all of this. He did go on to say, though, that the president will confidently respond when due process goes on. So what that means, how that looks like, that is still very murky. But, Paula, we are going to have to keep watch on this potential arrest and see how this timeline unfolds from Seoul, South Korea. Paula?",

You know, he actually also helped guide, you know, President Carter to work on disease eradication elimination efforts and focusing on neglected tropical diseases and specifically, you know, Guinea-worm became the flagship program.
