Another provocative flag seen outside the home belonging to Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, causing new controversy this morning. \"The New York Times\" was first to report the \"appeal to heaven\" flag that was seen on display at Alito's New Jersey vacation home last summer. The flag dates back to the revolutionary war, but it's become a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement, especially the Christian wing and was used by Trump's supporters during the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Alito and the Supreme Court have not responded to requests for comment. This is now the second time Alito has been found to be flying a controversial flag at one of his properties. Last week, \"The Times\" published a photo of an upside-down American flag flown at Alito's home in Virginia in 2021. The justice said that the flag was raised by his wife in response to a spat with neighbors. Meanwhile also this yesterday, former Trump rival Nikki Haley, now saying that she will vote for the former president in November. This was not however, an explicit endorsement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe, so I will be voting for Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is his Long Beach Island beach house. And it says \"an appeal to heaven\" on top. It's a reference to John Locke, the philosopher for those who want to go back that far. But it really does date back to the founding of the country. It is one of these symbols that has now been appropriated by the Stop the Steal movement. And it does seem as though there are more people out there defending this particular flag. We saw John Bolton on with my colleague Wolf Blitzer. And then this was Senator Ted Cruz also on CNN last night talking about this. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX):  I think this entire hoopla is greatly overstated and I think there is a concerted effort that is driven by Democrats in the Senate to try to delegitimize the court and to try to demonize -- we're seeing it with Justice Clarence Thomas. We're seeing it with Justice Sam Alito. I think the whole thing is disgraceful. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But just heard simply saying she would vote for him is a win for him in his campaign he doesn't necessarily need her on stage, probably doesn't necessarily want her on stage, but the fact that she said despite everything she said about Donald Trump's, she's still believes he would make a better president than Joe Biden is still a powerful message.",

But I do want to warn you, this video is disturbing. The young women are seen lined up their hands, bound, their faces are bruised and bloodied. Officials say one woman was rescued, another was killed, and five of them remain in captivity. The footage released by Hamas was edited by the Israeli military, according to the Hostages Families Forum. All right.

You can give me some more context on this, but it's things can only get better, which I guess is a throwback to the Tony Blair era Britain.

MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're renaming it drowning street, number one. I mean -- so the music was being blasted for the end of Downing Street where Labour supporters, the opposition party supporters, and they were playing the tune that swept Tony Blair to power. So they were trolling him basically, and for some reason, the Downing Street people didn't manage to sort out the sound. So that was interrupting it all, people are distracted by the rain. The bigger question though, exactly what you're saying. It was a shock announcement because -- I mean, to say it's an uphill struggle for him. I think you're being very polite there, Kasie, as is your way. But it's an -- I mean, his polling numbers could not be worse. He, by any standard, is not going to win this election if things carry on as they are. But he has to have an election by the end of the year and he's had some relatively good economic numbers inflation figures came down and that's meant to be as thing, a former banker. You know, he's very bright guy, he knows about the economy. So I think he's banking on the fact that inflation numbers have come up a bit and that might be enough. But I think the people behind him there, for example, you know, they're thinking about a lot of other things. So I mean, it's a real -- is really big gamble.",

So it's very difficult to see what a conservative voter will get from him when they go into the polling booth.
