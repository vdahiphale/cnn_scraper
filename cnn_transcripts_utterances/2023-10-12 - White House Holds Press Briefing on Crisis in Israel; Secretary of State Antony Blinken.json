Israel has launched large-scale strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza and reports that Israeli missiles are hitting inside Syria, taking out runways at two major airports. During this latest barrage, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stood side by side with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowing that Israel will never have to stand alone. Moments ago, Secretary Blinken discussed the gruesome evidence he's been shown by the Israeli government showing purported Hamas atrocities. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  It's beyond what anyone would ever want to imagine, much less actually see and, God forbid, experience, a baby, an infant, riddled with bullets, soldiers beheaded, young people burned alive in their cars or in their hideaway rooms. I could go on, but it's simply depravity in the worst imaginable way. You can't help but imagine yourself, your family, your loved ones, your friends in that situation, in that predicament. And maybe the best word for it for me is overwhelming. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if indeed that is the case, if that is the direction in which we move, the Israeli prime minister has to prepare the public here that there will be IDF casualties with a ground invasion and also preparing the world for the fact that there will be casualties inside of Gaza. And we know the death toll will mount. What is very clear is that, regardless of what comes next, it will be civilians who are too often caught in the crossfire -- Boris.",

And I'm meaning that a policy that is based on improvement of the economic, on the -- of the civil situation in Gaza, in order actually to create a prize, something that Hamas could lose if he will promote any escalation. And, right now, I think that, in the horrible situation we found ourselves, actually, this is the only way to really to push Hamas. And only this evening, we heard Saleh al-Arouri, number two in Hamas leadership, declare that, actually, Hamas members, Hamas terrorists from the military wing were not involved in killing, slaughtering civilians in Israel, but it was civilians from Gaza. So, he's trying actually to change the damage in the image of Hamas. But I really hope that those steps, I mean, banning water and electricity and other things, will cause unrest, will cause protest among the citizens of Gaza, and maybe now, finally, they will understand that their worst enemy is Hamas, and the source for all their suffer is Hamas. And I think that this is the only option Israel has today.",

You were just making the argument that leadership in Hamas is trying to muddy the waters and blur those lines. There are some two million Palestinians packed into a tiny sliver of land that is Gaza. Many of them are just women and children that had nothing to do with the atrocities that we saw over the weekend. How does the IDF go about trying to ensure that innocent people aren't hurt?",

First of all is the intelligence failure to recognize actually all the signals. During the last day, we understood that those signals were elaborated only a few hours before the offensive began, and it was quite too late to do something. But the other failure, actually, is connected or in regard to the question of the intentions of Hamas. The basic assumption regarding Hamas was that this organization is very much deterred, it has no interest in promoting escalation. And, of course, this assumption was really wrong, because I think that we -- I would call it, we thought in a Western style, in Western-style patterns. And we actually enforced our way of thinking on the other side, on an Islamic radical organization whose basic aim is actually to eradicate Israel from the map. He has no intention to take care of the Palestinians in the territories of the life of the people in Gaza. His basic aim is to promote jihad, muqawama, resistance.
