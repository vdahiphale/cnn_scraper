I'm Kim Brunhuber. We begin with a major development.Israel is calling for all civilians in Gaza City to evacuate their homes and move to the south in the day ahead. A U.N. spokesperson calls the request impossible, saying it could turn an already tragic situation into a calamity. It's likely the clearest sign yet of Israeli plans to intensify its military operations in Gaza following Hamas' attack on Israel which killed at least 1300 people. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops, tanks and other military vehicles are now gathering along the Gaza border. Meanwhile there is enormous and worsening suffering for the civilians in Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry says there are more than 1500 people who have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and shelling. And without power and water, the health system is on the brink of collapse. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Jordan right now with meetings scheduled in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. In Israel on Thursday, he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  -- encountered a nation knit together by grief, but also, a nation united in resolve. United States shares that resolve. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER:  And joining me now from Tel Aviv is Israel Defense Forces spokesperson, Major Doron Spielman.

Don't pay any attention to what it has described as psychological warfare from the part of the Israelis.I think probably, the people in the Gaza Strip will, to play it safe, err on the side of paying attention to this warning from the Israelis rather than Hamas' request to not be swayed by it. And Israel, for its part, has described the U.N.'s response to its early warning as shameful. The U.N. Secretary General, we know, Antonio Guterres, has asked for clarification on what is going on or what Israel is demanding in terms of the evacuation. But the situation right now and we're what now, it's at nine o'clock in the morning in Israel. So, there's another what, 15 hours until this 24 hour deadline if you like runs out during which Israel wants as many civilians as possible to evacuate from Gaza City and to move south to get out of harm's way so that it can strike the targets it wants to strike the targets of Hamas infrastructure and Hamas militants that it wants to strike as a result in retaliation for this attack launched by Hamas in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Analysis shows much of the practice work was done inside Gaza, and some of it around a mile or less than two kilometers from the most heavily patrolled border with Israel. Our Clarissa Ward has the details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Propaganda videos put out by Hamas revealed chilling details about the years of preparations that went into Saturday's bloody attacks right under Israel's nose. Analyzing metadata from the videos, a CNN investigation can reveal the presence of at least six training sites inside Gaza. One just 720 meters from the most heavily fortified and patrolled part of Israel's border. In that camp, Hamas recreated an Israeli compound, with elements of the nearby border crossing, including an insignia of the Erez Battalion. The videos show they even practiced taking prisoners and zip tying their hands at the camp. Satellite imagery indicates the camp was constructed within the last year and a half. At two other locations in the southern part of Gaza, Hamas trained for their audacious paraglider assault, rehearsing takeoffs and landings. At all six sites, two years of satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows no indication of offensive Israeli military action. The imagery instead shows that in the last two years, some camps even expanded into surrounding farmland, and that there was activity in the last several months at the camps. The stunning revelations raise questions as to how Hamas was able to train so openly, so close to the border, for so long, and why Israeli officials were unable to pick up on and prevent the October 7th attack.

Remember, to lose the -- to win the speakership, you could only afford to lose four Republican votes on a party line vote. That means Steve Scalise had a roughly about a dozen, maybe up to two dozen Republicans who are ultimately saying that they were not going to support him despite his efforts all day long to try to flip them, try to convince them that he was their candidate and to assuage their concerns, none of that worked. And members all day long were fuming about the stalemate, about how it makes their parties look and raising fresh concerns that all of this could cost them their narrow majority in 2024.
