Six of them still who are inside Gaza believe to be there out.I want to get straight to CNN's Alex Marquardt who has been reporting on the hostage negotiations. First, your sense of what was said, what wasn't said and also more importantly, what are you learning from your sources, Alex?",

So what Secretary Blinken and his Qatari counterpart are announcing just now is something that we've been waiting for for more than a week. And that is the Hamas response to what we've been calling a broad framework to get a hostage deal, a ceasefire deal in place.This was something that was agreed to, by the U.S. with the CIA Director Bill Burns, his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts, as well as Prime Minister Al Thani, of Qatar, who you saw just there. Last -- the weekend before last in Paris, that deal was then presented to Hamas. They were not in attendance in Paris, of course. And so we have been waiting to see what they would say. Now, in the meantime, Hamas had been given -- had been giving indications that they would not accept a deal that does not lead to the end of the war, that would not see Israeli soldiers leave the Gaza Strip and that is something that Israel so far has been refusing to do. So what we've got here, Dana, is Hamas's response, which the Qatari Prime Minister said is generally positive. And Secretary Blinken saying it is something that they are reviewing that he will present to the Israeli government tomorrow. He's traveling from Qatar, to Israel, he'll meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and others tomorrow. And this is what we were expecting. Not a yes or no from Hamas, but a counterproposal. And right now, we don't have the details of that counterproposal. But it's clear that this is moving forward in a generally positive direction.",

And hopefully, in his mind, the people that he appointed have the same view that he does. Now, they haven't always agreed with him on every issue.

For weeks, the right was assailing this bill, Trump was attacking this bill.And the people who were negotiating it, for good reason wanted to keep it close hold, but the reality was more and more misinformation about what was in this bill was getting out there and it was becoming the narrative. And once the bill was released, it was already too late. It was minutes before you saw the speaker, the majority leader coming out saying this bill was not even going to get a vote in the House. And now you have Republican senators, some of whom, like Tom Tillis were cheering Lankford on for the last several weeks saying they are not voting tomorrow to advance this bill in the Senate.
