In just a few minutes, the president of Ukraine will take questions from the American press, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes his bold and symbolic trip to the U.S., his first time outside his country since Russia's invasion almost a year ago. Plus, just in, the January 6 committee might delay its final, final report. What new what we learned about the insurrection? And while we're at it, what new we're going to learn from Donald Trump's about to be released tax returns? And just days before Christmas, with holiday travel ramping up, new states of emergency declared. And power grid operators on guard as winter rushes in with a deep freeze over much of the United States. (MUSIC)",

That's -- this includes the Patriot missile defense systems to beat back the invasion of the Russian anti-democracy forces. In just minutes, Presidents Biden and Zelenskyy are going to address the press from the East Room of the White House. We're going to bring that to you live when it happens. Afterwards, Zelenskyy is going to travel to Capitol Hill, where he will address lawmakers in a joint meeting of Congress. This comes just weeks before Republicans are set to take back control of the House. Many Republicans have expressed criticism of the price tag of the U.S.'s aid to Ukraine. Today's visit is drawing comparisons among some circles to 1941. That is when U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill spoke before Congress. This was just days after the Pearl Harbor attack. That visit helps event the alliance that would go on to win World War II against a different autocratic terroristic regime. Let's go to CNN's Phil Mattingly, who is in East Room of the White House, awaiting to the start of this news conference with Presidents Biden and Zelenskyy. Phil, what do we expect we're going to hear the two leaders talk about it in just a few minutes?",

It is the substantive issues that will be more in-depth discussed over the course of the two hours that the two leaders are expected to meet behind closed doors. Also bilateral meetings with their top national security teams and advisers.The expectation right now is that there is both the message here, the very clear almost vivid demonstration of an alliance that the White House and U.S. officials maintain has been completely steadfast over the course of the last nine months. But also the realities kind of undergirded this entire meeting about this moment in a war that continues to grind on, surpassing 300 days, at a moment in time where winter months are putting added pressure's, not just on the Ukrainian people, but also the people of Europe. Countries with their own domestic concerns as well. That is where, in large part, one of the issues that those realities create is what actually happens next. That is one of the questions that both sides will need to walk through over the course of their two hours behind closed doors. The president in the oval office beforehand, before they sat down, talking about helping Ukraine pursue its goal of a just peace. What that actually entails is still very much an open question at this point in time. There's also, of course, the defense assistance, the U.S. is ramping up that support, $1.8 billion on top of $20 billion already provided -- and of course, expanding that to include Patriot missile defense systems, something President Zelenskyy has repeatedly requested over the course of the last several months. Now, President Biden is signing off on that, and be willing to move forward. What that means about U.S. support going forward. What that means about how Russia views it in terms of an escalatory act also, questions that I think are very much being weighed at this moment, Jake.",

These two men have spoken repeatedly over the course of the last nine months by phone, by video conference, in group settings with other Western leaders. This is the first time they will be sitting down face to face since 2021, the first time since this war started and that is incredibly important for President Biden, again, because of those unanswered questions, in terms of what the shape of some type of endgame would look like -- these officials have been very candid. They don't the end see one at this moment, given where things stand. With the view that president Biden -- the view that President Zelenskyy has laid out again and again, whether or not there is any type of sense of the next months even years, about how this ends up -- very much something that they want some semblance of an I answer to over the course of these meetings, Jake.",

Amid speculation he would be evacuated, Zelenskyy said, he did not need a ride. He needed ammunition. A week into the conflict, in his bunker in Kyiv, Zelenskyy told CNN it was about much more than Ukraine.

His resolve and that of Ukrainians was hardened by atrocities committed by Russian forces, especially north of Kyiv in March. Even as the city of Lysychansk was about to fall this summer, he went there to award soldiers metals.

The amount of information we're going to be able to see, however, will be determined by the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, Democratic-controlled just for another few days. And that committee voted along party lines late Tuesday to release some materials on Trump's taxes. CNN's Lauren Fox is live from Capitol Hill for us. And, Lauren, the committee mentioned last night that there was a big gap in what the IRS was supposed to do with Trump's returns when Trump was president and in charge of the IRS and what the IRS actually did.",

Their report was a lot more dense. And it sort of told a story that we were familiar with, thanks to \"The New York Times\"' bombshell report on Trump's taxes, which is that he used losses to reduce his tax bill. Now, the JCT is not saying that that was against the law. They're not even suggesting that maybe Trump should have paid more. That's not their job. But what they are saying in this report is, maybe these are some places that the IRS should be looking more closely at. They also lay out what Trump paid in taxes for those six years in which the Tax Committee has his returns. And a couple of things emerge. One of them is the fact that he paid very little taxes in several of those years. Some of those years, we knew because of \"The New York Times\"' reporting, but that he paid really $750 in 2016 and 2017 in federal income taxes. We should note that there were other years he paid more, but, in 2020, he paid zero dollars in federal income taxes. And, obviously, that is something that Democrats say might need to be taken a closer look at. We should also note that Trump's spokesman released a statement yesterday saying that this was an unprecedented leak, Republicans decrying the release of these returns. We expect we may get them in upcoming days, but information, personal information, has to be redacted before that's released strength, Jake.",

That's around the time I was in the Oval Office with the pool. Looks like it went ran a little longer than was expected. And I think, to some degree, that was expected, given the scale of the issues that the two leaders needed to address, needed to work through. There's really two kind of critical elements here as they get prepared to speak here at this press conference, take questions from reporters. And that is the intent to make very clear the unity and the steadfast support that the U.S. and its Western allies will continue to provide, but also to Capitol Hill, where President Zelenskyy will be heading after this press conference, making very clear, as lawmakers consider an additional $45 billion in assistance, economic and defense assistance to Ukraine, that it is unity that needs to be maintained here in the United States and in that Western coalition. That's as much of the message here as anything else, particularly as this war continues to grind on. And U.S. officials have been very clear there is no clear endgame right now, given how Russian forces continue to operate. So, how the president's address both their behind-the-scenes meeting, but also what the pathway is going forward, knowing full well that we're not talking about days or weeks. We're still talking about months, if not years, and a very, very critical moment in a conflict that has now gone more than 300 days, Jake.",

They want better weapons. And he wants to make the case to the American people that they should get them, Wolf -- Jake.",
