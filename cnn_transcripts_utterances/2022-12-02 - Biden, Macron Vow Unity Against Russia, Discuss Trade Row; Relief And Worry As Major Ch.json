We saw him, for example, try to engage with President Biden's predecessor that was unable to get him to move on Iran, on the Paris Climate Accord and so on. But in this particular case, you saw him trying to lead President Biden towards being more open to the possibility of speaking to the Russian leader rather than each of them in their respective corners, ultimately waiting for the situation to play out.

And he referred to President Macron deliberately, which would have been music to President Macron's ears not just as the leader of France, but ultimately is one of the main leaders of the European Union.And President Macron in return made openings in that particular regard when he mentioned, I think the most interesting term in these discussions was the word resynchronization. It's this reaffirmation of the multilateral order that was weakened and undermined by President Trump, and from which they all have to benefit. And at a time, when, as you mentioned, the UK is unpredictable, unreliable, as an Atlantic partner, that center of gravity has shifted in Europe. And it shifted away as well from the German leadership since the end of the Merkel era towards Emmanuel Macron. And to that extent, his ability to speak English is also crucial. And his ability to position himself and take the sort of inspire the confidence of other European leaders is important. And I felt that this visit to the White House was not just a visit from their manual, and in my call, but also as Emmanuel Macron as the representative of the European Union.

A social media channel affiliated with the group recently posted this video allegedly showing a severely wounded Wagner fighter trying to shoot himself rather than fall into Ukrainian hands. Now, the group has acknowledged a man from the southern African nation of Zambia has been killed fighting on the front lines in Ukraine. This is 23-year-old (INAUDIBLE) Nathan Nirenda (ph). Wagner's founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as Putin's chef, admits he recruited Nirenda him from a Russian jail and says he died a hero. \"I talked to him in the (INAUDIBLE) region,\" Prigozhin wrote in a statement. \"Why do you need this war? After all, the chance of dying is quite high.\" \"And he answered what I expected. You Russians helped us Africans gain independence for many years. The Wagner group saved thousands of Africans. And if I go to war with you, this is probably a very small way in which I can pay our debts. Zambian authorities say Nirenda was studying nuclear engineering in Russia but was thrown in jail for more than nine years for what his father told Reuters was a drug offense. Despite what Prigozhin said about Nirenda's alleged gratitude, the Zambia government is demanding answers.",

Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano is putting on quite a show this week, with its first eruption since 1984.However, the twin eruptions from Mauna Loa and Kilauea are raising concerns over air quality, especially for children and the elderly and people with respiratory problems. For more on this, I'm now joined by our meteorologist Derek Van Dam. So it is impressive to watch. But as you were just saying. How much more dangerous could this possibly get?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, you think about it, when it actually erupted five days ago, it spewed this volcanic ash into the atmosphere. And just by the nature of what volcanic ash -- it's pulverized rock, glass -- it is very jagged in nature, kind of hollow. And it is very small as well, less than two millimeters.So, it can potentially be an eye irritant, a lung irritant, and of course, it can cause breathing problems. But this particular volcano, of course, we are talking about this slow advancement of the lava flow that is now more of a matter of inconvenience for the people who call the big island of Hawaii home. Let's zoom into this area. And you can see exactly what I'm talking about. Mauna Loa actually encompasses over 50 percent of the big island of Hawaii. And as we zoom in a little bit closer, this is very interesting. There is a highway that intersects kind of an east to west cut through, kind of a thoroughfare from the island and the lava flow is actually approaching that particular highway. So, authorities are warning that it is highly likely that that lava will eventually intersect the highway. They'll have to close the highway, help divert over some of this lava flow, which is right now about 3.2 miles away from this saddle road. But again, that is going to be more of an inconvenience for people because they will now have to go completely south of the volcano or completely north of the volcano to get to their destinations, which, of course the population lives on either side of the island. So if you look at the lava flow, it is not moving very fast. And when I say a snail's pace, I literally mean it. Only 40 meters per hour. So they only expect the lava to intersect the highway, that saddle road I showed you a moment ago in about seven days time. So it's kind of a slow-moving disaster. But when we think about what is happening across the Hawaiian islands, well, we are seeing new land form, just like so many of the other islands that dot the Pacific Ocean, the magma bursting up from down below, creating some of those new formed locations, Paula.
