They moved ships on the surface and then sent down remote operated vehicle to the area where they thought those sounds were coming from and that turned up nothing, unfortunately. We -- the Coast Guard spoke to CBS this morning a short time ago and described the sounds this way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL JOHN MAUGER, U.S. COAST GUARD: There is a lot of metal and different objects in the water around this site.

But, literally, all hands on deck. There are three U.S. military C-17s that flew into St. John's here yesterday. The gear from that went on to the Horizon Arctic that shipped out earlier this morning. And then there was a Coast Guard ship just a couple of hours ago that shipped out.

You have Hunter Biden, who didn't pay his taxes on time for 2018 and 2017. Is this any different what he is doing than what would happen to the average American? RENATO MARIOTTI, HOST, \"THE COMPLICATED\" PODCAST: It's different but not in the way you might expect. I think it's actually harsher than the treatment that a typical person would receive. So, I've charged misdemeanor tax charges that are just like the ones here, in other words, it's -- we talk a lot of times, the public might talk about tax evasion and think of all crimes as tax -- tax crimes as tax evasion. Tax evasion is a very specific felony charge where you can actively trying to deceive the government, deceive the IRS. Usually that's the sort of crime that is charged in a tax case. That or tax fraud. And when I've brought these misdemeanor-type charges just for failing to pay or failing to file your tax return, I usually use those as a backstop in a more serious case. You'd throw them in just in case the jury was split on some of the other counts. I don't recall ever seeing misdemeanor tax charges on their own. I'm sure it's happened, but it's the exception rather than the rule. It's pretty rare. The Justice Department rarely works on cases in order to generation a misdemeanor tax charge. I would consider that a failure of an investigation. Similarly, you know, the gun charge, I have never seen that gun charge brought before. Usually, the types of gun charges that are brought are felon in possession where -- or a firearm used in the - in the - in the course of committing a violent crime or a drug trafficking crime.
