As for what Trump is going through right now, look, it just really sucks to be in court, to be a defendant. It is just one of the most stressful things you could possibly go through.

But you realize, oh, wow, they have got all of this stuff. They have a lot of information. Paula mentioned the nonprosecution agreement that they have with AMI, the fact that David Pecker is a cooperating witness. And I think that's something to -- or has immunity. It's something to remember. We saw at the very beginning that David Pecker seemed to be flattering Trump throughout the course of the kind of opening parts of the trial. He has immunity here.

He does not want this jury to be hearing anything besides the actual testimony at issue. And the lawyers and the judge are actually discussing an objection from Trump's legal team. This is out of the earshot of the jury in this context. The reason why is because you want this jury focused on only the presentation of evidence or notetaking, not trying to get through the different rabbit holes. It's really important for the clarity and a streamlined process, but not wanting to get these documents in for the reason Elie talks about. They don't want the corroborative aspect of it. They do not want anything that's not being said. They don't want to have the overwhelming number of receipts to say, listen, if you question the credibility of the speaking witness, if you want to figuratively ixnay the messenger, then you can turn to the actual documents.

It's the continued relationship. If somebody's getting ready to be the president of the United States, and they believe that they might be or might have a chance at doing so, think about the fodder you have in the future.
