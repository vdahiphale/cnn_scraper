What it means for Republican efforts to secure the audiotape of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. And we're tracking a Russian naval operation with echoes of the Cold War, multiple warships, including a nuclear powered submarine arriving in Cuba, just 90 miles from the United States for military drills. We're going to tell you how U.S. officials are responding to the provocative Russian exercise. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's go first to the breaking news. The former special prosecutor forced to step down from Georgia's case against Donald Trump is now speaking out. Nathan Wade resigned from his role after revelations of a romantic relationship with D.A. Fani Willis. And now he's speaking exclusively to CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan is joining us on the phone in just a moment, but, first, listen to Wade explain why he believes Trump could still be prosecuted even if Trump is re-elected. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It is the position of the Justice Department right now that a president, a sitting president can't be tried in federal court. The question of what happens with the state court has not been answered yet. I would think the Justice Department would take the same view based on the unique nature of the presidency in the United States, but he's right, no one's tested the question yet. BLITZER: Not yet. All right, we will see what happens. Andrew McCabe, you're the former deputy director of the FBI.

And I do think Elliot's absolutely right. If he's re- elected and the trial goes forward, former President Trump will exert, will have many strong avenues to appeal his presence in the court at all.And the strongest argument will come ironically from the Justice Department, whose very policy prohibiting such a trial at the federal level essentially lays out a very coherent argument that makes the case that it would be unconstitutional to deprive the American public of essentially the good and undistracted services of the president, the person that they elected for the time of -- during the time of a criminal trial. But can we also just recognize that as the person who's created much of this turbulence in the Georgia case, great job on Kaitlan getting this interview, but really questionable choice by Mr. Wade to give it.

Let's roll the tape. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mitch McConnell is a loser. We do have to do something about Mitch McConnell. He's a disaster. These Washington Republicans, like Mitch McConnell, who's the absolute worst. I had to fight Mitch McConnell, another beauty. Mitch McConnell, and his wife, Coco Chao, Coco. We got to get the McConnells of the world to do their job. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, he certainly has consolidated power within the GOP, Wolf, to be sure, but this meeting is going to be very awkward. Not only has Donald Trump insulted Mitch McConnell, but also his wife. There will also be several senators potentially in that meeting, a few senators who voted to convict Donald Trump in the impeachment. Todd Young has also been critical of him. So, I think it's me a very awkward meeting.I would really hope that one of the senators takes Donald Trump to task over his daughter-in-law, who should have been frog marched out of the Republican National Committee for the terrible things she said about Larry Hogan, a very credible, thoughtful candidate in a deep blue state. It shows, you know, they're talking about unity, but then all you hear are Donald Trump and his family members insulting Republicans who don't fall in line the way they would like, even in the deepest of blue districts or states. So, this will be a very weird situation tomorrow. I don't know how candid they are going to get with him. But there's a lot of work to do to bring together a very divided party, particularly in the Senate. I get it. It's not evenly divided, but it is still divided nonetheless. And they have a lot of work to do if they hope to unify this party.",

There's no politics that could make me then come and coddle the individual that insults my wife and calling her out of her name and using racial epithets or stereotypes. And the problem that we have with Donald Trump in this country is not a Democrat or Republican one, as much as it is the fact that people like Mitch McConnell refuse to stand up to individuals who act childish in our American political system. But one day there's going to be a book written about how Donald Trump made men like Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and now Mitch McConnell just kind of melt and like putty in his hands. Tomorrow will be an awkward meeting. But at the end of the day, this cancer that is Donald Trump in the Republican Party, unfortunately, for Charlie Dent and others, is going to metastasize and be there for a very, very long period of time.",

They don't like him as their standard bearer. They know he comes to the table with a lot of liabilities, not the least of which is that he was just convicted and, of course, the January 6th -- his role on January 6th, which was a dereliction of duty.So, I don't know that many members are going to confront Donald Trump directly. I don't think so. They are going to try to talk about unity. But we cannot cloak the fact that they're, that this party is so significantly divided, even though it's not evenly divided. What is Trump going to do to reach out to the Nikki Haley voter in this meeting tomorrow? Is he going to do anything? They'll talk unity for a few minutes, then he'll go back out and he'll make these kinds of insulting comments against McConnell and anybody else who displeases him for just about any reason. So, I am not optimistic right now that anything is really going to come of this. They might actually talk about some policy, how are they going to deal with the expiring tax cuts from 2017? They might talk about the border. They'll probably talk about those sorts of issues where they might find common ground, but don't expect a whole lot of confrontation tomorrow.",
