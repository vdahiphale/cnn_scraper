They certainly are already having a chilling effect, I can tell you, from speaking to some activists on the ground there.But it seems as though there were three venues that were raided this weekend and they're not necessarily gay bars or clubs per se, but they are gay entertainment venues where apparently, events were taking place. And that all is very significant even though the authorities there are saying that no one was detained in those raids. However, there were some documents that were photographed from those people there which that, in itself, can have a chilling effect in a place like Russia, of course. The authorities are saying that these were normal drug raids, as they put it. But certainly, it seems as though folks from the gay and lesbian community on the ground don't necessarily buy that. They are definitely terrified at what happened. And the reason why this is significant, guys, is because it's another sign of a massive crackdown that's happening in Russia on the gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer community there -- something that's been going on for several years. But what happened on Thursday is that the country's Supreme Court did not only ban what they call the international LGBTQ movement, but they also declared everybody who, as they say, is a member of that community. In other words, all of the folks in Russia who are gays, lesbians, transgender, or queer are all extremists -- they are considered in Russia now -- which that, of course, can have huge legal repercussions for those folks. Again, this is something that we've seen over the past couple of years -- the big crackdown happening on that community. Certainly, life has become a lot more difficult for them over the past couple of years. And the other thing that we also have to say is that one of the reasons why Vladimir Putin says he's doing this is he says to counter Western influence, which is also, he says, why he's conducting his invasion of Ukraine, guys.",

JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, \"THE LEAD\": Well, I managed to get an early copy of her remarks and she is going to be focusing on rape as a crime. As a war crime. As a weapon of war. And look, I understand Congresswoman Jayapal's desire to change the subject to what's going on in Gaza. And certainly, that is something that a lot of activists and a lot of members of Congress want to talk about and I understand that. But there is also a desire by individuals in Israel, and women's groups, and feminists, and people who have been talking about rape as a weapon of war for decades now who want to talk specifically about this issue. And one of the things that Sandberg says in her prepared remarks is that 30 years ago, there was this big effort after the wars in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and Congo, and the efforts of then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to focus on rape as a weapon of war and to prosecute it, and to make sure that there is punishment for it. Because before then, it was just seen as oh, yeah, that happens in war. And she doesn't want that to -- doesn't want the world to go back to that world again where it's just kind of seen as yeah -- that, of course, that happens in war just like looting happens in war. So we're going to -- she's going to -- she's going to put it to the world at the U.N., according to her prepared remarks that I got ahold of, who is the world going to believe?

Purdue and the Sacklers are both behind the painkiller OxyContin, one of the drugs that drove the opioid epidemic. The CDC says more than a million people died from 1999 to 2020 from opioid overdoses. Now, the Sackler family had agreed to pay up to $6 billion to Purdue's reorganization fund on the condition that the Sacklers themselves -- the individuals -- would be shielded from other opioid-related civil lawsuits. At the core of the case is the responsibility for the early days of the opioid crisis -- a crisis that continues very much so today.
