And Kara, Don Jr. testified for about 2 hours this morning before the court took that lunch break.

So, all of this stuff this morning, it's his chance to sort of tell his story and, you know, Donald Trump's a visionary and every property is a crown jewel. But you could ask, what does it really have to do with the charges which are inflating values? It's his chance to do what you would normally do to a jury. And also, I think he's talking to the American public. But what he really has to do, and the defense has to do is rebut the charges that the valuations were inflated and false and they knew it. And this has kind of been, you know, an infomercial for the first few hours.It doesn't really speak to that a lot. That's why the AG was objecting so much. This is irrelevant. It's a narrative. But the judge is saying, you know, let it go. I don't want to have any problems on appeal. Let him tell his story. You had 6 weeks. So that was the basic theme of this morning.",

I mean, we've talked a lot about how the former president likes to play things out in the court of public opinion versus inside the courtroom. How much of what we're going to be hearing from Don Jr. and Eric and if the former president gets back on the stand is really aimed at shaping this narrative outside the courtroom?",

It'd be one thing if Don Trump Jr. was turning to the jury and trying to turn on the charm such as such as it is. But it's the judge who's going to decide. I think they've pretty well concluded that the judge is going to decide against them. And this whole story won't really do anything on appeal. So, I think the only real explanation besides just giving him a chance to tell the story of why his father is a visionary and it's a fantastic brand and the like really is for us, the public. It doesn't really have much to do with the decision that the trial judge and not a jury is going to make.",

The one thing he said today that I thought was a mistake is he said everybody shared responsibility for everything. And that suggests a role for all of them in these potential false evaluations. So, what's going to happen now, I think, is he'll try his best to give, you know, different explanations about how things work, but come cross- examination, he's going to face some very pointed questions both about valuations and about the spectacular failures and business losses of this company that supposedly was the visionary for the whole real estate reel.",

All of the hostages released, the Mossad and the CIA also involved in those conversations. They are ongoing from what we know. The hard part to gauge is how much progress in there -- is there.President Joe Biden spoke with the Emir of Qatar over the weekend, and he brought up for the first time as we've learned, a 3-year-old toddler, an American citizen who's being held by Hamas. That would be the youngest American we know who was captured and kidnapped in the terror attack on October 7th. He said all of the hostages should be released immediately. He also underscored in his call with the Emir of Qatar the need for a Palestinian state and Israelis and Palestinians living side by side. Meanwhile, domestic pressure is growing here as well. The families of the hostages are planning a march from here in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem tomorrow over several days that will End at the prime minister's office. They're pushing for a hostage release and a hostage exchange here. Hamas has demanded all for all, all the hostages in Gaza for all of the prisoners in Israel. Meanwhile, there's also been discussions of a hostage release for a several-day pause in the fighting. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no pause in the fighting until all of the hostages are released.  The difficult part is trying to find any sort of common ground here in the middle of a war between Israel and Hamas that would allow nearly 240 hostages to be released. KEILAR: Oren, the situation when it comes to health care in Gaza, as i just mentioned, we're talking about the largest hospitals in Gaza. Give us a sense of what's going on there.",

Al-Qud's hospital, the second largest hospital in Gaza, already shut down over the weekend, closed off its medical services because it no longer has the supplies, the energy, the food, the fuel to run the hospital. And that brings us to Al-Shifa hospital, the largest hospital in Gaza that's treating some 650 patients, with thousands of people trying to find sanctuary inside as fighting rages on the streets there between Israel and Hamas.That hospital, we learned from the hospital director, had to shut off all of its essential units, meaning it's barely, if at all, able to treat patients inside. As an example, in the neonatal intensive care unit, the incubators that keep the babies alive shut down over the weekend when the generator could no longer operate. Three babies in the neonatal intensive care unit died as a result of that. Now, according to the hospital director, they're relying on hot water and foil to try to keep the babies warm and, frankly, keep the babies alive so they can keep finding some way to treat them. And that is just a small fraction of the challenges here. We're about to show you a clip here. Just a warning, this is a graphic clip, so please keep that in mind here as we play this from inside one of the hospitals describing the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Daniel, the parties involved right now, as we talk about hostages here, they are working on a deal to get a sustained, days-long pause in fighting in exchange for a large group of hostages being freed.We know that President Biden actually spoke with the Emir of Qatar about the hostage situation. Does that perhaps signal to you that there is progress in getting Israel on board with this big step? DANIEL O'SHEA, NAVY SEAL COMMANDER (RET): Well, there is intense pressure on Netanyahu, not only coming from the allies. You know, 30- plus countries have nationals that are being held hostage, with the 238 total that they still have listed. You've also got pressure from the families themselves in Israel that are going to march on his residence, demanding the release. So, all pressure is on Netanyahu right now, not only from his own people, especially the family members of the hostages, but the international community as well.",

You have, we've heard 3-month-old children, upwards to 85-plus-year-old grandparents are being held, innocent noncombatants. But again, this is how terrorist groups negotiate with the West. They grab hostages. And frankly, world opinion is driven very much by this young American child, and it's getting the US president involved. So, it's serving their end state.

This is what is allowing these civilians out of Gaza along these 2 main highways. Do you see this as a practice run for a larger pause, or should we really just see this for what it is?O'SHEA: Well, anything could happen right now, because the conjunction with the al-Shifa hospital, it's the largest hospital, reportedly has a command structure, a Hamas command structure, bunker system. The hostages very well could be hidden underneath this hospital as well. We've already heard that people are fleeing to that hospital right now. So that's the challenge, that Hamas not only uses the hostages as human shields, they use their own populace. And that's what makes this so challenging for, you know, the stated goal for the IDF is to go in and wipe out Hamas. And it's pretty hard to do when Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians are co-located with the very, very terrorist organization you're trying to wipe off the face of the earth.",

But clearly the court is trying to address concerns about ethics on the bench after a series of high-profile stories about benefits that justices have received. Now, we've looked through the code of conduct now and again, it's not clear how this will be enforced, but it is an important step because we know the nine justices, they are not bound by a formal ethics code, unlike lower courts, which are.And in recent months, really over the past couple of years, there have been a series of big stories about things that justices have received and sometimes for people who are close to cases that they will hear. So, this is interesting because the court says that they derive this code of conduct from the one that the lower courts abide by, but they didn't accept it wholesale. So right now, we're going through and trying to figure out what is different, what is new. But Democrats in Congress are, of course, threatening to pass legislation to mandate ethics reform. They asked the chief justice, John Roberts, to come before the court and testify. He declined. And in April, when he declined, he sent them a letter and attached to it was a statement of ethics and principles, practices that they abide by. This appears to be going a little bit further.
