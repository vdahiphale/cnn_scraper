And the IDF then released a second video, which they say show Israeli forces in a section of the tunnels where they believe Sinwar was hiding. And what they're showing here is a kitchen, bedrooms and tons of money. Again, these are IDF footage. CNN cannot independently verify what it is or that Sinwar is the man seen in the video or when it was recorded.The IDF has not provided additional evidence to support their claims. Nonetheless, that footage is, of course, fascinating. Thanks so much for joining us. CNN special coverage of the New York special election starts now.",

The vote to fill the seat previously held by Congressman Santos comes after many months of scandal and a litany of lies that led to his indictment on 23 criminal charges, followed by his historic expulsion from Congress in December.Tonight's heated race pits veteran Democrat and former Congressman Tom Suozzi against a relative newcomer to politics, Republican Nassau County legislator, Mazi Pilip. This is a potential nail-biter of a race that's about much more than just who represents New York's 3rd Congressional District in the Long Island area, once reliably Democratic turf that is now a political battleground. This race tonight could provide important clues for the Biden and Trump campaigns as they gear up for an expected rematch that may be decided by moderate suburban voters such as those who dominate the 3rd Congressional district. And it will have a direct impact on the balance of power in Congress. Republicans are eager to add to their current seven-seat advantage in the House. Democrats hoping to make the GOP's slim majority even slimmer. As the special election unfolds, members of the U.S. House of Representatives just got a fresh reminder about how much every vote counts. Republicans successfully impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas just minutes ago after a similar vote last week narrowly failed in an embarrassing public defeat for GOP leaders. CNN's Manu Raju joins us now from Capitol Hill. Manu, big night - big night for Republicans.",

Republicans moving this after that embarrassing defeat last week then said this is going to go over to the Senate despite three Republicans just now voting against it. Expect the Senate, potentially by a bipartisan majority in the Senate, to quickly dismiss this.But Jake, this margin underscores the significance of this race tonight. One vote would have made a difference here. If the Democrat, Tom Suozzi, were in this seat, that would have been enough to scuttle this effort. Mazi Pilip, the Republican, told me just recently that she would have voted yes. That would have given them cushion on this vote and that is why this moment is important about there are huge issues that are pending before the House. These two members, how they come into Congress, that will impact how the Republican leadership deals with it. Everyone watching this race so intently tonight, Jake.",

Number one, you just saw that - you mentioned the House Republicans impeaching the Homeland security, a very narrow majority right now, 219 to 212, a few vacancies.

We'll learn as the votes come in. But this is an interesting district for a number of reasons. Let's just take a look as we come through here and bring it out. Number one, this is a district - if you look at the last 10 years of American political life, the Democrats should win. George Santos was a Republican. Why should Democrats win? Democrats have been doing very well among those higher educated voters. This district won - about one and a half times the national average in terms of voters that have a college degree, at least a bachelor's degree or higher, so it is more educated. That is one reason in recent political times you would say it should tilt Democratic. Another reason, this is a very affluent Congressional district. If you look here, 200,000 - a little less than 200,000, 22 percent, above 200,000 income, nearly 30 percent. Again, more than one and a half times the national average, the median income in this district. So it is more educated and it is more affluent, which means if you look, New York suburbs here, but - the Philadelphia suburbs, the Cleveland suburbs, the Atlanta suburbs, the Phoenix suburbs, the people who made Joe Biden president are the people who live in districts like this in New York. So that's one reason to look at it. Another reason to look at it when you think about it as we go on through November, let me stretch this out a little bit. Really interesting demographics in this district. Not a huge black vote in this district, a traditional piece of the Democratic base. So Tom Suozzi has to get, number one, nearly six in 10 voters in the district are white. I talked to him about, yes, a couple of weeks ago when he was in here, he pointed to this, the Asian population, the Asian voters. It's nearly 23 percent of the population in the district. It is a giant swing constituency and he said it was trending back toward the Republicans and he needed to pull it back. Also, we've seen in the 2020 presidential election, Latinos starting slowly, not hugely, but enough to make a difference trending back toward Republicans, more than 13 percent of the electorate in this district. So it's the suburbs, you have two great swing groups, Latinos and Asians to keep an eye on and let's see - let's see if it sends a message. Number one, tells Mike Johnson how big his majority is. And number two, we'll see if there are some November lessons.",

If Democrats can take a seat back, it kind of staunches some of the bleeding that they've been doing in the national media cycle lately. So that's number one.Number two, testing out this immigration issue. It's obviously the top issue in the race. And the Republicans really do believe that it is going to be useful in all kinds of districts across the country that are nowhere near the southern border. So this is the first test case for that. Now, they have been outspent about two to one and I think the Republicans are targeting about 24 districts this year that are less Democratic than this one. So even if they don't win, if they get close here or win using immigration as an issue, I think you're going to see this become a, obviously, a key strategy and all these other targeted races throughout the rest of the year.",

You look at the foreign aid bill and I look at why hasn't Joe Biden told Americans why they should care? Congress hasn't done it either. Tell people why they think Ukraine is important and the fact that helping Ukraine prevents war. Tell them why Israel is important, because it actually helps us avoid terrorism when we do that.

Thanks so much for joining us, Congressman. First of all, as you know better than most, there are a lot of House Republicans reluctant to kick Santos out of the Congress because of the very narrow majority Republicans have. If Mazi Pilip, the Republican, does not win tonight, will you regret calling for Santos to be ousted? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): No. It was the right thing to do. He was unfit to serve as a member of Congress. He not only defrauded the voters. He defrauded donors, stealing money through shell companies, through the campaign. His treasurer pled guilty, a campaign staffer pled guilty to impersonating Kevin McCarthy's chief of staff. You have to have standards. And ultimately, he was allowed and afforded due process with the Ethics Committee, which is what many of my colleagues were concerned about. Myself, Anthony D'Esposito, Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro, we called for him to resign immediately when these allegations first surfaced. Because from our own interactions, we thought there was something wrong with him. But ultimately, when you see all the evidence that came out, putting litany of lies, but the criminal evidence that came out, 23 felony counts, he was unfit to serve. So I stand by the decision to expel him. Sometimes you have to take a stand that's bigger than party. And frankly, when you see what's going on, for instance, in the Senate with Bob Menendez. You know, people like John Fetterman are standing up and saying he needs to go. I think in Congress, if we want to restore the reputation of this institution and give the American people something to believe in, we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard.",

Their close fight to represent the third congressional district will determine if Republicans hold onto this New York seat, expanding their slim seven- seat advantage in the House. Or if Democrats pull off a win, that chips away at that GOP majority. As the polls are about to close any minute, let's go back to a key voting location. John Berman is in Carle Place, New York.

Number one, what is the final number, Jake, of the Election Day vote. Because we do know Republicans view it more as a holiday.They tend to more be more traditional and vote on Election Day. We see that all across the country. If Democrats had an advantage in early voting, did the weather. Did the fact that it's a special election, did that combination depressed turnout, does that help the Democrat? We'll see. We'll be counting votes in just a matter of minute. So you mentioned this is the district. Let's zoom a little bit. One thing interesting about it, John, is in Nassau County. Let me just put the county lines up here. You see the line right here. This is Queens County. This is part of New York City. Queens County is part of Queens, right? So you're on the edge of New York City. Tom Suozzi has to run it up here. And we'll get some early votes here pretty early on. They're likely to be -- when we get those early votes, they're likely to be lopsided democratic. That's good for Tom Suozzi. But remember, as we've seen in recent elections, especially since COVID, there's more early voting. It tends to be disproportionately democratic so that he needs that. But that doesn't mean, oh, game over. We have to count throughout the night. So you'll see that early on, but that's Queens County. Then you come over here. This is where John is out in Nassau County. This is where Mazi Pilip just simply has to, you know, not only compete in the early vote when we start to see that, but run it up. But it is a different district in the sense as you move away from the city, you get more suburban. And that is the tug-of-war. How is this district matter? Let me pull out a little bit. Come back here. Just in New York, right? I'm going to show you in the country, we have so- called swing districts. These are districts, Republican-held districts that Joe Biden won, right? So you watch this right here. Let me come out and pull it out to the thing. Here, this is -- this one right here is here. If you come back and look at the House of Representatives now, right, this one is here, we're looking at tonight, but then if you pull it out, there are 17 of these. And so will this district tell us anything about these? If you're the Democrats, now in a presidential cycle, these -- Joe Biden won these districts in 2020. Republicans won them in 2022. So in the tug of war for the control of the House of Representatives, you know, Republicans are going for the narrow Biden wins, but the Democrats are trying to take them back. So does this district in New York tonight tell us anything that you might apply, because many of these districts like this one, are those competitive suburban districts. Higher education, higher income have been trending democratic. But we have seen signs the Republicans are starting to pull them back. That tug of war gets one vote tonight as we count votes in a bit.",
