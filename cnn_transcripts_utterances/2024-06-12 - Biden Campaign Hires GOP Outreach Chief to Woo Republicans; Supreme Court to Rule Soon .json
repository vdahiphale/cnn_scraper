You say, whatever the court's decision and whoever won the 2024 presidential election, it was clear that the case would not mark the end of the post-Roe religious rights, legal and political efforts to row back America's cultural transformation, of course, referring to Dobbs.

But when you strip away, just -- are able to look at the big picture of how did the anti-abortion movement become so successful? What were their legal strategies? How did they get to this point?

And one of the things that you guys get into in this book is Donald Trump, how he has handled this issue, and how voters viewed him in 2016.You guys write, many voters assume that Trump's opposition to abortion rights was just part of the political game to win the White House.
