When you look at the meme that was sent out, you notice that the immigrants that were shown, they are immigrants of color, right? Despite the fact that immigrants come from around the world, he wants you to see that there are certain types of immigrants that you should fear. And what he does is he takes very complicated issues, takes away all the nuance and makes it very simple for people who are low information voters to believe that they are somehow protected by him and not on the outside group. But I think what many of these voters will start to see is that he also doesn't have their interest at heart and that is something that will be evident when many of the policies that he advocates, when you really look at them closely, you see that they don't include all of America.",

So there are actions that they've taken and as long as she points back to that and she talks about what she's going to do and reminds people that this is a long-term problem, it is not a problem that just started under the Biden-Harris administration, but it's something that we, as Americans of all sides should be invested in fixing, she can seem like the adult in the room.",

Missouri, of course, has long ago stopped being a battleground state in presidential contests, but it could still influence others statewide races there.

I do think on this issue its vital that Trump really express his views on this, and he has, and he's going to have to continue to do so. And that is, he has a pretty moderate position in the Republican Party. It's the old Reagan position. He is pro-life, he believes in the three exceptions -- rape, incest, and life of the mother. To Paul's point, he supports abortion rights for people who've been victims of rape. He strongly supports IVF. I mean, Trump has actually set forth a very center cut set of positions on this topic that a lot of Americans are going to say, yes, that sounds pretty reasonable to me. It is true his court overturned Roe versus Wade, that didn't do anything except return it to our political process and let states make decisions about local policy.

Now, it appears that's what these documents for.
