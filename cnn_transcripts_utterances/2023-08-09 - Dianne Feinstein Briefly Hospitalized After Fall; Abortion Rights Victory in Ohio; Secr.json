It's a memo written by Ken Chesebro, who is a lawyer who was working on this fake electors scheme. He was writing multiple memos about how to use fake electors to help Donald Trump. And then what happened was, initially, they wanted these fake electors to come together on December 14 just in case one of the battleground states would fall in Trump's favor, even though he didn't look like he was going to win. But then, when Ken Chesebro wrote an additional memo, this memo that \"The New York Times\" has now made public that is cited in the indictment, at that time, he's saying on December 6 that we want it to look like a routine measure that the fake electors are coming together, but, actually, we need these because it'll create confusion, and people will start to believe that maybe Mike Pence can overturn the outcome of the election.

All of her scans were clear and she returned home.\" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also said he spoke with the senator from California this morning, that she said she was doing fine, that she's recovering at home. [13:20:00] And I think that it's important to point out that she was absent from the Senate for several months. If you will remember, back in February, she was hospitalized because of complications from shingles. She then returned to the U.S. Senate in May, but she did face calls from Democrats saying that she should step aside. When she returned in May, it happened after there was some pressure because her vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee was so key to moving forward many of the president's judicial nominations. There have been some moments over the course of the last several months in which she has seemed confused at times, including right before the recess, when she was on the Senate Appropriations Committee. They were voting to approve a defense spending bill. And she seemed to start to read a statement as to why she supported that piece of legislation, instead of just simply voting aye. She was then reminded by her staff that it was time to vote and reminded by Senator Patty Murray, the chairwoman of that committee, just to say \"Aye.\" She then did. And at the time, her office that it was just a confusing set of circumstances, that they were switching back and forth between the vote and having statements on why senators were backing the bill. And she just had a momentary lapse, wondering what to do next. So she voted yes. And that was the last of it. Obviously, lawmakers are on recess right now, Brianna.

Now, of course, yesterday's vote was to change the rules to make it more difficult to amend the state's Constitution for that abortion rights question that will be on the November ballot. But it was about far more than that as well. It was about the petition process, how difficult it will be to get some of these petitions on states across the country and other states that allow it to protect abortion rights. Of course, all of this comes a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, sending the issue back to the states. And we have seen one state after another since then, beginning with that surprise decision in Kansas last summer, on to Kentucky, Montana, Michigan as well, protecting abortion rights in their states' constitution. Now, this is going to be a full on campaign here in Ohio. This is going to be the only state where abortion will actually be on the ballot this November. So, look for both sides to pour an incredible amount of resources in. But there is no doubt, with a simple majority needed to pass that, abortion rights proponents believe that this is something that they can do.

I'm in a town called Maalaea. And you can see that police have this area completely shut down. They're not letting anyone through. No one is allowed on the west side of the island right now, because it is not safe. The fire first broke out yesterday morning around 6\"30. So it's been over 24 hours here in Hawaii that firefighters have been battling this blaze. And they're battling multiple brushfires throughout the entire island. This one here on the west side, as well as in the Upcountry area, you heard from that resident -- there's people Upcountry as well. Last night, there were fires on the south side of the island. And so firefighters, first responders absolutely have their hands full right now. Maui police are not letting anyone in, but they are allowing people out. You are only allowed in if you are, like, official or a first responder. As you can see, the wind sure is roaring right now. A lot of times, in the morning, the winds are normally calm. In the afternoon, it picks up again. But this is an indication that there is no sign of this fire stopping or there's no sign of relief because of the winds are just whipping right now. And you can see also this line of cars. These are residents or visitors that are trying to get into the west side. There's no indication that police will open up the road anytime soon. But as we have been talking about, the west side of the island, behind Lahaina, Kaanapali, Kahana, that is a very popular tourist destination. We have been seeing videos that have been sent to our newsroom all morning long and all throughout the night of just structures that are damaged, businesses that are destroyed. It's difficult to talk to people out there because phone lines are down, cell towers are down. So it's hard to get in touch with loved ones to see how they're doing. But we know that shelters have been opened. The Red Cross has opened shelters. But they have also been evacuating that -- shelters as well. They're just leaving the west side and heading into the town location here where we are, where it's much safer, so no signs of this fire stopping anytime soon. KEILAR:  Chelsea, we have heard officials talking about burn victims, burns that are so severe that folks need to be taken off of Maui so that they can get better treatment than is available on the island.

So I'm sure they're having a hard time getting in touch with first responders on scene. They obviously have their hands full battling the blaze as well. But communication is hard to come by because the phone lines are down. So we don't know numbers at this time. We have heard from the chief communications officer for the county of Maui that evacuations are extensive and multiple structures have burned. But she doesn't have an exact number for us, because she said they're just still trying to focus on just getting people to safety. This is still a very active scene. A lot of people -- as a matter of fact, we just learned that a shelter on the west side, they're being evacuated from that evacuation shelter. So they're leaving the west side, getting out of the area completely. So, to answer your question, we don't have exact numbers because officials are still trying to work to get that information. In terms of the burn victims, we -- they are being flown to Oahu, to Honolulu, to Straub Hospital. And that's kind of a specialized hospital that is focused on critical burn victims. And a huge reason for that is because we only have one acute hospital here on the Valley Isle. For this entire island, there's just one main hospital. And so they are overwhelmed. Doctors, nurses, staff members, they can't take -- they're already at their max before this started. So they need help. So, they are flying people over to Honolulu, where there are much more resources, a lot more hospitals, doctors, nurses, staff that can take care of those burn victims.
