He said some people just show up and it causes a distraction. That's true for a president perhaps. But it's not true for a transportation secretary. FEMA was there on day one. EPA administrator has been there two times. This is ultimately Norfolk Southern's responsibility to clean up. But it really requires a bipartisan effort. We are seeing some outlines of that, some of the enthusiasm of deregulating the train industry, particularly some of these trans that transport harsh chemicals, now there appears to be a bipartisan effort to revisit that.

But at this point, this woman has not been charged with that. The FBI interviewed her and so far, she's only been arrested on a local misdemeanor charge of illegal airport obstruction, no federal charges at this point. But the FAA this morning has been tweeting overnight at least about their strategy to fortify the flight deck for future flight saying, \"Last year, we made progress to require new planes to have a second barrier to the flight deck after the rule stalled under the previous administration. We're working quickly to issue the final rule.\"So, what would that barrier look like Poppy, it would likely be some sort of gates or a -- mesh wire panels, something like that would be pulled across the aisle of the plane in front of the first row. But it's important to note it would only apply these changes to new aircraft. They would not be upgrading airplanes that are currently flying today. HARLOW: They're not, not the majority of them.

And what happens in the water is a process that takes time. How this chemical will travel with the water? How long it will take to get to a municipality to a well water?
