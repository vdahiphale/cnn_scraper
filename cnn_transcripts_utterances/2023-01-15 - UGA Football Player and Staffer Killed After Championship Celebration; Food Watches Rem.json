All of this unfolding early in the morning, 2:45 a.m., where their car for some reason left the road, striking two power poles, snapping the power lines in half, and continuing on to hit trees, going over a small hill, and landing, crashing, and finally resting by the side of an apartment complex. Willock and LeCroy, they died from their injuries. Two other football program members that were inside of that car, they have survived, one with minor injuries, another with serious injuries. From the football roster, we know that Willock, he was from New Jersey, an offensive lineman, a red shirt sophomore, and he played every game this year. And take a look at this video of the team just yesterday, hours before that crash, celebrating the national championship victory. So many people out there, fans, the student community cheering them on, and this victory at a parade here in Athens.

And if you look past that sign right there where it says no life guard on duty, local residents tell us that there's actually a walkway for another 20 feet as well as an entire parking lot before you actually reach the beach. So we've seen residents come up to the water's edge, taking pictures because one person said she's lived here 30 years, and it's just very intrigued to see the water come up this far. We also saw someone trying to kayak here, though I'm not sure that's recommended. There are still city and county officials really warning residents to be careful of threats like mudslides like we saw in Belmont yesterday. And that's on the peninsula. You can see these pictures from Belmont Police showing part of a hillside coming down into a neighborhood. That's the type of threat that's still very possible, given the amount of moisture that is saturated in the ground and in these rivers, with more rain coming very soon through the morning hours. We're also expecting some high wind gusts as well. There are counties south of here who have issued wind advisories.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:40:34] BROWN: Just in to CNN, a University of Alabama basketball player is charged with capital murder. 21-year-old Darius Miles is facing charges in connection with the shooting in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, early this morning. Police tell us he is one of two men arrested and charged in this case. And the university released this statement. \"First and foremost, we extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the victim from last night's incident. We were made aware of the recent charge against student athlete Darius Miles, and he is no longer a member of the Alabama men's basketball team. Athletics in conjunction with the university is fully cooperating with this investigation.\" Well, any day now Facebook's parent company is expected to announce whether it will allow former President Donald Trump back on to the platform. CNN spoke with two former Facebook officials, one a Democrat, the other a Republican. As CNN's Donie O'Sullivan shows us they have special insight into the type of debate that will ultimately lead to a decision.

Not only cutting, you know, murders by almost 70 percent, crime more than 50 percent, cutting welfare in half, but turning multibillion dollar deficits into surpluses, cutting taxes, restoring the quality of life, setting up a model for urban America that showed that cities were not, indeed, ungovernable. And that is a success in governing. And it's in stark contrast, in some ways, to how he is seen today. But it shouldn't be forgotten.

But I think this last chapter, the decisions he's made to throw in with Donald Trump and back an election lie and contradict so many of the principles that he upheld, I think that threatens to cast a shadow and make so much of the positive things about his legacy less accessible.But it shouldn't. You need to understand somebody in all the chapters of their life. I think 9/11 ultimately is what he will be remembered for and should be remembered for.
