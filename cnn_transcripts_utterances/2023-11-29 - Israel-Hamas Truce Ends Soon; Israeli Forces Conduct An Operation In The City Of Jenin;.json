Are the red-headed boys coming out today? And just to hear that this family may no longer be alive, I mean that is what you call collective trauma in terms of what the people of Israel are going through right now.

The pause is supposed to end at midnight tonight, so we still have a few hours for those negotiations to bear fruit. For now, what I hear from Israeli officials is that they did not get any indication that Hamas agrees to release more hostages in the coming days in order to allow for an extension of the pause. And the Israelis are saying another thing, which is very interesting. In my opinion, they say that they will not discuss any further deals, meaning on soldiers, on men who are held hostage or anything else, before all women and children are released from Gaza.

Now, the army went into the Jenin refugee camp at about 9 P.M. last night. They went in with dozens of military vehicles backed up with bulldozers, with drones overhead. We were actually in Jenin -- the refugee camp, yesterday before this incursion took place. What the Israelis do is they will go in with these bulldozers and just plow up all the roads, which oftentimes breaks the sewage pipes, the water pipes, and the infrastructure, the electricity in the camp. Now, they declared it a closed military area. And as you said, they said this was anti-terrorism activity. Now, there are militants in the refugee camp. But of course, in the refugee camp, they're not seen as militants. They're seen as fighters against a decades-long military occupation by Israel of the West Bank. Now, you mentioned the blocking of access to the hospitals. That's why two people died, apparently, the Israelis, as is the custom when they go into Jenin. They surround the hospitals, don't let anybody go near them. So, two people died because they couldn't get treatment in time. In addition to that, Israeli soldiers shot two boys, one aged 14, one aged eight. And this sort of raid, this sort of incursion is a regular event. Residents of the camp yesterday told us that since August, there have been more than 35 individual incursions into the camp. Just last of Thursday going into Friday, four people were killed in that raid, as well. So, this has been very much the brunt of intense military action by the Israelis going back months if not years.",

And when they are arriving, we're trying to protect them at the beginning from the environment that just, you know, let them in. The whole process of passing in, you know, they arrive in helicopters after everything they've been through and they're just, you know, entering a special department that's made for them and trying to show them if there are familiar faces, the most familiar faces that the main, you know, take the one that will take care of them is with them.

Now, the environment has to be like you know we're trying to make the environment as pleasant and possible and not too much because they have been suffering from overload of everything. So, the first steps are we're not doing anything -- nothing invasive if the clinical situation is enabling us. So, we just let them, you know, come in, meet the families after a quick evaluation by social workers to see if it's okay and then they're with the families. And the next steps after, it's a little bit relaxed -- it's a major event. You cannot imagine how terrible this thing is.

So, there's lots of issues regarding the nutrition. We even know that the food that they had like very small amounts of, you know, bread or rice and there are lots of things like constipation issues and deficiencies that they were suffering from. Now, when they return, the first thing you want to do is give them food and feed them. And this is also dangerous because after being low in caloric supply for such a long time and you lose -- you know, kids that are losing nine, 10 kilograms from their weight in such a period, then you have to be careful not to cause a re-feeding syndrome which is dangerous. So, everybody wants to give and bring food and candies and the best, you know, the food that they like and we have to prevent -- I was trying to take food out of rooms of kids so they will not each much, not to get the electrolyte and balance that could be caused if you eat too many things, especially sweet things.
