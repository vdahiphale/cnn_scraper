If you're just joining us, here are today's top stories.Syria's ousted President Bashar al-Assad and his family have fled to Russia after rebel forces toppled his regime. Sources say they've been granted asylum on humanitarian grounds. South Korean prosecutors have banned President Yoon Suk Yeol from traveling overseas amid an investigation into his attempt to impose martial law last week and potential insurrection charges, too. President Yoon publicly apologized on Saturday, but it was too little too late, as his party is set to seek his resignation and are pushing for his suspension. And a Major League Baseball player now has the biggest contract in the history of sport. According to reports, superstar outfielder Juan Soto has agreed to a 15-year deal with the New York Mets worth at least $765 million. ESPN says Soto could earn more than $800 million if certain conditions are met. The Lebanese army has deployed new troops along its border with Syria. Lebanese officials say the soldiers are there to maintain security and protect civil peace. Lebanon says it wants to distance itself from possible repercussions of the Syrian rebel offensive. We're joined live now from Damascus, Syria by UNHCR representative Gonzalo Vargas Llosa. Thank you so much for joining us. Just take us through your concern about that border area, first of all, because obviously other borders around Syria as well are a concern for the countries in the region.",

Thank you.We're going to cross now to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's joining us from the occupied Golan Heights, live for us. Jeremy, a lot of movements in that area, too. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. Israeli troops have been going into the Syrian buffer zone on the other side of this border fence right here. This is the line that separates the Israeli occupied Golan Heights and Syrian territory. There is a buffer zone of about two kilometers where Israeli troops have not been positioned for more than 50 years. But now Israeli troops are inside that buffer zone. And we're also told, according to the Israeli defense ministry, that Israeli troops have also captured positions beyond that buffer zone as well in Syrian-held territory. You can see my cameraman, John, is now zooming in on a building here where moments ago we just saw some Israeli troops who were positioned inside that buffer zone. And then if he whips back around over here, this gate that is over here is where we have seen Israeli military vehicles have gone back and forth throughout the day. Yesterday was the first day that Israeli troops began going into this buffer zone after the Israeli prime minister said Syrian troops left their position on the other side of that buffer zone. According to the prime minister, that meant the collapse of the 1974 agreement between Israel and Syria that has held for more than 50 years. And he then sent Israeli troops to go and take over those positions, effectively positioning Israeli troops between the communities here in the Golan Heights and those newly victorious Syrian rebels. So as you can see, this gate is open at the moment, and we expect that Israeli troops will continue to go inside and outside of that area. Now, in addition to what we're seeing here in this buffer zone, we also know that the Israeli military has been conducting airstrikes inside of Syria. We have been hearing and seeing those jets overhead throughout the morning. And we know that the Israeli military said they are going after strategic weapons of the Israeli -- of the Syrian armed forces, going after ballistic missiles, air defense systems that the Syrian -- that were previously held by the Syrian regime. So a lot of military action is taking place here as a result of the fall of the Assad regime yesterday, which stunned the region at large, of course. And of course, in this community as well of Majdal Shams, where we are now, we also know that there are people who have family on both sides of the border. The people in this area consider themselves to be Syrians of the Syrian Druze community. And many families here are separated by this 1974 demarcation line with families on both sides of that border.",

On Sunday, Iran, a key backer of Assad, says it'll respect Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but not without some caveats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBAS ARAGHCHI, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Our interaction with the group that took over Syria will depend on their behavior, on what policy will they adopt against the Islamic Republic of Iran? What policy will they have against the Syrian Shiites? What will be the distance between them and the Zionist regime? What will be the distance between them and the terrorist groups? And how will they behave? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm joined now by Steven Erlanger, a chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe for The New York Times. Stephen comes to us live today from Berlin. Thank you so much for joining us.I mean, it is a day of hope, isn't it, for all of those Syrians who felt so suppressed by the often barbaric regime that's just been ousted. But at the same time, we don't know what's going to replace it. And we have a main rebel leader who, you know, used to identify as a jihadi. But his rhetoric in the last few days has been very positive. So how are you reading it?",

But Turkey's main interest is, is -- are the Kurds in the north and the Americans back the Syrian Kurds, which annoys the Turks.And the Turks are very, very eager to maintain control over their border. The Turks also want to be able to send back all these refugees. They had three to four million Syrian refugees back to Syria. It's become a big political issue inside Turkey. So different countries with different interests hopefully can come together and stay together. But it was very notable that Donald Trump, for instance, said, you know, the U.S. should stay out of this. This is not our problem.",

But if you ask a lot of the Swifties, they will tell you that it was about coming together to listen to the music, to share these moments and to sort of forget about some of the problems that they were facing in the world. I met one of the super fans. Her name is Julie Barfuss. She gave me the friendship bracelets. I followed her along and I asked her what this concert and what this tour really coming to an end meant for her. Here's a little bit of our conversation.",

That is a record-setting number right now. The record belongs to Elton John.And the U.S. Travel Association said that between the travel, the hotel, the food, the merchandise, Swifties spent about $1,300. Also, according to another estimate, the Swifties spent in the U.S. about $5 billion. But that is direct spending, so it is estimated that even more money was spent here in the U.S. So it's not just the money that Taylor Swift is making. It is also the impact on so many local economies, both here and overseas. We're talking about the hotels, the restaurants near the venues where she played and performed. And so it's just so many people impacted by what Taylor Swift was able to accomplish over the last couple of years. So it's not just the Swifties that are going to be missing the Eras tour.
