      "sentences": "What does that tell you about the closeness with which forces are operating?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, the effective range of a tank is somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 yards, because that's what they can see. They have great night vision capability, night vision devices within the tank that will set on a target and be able to hit it at those ranges 3,000 meters. They go about 1,000 meters a second -- most tank rounds. So you can hit a target 3,000 meters away and even further if you can see it. But it tells me that there is something they're targeting on the other side. Probably the movement of some type of Hamas forces or Hamas vehicles or the establishment of some type of battle position by Hamas. They could also be seeing trucks moving up toward the border, planting improvised explosive devices, a series of things could be happening. But that that is a direct fire fight from a ground vehicle -- Anderson.",

      "sentences": "I want to show some video from about two days ago that was released by the IDF, in which they call a very limited cross-border operation to hit reconnaissance -- any reconnaissance positions or any munitions. This is again from two days ago. This is from Wednesday. We see bulldozers literally flattening the ground. What do you make of this?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, you see that long line of vehicles, the tanks and what look like personnel carriers with the flat roofs, but the tanks with the gun turrets, they're being let in across the border with bulldozers, D-7 dozers. Those things will clear rubble so the tanks can follow on behind them. They might also pick up because bulldozers are run by the engineers. They also have sappers that will find mines or improvised explosive devices and disarm those. So the follow on vehicles, the tanks and the personnel carriers can go in behind them.What I also saw was one of the bulldozers that looked like it was leveling the ground at the crossing point. It looked like there was a berm there that it was leveling off. Because you don't want a tank going up over the top of a berm cause it exposes its underside. You want to go straight across so it can maintain its turret and its orientation of its main gun tube on the enemy.",

      "sentences": "So in terms of moving forward is IDF forces moving forward into Gaza the deeper they go. You and I have talked about whether this could be a multi-pronged, you know, blitzkrieg fast operation or slow methodical. Are mines a concern along the border with Gaza? Do we know? Because I was out with the IDF during an operation 2006 during the fight against Hezbollah, in a armored personnel carrier going across the border, and it was supposed to be an hour operation and it lasted I think about 14 hours because the movement was so slow because of concerns about mines.",

      "sentences": "Well, yes, my command was responsible for a fight in Mosul in 2007 and eight. And what I'd say is this will be 10 to 20 times harder than Mosul for a variety of reasons. First of all, you've got better trained Hamas than you had al-Qaeda. You also have, like you said, the mines, al-Qaeda. They had IDEs and EFPs. They didn't have the minefields. They didn't have the subterranean fight that they could duck into. They didn't have high-rise buildings. I mean, the highest building in Mosul, I think, was like six or seven stories. So all of those things compound the fight when you're talking -- oh,by the way, they didn't have close to two and a half million people in Mosul that were the citizenry of the city and al-Qaeda, for the most part, was not using them as human shields, and they also didn't have 229 hostages. So when you try and compare Fallujah or Mosul to what's going to happen in Gaza, there is no comparison at all. And I'm telling you that from a guy who commanded forces in an urban environment, it's just going to be so much tougher.",

      "sentences": "And we're obviously seeing some very large explosions one after the other in Gaza right now. Before we let you go, Colonel -- General Hertling, let me ask you, the other factor in this, which is different than perhaps in Mosul and Fallujah is, Hamas has had -- if they have been preparing for the slaughter that took place in October 7th for two years. They've also had two years to prepare for what they knew would be an inevitable ground operation in the wake of that slaughter. So they've had a long time to prepare and think out and game out what Israel is about to do.",

      "sentences": "That is correct and that's why I think you have Israel conducting the kind of operation they're doing, trying to strike targeted infrastructure, trying to strike entrance to the tunnels, trying to strike locations where they know the -- Hamas has fired rockets from. Because that's the kind of intelligence they have.Again in Mosul, al-Qaeda was moving in and out of the city. There was a free movement in all directions north, south, east and west. What you have in this case is you've had Hamas in this city preparing defensive positions and tunnels and the kinds of ambushes that they want to conduct against the Israelis. They want -- Hamas wants Israel to come into this city. They -- that will meet every demand they have because not only will they be able to fight the Israeli Defense Forces they will be able to blame the IDF for all of the Palestinian casualties that are caused by them inside of the city, because they have held on to the Palestinian population. So they want Israel to come in and they don't care if Palestinians are harmed.",

And again, what's different tonight is the intensity of the bombardments. How loud they are from the position where we are. The types of munitions that they may be using. There's also the smoke that our correspondent Nic Robertson and -- was hearing as well -- was seeing as well. Which was different.And of course, the communications being cut off is not something that the IDF has done in the last couple of nights. Even as they've conducted those targeted raids. All of that indicates that what we are seeing right now, what we are hearing right now is something much, much larger. Whether or not it is that ground invasion remains to be seen -- Anderson.",
