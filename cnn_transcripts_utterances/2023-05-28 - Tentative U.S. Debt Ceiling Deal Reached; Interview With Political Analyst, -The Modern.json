It is meant to avert the first U.S. default in history, which could have disastrous consequences worldwide. Here's how U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy characterized the breakthrough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  After weeks of negotiations, we have come to an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do, but I believe this is an agreement in principle that's worthy of the American people. It has historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms, and will lift people out of poverty into the work force, rein in government overreach. There are no new taxes, no new government programs. There's a lot more within the bill. We still have more work to do tonight to finish all the writing of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  I think the debt ceiling is -- it's just a created thing to hold us into responsible and to check. But the reality is, neither party is responsible. We've got to get back to some fiscal sanity in this country, it's just that much. We cannot keep spending at these levels. Both parties need to start holding the line. If we went back to pre-spending (ph) we would have a surplus right now if we were at that level of spending. REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL):  These are really difficult times right now especially when people are using a default to push a political agenda forward. And so, people at home know the budget process is separate from this. They're combining it because they understand that they can't get through this type of cuts through the actual normal process that Congress usually takes. And so, they've combined these two things and they're saying, hey, it's my way or the highway. And it's not right and that's not the way we're supposed to go. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're getting bits and pieces that are starting to dribble out. And we don't know the full details and therein lie the rub, that's where we're going to have the problem. Because both sides want to make it look like they win. Neither side wants to make it look like they caved in, and yet both sides have had to make some concessions.

Biden, then-vice president now president, was in charge of some of the negotiations at that time. And one of the lessons that they learned from that episode was that if you pay a ransom, you encourage more hostage taking.And in fact, a couple of years later in 2013 there was another attempt to hold the debt limit hostage. It didn't get quite as bad that year as it had the previous couple of years, but I think that's part -- that whole experience is part of the reason why now President Biden had been adamant. We're not going to negotiate over this. There is -- should be no question about whether the United States will pay its bills, in fact, it's in the constitution. But the public -- the validity of public debt should not be questioned. We're not going to negotiate over that. Obviously, ultimately, he did.

It seems to show Ukrainian soldiers getting ready for battle and saying, it's time to take back what is ours.Now, in the video, you also see is them showing a lot of western supplied military equipment. It ranges from U.S. supplied Howitzers to HIMARS multiple rocket launch system, but also German supplied Leopard 2 main battle tanks, which many believe are going to be a key element once the Ukrainians start a counteroffensive that has been looming for a while. Now, it's unclear whether or not this could be an indication that that counteroffensive could be on the horizon, could be inching closer. But one of the things that we are seeing is that there do seem to be an increased number of long-distance strikes, possibly by the Ukrainians on the rear echelon of the Russians. Now, those are focusing, essentially, on two places. One of them is Berdyansk, on the Azov Sea, and the other is Mariupol, which of course is also a major port town on the Azov Sea as well. In fact, there are reports of three explosions, at least, in Mariupol on Saturday. Mariupol is one of the main staging grounds for the Russian military for their operations in Ukraine, so that certainly could be a big blow to the Russians if the Ukrainians are indeed hitting that area. The Russians, for their part, are saying that they have intercepted some Ukrainian drones and some Ukrainian missiles as well. They were also talking about intercepting two Storm Shadow missiles, which of course were supplied by the United Kingdom. It's unclear whether or not that that is true, but it certainly does seem as though right now the Russians in that part of Ukraine seem to be under a considerable amount of pressure.

And that, we are told, is when they were able to reach an agreement in principle. Now, of course, over the next several hours, both sides will be working on the text of this agreement.

When it comes to the debt ceiling process itself, there's only two countries in the world that have this type of debt ceiling. The other one is Denmark and their ceiling will never be hit, it's so high. I mean, it's designed that way. And when Donald Trump was in office, he said the debt ceiling should never be used a negotiating tactic. And then when he was challenged at the \"CNN Town Hall\" on why Republicans are doing it?

It's about what type of compromises you can extract from the other side because you have the opportunity.I mean, think of how different this conversation would be if about 10 votes in the House of Representatives have gone the other way. Democrats would have controlled the House, the Senate, the Oval Office. You never would have had this conversation, and that's because Republicans have really linked, and it was strategically extremely smart that they did, but have really linked the debt ceiling with what they want out of the next few budget cycles.
