Great to have you with us on thismidterm Election Day in the U.S. American voters are heading to the polls to decide the balance of power in Congress. All of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, as well as 35 seats in the Senate. And while Republicans are favored to win back control of the House, while the race for the Senate that could go either way. Global Markets of course, watching the faceoff between the Democrats and the GOP very closely. Investors do tend to like divided government, because it lessens the chances for major policy changes. They'd also like a quick, uncontested and yes safe outcome to today's contests as well. For now, as you can see, the major U.S. averages are on track for the third straight session of gains with Dow Futures up about four tenths of a percent. The NASDAQ closer to seven tenths of a percent in the S&amp;P also about up four tenths of 1 percent and we will have expert analysis of what to expect later in the show from Greg Valliere. He is the Chief U.S. Policy Strategist at AGF Investments. The economy, the number one concern for many voters going to the polls today President Biden and Democrats have been largely criticized for not doing enough to help bring down inflation, which is hovering near 40 year highs. And voting is underway across America amid uncertainty about the economy. So who better to speak about that, than CNN Chief Business Correspondent, Christine Romans? Christine, good to have you with us! You and I talked about this, it seems like daily, this tale of two economies you have unemployment very low, job creation still strong. But inflation remaining near 40 year highs last check about 8.2 percent. And that's really shaping how people feel about this economy today. They're going to speak with their votes.",

You mentioned the jobs market still near a 50-year low in terms of the unemployment rate. But people feel bad about inflation, inflation at levels we haven't seen in 40 years. So that is the number one factor, I think. Punishing the party in power is what many people are going to think is going to happen here when they go into the ballot box. Now, let's be clear, there are a lot of uncertainties here. You've got a lot of early voting people who are voting on the abortion rights issue in this country and gun control in this country. So there are a lot of other things that could be animating voters. We won't know for sure until all the voting is said and done. But certainly 40 year high inflation is top of the list.",

And so depending on the makeup of Congress, you could see different results. Right now it's looking like you could be heading into a period of gridlock, which is I think, what the markets traditionally like to see where if you were to have a Republicans controlling the House and the Senate Democrats in the White House, you could have some form of gridlock here.

But I have to say other nations in Africa are taking a different route. You look at Mozambique, Angola, Namibia, parts of North Africa, and others all aggressively pursuing natural gas and oil deals with developed nations. And there's that squeezed right now on Northern Europe and elsewhere, because of the war in Ukraine. And there is a need for many of those nations to secure energy. They're looking largely to Africa, not entirely, but largely to Africa. And that means that there's disconnect between the potential gains economically that Southern African and East African countries can make in selling their oil and natural gas to the west but also the fact that we are trying to avoid this climate catastrophe. I actually had an interesting chat with the head of the United Nations Environmental Program. She said that she understands that there will be a transitionary period. But by fully investing in fossil fuels right now, many activists say that you are really stopping any kind of progress that we can make towards mitigating emissions in the future, basically exporting the emissions to those countries that haven't caused this issue in the past. So while Kenya seems to be going on the right track, other countries are going on the wrong track, but they need financing to stop it you can't expect countries to just pull the plug on the economic development. And I think that's one of the discussions and the importance of meetings like here in Sharm el-Sheikh whether they can make any progress. We are yet to see it, Becky.",

They can't even see their families during this entire time. Now Foxconn says it's giving a one-time bonus to workers who left and are choosing to come back equivalent to 69 U.S. dollars. That's a one-time bonus. They're offering an hourly wage equivalent of four U.S. dollars for new workers. The background here of course, is that since there was that outbreak in the Zhengzhou facility in mid-October. There's been absolute chaos at the factory viral videos showing masses of workers walking miles and miles on highways even through farm fields in order to escape the COVID restrictions at the factory campus. There were many complaints from workers about subpar living conditions about the poor quality of food. And this has had a huge impact on Apple. Apple putting out an announcement saying that this is going to temporarily impact their shipments and it will cause a temporary delay because the capacity at the assembly factory has been significantly reduced. Now what all of this show is that Apple's reliance on China used to be a big reason for its success? It was low cost efficient manufacturing now it's become a liability. Apple here is just the latest victim of China's zero COVID policy.

What's happening now is we have, let's say, a challenge situation across the globe. But they're very different drivers and very different timings on this which means that kind of you really have to peel the onion to understand if a business is doing well or not in general our businesses in a very good place. Now, if we talk specifically about China, we have to bear in mind that China's mainly 3 percent of our revenue in quarter three. So yes, of course, I wish that the government there had a slightly more lenient approach to the regulations, because our traffic is down 60 odd percent. So it's very difficult to trade under those conditions. So we have to kind of wait for the Chinese government to start easing up a little bit in order to see different numbers coming out of China. Then we look at the U.S. our organic growth is down three points in the quarter which I think we will have to be very satisfied with given last year with the stimulus checks this whole jewelry market rose by almost 50 percent. We grew a little bit faster than that. But what I kept saying to my shareholders, and the analysts, like, throughout the whole year last year was like, this is unnatural. These will kind of reset during 22 and that's pretty much what's happening? So in that context, we'll be down only three points. We feel actually quite strong about that.",

Across the globe, let's park China for two seconds. But across the globe, those metrics are actually very strong, only odd one, the only soft one, I should say, is in Italy, where we can now see that the macro is starting to influence. So we're down I believe it was five points in terms of organic in Italy. But I think that's unfortunately the situation in Italy.

One of the problems now that Twitter is no longer a publicly traded company is that there are certain things that they don't really have to disclose to regulators as often or to investors for that matter.
