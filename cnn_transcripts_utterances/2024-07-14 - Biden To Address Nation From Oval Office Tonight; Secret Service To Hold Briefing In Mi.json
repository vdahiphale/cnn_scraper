We are covering some grave news and a call for unity from the White House as President Biden addresses the nation after that shocking assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. He spoke from the White House just a few moments ago and said he was genuinely grateful that his predecessor in that office survived that shooting attempt last night, and also offered his condolences to those who were killed. Corey Comperatore, and also the two who are critically injured during that shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We will the debate and we will disagree -- it's not -- that's not going to change, but it is going to -- we are going to not lose sight the fact who we are as Americans. Look, Vice President Harris and I were just briefed in the Situation Room by my Homeland Security team, including the director of the FBI, the Secretary of Homeland Security the attorney general, the director of the Secret Service, my Homeland Security adviser, the National Security adviser and we are going to continue to be briefed. The FBI is leading this investigation, which is still in its early stages. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He also announced that he is ordering the Secret Service to conduct a review of the security measures in place here at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.The Secret Service is already here on hand. You go through magnetometers to get inside the perimeter. It is quite a wide perimeter around the area, but President Biden says he wants them to review it, to check on those precautions. He also, and this is notable, given he just met with the Secret Service director in the Situation Room of the White House, says he wants an independent review of the security at that Trump rally and what measures were put in place that allowed 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks as the name of the suspected shooter to open fire before he was ultimately killed by counter snipers who were on the roof outside of that arena or outside of that perimeter where Donald Trump was speaking. In the last hour, we heard from former President Trump himself. He will be leaving his Bedminster home this hour, flying here to Milwaukee for the Republican Convention after considering a two-day delay, but ultimately saying he decided against it because he did not want a shooter to determine his schedule. We have a team of correspondents who are covering all these quick moving developments this hour. MJ Lee is at the White House, but I want to start with Danny Freeman, who is near the home where the gunman lived in, and obviously, Danny, this has been a lot of the questions that people have. President Biden himself, noting that the FBI has not determined a motive yet for this shooter, not one that they are ready to take public for that matter. What have you learned being on the ground?",

He said that Donald Trump is doing well and is recovering and that it was a good conversation.He also paid condolences to this rallygoer that you were just talking about describing him as a father who died while trying to protect his family from the bullets that were flying by. He of course, was just coming out of a briefing in the situation room from by the heads of various law enforcement agencies, the heads of the DOJ, DHS, FBI, and the US Secret Service and he said that the FBI is now taking the lead on this investigation and he expects this investigation to be fair and swift. He also said that there was nothing that he could share at this moment when it comes to the motives of the would-be assassin and he sent a stark message. He said, \"Don't make assumptions about his motives or affiliation right now,\" and essentially said, we need to let the federal agencies do their jobs. This clearly was a president that wanted, Kaitlan, to temper the rhetoric, the speculation and the misinformation that is unfortunately so rampant on social media and elsewhere right now. Just one other thing that is worth really stressing is that the president did also say that the Secret Service is going to be doing a thorough review of the security measures that are in place at the RNC where you are right now in Wisconsin. We already knew that there was going to be serious ramifications for the RNC given the events of yesterday, but the president, again, confirming for himself that that is going to be incredibly heightened heading into this crucial week. Tonight, the Oval Office address, I mean, you know better than anyone, how rare it is for the president to use that room, that setting to speak to the nation. So I think that just captures the gravity and the seriousness of the moment that we are in. You know, we heard the president two times now calling for America being a place where there is just no room for political violence of this kind. So we certainly expect that to be, again, a central theme when he speaks from the Oval Office tonight at eight o'clock.",

This is a script that has not been written in modern American history with social media, with disinformation, so this now its super charged, everything that has been building up to this point.But talking to people close to Nikki Haley, that is one example of the changes we will see in the Convention Hall behind me here. As of last week, she was not invited. She turned over her delegates just a few days ago, some 97 delegates; in that, she issued a call for party unity. Now, she is invited. I am told by her aides that she is working on her speech because this annotation is just coming, but she will deliver that call for unity for Republicans, and indeed Americans. Why does that matter? In some counties here politically speaking, she did considerably well. Right here in battleground, Wisconsin in Dane County, 124 percent of the primary vote, just a few months ago. So the Trump officials believe that she is a unifying voice for the party, but beyond that to American suburbs. But all week long, I think we will be sort of talking about the politics on one side and then the country and a broader look at things. So yes, she will address the politics, but I am told she will also use this as a bigger moment to address the fissures and deep tensions and divide in this country.",

You know, there is anger. He doesn't deserve sympathy. You're wrong. You know, he is the wrong person for office. It is really interesting that the divide is still there.

This is in the middle of a presidential campaign, but I still think the tone that is struck inside this Convention Hall will be so interesting and important and what does former President Trump do? This is a moment for him, his advisers do believe, to try and reach out, and obviously, President Biden is doing that tonight as well. But Democrats now are scrambling to sort of figure out how did they adjust their campaign week. They were obviously going to use it to attack him and draw distinctions.

He got off that call, went to Saturday evening mass as he does every week, and then all of this happened.So this is a new moment for his job as president and never mind presidential candidate, but this is an opportunity for him to obviously also be engaged and by calling for that independent investigation, I think that is something that only presidents know what it is like, I am sure to have that threat. As we reported last evening, former President Trump has always been nervous about this, former President Barack Obama's supporters, certainly were, so this is something that cuts deep. But for the Oval Office address tonight, this is a chance for President Biden to assert his control, and I guess, in his day job, but I am not sure if it changes anything in the long term for his candidacy.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:21:06] COLLINS: We are continuing to follow all of the developments surrounding the undergoing -- underway investigation into the assassination attempt on former President Trump at that rally last night. Any minute now, we are expecting to see the former president, for the first time, leave his home in New Jersey. He will be traveling here to Milwaukee for the Republican Convention that is underway where he is expected to pick a running mate, to be around delegates and surrogates and also, to ultimately deliver his speech on Thursday night on the Republican Convention that surely has been altered by what happened within minutes of him taking that stage last night. In the aftermath of that, of course, we are reminded political violence is not unheard of here in the United States. Actually, it is far from it, unfortunately. Here tonight -- here today joining me is historian and CNN political analyst, Julian Zelizer. Julian, it is great to have you here because I do think we look in this moment and people think, how can this happen? And how does, you know -- regardless of the Secret Service questions that we are already know, a lot of questions for them, just put this in the historical context for us of the last time we saw a presidential candidate in this situation, I believe it was George Wallace, but please tell us just the historical perspective of this.",

We've seen it from Donald Trump himself in past situations, and I think if you're just a regular person and you're looking at that, you're wondering where that leads us next. ZELIZER: Yes. It won't lead us very far. I think the important message is that this kind of rhetoric from leaders is dangerous because it can tap into this element of our culture, and it could also inspire people who are unstable to take actions as we just saw last night. So the message can't just become one more partisan talking point. I think ultimately, it has to be a bigger conversation about our political culture and then all of the other elements that are part of this, from security and securing our elected officials, down to poll workers, and also issues involving guns and weapon. So it is a broad conversation if we are actually going to be serious about it.",

Donald Trump expected to arrive here as soon as tonight after saying he considered delaying his trip, but no longer will. Right now, we are hearing that no major changes are being made to the convention schedule, but you can imagine, speakers are tweaking their speeches and the conversation is going to be completely different than it would have been 48 hours ago. But before this gets underway here tomorrow, we are going to hear again from President Biden in a rare Oval Office address that is scheduled to happen at 8:00 PM Eastern tonight, as he attempts to calm the nation following that attempted assassination of his political opponent. The shocking moment has led many lawmakers to unite in calling for an investigation into what is underway. CNN's Danny Freeman is in Pennsylvania and Danny, obviously, what lawmakers in Washington want is an investigation into what happened. They want to hear from the Secret Service. The House Speaker Mike Johnson is promising congressional investigations, all of that is to come, but of course right now, there is very much still this FBI investigation underway. They still haven't determined a motive yet for this shooter. And now CNN has now spoken with the gunman's former employer for the first time. What are you learning? What was the job?

This is the 20-year-old suspected shooter and we learned that he is a or I should say, was an employee at the Bethel Parks Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. Its only about a five-minute drive from where we are in Bethel Park, right by where Crooks lived. Now, I should say the center confirmed that he was an employee. Specifically, he was a dietary aid at this particular center. The organization said that they were shocked and saddened to hear this news, but also noted in their statement that Crooks performed his job without concern. I just want to make sure I get this quote correct, and that his background check was clean. They went on to say that they are fully cooperating with law enforcement officials at this time. And of course, our thoughts and prayers go out to former President Trump and the victims impacted by this terrible tragedy. But again, we are just getting more of a picture of this suspected shooter, this would-be assassin who took shots at former President Trump yesterday afternoon. That is in addition to some of the things we already knew that he was a registered Republican, that he may have donated to a Democratic-aligned group a couple of years ago, and that he had an AR-style rifle that was actually traced back to his father, which is how initially according to law enforcement sources, law enforcement officials were able to identify Thomas Crooks in the wake of this particular shooting. But of course, Kaitlan, as you noted, as the president noted, just earlier this afternoon, the big question that we still do not have an answer to is, what was the motive? We understand a little bit more about what he -- what his job was. We understand a little bit more about his -- how he was in high school, a classmate who knew him said that he was a bit of an outcast. He was not really in the in-group and because of that, he may have had a target on his back. He may have been bullied, but still we don't have that all-important question, what made him get into a vehicle, go-to Butler, go to this former President Trump campaign event and opened fire. Clearly, it seems at least from the FBI's perspective, trying to assassinate the former president -- Kaitlan.",

He is stable at the moment. And the second victim was 74-year-old, James Copenhaver from Moon Township, Pennsylvania, and he is also stable. Basically, both of these men are from other suburbs of the Pittsburgh area, both from not too far from where we are right now and not too far in terms of the grand scheme of Pennsylvania from the actual event in Butler. The other thing that I will note though, 57-year-old, David Dutch. The Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania identified Dutch as a commandant in their organization's location in Westmoreland County. So a servicemember was one of the ones who was injured and we learned from the Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania that Mr. Dutch underwent two who surgeries after being shot, both in the liver and the chest. So again, truly miraculous that both of these men were able to survive after getting hit. And then of course, Kaitlan, you mentioned it initially, Corey Comperatore, 50-years-old. He was the man who you described as a husband, a father, a girl dad as Governor Josh Shapiro noted, he is the one who was a rallygoer at this event. He was the one who died though from the gunshot wounds. But his wife told Governor Josh Shapiro who relayed this in a press conference early today, his wife said that he was hero because he dove on top of members of his family as the shooting started to ring out to protect them from this oncoming gunfire. So now we know the identities of the three rally goers who were struck by gunfire in this shooting. Again, 57-year-old, David Dutch, 74-year- old James Copenhaver, they both were able to survive this shooting, an incredible story and incredible that after they were critical last night, they're stable now -- Kaitlan.",

That is one of the things we learned at a briefing that just happened a short while ago with the FBI.We heard from FBI Director Chris Wray and from Attorney General Merrick Garland, both of them described this attack, this attempted assassination of the former president as an attack on democracy itself and the biggest update of this investigation is simply that right now, at this hour, they are trying to get access to the shooter's phone. The phone has been brought to the FBI lab in Quantico, and that is where some of the experts, the FBI experts are going to break into it and they believe they will be able to get access to get a better picture of exactly what he was doing in the last few days, in the last few hours before this event. We know according to Kevin Rojek, the head of the investigation, he is the special agent in charge in the field office in Pittsburgh, he says that what they have been able to find out right now is that the shooter acted alone, but as far as ideology, they have not been able to figure that out from any of his activities online. Now, one of the things that they are still also doing is they are examining the suspicious device, the explosive device that was found in his car. There is also some explosive material that was also found at the home. Those are things that have been taken again to the lab in Quantico for further processing so they can try to figure that out. As far as whether there was any indication, any indication that he might do something like this, they said that they had found no evidence that he had had any interaction with police. The FBI had no prior knowledge of him, so no threats or anything like that. No indication of a mental health situation that could, again, explain some activity before this happens. So the FBI is still doing a lot of the legwork, the hard work that really will take for them to figure out what may have happened here, especially because obviously there is no shooter to interview as a result of this. They also noted, Kaitlan, real quick that his family has been cooperative as part of this investigation. This is something that is now clearly going to take days, perhaps weeks for them to put together a clearer picture of this shooter -- Kaitlan.",

That's what they stated in the call, but they are going to look through the phone. It is going to be the main thing -- that is how we contact everything, that's where we live our lives, right? Contacting everybody -- family members, friends -- through our phones. So the phone is going to be crucial to do that.But so far, it looks like he acted alone. There is no obvious outward signs that he was involved with anyone else and that the investigation is ongoing into that. I am sure they have been family members and friends, co-workers all of those things, some of this is just going to take a lot of interviewing once they get into the phone, that will also be a treasure trove of that kind of data to kind of make those connections.",

I would think that they are going to go to the ends of the Earth to find out how this happened and was anybody else even peripherally involved in helping him or unknowingly assisting him in this endeavor.And so, it is very important that this its very thorough, the Bureau will do a very thorough job on this because it is very important to know if there was anybody else even tangentially involved in this activity going forward because we are now in the height and now we are entering the final stretch of the political race that ends in November and so, nothing but concern is going to be put forward.",

There is a massive amount of cell phone video that needs to be he collected. There are thousands and thousands of interviews that need to be done.And as we knew last night, as soon as this happened, the FBI began to mobilize evidence response teams from across the country. So the family is critical, but all of the other pieces to this are as important because of all the interviews, digital evidence collection, both on the cellphone, but as well as his computer and any other insights the family can provide that leads investigators down a road.",
