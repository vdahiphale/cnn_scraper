The Republican supermajority of the House of Representatives decided to kick out to Democratic representatives because of what they call disorderly conduct. They were actually expelled. There are no longer representatives.And this alleged disorderly conduct happened just one week ago, there wasn't any long investigation. Or anything like that. These three state representatives walked into the well of the House of Representatives, up in front of the chamber without permission and started talking without permission, and actually had a megaphone with them after recess was called start talking on the phone about gun reform. They wanted to see gun reform after the horrifying school shootings last month here in Nashville. Well, we couldn't find the decision was made for two of them to be expelled. They needed a two thirds vote. One of the people, the only woman of the three, by the name of Gloria Johnson, she survived by one vote, it was perceived Republicans tell me that she wasn't the leader of this effort. But Justin Jones, Justin Pearson were expelled. There are no longer representatives. There were hundreds of people here, outside the capitol and inside the capitol, in the hallways and in the chambers, all of them yelling, screaming and mourning, very sad, thinking that democracy has died, one of the people told me, because of this decision. In the state of Tennessee, since 1866, only three people have been expelled, and they've been either for crimes or something very immoral. This was a violation of the rules of the protesters, who were here were very upset. When it all came to an end, there were state troopers from Tennessee separating the protesters from the legislators who are leaving the chambers. These two men who have been expelled can run again if they want to. They haven't decided if they want to do that -- Omar. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now -- and by May 2021. Now in the Thursday briefing at the White House, they declined to really get into what mistakes President Biden believes were made in that withdrawal. Instead of -- instead, they really framed it largely as a successful mission, but they said that they were two takeaways, that they acknowledge that in the future, they would do differently because of this review. Now, that includes evacuating Americans much sooner than what we saw in Afghanistan but also includes just really telling Americans on the ground about how the security situation is deteriorating in real time, much sooner than what we saw them do in Afghanistan -- Omar.",

Ahead, expelled Tennessee State Representative Justin Jones will join CNN THIS MORNING. His message to the nation we will tell you when that happens later this morning. Now, over here on this show, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan is issuing a subpoena to a former top prosecutor for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Jordan's is demanding testimony from Mark Pomerantz over his role investigating Donald Trump and the Trump organization. Pomerantz resigned from the D.A.'s office in 2022, one day after Bragg told him that he wasn't prepared to move forward with criminal charges at that point. Pomerantz said at the time that Trump was, quote, guilty of numerous felony violations. Now, Pomerantz has declined to comment, but Bragg, responded. The House GOP continues to attempt to undermine an active investigation and ongoing New York criminal case with an unprecedented campaign of harassment and intimidation. So joining me now is Bob Bianchi, he former head prosecutor in Morris County, New Jersey, and host on the Law and Crime Network. Bob, good to see you.

But the problem is, as you note that he goes, and he writes a book,which was really my opinion, not the thing to do to talk about internal deliberations that were going on amongst the prosecutors. That does muck up, if you will, this particular situation. But nevertheless, Alvin Bragg is the person who was his boss. It was an investigation that was occurring in Bragg's office. And I believe Bragg has the ability to be able to say, you're -- even though he wrote that book. You don't have a right to bring him in. The issue is, he did the book, fine. And that's not a good thing in my mind, but nevertheless, you don't have a right to be able to subpoena him, bring him in and talk about the internal deliberations that were going on with respect to the case. The bottom line is it's just affecting the ability to have a fair and impartial jury decide the case.",

It is -- was twice raided by Israeli police on Wednesday.And there's very dramatic images you showed. Those were extremely inflammatory, as you can imagine, to the Muslim world, particularly as it is the holy month of Ramadan. Condemnation poured in quickly after that footage was released, and so did the rockets coming from two different locations, Southern Lebanon and Gaza. When it comes to southern Lebanon, a barrage of over 30 rockets, the largest seen since the war in 2006. Prime Minister Netanyahu, of course, vowed to respond, vowed to retaliate, and that's exactly what we've seen happen in the overnight hours. Israeli Defense Forces saying they struck sites, weapons sites inside Gaza. As you mentioned, though, the Palestinian health ministry is saying that the hospital was damaged and the people inside, patients inside were worried. But all eyes now go back to that flashpoint complex. Friday prayers are about to start at Al Aqsa mosque. Do they go ahead without incident? So far, we understand from my witness on the ground, all seems normal, all seems calm. That could deescalate tensions -- Omar.",

The report describes Thomas accepting lavish trips across the U.S. and around the world as well as on Crow's private jet and 162-foot yacht.But those reported trips never appeared on Thomas's financial disclosures, and that's important because under federal law, Supreme Court justices are required to file annual financial disclosures, including gifts, unless they fall under certain exemptions, which Thomas's trips did not. Democrats are now calling for more scrutiny of the conservative justice and demanding tougher ethics rules for the high court. So to talk about all this, let's bring in Stephen Griffin, professor at Tulane Law School. Good to see you. So there is no Supreme Court code of ethics, which means seeing that for the first time, it's almost hard to believe.

The cases are a little different, but Fortas this did accept money under questionable circumstances. And there -- you talked about real action from Congress. You know, the Nixon administration put heavy pressure on Fortas to resign, and it looks like Chief Justice Warren at the time agreed.
