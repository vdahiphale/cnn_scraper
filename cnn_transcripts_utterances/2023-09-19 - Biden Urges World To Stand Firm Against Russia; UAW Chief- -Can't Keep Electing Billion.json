The Republican Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee is here with me. Plus, what a central witness, in the Trump classified documents case, has now reportedly told federal investigators? Something that the ex- President apparently urged her not to tell them. And if Rudy Giuliani did not have enough legal problems that were already facing him, they just got a lot worse. He is now being sued, by his own attorney. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. In a rare visit, to the United States, Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is issuing a blunt warning, about Russia, saying that \"Evil cannot be trusted.\" He was speaking, today, to world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, here, in New York, in-person. But it's not clear if all of the world leaders, who were in the room, or even some Republicans, in Washington, got that message. This is what Zelenskyy told Wolf Blitzer, about what is on the line, in this fight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And \"The New York Times\" is reporting, tonight, that Trump wanted her to say that she didn't know anything, about the boxes, containing classified documents that were found, at his Florida resort, and taken with him, when he left office. When he learned that federal officials wanted to speak with her, he told her, according to \"The New York Times,\" quote, \"You don't know anything about the boxes.\" That of course would be the boxes that per this federal indictment were openly stored in a Mar-a-Lago ballroom, in a bathroom, among other places, at the former President's property. Michael also reportedly told investigators that Trump would use documents, with classified markings, to jot down to-do list, for her. For a perspective, on what this evidence means, to investigators, I am joined now by former federal prosecutor, Elliot Williams; and former Deputy Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe.

But I think the thing here that is different? I was listening to Doug, and I agree with some of what he was saying. But there's a really key difference here, between 2016 and now, which is that, Donald Trump is effectively an incumbent. Donald Trump now has a record, four years, of factories closing, under his watch, of jobs going overseas, of him saying things like, \"Your job should go overseas, and then you can negotiate better deals here. And let's see how you like that.\" So, he has a record that he has to defend. And I think the contrast there with President Biden, who has created 800,000 manufacturing jobs, since he took office, and has helped lead a manufacturing boom, in this country, that economic contrast is intense. And that's where the Biden campaign is going to try to drive the comparison here.",

Donald Trump is presenting a different vision to that where a lot of the party has gone. Think about the issue of trade as well. And here's where it gets slightly complicated, Kaitlan, is when you were talking to Mike McCaul, one of my favorite members of Congress, earlier, talking about the shutdown? The longer if a shutdown happens, the longer it goes on, the more unpredictable it is, on how there's a resolution, and what the fallout may be. The longer this strike goes on? The same thing.",

They, when the United States asked them to release him, they immediately asked for concessions, to make an exchange, to get something, in exchange for Paul. And the United States refused to negotiate, with them, which is what a lot of people are saying, \"Well, if you negotiate with them, then there's no reason why they should take Americans hostage.\" So, the United States did not negotiate. They refused to negotiate, to bring Paul Whelan, home. And after that, the Russians took me hostage. At that point, the U.S. government also refused to negotiate, to get me home. And after that, they gave Brittney Griner, a hugely disproportionate sentence, which was completely political. So, if you just look at that, one example, I think you can see anyone, that is reasonable, can see that you, refusing to negotiate, with these governments does not guarantee that they're not going to take other hostages. And any of those governments that are already taking Americans, hostage, they don't need an incentive, to take Americans hostage. They're going to continue to do that. Their incentive for taking Americans hostage is that they're Americans. And they can show that to their own citizens that they've done that. They've spited the U.S. They've embarrassed us. And the United States can't do anything about that. That's enough for them. They don't need material concessions, a hostage, money. If they can get those things, they will try to do that.
