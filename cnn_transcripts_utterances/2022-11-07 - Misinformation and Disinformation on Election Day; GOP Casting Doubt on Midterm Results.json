On Election Day 2020 we saw this video circulate all online of -- that supposedly showed ballots for Trump being burned. Even the then president's son, Eric Trump, shared it. It was totally false. It was disinformation created to deceive. But just a couple of days later, we were in Pennsylvania and we spoke to a voter who believed the election was stolen. And one of the first reasons she said why was that video. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
