It happened at the same hearing where Combs pleaded not guilty to sorted out allegations of running a criminal enterprise that forced women into sex parties. Today, Combs will go before a different judge to appeal that ruling denying him bail. And his lawyers have a new proposal that they hope gets him out of jail while the case plays out. Let's go to CNN's Kara Scannell. She's outside the federal courthouse in New York. Kara, tell us more about what could happen at this hearing.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' attorneys are going to offer this new proposal that they put together following yesterday's hearing. They're asking the judge to release \"Diddy\" on a $50 million bond.But here are the things that they've added that are needed. They're saying that they would restrict any female access to his residence, except for the mother of his children or family members. That they would also restrict any visitors to visit him at his homes in Florida and Miami unless they are friends who are not co- conspirators in this case or family members. And they're proposing he be contained in home detention with a GPS monitoring and have weekly drug testing. And also maintain a visitor's logs that would the supplied to the Pretrial Services Unit so they could check every day to see who was coming to see him. Now prosecutors are likely to object to this. They strenuously urged the magistrate court judge yesterday to keep Combs behind bars while he is awaiting trial. Their arguments are that he is a flight risk, that they have a copious amount of evidence, some of it embarrassing to him, including dozens of video recordings of these drug-fueled sex parties that prosecutors say are at the heart of this sex trafficking case. They also say that they have talked to 50 witnesses and victims who are prepared to provide testimony. So they're saying that this evidence is overwhelming. Combs was a willing -- a good risk to flee the country and not face these charges. They also say that he's a danger to some of these witnesses, pointing to the cache of weapons that they found in the closet of his bedroom and also his outreach to some witnesses in this case after they were subpoenaed by the grand jury. So prosecutor has been argument against this. Ultimately, it will be up to the judge today to decide whether he is going to grant a bail to Sean Combs. This judges the judge that is overseeing the trial. So now it is in the hands of the person who will take this case forward. Unlike yesterday's magistrate judge. But that judge yesterday said that there were no conditions that she felt comfortable with in letting him out free on bail, saying that the crimes that he's accused of committing are crimes that are committed behind closed doors. And there's really no amount of monitoring that would make her feel that that would not continue -- Brianna?",

And there's growing concern that if former President Trump loses again, he could pressure state officials to un-do or delay certification of their results.That was the case in 2020 in the key states of Georgia and Arizona. But now nearly 20 former governors from both parties have come together urging their successors to certify the results and to reject any request to delay the process. We're joined by two of them, George Allen, the former governor of Virginia, and Scott McCallum, the former governor of Wisconsin. Thank you so much to both of you for joining us. You are, of course, both Republicans, both from states that lie on the very interesting end of the battleground spectrum. And it was Republican governors, as I mentioned, in key states, who've got that pressure from Trump in 2020. Governor McCallum, what are you worried could happen this time? SCOTT MCCALLUM, (R), FORMER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR: Not necessarily a worry. It's the measure that we have been supporting. And sent a letter to present governors is a change in the process for the electors. And we want to make sure everybody is fully aware that the process has been streamlined. So there are issues, they ought to be dealt with rapidly.",

I do like his tax policies, his energy policies, no mandates that we have to drive E.V. cars and so forth. There's other things that I don't agree with them on. So the point is elections are about choices. And there's rare, rare times that you can find something you agree with on everything. The point of all of this, Brianna, though, is to respect the -- the owners of the government, the people, the voters' wishes. And when I was governor, Bob Dole won Virginia, but Bill Clinton won. But I'm met with our alleged -- our delegation, electors in our state capital, as every state capital have their electors. And the governor needs to do his or her duty responsibly in reflecting the will of the people in our republic.",

And they expect the leadership to work this out. And having trust in system. So it is incumbent upon us to create that transparency, to share how the system does work, and to build the faith in it. And at the same time, there are ways to resolve issues. And I know what we're working on in Wisconsin is to make sure that if there is an issue, we can address it right away, and find out what are conspiracy theories and what is really happening.

What it points back to is that -- is that the ship had been dealing with excessive vibrations for a long-time. Vibrations on the ship that had caused electrical issues, mechanical issues. And those are the same troubles, according to Department of Justice, that ended up causing that power outage on that March morning that led to that catastrophic series of failures. Backup systems didn't work. Even the anchor wouldn't drop quickly when the pilot called for it. I want to play a clip. This is justice -- or excuse me, an official from the Justice Department explaining what went wrong on a call a little bit earlier today. (BEGIN AUDIO FEED)",

Yes, that's it right there. As well as that hook that had been welded together, jammed between the transformer and a steel beam. So essentially, saying they didn't want to deal with the problem. They just put these Band-Aid solutions on. We're still waiting to find out if they're going to be potentially criminal charges. We know that eight of those crew members are still in Baltimore as these investigations have been playing out. This again, a civil claim. At least $100 million. And look, it's just the beginning for these companies who are facing similar claims from the state, the city of Baltimore, as well as the families of those six construction workers who died.",
