That would typically involve entering a guilty or a not guilty plea, as well as any other conditions set by the judge. We don't know if Lester himself is going to appear in court. We are still, as a network, trying to confirm these details. We did also hear from the Kansas City mayor about an hour ago who expressed some concern that Lester is out on bail, someone that the mayor described as someone who he sees as a threat to the public. He said, we don't know what house he's in right now and what else could happen. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS (D), KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI: It is shameful, in some ways, that he gets to live this very normal life, but I understand it's part of this system that we have which needs real tweaks. And I think that this has everything to do with race, the defendant's fear of black people, black men, black boys, and I think that's why we are all discussing this now for some reason, right, because it is something that is tragic. And I think that if - if the young man wasn't black, we wouldn't be here today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We don't know the -- any updates on his condition this morning, but the family attorney did speak yesterday saying, look, this child, the 16-year-old, was undergoing surgery on Thursday.

The speaker can only afford to lose four Republican votes, as we know, to get it done because Democrats aren't going to be helping them out. And there are more than a few Republicans already expressing skepticism and frustration over his proposal as it stands today.This debt ceiling fight is McCarthy's first real legislative test in his new speakership, win or lose, and it's a deal -- if a deal between Congress and the White House is not reached in two months, the nation will default on the government's $31 trillion debt. CNN's Lauren Fox is following this on Capitol Hill for us. She joins us now. Lauren, Speaker McCarthy is projecting confidence. Does he - does -- does he have good reason to do so, though?",

Republicans are still getting a sense of what is going to be included. In fact, some Republicans still fighting for provisions to be included in this legislation.But at the end of the day, a lot of Republicans and close allies of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are arguing. this is about Republicans showing that they can govern. In fact, Kevin Hern, the leader of the Republican Study Committee, said yesterday, it's a about leadership. Still, some Republicans say that they need more details. Scott Perry, who is a republican and the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, he's been involved in a lot of these early discussions. He says, quote, I don't know what's in the package. So, a lot of work for leadership to do. Yes, Kevin McCarthy is projecting that he could have the votes as early as next week when a lot of leaders are hoping this bill can come to the floor, but it's a huge gamble because the whole game here is to try to get the White House and Senate Democrats to negotiate. If Kevin McCarthy cannot show he has unity behind him, that gets a lot harder to do, Kate.",

Can't rule out a tornado. But the real threat today is hail. So, looking at the current radar, not too active right now, with the exception of some snow and light rain to the north. But we do believe by this afternoon we get the sunshine helping destabilize the atmosphere. We get what is called a triple point. That's where the cold front, warm front, and included (ph) front meet. And that is the focal point that we will look for, for the potential of these strong (INAUDIBLE) storms to form later today.

      "sentences": "People from all over the world are gathering today to remember the heroes of the largest uprising of Jews during World War II. On this day 80 years ago, the Warsaw ghetto uprising began when hundreds of young Jews took up arms against the Nazis in Poland. The Germans set up the Warsaw ghetto in 1940. It was the largest ghetto in German occupied Europe. The 1.3 square mile area was bound by a 10 foot wall with barbed wire, trapping and sealing off some 400,000 Jews.By 1942, the Nazis began mass deportations from the Warsaw ghetto, moving tens of thousands of Jewish people to their deaths at concentration camps. By that summer, it was clear, those deportations meant almost certain death, and the resistance then began on April 19, 1943, on the eve of Passover. Seven hundred young Jewish fighters battled Nazi German forces for almost a month, resisting longer than some countries could. The uprising ended on May 16th, when the Nazis leveled the ghetto. And at least 7,000 Jews died fighting or in hiding in the ghetto. Some 42,000 survivors were sent to forced labor and death camps and where, of course, most were murdered. Today, the world pays tribute to these -- this heroic effort. The presidents of Germany, Poland and Israel, three nations forever linked by this history, they joined together in Poland today, vowing to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive. And in the United States, President Biden is vying to -- vowing to continue the fight against anti- Semitism, saying, quote, evil will not win, hate will not prevail, and the violence of anti-Semitism will not be the story of our time. Together we will ensure that never again is a promise we keep. We're joined now by two of our CNN colleagues, themselves children and grandchildren of survivors, CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash, in Warsaw, Poland. That's such a powerful image having you both there. Wolf, what is it -- what are you seeing there today?",

It's hard to imagine that they can ignore the president of Germany taking responsibility, talking about the shame that the German people have for the murder of six million Jews and many, many more.

And 450 thousands of these -- 450,000 of these, rather, were given out around Warsaw today. And you see people in the streets wearing these. Why 450,000? Because at its peak, where we're standing right now, we are standing in what was the Warsaw ghetto. And at its peak, there were about 450,000 Jews crammed in to the walls and the barbed wire you described earlier, given very little food, very little help. They had almost no way to make money. Never mind sort of deal with the basics in life. And so the daffodil towards the end was a signal - a symbol of hope. And so that's why people wore daffodils. And people also move it down and wear it like this. And you know what that looks like. You remember the Nazis made Jews wear a Star of David.
