The economy ranked as the number one issue among those who participated in last night's GOP primary.

A recent ABC News/IPSOS poll shows that 56 percent of Americans disapprove of President Biden's handling of the economy. It's why the Biden campaign has been paying such close attention to any indicators that may hint at a change in the mood in the months to come. Joining us now is Catherine Rampell, CNN economics and political commentator, \"Washington Post\" opinion columnist.

The head of the FAA just told me that quality control is where his investigation is now focused. Remember, the FAA grounded the Max 9 in the U.S. as it figures out exactly how airlines should inspect their planes for problems.FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told me in this one-on-one interview that the Max 9 door plug is a good design, but only when it is properly executed. That's the big caveat. The bolts that hold the door plug in place are key. There are four of them. And if they're not installed, the door can shimmy out of its retaining grooves and shoot off with explosive force, like we saw back on January 5th on Alaska 1282. Here is the sound bite from the FAA administrator saying quality control is now that agency's focus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
