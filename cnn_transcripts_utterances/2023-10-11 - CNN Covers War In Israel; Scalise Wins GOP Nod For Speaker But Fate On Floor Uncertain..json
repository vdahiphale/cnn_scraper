They say that there will be more details to follow. So, as soon as we get those, we will bring them to you. What we can say is that in airstrikes that happened earlier in the morning on Thursday in Israel, that there were 51 people killed in the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. So, the death toll inside the Gaza Strip from Israel's retaliatory airstrikes rising now to 1,200, which coincidentally, I guess, is around about the same number of people inside of Israel who were killed in that attack launched by Hamas in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The use of social media to post some of these just horrific videos, even if not authenticated, it doesn't matter, it is showing up in people's feeds. So that's the first. That's the second form of terrorism.The second is people seeking a political agenda by creating fake news or manipulating intelligence that's out there. And that's why journalists and others who absorb the news have to be super careful about what we are claiming. So, in particular, there is lots of reports about Iran's direct involvement with this attack. That's a huge thing to claim and it could -- it could make countries move in ways that we don't necessarily want them to move right now. And so, I noticed that the Biden administration was very, very fast in pushing back against that narrative because if this unverified news reports about specific knowledge as compared to Iran's historic support of Hamas became a political lightning rod based on not accurate information, you could get countries reacting in ways in which -- that are not based on information. We've been there before, not based on appropriate information. So those are two ways in which there's a sort of worrisome fog of war. The fog of war is becoming foggier because there's -- you know, Twitter, for example, is just completely unreliable now. Other platforms haven't sort of gotten to the maturity that Twitter was at.

She told Jim Tapper this earlier on whether she would support Scalia as first speaker and it wasn't about whether he had given her any attention. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): I would not. I plan on voting for Jim Jordan on the floor. I've been very vocal about this over the last couple of days. I personally cannot in good conscience vote for someone who attended a white supremacist conference and compared himself to David Duke. I would be doing an enormous disservice to the voters that I represent in South Carolina. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
