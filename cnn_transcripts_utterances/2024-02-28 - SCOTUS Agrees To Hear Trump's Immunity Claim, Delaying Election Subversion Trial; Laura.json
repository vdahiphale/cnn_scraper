You could be going to bed with one. That's if the Supreme Court hands Donald Trump a get out of jail free card. After all, what is a king? Someone who answers to no one, can do what he wants, and well, who's going to check him, boo? In a democracy, the answer is supposed to be the other two branches of government, right? You know, the co-equal branches, the whole checks and balances thing. It's all coming back to us now, right? I mean, it's easy to forget these days when the Supreme Court just announced it's going to take up the question of whether a president has absolute immunity. And no, they're not treating that as some kind of rhetorical question. They're actually going to hear arguments, arguments as to whether a president is untouchable. Now, we don't know how they're going to rule, but the arguments that were raised by Trump's lawyers in the Court of Appeals were, well, one, the only way you can criminally prosecute a former president for criminal conduct while in office was if that president had first been impeached and convicted. And two, if you tried impeachment first, you can't pursue criminal action because somehow, without any basis in the law, you would violate double jeopardy. You remember the hypotheticals we heard about? Trump's lawyers saying that a president could possibly order SEAL Team Six to assassinate his political rival? Really? But, oh, it is on, on the docket for an oral argument at the end of April. Now, the Supreme Court's term, you know it ends in June. Now, that's their actual deadline for when they have to give you an answer. But guess what? I bet you want an answer sooner, don't you? Wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be helpful? No, wait, wouldn't that be super, as in Super Tuesday, when millions of you are going to be casting your primary votes? Well, Super Tuesday is in, what, six days? You're not getting an answer by then. Let's be honest, you might not get an answer before Trump is expected to clinch that nomination. Now, I should look into getting one of those maybe white barrister wigs that the Brits wear in court, just in case the Supreme Court got Hamilton's King George III song stuck in its head.

Maybe there was going to be some horse trading there and it didn't work out.Second thing is maybe a justice was dragging their feet, trying to delay things to run out the clock to help Trump. Most likely is that the Supreme Court just goes on its own schedule and lets the chips fall where they may. And so, if they decide, you know, it's -- this is what we want to hear at the end of April, we'll issue an opinion likely at the end of June, and if there's not enough time for Trump to be put on trial for election interference before the election, so be it.

You know, the classified documents case has been slowed down.So, to the extent that people want to get some judgment about Trump's performance as president, something from the court, something where a jury is going to weigh in that hush money case is really about his pre-presidential conduct, it's really not as serious as some of these other charges.

WRIGHT, FORMER LAW CLERK FOR JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Absolutely. I'm reminded of the moment in the argument in Dobbs where the court overruled Roe v. Wade, where Justice Sotomayor says, how will this institution survive the stench? And there has been so much stench coming from the court since that decision and, frankly, before it. And I imagine that tonight, Chief Justice Roberts finds himself in a position that I don't envy, where I think part of what may be happening is he had two options, right? The court could have affirmed the decision below. There were probably votes for that to just say no absolute immunity, period, or grant a stay, delay, delay, delay, consider it in the normal course. And so, this may be somewhat of a middle position, a compromise, that gets us still some delay that might interrupt the election but not the permanent delay that perhaps some folks wanted.

I have to get your reaction initially to this announcement from SCOTUS. He thinks it's a win. Many believe it, in fact, is for him just having the delay. Do you think Trump is nervous at all, though, about why he wanted this kicked down the road? MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: Yeah, he's nervous about everything, and he has the right to feel so. I mean, think about -- I mean, here in New York, that's just one of the many legal issues that's currently confronting the former president. I mean, I think we can't ignore the fact that our attorney general, our unsinkable attorney general, Tish James here, just achieved a fantastic result in repatriating more than a half a billion dollars back to the great state of New York. And more importantly, for thanking me for being a catalyst of bringing this case to the courtroom. So, he has a lot of reasons to be nervous right now, and that's just one of them. Let's not forget, March 25th, we're starting now the Manhattan District attorney case, which is not civil, but criminal. So, yeah, he may delay one, but the other ones are still moving forward.",
