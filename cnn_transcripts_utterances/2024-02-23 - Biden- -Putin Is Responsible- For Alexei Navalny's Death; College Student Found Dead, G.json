If that person isn't an SOB, I'm not really sure who is. So, I imagine most Americans probably agree with President Biden on that.But you know, you also see it in his policy. I mean, you see that he has been tough. He has -- he has stood up to Russia. He has stood up to Putin. He has worked to bring all of our allies together to stand strong over the course of his two years since the invasion of Ukraine. And I think that the contrast to that that draws with Donald Trump who is out there saying you know, if I were president, I would let Russia do whatever the hell they want, well, you know, that's going to have incredibly real security implications, that is going to have an impact on you know, stability in the west and around the world. You know, those are not -- that's not just a glib-off-the-cuff thing for Donald Trump to say. That is an incredibly frightening thing to say. And so, I think the difference in the contrast that you see between Trump and Biden on this issue is incredibly important.

The day 19 children and two teachers were killed.CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is back with me. Shimon, a grand jury on this after the DOJ investigation at this point means what? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: So, to see if there are any criminal charges that can be brought against the officers for their failures. It's a really difficult burden on the part of a prosecutor to try to bring charges against any of the officers. Specifically, what they're looking at is some of the commanders that day, that the bosses that day, like the police chief -- the school police chief, the Uvalde school -- the Uvalde police chief, and then any other commanders that day on scene where we know they were the ones essentially that have been held responsible for the failures by the DOJ report, by other law enforcement officials and that they took no action that day to force the officers to go in and kill the gunman. So, now, we have a grand jury process that's underway. It's been underway for about a month now. People have already testified. And now, the grand jury wants to hear from additional officers.

So, they're going to start hearing from more witnesses. You know, the other key thing is I've spoken to some of the family members to see if any of them have gone in to testify. So far, none of them have, or if any of the victims, the kids that were inside the classroom waiting for the police to come in if they've gone in. None of them have gone in yet to testify.

The New York Attorney General's Office accused the organization's top executives including former CEO Wayne LaPierre of spending millions of dollars of NRA money on private flights, vacations, and other perks. Defendants' attorneys say their clients are the victims, you've heard this one before, of a witch hunt. And a historic performance in the NBA. Last night, Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic became just the third player ever to record a triple- double against every NBA team opposing him in his career. I know you know what that's like, John. That's what a player tallies double figures in three statistical categories. The two-time MVP led the Nuggets to a win over the Wizards, finishing with 21 points, 19 rebounds, and 15 assists.
