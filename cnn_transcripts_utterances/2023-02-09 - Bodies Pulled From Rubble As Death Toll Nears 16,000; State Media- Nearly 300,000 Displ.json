This is CNN NEWSROOM WITH ROSEMARY CHURCH.CHURCH (on camera): It is 10:00 a.m. across Turkey and Syria, where the death toll from the worst earthquake in the century has climbed nearly 16,000. CHURCH (voice over): In northern Syria, there are huge mountains of rubble, where residential buildings once stood, Damascus says close to 300,000 people have been forced from their homes, and that's only in the path of Syria under government control. Turkey has restored Twitter service in the quake zone after it was restricted for most of the day, Wednesday. Rescue workers and aid groups have been relying on the social media platform to coordinate their efforts. The government detained nearly two dozen people for tweets criticizing its response to the disaster. With each day passing, rescue workers are pulling fewer survivors, and more victims from the debris. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh begins our coverage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice over): It is hard to imagine how this rubble give anyone hope. Yet, for 50 or so hours after the quake, it almost did. And when it stopped, when the chances of surviving egged, the body so near the epicenter here kept coming. The paralysis of grief when these two parents see their 8-year-old daughter's red hair blood stained. Another 4-year-old girl with no parents here to bury her. Another father, simply walking behind. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): My son. WALSH (on camera): It's been constant intense activity desperately trying to save lives, but we are sadly now into the window where so many of the ambulances that arrived will likely be taking away people who have perished. WALSH (voice over): Up high, hope is strongest -- digging furiously by hand here. on the other side of the rubble, medics rushed forward growing fury at how nothing here came sooner.

We are trying as Doctors Without Borders to work with our partners, and supported medical facilities to be able to deliver supplies, to do to provide trainings, and to increase the capacity of these hospitals. To provide some other operational materials. Also, to help them to do their job. One of the main problems is the lack of access to this area. The main access in this area is called Bab al-Hawa, and this humanitarian corridor is organized and regulated through Security Council mechanism that is making it a bit not easy to deliver support. We call ourselves Doctor Without Borders. And we act in this in this sense, but unfortunately, there are many borders, and we are trying to overcome them. CHURCH: Yes, I totally understand that. And, of course, as you mentioned, the problem is getting access. Aid is arriving. But Bashar al-Assad, the leader of Syria, has asked that, that aid be sent to Damascus. There's a lot of politics involved here, as you say, you know, there has been war in the region. So, people are dealing with so much, and then on top of it, they have to deal with this.

You know, like, I mean, the last 12 years, every year, we were hoping that this will be the last one. We are in February, and in March -- next month will be the 12th year, you know, and actually this this is making it even harder and more complicated.

But, what's interesting to see those comments from the U.S. president in an interview with PBS News Hour, when he said that the U.S. shooting down the Chinese balloon did not make us China relations worse. He's obviously trying to downplay this situation. But when you talk to China watchers and analysts, they disagree. In fact, I want to show you this bit of analysis from Jude Blanchette of CSIS, who tells CNN, this, \"The relationship, I think, is just heading to a very, very dark place if the two sides don't find some way to put a floor underneath.\" Now, analysts point out that U.S.-China ties are under strain, and that there is very little window of opportunity ahead to put a floor in the relationship, to be able to reset this relationship. They point out that the Nationals People Congress, this is the annual legislative meeting that China hosts. That's going to be taking place shortly in early March. China will be preoccupied with that. And they also point out the reported planned visit of the U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to Taiwan, which will surely provoked the ire of China, and getting the way of any sort of reset and ties. Now, China continues to insist that this balloon was a civilian craft that blew, off course. The United States saying it was a spy craft, and part of a broader Chinese military surveillance program that spans continents. With the Pentagon, adding, it has 100 percent certainty, it was not just a weather balloon. Back to you.",
