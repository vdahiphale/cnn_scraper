My house used to be exactly at the center of Lahaina Town where we have the Banyan tree that is exactly in front of the harbor, the Lahaina Harbor. I used to leave like one minute away walking. So basically everything started at 5 a.m. when the energy turned off and it was wind all day and the wind was just increasing and increasing and increasing. Basically around 3 p.m. I was at the Lahaina Harbor, checking the wind, talking with a couple of captains that were checking on the boats, because I work for a company, Caraman Company. We saw from the harbor there was black smoke by the highway, pretty close to Lahaina town. So I went back to my house, two minutes away from the harbor. The wind was blowing nonstop. I have -- like a small warehouse at the back that flew over the neighbor's house. The wind was still super strong. The smoke was getting darker and black. It was pretty strong heading northeast. So it wasn't like towards my house. I was with three other people, two roommates and a friend. Neighbors were outside, we were checking and we studied hearing explosions. One gas station that is around like five minutes walk from my house, started to get on fire so we could see the explosions of the gas station. A lot of people walking around, a lot of people completely stressed, cars started to draw by, people asking if we were doing fine and neighbors started to talk together since we got one of the neighbors telling us, hey guys grab your stuff and leave. By that moment the fire was like two minutes away from my house walking so I was able to grab my passport. My important, I don't know, like documents, two shorts, two t-shirts, and around three, no, sorry, 4:45, I was leaving my house with the three other people. We drove by, the highway was already super busy, but the flames were, we could see it from the corner of my house, like just behind the cinema work. From there on, we drove to La Unia Poco Park, where a lot of people, local people that live close to me or everything, we were parking there because that's like a special place for everyone. And we were all in shock. All the trees were blew now. Everything, like we could see the roots and were all big, really big trees. We stayed there. People were evacuating there. It was kind of a meeting point, trying to decide where to go, like Cajului, Kihei, trying to see how we're doing. We, from that La Unia Poco park, we went to a house up La Unia Poco, like up the hill that we can see the fire burning.",

It's just about a two-hour drive from the Polish border.We've seen attacks in the Western regions before, but they are less common. And also because it's being described as massive. You can see the regional head there standing in front of this huge blaze. He says that an oil depot has been destroyed. There are, as of now, no casualties, but a massive operation underway to put it out. The Air Force in an update saying that 10 attack drones were launched from the Northeast, of which they managed to thwart by various means. Seven of them, but still seems to be a serious amount of damage there and this comes Rosemary after Moscow has reported 13 drones in total they managed to avert their accusing Ukraine of firing two of them towards Moscow to those two were shot down another two shot down near the Crimean Black Sea port city of Sevastopol and they say nine more were averted using electronic warfare and crashed into the Black Sea. Now Ukraine isn't saying anything about this latest round of drone attacks. There were also two launched towards Moscow, according to the mayor there on Tuesday night into Wednesday. But these are happening with increasing regularity. We did hear just over a week ago President Zelenskyy promise that the war is returning to Russian soil. It does smack of a strategy while not causing massive damage or any injuries really to sort of crack the facade for the Russian people to bring home the idea that this is not in fact a special military operation but a full-scale war.

Of course, the democratically-elected president or else, but the or else was kind of unclear. And that's why they're meeting today, Thursday, to determine the next steps.Of course, they have said, the ECOWAS leaders have said that they prioritize finding a diplomatic solution, but they have not ruled out the possibility of a military intervention. However, I must emphasize that that's highly unlikely. There seems very little consensus within the bloc itself to carry out a military intervention. You have several nations like Mali and Burkina Faso that have had their own coups in recent years and have already expressed that they would side with the military junta in Niger if a military intervention took place, even within Nigeria's political class. Very little willingness there for a military intervention. The fear and concern is that that could further destabilize the region, further destabilize Nigeria, which of course shares a border with Niger. And diplomatic solutions, attempts for talks and outreach, have so far fallen on deaf ears. There's been multiple attempts this week. The Deputy Secretary of State of the United States, Victoria Nuland, carried out a visit where she said she had frank discussions with the coup leaders, but that was very little traction. There was also an attempt at a tripartite meeting earlier this week, the African Union, ECOWAS, all meeting, and the United Nations rather, all trying to carry out a meeting with the military leaders. That was turned down as well. So really hope fading here for a diplomatic solution. And if you put the military intervention to one side, what other options could really be discussed today at the ECOWAS meeting? That's going to be the question. Do they extend the deadline? Well, that hasn't really worked. What can they do to push a coup leadership that has so far been able to really solidify its power in recent weeks by holding on to that capital, by shutting down airspace, and by sending out a rather effective message, Rosemary, to a youth population that feels disenfranchised and marginalized?",
