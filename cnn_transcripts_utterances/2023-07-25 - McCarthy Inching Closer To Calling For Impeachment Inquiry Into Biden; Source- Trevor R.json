In fact, I've been doing some reporting on this with my colleagues Manu Raju and Andy Greer and we learned that in recent weeks, McCarthy has been hearing from senior House Republicans and influential conservative lawyer advising him that he should prioritize an impeachment of Joe Biden over one of the members of his cabinet.And part of the thinking here is that if they're going to expend resources on something as complicated and time-consuming as impeachment, that they might as well go after their top target except for someone else in the Biden administration. Not to mention, some of the other investigations that Republicans have been leading have really lost momentum. Border crossings for example, have been down in recent weeks. And meanwhile, by contrast, Republicans feel like their investigations into the Biden family are starting to pick up. But all that to say is they are still all over the map when it comes to an impeachment strategy. There are still some Republicans on right to call to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas or Attorney General Merrick Garland and then moderate Republicans who are weary about impeachment. So if they do down this route, it is still a heavy lift. There is not a lot of time to do it and there is a sentiment among Republicans that if they're going down this path, that they need to wrap it up before the end of the year, Bianna.",

And indeed, Kevin McCarthy been under pressure to appease both Donald Trump and his right flank. Another issue that is giving Kevin McCarthy heartburn is this symbolic resolution that would expunge Trump's past two impeachments. McCarthy, as we previously reported, told Trump in a private phone call that he supports the idea and would bring it up with the rest of the conference but he has yet to put that on the floor and there don't appear to be any plans to do so. And that is causing frustration among Trump, I'm told that Trump called Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of this top allies in Capitol Hill recently to complain about the lack of action from McCarthy.

And from that point on, the next two months or so, we heard public testimony from people like Ambassador William Taylor, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman, all of whom have now become familiar to us. At the end of that two-month process, the House formally voted on an actual impeachment. That takes a majority of the House in order to impeach. If we get to that point, and, of course, it goes over to the Senate where you need a two-thirds vote in order to convict.

To say that it should rise to the level of impeachment at this juncture, I would believe would be premature and I would remind Republicans that we did watch as Democrats canceled the price is right to have live with Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff and all it did was lead to President Trump going up in the polls because at the end of the day, if you're not going to be able to show conclusively to the American people that, in fact, the president did commit high crimes and misdemeanors, to level that accusation in many ways could be an act of political mal practice and suicide when it comes to trying to elect Republicans across the slate in 2024.",

The tax problems of a vice president now president's son has very little to do with the American public. The only reason that those issues are pertinent to the American public is because of why he was perhaps given the money that he then refused to pay taxes on.

And what are some of the first questions you have as a physician? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, thankfully, it's not common. But I think it's maybe more common than people realize as well. If you look sort of across the country, in any given year, maybe around 6,000 people may have a cardiac arrest that are young people. A lot of times it's a sports-related in some way, 39 percent sports-related. As people get older, 19 to 25, sports still a factor, but less so of a factor. So it does happen. And as Natasha mentioned, it happened at USC last year. It's happened in lots of other athletes over the years. Some of the questions that you want to sort of figure out was, was he having any symptoms prior to this? It sounds like he wasn't. Sometimes this sort of thing is the first time somebody knows that there is a problem at all. Has he undergone any screening tests in the past to look at his heart? That's certainly what doctors are doing now looking to try and figure out what exactly caused this, Bianna. A couple of things. Is there some sort of electrical abnormality to the heart, the way that the heart actually conducts electricity through the heart? Is there any evidence of heart inflammation? Is there a problem with the structure of the heart? There is something known as cardiomyopathy, Bianna, which basically means that some of muscles of certain chambers of the heart may be abnormal in some way and that could lead to something like this. They don't always figure out what exactly caused this but more times than not, they will, and that is likely the questions they're trying to answer right now.",

They don't have a pulse obviously.A heart attack is typically related to the blood vessels that lead to the heart that could become blocked. The heart is not getting enough oxygenated blood as a result, the muscle tissue starts to die and that could lead to cardiac arrest. So, cardiac arrest, you know, for people under the age of 35, there could be a hold of things that I mentioned, electrical problems, anatomical problems. Once you're over the age of 35, if someone has a heart attack that leads to cardiac arrest, it's typically related to those blood vessels that become blocked or occluded for some reason.",

Local officials say more than 8,000 firefighters are working to contain the spread of the fires. But across the border in Tanzania, smoke filled the sky as both emergency teams and residents do whatever they can to stop the blaze from scorching more land.Parts of North Africa and the Mediterranean have already exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit over the last week, temperatures which according to experts would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change. In a new report, the World Weather Attribution Initiative says extreme heat events are expected to worsen and in both severity and frequency unless the world rapidly stops burning fossil fuels. One lead researcher even warning that this year's sweltering temperatures could be considered cool in the future. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on camera): Look, Bianna, here in Rome, the temperatures have now cool and you could see people behind me enjoying the milder weather this evening. But in other parts of Italy, particularly across the south, across Sicily, those fires continue to plays and that is a reflection of what we're seeing across the Mediterranean. And the stark warning we are hearing from experts is that this is only going to get worse unless something is done rapidly to change the situation -- Bianna.",

That's according to a new report led by a group of international scientists. They say this heat hell is here to stay. And it is only going to get hotter. Meteorologist Chad Myers is with me now for more on this. So, Chad, can we expect this sweltering heat to just become less and less of an anomaly going forward.",

These won't be broken again.When we see these temperatures again, they won't be breaking because a breaking record would be higher than this. So, yes, we are going up from here in many spots and so is the east coast. The east coast definitely going up. All that weather that's been bottled up across the desert southwest, that that is now expanding toward Chicago, in Des Moines and Kansas City, St. Louis, and eventually toward New York City. So, here's what's happening. This is the normal part. What we expect before really we started burning all of this fossil fuel. But now, all of the sudden, that's shifted. So, 95 is not out of the ordinary. It is three times more likely and I think I saw 87 percent of the United States over next five days will be 90 degrees or higher, every single reporting station for all of the people in that area. And in Phoenix, again, right now, it's 115 already and that was 25 days. Now let's make that 26 -- Bianna.",

Nearly seven decades ago, he was kidnapped and beaten to death by a group of white supremacists in Mississippi because he allegedly whistled at a white woman. Emmett was just 14 years old. Well, joining us no are some members of the Till family who were at today's White House event, Reverend Wheeler Parker Jr., and Dr. Marvel Parker. Thank you so much for joining us. What a special day this was for the country and I know for you personally. Reverend Parker, today would have been your cousin and as you call him your best friend's 82nd birthday. What does it mean for you to be marking this day at the White House with the president established a new national monument honoring Emmett? REV. WHEELER PARKER JR., COUSIN OF EMMETT TILL: Today, I have mixed emotions. We appreciate and celebrate this occasion to name a monument after Till, Emmett and his mother, but at the same time, I'm very conscience and sensitive of how we got to where we are and the price that he paid to have this done. So I have mixed emotions and I just wish his mother was here to share this experience with us and question as she decided to take courage and let the world see what I see, was I hope you didn't die in vain. [16:50:08] Today, she would have said, you didn't die in vain.",

She made sure that the world did by insisting that his casket remain open.Talk about the significance of honoring her legacy today and the powerful woman that she was fighting for justice for her son until the very end. DR. MARVEL PARKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE EMMETT TILL AND MAMIE TILL- MOBLEY INSTITUTE: Well, I think the significance is we're honoring a heroic woman who in the face of tragedy, the loss of her only child, decided that she wanted to take an unpleasant and a hurtful incident and challenge America by showing the face of her martyred son, the brutality that he experienced. She challenged America to face the racism and hatred that resulted in her son's death. And as a result of that, America took another look at America. And the death of Emmett Till was said to have been the capitalist that sparked the civil rights movement. She would never have thought that, but her intention was to let the world see what America looks like behind the Iron Curtain.",

You were the last person to have seen your cousin before his kidnapping, and she never asked you what happened that day, clearly not wanting to put you through that trauma, having you relive that once again.You talk about the time lapse from then to today. And at today's event, President Biden brought up the issue of some states that have started now restricting how race or racism is taught in schools. You lived through the Jim Crow South and the civil rights movement. How concerning is this for you? W. PARKER: Very concerning, and almost unbelievable, but we're constantly reminded as a preacher and as a bible scholar, lest we forget. If we tend to forget, we're going to repeat the same thing happened before. So I think America is going to stand up. It's people like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that have reminded us, and we need others who are in Congress and other leaders throughout society to remind people we can't afford the luxury of forgetting our past. Our past is what made us strong. And our past is what will keep us strong. So I conquer with them, lest we forget.",

PARKER: Well, the story of Emmett Till, of course, is not a pleasant story, but it reminds America once again of the hatred and the racism that was prevalent in America in 1955. And many of the young people today have no idea what it was like to be Black, African American, living in Mississippi. So the story of Emmett Till allows them to learn the climate of America and maybe it is my intention that they can appreciate where we are. We've come a long way. Certainly, we have a long way to go. But I think we need to appreciate, our young people need to appreciate where we've come from. And in the generations to come, this story, I hope, will challenge the future of young leaders to pursue justice and equality for everybody.",
