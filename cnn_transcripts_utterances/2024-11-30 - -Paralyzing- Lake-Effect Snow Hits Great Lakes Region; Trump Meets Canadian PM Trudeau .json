Lake-effect snow is more than three feet in parts of the Great Lakes region, with the worst still to come. Pennsylvania's Governor Josh Shapiro, issuing a disaster declaration for Erie County and mobilizing the Pennsylvania National Guard after heavy snowfall shut down several highways in that area. Nearly 2 million people, now under lake-effect snow warnings through Monday. Let's go now to CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar with the latest on this treacherous snowfall and bone-chilling temperatures we are seeing all across the U.S., Allison.",

      "sentences": "Heavy bands of lake-effect snow have been going off and on throughout the day today, and are expected to continue as we go through the day Sunday, not just across portions of Michigan, but also Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.And it's specifically portions of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where we're likely to see some of the heaviest snow bands come through in the next 24 to 36 hours. But we also have a separate system that's bringing some snowfall. This is going to stretch right there along Interstate-70 that runs through Saint Louis and continues eastward into southern Indiana, portions of Kentucky as well as West Virginia. Now, snowfall totals there are not expected to be quite as much. Most of these areas looking at about 2 to 5 inches total. Whereas farther to the north, now we're going to be measuring it in feet. In total we're looking at possibly 4 to 6 feet of snow across portions of the northeast, right there along the Great Lakes. Now that's the total. That does not (INAUDIBLE) will count everything that started on Friday all the way through today and continuing into the day on Sunday. Again, some pretty substantial amounts here. It's been causing traffic problems up and down Interstate-90 stretching from Buffalo back through Cleveland and portions of Interstate-81 near Watertown as well. And that could continue through the evening hours tonight and as well into Sunday, especially as those bands get thicker and heavier as they continue through the day. Another concern is going to be the Buffalo Bills game that takes place on Sunday night. Not only do they have all the snow that's already fallen and will continue to fall, but then the snow that's going to fall during the game itself. It could be coming down quite heavy at times. Those temperatures kind of hovering right at or below the freezing mark for much of the game. But they're not the only place that's going to be cold. In fact, 70 percent of the U.S. population is looking at temperatures at or below freezing at some point over the next several days. And it goes pretty far south, too. This isn't just a problem for northern cities. Atlanta, Dallas -- all looking at those temperatures well below where they normally would be this time of year and they're going to stay there for quite some time. Look at New York City. Every single one of the next seven days is expected to be below 49 degrees, which is where they normally would be this time of year.",

Of course, he is the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Ivanka, father of Jared Kushner. He was pardoned by Trump in 2020 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Alayna, what more have you learned about this selection? Well, it's really interesting, Jessica, and I know you know this as well. When a president has these different appointments they can make for ambassadors, the ambassador -- the U.S. ambassador to France, is kind of thought of as a cushy -- no pun intended -- role for certain people, for donors. They often give out some of these to big donors, to strong allies. And so its notable that he is now doing this, giving this role to Charles Kushner, someone who is within the family. And also to just talk about, you know, Charles Kushner's past. We know that, as you mentioned, Donald Trump had pardoned him for crimes he had committed in the early 2000. Trump pardoned him in 2020. But what's notable about that, as well is Chris Christie, was actually the prosecutor who brought those charges against Charles Kushner. Then he was the U.S. attorney in that case. Thats also something that Christie has since argued. He had kind of gave responsibility for, for losing some of his standing early on in the first administration due to that -- his involvement. And so some interesting dynamics there. But, yes Charles Kushner, his son-in-law's father, now being given this really big post, but also one that is viewed by many people as one of the spots that they would like in an administration, Jessica.

About 75 percent of Canadian exports come to the United States ofAmerica. A large percentage of that is my personal maple syrup consumption. But nevertheless, he is taking this seriously and he has the benefit of having worked with Donald Trump before. He knows how this game is played, and he knows that Donald Trump is unpredictable and that he also has a power of his voice and the power of his sharpie. And come January 20th, 2025, he could very well sign tariffs into law and make them realistic. And that would harm not just the Canadian economy, but certainly the Mexican economy as well.

You know, people's bottom lines that they cannot afford to have. And it's going to make housing prices -- we get a ton of lumber from Canada -- it's going to make housing prices increase even more in an already unaffordable market.

So I don't actually think that the American people are going to stomach this. And I think with the -- in Congress being so close its going to be hard for Trump to get anything passed anyways and when you're a lame duck president, you only have two years before you go into the midterms and he's going to set his party up for what could be -- we could even Democrats could gain more houses or more seats in the House, excuse me. And set them up really well for '28. So these are some decisions, political decisions that he's going to have to make. Because I just don't think that Americans are going to stomach losing any more money, whether it be inflation that Pete is saying is the Biden-Harris administrations fault or Donald Trump's tariffs. D5; Yes. And, Pete, we also know this week that President-Elect Trump, he's talked with Mexico's president. He claimed that Mexico's president agreed to close the border during a phone call with him earlier this week. She denied that very quickly, saying that would never be something that she would consider doing. What do you make of that particular relationship? Because of course, the southern border played a huge role. Immigration in this election is a very high priority for a lot of American voters. What do you make of that particular relationship? And also the idea that Trump believes that he can stem the flow of fentanyl and migrants into America with these -- with these tariffs. SEAT: The Mexican president took office on October 1st. So let's just say this is a blossoming relationship. They don't necessarily know each other. They haven't had very many phone calls. I believe there have been two thus far. The Mexican government though for months -- for months has been talking as if they have secured and sealed the border. They may not use that phrase, but they believe what they've been doing in rounding up migrants, potential illegal immigrants into the United States, on busses and trains and these various highway checkpoints that they've set up, they think that is enough and that they are getting the job done. But I think the Mexican president realizes that one of the root causes of migration is their struggling economy. And if they're going to get more jobs and have more opportunity for Mexican citizens they cannot have these tariffs slapped on them, which is why I think she will probably go to Florida if not get on the phone. Donald Trump's probably on her speed dial by now. Get on the phone again really quick after she sees that Trudeau was there.",

There's going to be negotiation just like there is with the Canadians and the Mexicans on some of the policy priorities moving forward. With these slim majorities in both the House and the Senate, it's likely I think one cabinet nominee is probably going to bite the dust.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, OK, let's start first with what these tech companies -- these tech companies are saying that the process to pass this bill was rushed.We've seen Meta launch Instagram Teen accounts earlier this year. We've seen them try to do some things to mitigate the mental health concerns that people have for these younger children. But how is the tech industry reacting? And could they potentially adapt to some -- to this to this law?",

      "sentences": "Yes, they're trying to come out and say we'll be compliant, but it's also kind of unrealistic.In terms of the rush, Jessica, the Australian government is supposed to put out a report describing how age verification technology could work in this type of an environment. So that's why they say it was rushed. They believe it should be halted, this law, until we get that report out. And trying to determine, if you're a tech company, whether or not somebody is actually under 16 is very hard to do. One of the reasons being, if you were to use something like biometrics, you get into a lot of privacy issues. And it's especially important because children's privacy tends to be more scrutinized around the world than adult privacy. But even so, Jessica, even if this law is aiming to get at kids who are under 16 to prevent them from using social media, everybody who is, you know, subject to these platforms or wants to use them is going to be subject to those same verification tools. So they've got a really big challenge on their hands. And I think that their concern is that this bill, which came together within a week, sort of brushes past some of those huge details, And they don't know how they're going to comply or put something together within a year. That's the deadline that they have.",

      "sentences": "I mean, of course, they're going to try to file for injunctions. That's the natural thing that you would expect here.But, yes, they're going to try to do whatever they can on the back end. I mean, these fines can be somewhat punitive if you're looking at 50 million USD for violations. And that could be per user or per time period. And so they don't want to have to be in a position where they yank their services because they can't adhere to the law. And, Jessica, that is not something that's totally uncommon. When Australia passed a law that required these tech platforms to bargain with news companies, Meta and other services temporarily pulled their -- their news on their platforms because they were worried that if they couldn't comply, they we're going to get fined. So these companies have a real impetus to try to make this law work. The challenge, like I said before, though, is nobody has figured out age verification on the Internet. And you know, in this law, they're trying to put the onus on these tech platforms. Tech platforms have tried to put the onus not just on parents, but also on device manufacturers saying, well, it's easier if you're a laptop company or a phone company to verify the age of a user who's going to use tens of dozens of Web sites and apps than us to do it. And so I think this is going to be a messy battle. And it will set a precedent for global laws around privacy and age verification.",

Of course, interesting for a lot of reasons, but I think one especially interesting reason is because Trump has threatened Zuckerberg with jail in the past. And obviously, as we're seeing with so many people, both in tech companies and politics, they are trying to go down there and talk to him and try and, you know, just try to smooth things over before he gets into office.",

And so Mark Zuckerberg has a very big regulatory impetus for meeting with Donald Trump. And then also you want to make sure that, as a tech company, you're advocating for things that benefit the entire sector. Meta has been very aggressive in pushing sort of not anti-China legislation, but kind of, you know, underhandedly saying, look, if you we're to ban TikTok, that helps with American innovation, right? So they're not outwardly calling for the ban, but they have a lot of skin in the game for things that are, you know, related to the Trump administration outside of big tech, things like China.",

And they don't like to sort of legally get involved in that kind of case because doing so would imply that they have real big ownership of these accounts. And you don't want to dissuade your biggest users from investing everything they have and building up their followings. And so it's a rare thing for someone to come out and do this. I think the reason that Elon Musk is doing this, obviously, personal politics plays into this, you know, Alex Jones, right wing, et cetera. But I also think it's this is him sort of declaring to courts, to the business community, to his users, I own this platform, I own your accounts, and I can do whatever I want with them.",

Now, she was able to avoid detection in two security checkpoints, which were really identity verification stations, which included the boarding pass, the boarding process itself. So actually getting on the plane where they check your boarding pass and your I.D. She was able to somehow skirt that. Now that is, of course, on the airline. That's not something TSA controls. But what TSA does control is a separate identity checkpoint, which she was also able to skirt around. Now she was -- she did go through the TSA screening, that initial screening that everyone goes on before getting on a flight. She did go through that. So she also avoided detection on the aircraft itself, which is a long flight. And she seemed to do this by jumping between laboratories during what one passenger called a full flight. Now, upon arrival, she was detected and Paris authorities arrested her, detained her. And as you mentioned, this flight back to the U.S. to send her back to the U.S., she actually became unruly on that flight and was kind of kicked off. And a new flight has not been scheduled.
