Is he a risk to the community at large? Is he a risk to himself? Is he a flight risk? Some of the things that will be under consideration here. The defense, for its part, could go, Kate, one of two ways perhaps given that this is really going to be an uphill battle here in terms of getting bail. This is what legal experts are telling us, uphill battle. So perhaps the defense will decide not to contest this at all in which case it's going to be a very short hearing. Or what they could do is argue that there can't -- that they're -- that this -- that this defendant is a candidate for bail, given certain conditions such as perhaps no access to a computer, no access to the internet, things of this nature. So once again, once this detention hearing gets underway at 11 o'clock here, much for the judge here to consider. Kate.",

In its lawsuit, which was filed here in New York. Smartmatic said that Fox was in the business of trying to create this story where Smartmatic was the villain. I want to quote from Smartmatic's following. In their story, Smartmatic was a Venezuelan company under the control of corrupt dictators, some socialist countries. In their story Smartmatic's election technology and software were used in many of the states with close outcomes. In their story, Smartmatic was responsible for stealing the 2020 election by switching and altering votes to rig the election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"Defendant's story was a lie, all of it, and they knew it, but it was a story that sold.

Because, again, the public has seen it, but it's not evidence yet in the Smartmatic case.

Rudy Giuliani an advisor to the former president, any number of other individuals, including the Fox Corporation. And perhaps Fox could say, well, we can't control what comes out of Sidney Powell's mouth. She's the individual that ought to pay, not us. And so it's a little more complex. But at the -- but at the end of the day, the underlying question is the same, did Fox -- were they reckless, or knowing in putting false information on air are some of the same issues that were at the heart of the other trial?",

One person was killed in that collapse, five other people were injured.In this video behind me, you can see just like the mangled wreckage of cars and concrete from what happened. Here's some interesting information though that has been revealed. Records from the city now show that the garage has six open violations against the three classified as hazardous violations. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is live near the scene for us. Gloria, first and foremost, what does it look like? There this morning? GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, we have been pushed back from the scene a few times now because we have been trying to get closer to get a look at the work that's happening behind us. But emergency responders have been here all morning trying to start the cleanup process. I just want to show you, beyond these barricades and beyond this fire truck is the location of that parking lot. That yellow sign that you see in the background there is where the building is located. That is a building that is more than 100 years old and had been functioning as a parking garage for over 50 years. Now, the structure collapsed yesterday. You can see from that really shocking video that the cars were just swallowed up by the building as each floor collapsed on top of each other. I do have one important update regarding that one a fatal victim, the fire department has just confirmed to me that, unfortunately, they have not been able to get to that fatal victim to remove the body of this person because the entire structure is completely unstable and it is unsafe for first responders to go in there and retrieve the body. I've been told that the building is going to have to be deconstructed around this victim so that they can safely remove them from inside. So that is the latest update there. And you mentioned the violation says so far we've learned that the building has been cited for concrete that was crack, defective, failure to maintain the building. What we don't know yet is whether any of those violations played any role in this collapse. That is currently under investigation by the Department of Buildings which has been here on the site all morning looking at the structure, trying to stabilize it specifically around the removal of that victim, but also to ensure that the other properties in the area here are safe. Right next to the building is Paced University, which moved all of its classes held at this building here, behind me 161 William Street, to remote learning today because these structures are not safe to go into right now.
