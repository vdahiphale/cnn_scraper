Just hours ago in California, the secretary of state, Shirley Weber, opted to keep Trump on the ballot, despite pressure from the lieutenant governor to remove the former president. Contrast that with Maine where, yesterday, Democratic Secretary of Sate Shenna Bellows disqualified Trump. She wrote in her decision that January 6th was an insurrection, quote, at the behest, and quote, of then-President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHENNA BELLOWS (D), MAINE SECRETARY OF STATE:  It became clear that January 6th was an attack, not only on the Capitol, on government officials, but also an attack on the rule of law that it was insurrection. And the U.S. Constitution does not tolerate an assault on our government, on the foundations of our government. And that Maine election law and the Constitution required, indeed obligated, to act.

Okay? This comes a during the war in Ukraine and a conservative crackdown. CNN's Bianca Nobilo reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Dress code, optional, quite literally. An almost naked themed party hosted by a popular blogger in the leadup to the holidays in Moscow has gone viral in Russia. Blogger Anastasia Ivleeva organized the party in the heart of Moscow's night club district on December 21st. Partygoers showed up half clothed or with barely anything on, with outfits made of mesh, lingerie and other creative materials to strategically cover limited parts of their body. But photos of the almost naked partygoers have sparked outrage across some parts of Russian society. Internal criticism has mounted about how a party of this nature could go ahead as Russians continue fighting on the front lines in Ukraine. Orthodox Church officials, pro-war activists and pro-Kremlin lawmakers have all denounced the scantily clad partygoers. Attendees are now facing legal action. A court verdict against the party said the event was aimed at propagating nontraditional sexual relationships. Rapper Vacio, who showed up wearing a sock covering his intimate areas and not much else, has been found guilty of petty hooliganism by the Russian court. He's been sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined 200,000 rubles or roughly $2,200. Planned New Year's parties organized by celebrities who attended the party have been replaced with other stars. Ivleeva apologized via her Instagram page, posting a 21-minute video, asking for forgiveness and a second chance. Other celebrity partygoers have followed suit. In a previous video, Ivleeva claimed the event was an opportunity to showcase photos created during her tenure as the chief editor of the now-defunct Russian edition of \"Playboy\". Ivleeva also faces legal action and hefty fines. A collective lawsuit filed against her on Tuesday by 22 people and initiated by a Russian actor, seeks compensation of 1 billion rubles -- that's $11 million -- for moral damages. Backlash against the party comes as authorities in the country are pushing an increasingly conservative and homophobic agenda. Just last month, Russia's LGBTQ community movement was deemed an extremist organization by the country's supreme court. Bianca Nobilo, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
