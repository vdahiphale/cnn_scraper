By the end of it, the jury of 12 ordinary American citizens may actually finish their deliberations and decide whether to make Donald Trump a convicted felon.Now, no matter the outcome, both Trump and Biden campaigns will have huge strategic decisions to make on how much if at all, to focus on that verdict in the final months before election day. The Quinnipiac poll last week found that seven in 10 voters are actually following the trial, at least somewhat closely. The big question, whether an unprecedented criminal trial will have any impact at all on who wins in November. My great political panel is here to help answer that question and many more. CNN's Kristen Holmes, Laura Barron-Lopez of the PBS NewsHour, CNN's Camila DeChalus and Jackie Kucinich of The Boston Globe. Guys, welcome. Thanks for coming in. Kristen, I want to start with you, kind of the big picture of how much -- whatever happens this week, maybe leading into next week, depending on where the jury is, will actually matter on the election itself. You're so tied in with the Trump team. When they look ahead, past whatever the verdict is, how do they feel like this trial will impact these months ahead?",

That's the kind of traditional Donald Trump rah, rah, school of thought that no matter what he does. He's Teflon. His base is going to support him, and eventually other people will come out too.But there's also another school of thought, and this is with some of his senior advisors that they really don't know that this is uncharted territory. That there is a very real chance that this could deeply harm Donald Trump, particularly with those voters in this middle segment. Remember, both sides believe that this election is going to come down to a very small group of voters in the middle. If those people are turned off by a verdict -- a guilty verdict in this case, that's obviously going to impact the election.",

Since Donald Trump hush money verdict is set to shape a summer of presidential politics, but whether the verdict changes the game or not. These campaigns are now about to actually enter a real campaign as opposed to whatever the last five weeks have been. And when you think about whether the conviction will matter, there's that new Quinnipiac poll likelihood of voting for Trump if he's convicted, more likely 24 percent, less likely 6 percent. No different, 68 percent -- 6 percent, these are Trump supporters. If 6 percent of Trump supporters to Kristen's point, it matters to them. And he's convicted, he has a huge problem.",

So, you know, I'm sure there's two versions of that speech. Many versions, that speech, honestly, that they're working on.Two just determine, you know, which way to instruct the country. To put out a message, when you are the sitting president United States and your opponent is going through, you know, whatever happens. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, PBS NEWSHOUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Regardless of the outcome in this first trial. You know, the President Biden's campaign to Jackie's point is essentially staffing up already. They said that they're going to be hiring campaign staff, specifically dedicated to these independent Nikki Haley type voters. That is what they are going to be fully dedicated to, to turning them out, to trying to persuade them, regardless of whether or not Trump is convicted. And they're also heavily targeting some Republican big name, potential endorsements. In addition to Jeff Duncan, the former Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, but other Republicans, you know, they didn't get Nikki Haley. There didn't appear to be any outreach to Nikki Haley at all.

He says it's an unfair jury that it's because it's based in Manhattan.But you know, they haven't even really -- you know, we're hearing about Biden, talking about making remarks. They haven't really figured out what they're going to do after this verdict comes down. How are they going to respond? Is he going to give remarks right away? Is he going to set something up at Trump Tower? Are they going to wait a beat? Is he going to leave and go somewhere else? These are all conversations that they're currently having right now.

So, people didn't actually show up to vote, including you who told me that you didn't show up to vote. It was like, yeah, well, we were all really tired.
