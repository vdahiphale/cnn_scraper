Plenty coming up this hour including the U.S. Secretary of Stateto Antony Blinken is expected to speak any moment now at the G20 in New Delhi earlier this morning. The Secretary of State has a short meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of that summit. This, of course, was their first face to face conversation. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began just over a year ago. CNN's National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand has been following the events. Natasha, clearly much for all of the G20 Foreign Ministers to discuss but I think the war in Ukraine has sucked oxygen from the room. The key question, what do we know about what those two men discussed in that? What 10 minutes of conversation that they had?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this was described really as kind of a spur of the moment interaction it wasdescribed by the Russians as happening really from when they were walking from one event to the next. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken did seek out Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, the State Department says and that's because he wanted to have a conversation with him about a number of things. Chief among them, the detention of the American citizen, Paul Whelan in Russia, he has been detained for a number of years now and has not seen any signs that he's going to be released. So that was really the chief just topic of discussion that Blinken wanted to discuss with Lavrov. As well as the New START Treaty, which is that nuclear arms control agreement that Russia said that it would be pulling out of the Secretary of State really wanting to speak with Lavrov? However, briefly about Russia still needing to comply, of course with that treaty and wanting them to be able to stay in communication over that. And of course, the topic of Ukraine was also discussed. But look, I think that the bigger picture here is that Blinken clearly wants to keep the lines of communication open with the Russians. They do not want it to become a situation where the U.S.-Russia, communication channels are closed, no matter how bad the relationship gets. So it was not a pre-planned meeting we're told but Secretary of State Blinken did take advantage of that moment to pull him aside again, for the first time face to face since the war began. And speak to him bluntly about the top issues that the United States feels are really important right now, Julia.",

Of course, these men have had their own interactions with Chinese officials as well, Natasha, any sense of whether that country's potential involvement in a peace solution or beyond, of course, the concerns about the supply of weapons, perhaps from China, to Russia also a very sensitive subject between these two men.

And however, this has been a very, very concerning issue for the U.S.; of course, theyare watching very closely to see whether China is going to provide weapons to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine. China to date, really Chinese companies have only been providing non-lethal equipment. Now, we are learning that the U.S. believes that they're preparing to provide them with lethal equipment. And so I think that as part of the conversations were large between the U.S. and Russia. There are probably going to be conversations about warning the Russians against taking that Chinese equipment, right? And same with the Chinese leadership, you know, Antony Blinken does not necessarily have any plans to speak directly with the Chinese Foreign Minister while he is there. But he also did not leave that possibility off the table. Blinken, of course, has been very bluntly speaking to the Chinese about the risks of the Chinese providing that kind of support to the Russians was threatening essentially that the U.S. is going to take action if they do that, perhaps in the form of sanctions. And so this is going to be a very interesting meeting, really the G20 meeting, when you have all of these kinds of people around the same table with this huge, obviously, conflict looming over them, which is the war in Ukraine.",

Essentially, the FSB, the Russian Federal Intelligence Service was saying that this group of people crossed the border apparently took hostages, six hostages in various places across the border, and even went into an administrative building there as well. Now later, there was a video, Julia that emerged of two alleged fighters in front of what appears to be a Russian administrative building, claiming that they were part of the Russian volunteer corps. Now, that is a group of Russians were fighting in Ukraine on the side of the Ukrainians. We can see that video that was put out there those people were essentially saying that they want to show the Russians that they're active and just want to show that they are over there on the other side and able to operate on the Russian side of the border. Right now, the information that we're getting from the Russians is that apparently things have calmed down there. Apparently teams are still searching around, and that those militants as the Russians put it, is not there anymore needless to say the Russian President Vladimir Putin extremely angry about the situation. He was supposed to go on a trip earlier today to the South of Russia to meet teachers there. He canceled that trip. He did that trip online, and he called the people behind these neo-Nazis as he put it. Let's listen into what Vladimir Putin had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But of course, this is not a rescue effort anymore, this is a recovery effort. They are still retrieving bodies from the wreckage and unfortunately for some of those victims on board, it is a matter of identifying DNA. At this point, the first two carriages of this train were completely engulfed by flames upon that collision, the third carriage completely turned on its side it is not accepted that anyone on board these three carriages managed to survive that collision and narrow. Of course, dozens of people still in hospital who were injured receiving treatment we're outside Larissa General Hospital which is taken in many of those injured in the collision. A lot of them, of course, young people according to Local Hospital officials, and there is still an effort to recover those onboard and that is ongoing as we speak. There are also of course, efforts to sort through the wreckage. I mean, this is a huge disaster zone in - it's clearly a huge challenge for the authorities here. But of course, that investigation into accountability here is also still ongoing. At this stage, one man has been arrested the manager of a nearby station. He has been charged now, with manslaughter with causing death, mass death by negligence as well as grievous bodily harm by negligence. He is reported to have admitted to making mistakes according to state media and will appear before prosecutors soon. But of course, there was also the question of the safety standards and measures here in Greece with country has a far weaker rail standard than its European counterparts. And there has been growing frustration, growing anger towards the government and towards the transport ministry over this latest collision. In fact, just yesterday, the Transport Minister announced his own resignation; he said that this was a mark of respect to those who had lost their lives. But he also said that the standards here the safety measures in place were simply not up to the standard one would expect in the 21st century. We have seen anger building here in Greece; we've seen protests taking place across Athens. As you mentioned, that strike has been announced for 24 hours by railway workers. And there are real questions as to whether the government has really done enough over the last few years to ensure that the safety measures are up to standard here in Greece. And of course, as that investigation continues, we are still learning more at this stage. It is very much focused, according to the authorities on the question of human error the Prime Minister himself describing this as being most likely caused by a tragic human mistake. But of course, those questions will continue to mount over the safety standards within the rail network and whether or not there is more to blame now, Julia.",

But as you noted, as well, shares were up more than 60 percent this year, it's the best stock or was at least up until today, the best stock this year in the S&amp;P 500. So Elon Musk has a lot to be happy about with how Wall Street has rewarded Tesla this year, but I think to keep that momentum going investors wanted more specifics. They didn't get them.",

So this year has been good, the broader contextareas and slightly more painful if you have lofty ambitions. You know, to go back to that point about achieving that long term target of what I believe is an output of 20 million new vehicles annually by 2030. And that's a tenfold increase based on current capacity. The CFO of Tesla talked about a price tag of $175 billion?",

You know, does the company have enough cash on hand and revenue coming in to fund all of this without potentially diluting investors further? Those are all questions that remain to be seen. And of course, the other big wildcard for Tesla now is that every other auto company on the planet has woken up and found religion, if you will, in electric vehicles. So this is no longer a case where Elon Musk and Tesla have this market all to themselves. They are going to have to continue to fit and with the likes of GM and Ford and Toyota and Volkswagen, and it is going to be a much bigger challenge, I think for Tesla going forward and that's why investors want specifics, not just platitudes.",

Today,we also discussed other challenges where people around the globe expect our countries to work together, like addressing the climate crisis, helping communities adapt to the inevitable changes it's causing. Strengthening global health security so that we're better prepared to prevent, detect and respond to future health emergencies. I also had the opportunity to speak on the - meetings with counterparts from Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and of course, India. And let me first commend the Indian Presidency and Foreign Ministers Jaishankar for securing G20 consensus on a broad set of agreements reflected in the chair summary and outcome document. That's the first for G20 Foreign Ministers. Now, Mr. Jaishankar and I speak so frequently, that we just pick up right where we left off, working to elevate our strategic partnership in concrete ways, supporting India's very ambitious G20 agenda, advancing the U.S. India initiative on critical and emerging technology, which President Biden and Prime Minister Modi launched at the G20 Summit in Bali last May, engaging our shared commitment to human rights and democratic values. Tomorrow, Foreign Minister and I will join our counterparts from Japan and Australia for a meeting of the QUAD, where key areas of focus will include protecting the free and unrestricted movement of goods and people across our seas and boosting cooperation against around humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The importance of which has been brought once again into sharp relief by the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Our engagement with the QUAD and the G20 are just a few of the examples of how the United States is weaving together alliances and partnerships to enhance our capacity to deliver for our citizens. That's why I began this trip in Central Asia where I joined my counterparts for the C5 plus one Ministerial. The more of these partnerships that we build, strengthen, and stitch together, the more we're able to effectively tackle transnational challenges that affect our people, broaden opportunities for Americans, bolster our security and advance our interests. And what we're seeing in Delhi and Istana, in Tashkent and beyond, is the country's want to partner with the United States, because they see us showing up to solve shared problems, fostering inclusive economic growth, investing in our own competitiveness. And standing up for the international rules of the road that benefit all countries, including the right of every country to choose its own path free from violence, coercion, and threats. Lastly, I spoke briefly with Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov on the margins of our G20 meeting today. I urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision and return to implementing the new start Treaty, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation. Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries. It's also what people around the world expect from us as nuclear powers. I told the Foreign Minister that no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship the United States will always be ready to engage and act on Strategic Arms Control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did even at the height of the Cold War. I also raised the wrongful detention of Paul Whelan as I have on many previous occasions. The United States is before to serious proposal. Moscow should accept it. We're determined to bring Paul and every other American citizen who's unjustly detained around the world home. We won't rest until we do. Finally, I told the Foreign Minister, what I and so many others said last week at the United Nations and what so many G20 Foreign Ministers said today end this war of aggression, engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace. President Zelenskyy has put forward a 10 point plan for adjusting durable peace. The United States stand ready to support Ukraine through diplomacy to end the war on this basis. President Putin, however, has demonstrated zero interest in engaging. Saying there's nothing to even talk about, unless and until Ukraine accepts and I \"The New territorial realities, while doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine\". Independent of what Russia does we showed here in Delhi, what we will do. Deliver results on the problems most affecting our people's lives. Our hosts are committed to doing this over the course of their G20 presidency, for that, and for their leadership and hospitality I'd like to close by expressing my gratitude to India and with that, happy to take some questions.",

There's been rising concerns in recent years about democratic backsliding and human rightsissues in India, including the rights of religious minorities, and recently with a move against the news organization, the BBC, did you raise U.S. concerns about these issues with your Indian counterpart today? And are you concerned at all that the situation might worsen heading into next year's Federal election in India? And secondly, Reuters has reported that the U.S. is speaking with allies about potential sanctions for China if it sends lethal aid to Russia, for use in Ukraine as you've warned about in the past. Can you comment at all on those discussions and more broadly, about your conversations with counterparts today, relating to China's relationship with Moscow?",

We're committed to an enduring project; both of us, in ourcases, our founders put it striving to form a more perfect union. That's part of our national ethos. It's a project for both of us, India and the United States in different but also complementary ways. So we have to work together to show that our democracies can actually deliver on our people's needs. And we have to continue to hold ourselves to our core values, including respect for universal human rights, like freedom of religion and belief, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, which makes our democracy stronger. So we regularly engage with our Indian counterparts to encourage the Indian government to uphold its own commitments to protect human rights just as we look to ourselves to do the same thing. And in most conversations that I have with my counterpart Foreign Minister Jaishankar, this is an issue that we discussed, again, as we did today. With regard to China and its support for Russia's aggression in Ukraine, as we've said, from the start, and as President Biden made very clear to President Xi, going back to the very beginning of the Russian aggression, were China to engage in material lethal support for Russia's aggression, or were to engage in the systematic evasion of sanctions to help Russia that would be a serious problem for our countries. When I saw Senior Foreign Policy Official Wong Yi on the margins of the Munich meetings just a week or so ago, I raised with him our very real concern that based on information we have China's considering supplying lethal military assistance to Russia. We've not seen to do that yet. But we've seen it considering that proposition. And what I shared with him, again, was that this would be a serious problem for us in our relationship with China. And I made clear that there would be consequences for engaging in those actions. So I'm not going to detail what they would be. But of course, we have sanctions authorities of various kinds that would certainly be one of the things that we and others would look at. And I say others because this concern that China is considering providing lethal military assistance to Russia. This is a shared concern. And many other partners have raised this and not just raise this with us, but it's my understanding have raised it directly with China, including here today in Delhi.",

And that's been the focus of the United States. We want to make sure that, even as we and dozens of countries around the world are standing up for the basic principles at the heart of the UN Charter that are being trampled on by Russia and its aggression against Ukraine. We're at the same time also working every single day to address the concerns of people around the world, on the issues that are really affecting their lives, whether it is food insecurity, whether it's climate change. Whether it's creating economic opportunity, building global health, resilience, et cetera, all of those things we've advanced on yet again here at the G20.

And I think that the real the message, the big takeaway here was that the war in Ukraine was the overarching theme of the G20. Even though the U.S. wants to focus on other issues, just encouraging the Russians, of course, to pull out.",
