The airport where a variety of flights were diverted is back in operation.These were four drones that didn't cause any damage, didn't cause any harm to civilians. But keep in mind, back in May, when there was a similar incident that, of course, the Russians blamed on the Ukrainians in which the Russians even alleged that there was an attempt to assassinate President Putin, there was a lot of criticism to Russian defense authorities that they had allowed these drones to get so close to power in Russia. And given that President Putin is already a little off balance at the moment as a result of the Wagner mutiny, he's probably ever more concerned about his personal security after this incident and, of course, the mutiny itself -- Brianna?",

And as the Wagner mercenaries got within about 150 miles of Moscow, there was some resistance by some parts of the Russian security services. But by and large, we did not see a lot of -- an outpouring of opposition to Wagner. In fact, when he decided to call off the mutiny and he left the headquarters of the southern military district in Rostov-on-Don, we saw this video of a cheering crowd, people taking selfies with him.
