Heading south in search of a solution, senior officials from the US and Mexico hold crisis talks over border security. But is it really a crisis? And at the annual get-together of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, leader Kim Jong-un orders accelerated war preparations in the face of some unspecified threat from the US.On day 83 of Israel's war with Hamas, the risk of a second front opening on Israel's northern border seems to have increased significantly. With a senior member of Israel's war cabinet warning Hezbollah militants that continued missile and rocket fire across the border will trigger an accelerated Israeli military offensive, an escalation which the US and its allies have tried to prevent since the war began. Cross-border attacks in the north have escalated since the October 7 attack by Hamas, with Wednesday seeing some of the highest number of rockets fired by Hezbollah so far. The same day which the Israeli foreign minister visited the northern border. Hezbollah says it fired 30 Katyusha rockets in response to earlier IDF airstrikes on a Lebanese village. So with more now on that warning to Hezbollah, here's a member of the Israeli war cabinet, Benny Gantz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI MINISTER (through translator):  The situation on Israel's northern border demands change. The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But Israel held off on doing that and instead has said consistently, we're dealing with Hamas. We hope that there is a diplomatic resolution for the clashes that have been taking place daily along the border with Lebanon.However, there is patience running out here in Israel. There are daily rocket attacks. There are daily anti-tank missile attacks. There's 100,000 people, John, from the border area, Israelis who have been displaced from their homes, and they will not go back as long as Hezbollah is there and attacking Israel. So, Israel is trying to urge, I would read Benny Gantz's comments, is Israel saying to the world, the clock is ticking. You don't want us to have a war with Hezbollah and Lebanon. You have to get more active and you have to push Hezbollah away from the border.",

And as long as we do this, everybody can kind of feel like they're involved somehow, right? So, Hezbollah wants to show solidarity to Hamas, that it's involved, and it's helping to defend Hamas, and it's our need as Israel is waging a battle against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. However, it's not sustainable. And we also can all keep in mind that any miscalculation can easily lead to a larger conflagration.I think that the bigger question here, John, is after Israel was surprised on October 7th by Hamas, and is now trying to eliminate that threat and degrade Hamas's capabilities to the greatest possible extent, can it, or is it willing, better yet, to live with another enemy of this sort, stronger, more soldiers, more weapons, more rockets on its northern front? It would mean that it would end the war with Hamas, but still have a sword up against its neck in the north. And I'm not advocating another war here, necessarily. But what I'm saying is we have this other threat that might now seem to be small, but it's quite large. And if this whole conflict right now in the Middle East ends without that being resolved, then Israel will still be stuck with a big problem.",

Blinken and Mayorkas are expected to ask Mexico to move migrants south, control railways that are used by migrants to move north, and provide migrants incentives to stay in Mexico, like visas.

The wait time to cross by car Wednesday afternoon, an astounding 15 hours. Many Americans who frequently drive back and forth are opting to cross on foot, like Minerva Castro.

And for other potential migrants, they just decide to turn and come through unauthorized channels. They turn to smugglers or cartels, or they just attempt to come through unauthorized channels. And so, you know, especially for those people fleeing very dangerous conditions in their home country, they don't have time to wait months, years, decades to enter.

In other words, immigration restrictionists create the problems and then demand ever more restrictions to fix them. So yes, border towns may in fact be overwhelmed, but that's because there's no system in place which can process arrivals in an orderly way, which then leads to harsher laws to try and control immigration, wash, rinse, repeat, and on and on it goes.

The Russian army is constantly taking more favorable positions and expanding control territories in all directions, he said.

And Moscow now admits Kiev's Air Force managed to strike a large Russian landing ship, but only vaguely says the vessel suffered damage. Ukraine, though, claims the ship and its cargo were completely destroyed. Footage on air now is impressive indeed, the Air Force spokesman says.

We're doing our best to help people with what resources we have, and what we're able to bring into the country.Here in Southern Gaza, we have a medical clinical team working at one of the hospitals          in Rafah, but while these teams work around the clock together with their local colleagues, they know that there's never going to be enough doctors and nurses. There's never going to be enough supplies available to us here to meet the growing need. And some of the patients that I met in the hospital just yesterday, they're desperate for more support. I've spoken to mothers and fathers. I've spoken to children. And they're at their wits end. Unlike the amount of medical need here, both from the impact of the fighting and from the fact that people don't have more food, water. You don't have enough adequate shelter. This is just compounding the situation, making it more and more difficult. Not just for humanitarian organizations to respond. And their response cannot meet the needs that they actively have at the moment, but there are people trying to survive. And we're deeply concerned and appeal to all actors of influence: the states, and indeed to the parties in the conflict, that they have a responsibility to make sure that civilians have access to humanitarian need, that they have sufficient access to health care. And right now, that is woefully short of what it should be.",

There were 2.2 million people in Gaza before the conflict started. Those people are not able to work. There isn't enough sufficient supplies in countries. There is not enough food. There isn't enough water. On top of that, there's isn't safe conditions for organizations to deliver aid to where they need it most across Gaza.

Well, the GOP has been a party in this litigation. They are fighting for the ability to list Trump as a candidate on the primary ballot. And one of the immediate impacts of this appeal is that the Colorado decision is now on pause. And until the Supreme Court reveals whether it wants to get involved. They're under enormous pressure to take up this case and to offer some clarity on exactly who the 14th Amendment applies to and the extent of the states have power to remove candidates from the ballots. So unclear if the Supreme Court will take this up or how long it will take them to decide, but because of this appeal, that Colorado decision now on hold. Now, one of the places where this question of whether Trump will be on the ballot is still outstanding is in the state of Maine. Now, what's interesting about Maine is, there, the secretary of state is actually the first one to review ballot eligibility, and then it can go to the courts to be appealed. And Trump and his team calling for the secretary of state to be recused, to recuse herself from this case. They are arguing that things that she said about January 6th should make her ineligible to review this case. She's expected to make her decision on this any day now. She did not respond to our request for comment, though it does appear unlikely that she would recuse herself. Now, the special counsel, Jack Smith, also hard at work just days after the holiday. He has filed a request with the court to limit Trump's ability to argue that he is the victim of political persecution, if and when the January 6th federal case goes to trial. Now, that whole case is on hold right now. Well, larger constitutional questions are appealed. But the special counsel hopes to be able to take that case to trial before the 2024 election. In order to make that happen, he continues to make filings and requests of the court so that once those appeals are resolved, if he prevails, he can move ahead with trial as quickly as possible.
