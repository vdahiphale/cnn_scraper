The remnants appeared to have landed without causing injury at that particular stage. That is an extraordinary statement for the Kremlin to make and it is not backed up with concrete evidence. There is a video circulating on social media that appears to show smoke over the Kremlin. And that is something that you can easily falsify or manipulate. Yet more proof required from Moscow but there is a few things that they can accuse another of, even already at war with it, trying to assassinate their president. Ukraine, very straight, two officials close to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one saying we have no information about this at all, it's a trick. The other saying we have absolutely nothing to do with this at all. We only defend Ukraine and get Russians off Ukrainian soil and reminding people this will possibly be used by Russia as justification for barbaric and indiscriminate attacks on Ukrainian civilians. Where we go from here, there are fears from comments by senior Russian officials and most notably the speaker of the Russian parliament, suggesting that now Russia should reach into their arsenal for weapons to finish off the Kyiv regime. This could be a part of Russia's clumsy nuclear signal but no indication at this point in Russian posture in that regard. Many in Ukraine deeply concerned as to why this event has been admitted to or amplified in the way the Kremlin has done it. What is it leading to? What is it going to be used to justify? Russia is already using all its military might in this war pretty badly and is possibly hours or days away from a Ukrainian counteroffensive, which could potentially damage its mere presence here. So a lot concerns in Ukraine and a very strange statement from Russia, showing both weakness and highly escalatory. Kate.",

Sara, since the beginning of this war, the U.S. has been very afraid of anything that could provoke Russia further, that could lead to a nuclear attack and escalate this war. That's why you've seen over the course of this war this sort of incremental gain in the weaponry that's given to Ukraine from Stingers and Javelins to HIMARS, now to tanks. The U.S. is very afraid that weaponry that is too big would be seen as a provocation. One of the biggest things Ukraine has been asking for is these long term missiles called ATACMS and the U.S. has firmly said to Ukraine that, whatever we give you, you cannot use inside of Russia. We have seen Ukrainian attacks inside of Russia before. The U.S. has said Ukraine has that right because they are the ones being attacked. But the U.S. is not enabling or encouraging those attacks inside Russia. Sara.",

So 300 miles there. The drones that we know that the Ukrainians have used, these Turkish drones, have a maximum range of 186 miles. So it's not even clear if the Ukrainians have the equipment that could do that, if launched from Ukraine. So when you see the purported video of this, how do you assess this? What do you think is going on? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  I'm very skeptical of this because this looks to me like a typical Russian trick. So if you go back to 1999, when Vladimir Putin was the new prime minister and wanting to become the president, he had his intelligence agencies blow up three residential buildings in Moscow and blamed it on Chechen terrorists. He then unleashed a war on Chechnya, which made him a national hero. This looks like a repeat of the same play to me, John. Now there are a lot of technical issues here. Could the drone get there? Why would Ukraine think they could attack a dome on the Kremlin and hit Putin? Really bad intelligence. And then somebody walking up the dome in the middle of the night, the United States should call for an international investigation to pull this out and make the Russians defend themselves. But I think a key message here is this is most likely an effort by Putin to rally domestic support, to distract the news cycle and to pave the way for justification for an escalation of Russian military activity in some way.",

And they're holding their cards very close to their chest right now. And that makes a lot of sense. We don't really have any information about what might happen or when it might happen. And this is in keeping with the best military practices. But I do think that they will have to penetrate the front line of defense and attack it from behind to have the high chance of success that they need. They've built up partisan forces for a long time in the city of Zaporizhzhya and probably Melitopol and other areas. And these forces have not always been disclosed. Some of them probably haven't surfaced. So if you look at what the Allies did, before D-Day, for example, we activated the French Underground in France in 1944 that did a whole lot of damage to the Germans and made our D-Day success, in some ways, possible. So I think the Ukrainians will be very smart and they'll use partisan activity behind the lines to kick things off. We may not get an early warning here in the West.",

They're saying this could make a significant impact on the progression of this disease.So we know that Alzheimer's is characterized by these plaque buildups in the brain called amyloid. And this drug works in particular by removing that plaque. In previous studies, we have a brain scan that shows two patients that got the drug and that significantly reduced their plaques in the brain over time. They're the yellow kind of disappearing on that slide versus the bottom line, the patient that got the placebo and didn't get the drug and the brain plaques are still there in the brain. In this trial they showed that that translated into improving how fast people progress with the disease, losing their cognition and their ability to function. But this drug did not come without side effects. We saw brain swelling and the microhemorrhages or small bleeds. Most of these were mild but there were a few severe cases and even two deaths in the trial associated with these side effects.
