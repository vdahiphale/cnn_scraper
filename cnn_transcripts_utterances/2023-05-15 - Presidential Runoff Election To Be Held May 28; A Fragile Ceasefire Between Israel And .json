Heading for a runoff, that is the big news this hour after that critical vote on Sunday. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Bridget falling just short of the 50 percent threshold he needed to win. With nearly all of the votes counted, he leads his main opponent, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, by almost 5 percent. That is a disappointing showing for the six-party opposition coalition candidate after pre-election polls showed him with the leads over the incumbent. Well, official final results will be announced on Friday with the runoff happening on May the 28th, two weeks from now. Well, a third candidate, ultranationalist Sinan Ogan got about 5 percent of the vote. He has not yet announced who he will endorse in the second round. I'll be talking to him here on the show in the next hour. Well, Jomana Karadsheh is connecting us here in Istanbul. Late night for you, late Night for everyone here in Turkey as they stayed up to see just how this election would go. It's not an outright win for the incumbent president, Erdogan, but he has to feel confident going into this second round, given what he was up against as we went into this crucial presidential election.",

He says this -- the lira is more steady just because it's fashionable to use monetary policy run by central banks to fight inflation. Let's be quite clear, it doesn't mean that that is the only game in town. Does it? Could investors be on the wrong side of this? After all, this is a government, and you will hear from them day in and day out, as we have done here in Turkey, that their policy is all about boosting supply at this point. He has a plan about building continuing to build, what is a manufacturing base, a production base here, he can control supply, he says, and if he does that, he's going to come out of this on the right side of economic growth.",

We've seen that high base effect help them, but it's because he's been defending the currency in the short-term to get to this election. He has very little in terms of reserves left to defend the currency. So after the election, that currency anchor will go, which means another devaluation inflation spiral. It just doesn't add up. An investment, certainly foreign investors will not put money into Turkey with this unorthodox policy stamp. They've taken money out over the last decade because they don't believe it. There's no way any investor will invest in Turkey while you have massively negative real interest rates and the reality that he will he won't raise rates to defend the currency at any point in time.",

Mr. Erdogan didn't reach the required 50 percent threshold required to win outright on Sunday. State-run media reports that he leads with just over 49.4 percent of the vote while Kemal Kilicdaroglu has just under 45 percent. A second vote will be a first for Mr. Erdogan, who has faced criticism from the West, at least by maintaining ties with Russia during its war on Ukraine. Look, there's an awful lot going on here. Let's take a look at how this election is being covered here in Turkey. This is the Daily Sabah, a Turkish pro-government daily newspaper. It covers -- its cover reads \"President Erdogan and his party win again.\" Well, joining me now is that newspaper's Editorial Coordinator, Mehmet Celik. It's good to have you on, sir. Interesting to see what the headline on your newspaper is today. You could absolutely argue that this is a win for President Erdogan.
