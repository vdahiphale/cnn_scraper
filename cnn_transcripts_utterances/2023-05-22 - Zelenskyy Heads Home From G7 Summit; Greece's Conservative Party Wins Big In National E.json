Let me read you some of the statement released by China's Foreign Ministry late last night following Japan's dressing down it reads quote, Japan as the host of the G7 collaborated with relevant countries to smear and attack China in a series of activities and in the joint communique. It went on to say that such activities have grossly interfered in China's Internal Affairs violated the basic principles of international law and the spirit of the for political documents between China and Japan. Now, at the summit, the leaders of the world's richest democracies were very much united in their growing concern over China, you know, stressing the need to obviously cooperate with the world's second largest economy, but also to counter its, quote, malign practices and collusion in that joint communique. The U.S. as we know, it views China as the most serious, long term challenge to the international order. And this was backed up by the British prime minister at the G7, who said that China poses quote, the greatest challenge of our age in regards to global prosperity and security. The leaders of the G7 also pledged new measures targeting Russia, as you mentioned, Laila, to choke off its ability to finance and fuel it's war on Ukraine. And that surprise visit by President Zelenskyy certainly cemented leaders resolve and commitment. We heard from the U.S. President Joe Biden pledging ongoing support to Ukraine saying we have Ukraine's back. As you mentioned, you know, both China and Russia they hit back at the statements. Russia's Foreign Minister slam the Group of Seven for indulging in their own greatness with an agenda that aim to obviously deter Russia and China. China's foreign ministry it accused G7 leaders of hindering international peace, and said the need of the group needed I should say to reflect on its behavior and change course. Laila, it's very clear that after this G7 the world is even more polarized and divided those opportunities to obviously engage in constructive dialogue are becoming less and less likely.",
