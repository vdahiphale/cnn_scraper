This hour I'llspeak to a Former Government Official who worked in the Ministry of Railways about how this happened. First up though, oil prices rising after Saudi Arabia said it would go it alone and cut another one million barrels per day by next month. The announcement made at OPEC Plus in Vienna over the weekend and is Riyadh's biggest cut in years. Moscow claims without proof it has repelled a large scale offensive from Ukrainian forces in the Southern Donetsk area. Kyiv denied and offensive took place but it has been signaling for weeks that its troops are preparing for a major counter offensive. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has named his government's new cabinet and almost every member is new, one of the most highly scrutinized roles of Economy Minister will be held by an internationally respected former banker Welcome back to our second hour of \"Connect the World\" with me Becky Anderson. Time here is just after seven o'clock in the evening, more than 280 people are dead and over thousand are injured in one of the worst train accidents in India's history. The government has launched an official investigation into what happened? The country sadly no stranger to these disasters in 2021 more than 16,000 people were killed in nearly 18,000 railway accidents across the country let those numbers sink in for a moment. This recent incident is raising questions and rightfully so over the safety of the country's massive and outdated rail network. So tonight we ask who is responsible for this crash. Well, normal train traffic has resumed after repair work was completed following Friday's collision. Let's kick this part of the show off with CNN's Ivan Watson, who has the very latest from Eastern India. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Working on the railroad, an army of laborers laying new rail by hand, racing to reopen this transport route after one of the deadliest train disasters India has seen in its modern history. WATSON (on camera): On Friday night, three trains collided in this area and everywhere on the side of the tracks in this rural part of Eastern India. There are massive railroad cars that were as you can see, severely damaged in this collision. This vehicle here this car was reserved for people with disabilities. You can still see people's personal belongings down below right outside. WATSON (voice over): It began with a passenger train moving at 128 kilometers or 80 miles per hour, slamming into a parked freight train colliding after dark in this rural area. Villagers rescued passengers by the light of their cell phones. WATSON (on camera): Did you actually as volunteers pull survivors from the train wagons?",

And that is sending oil prices higher though they are off their earlier highs at this point. Riyadh's voluntary cut goes beyond the deal by the OPEC Plus alliance to limit supply in 2024 to prop up prices. But even with today's gains, crude prices are still a lot lower than they were at the beginning of the year. Well, Alex Schindelar is the President of Energy Intelligence and Energy Information and Insight Company, joins me now from London.

That's what it's been pursuing over the last couple of months and indeed, years. But in this case, it's very much working in the interests of the whole OPEC group, as far as we see it. I mean, that the overall strategy is to try to stabilize oil prices, or at least stop them we've seen is the actual decline in prices over time which you've been referring to. There's been a downward momentum that Saudi Arabia and all of OPEC, wanted to stem. And that really was, I think, what was driving a lot of the action we saw over the last couple of days.",

Such as the concerns about the economic situation, the questions about when Chinese demand will return? The overall questions about the debt ceiling that we saw over the last couple of days before that was resolved so there have been a lot of things that have been sort of on the margins, worries and concerns that haven't really been dealing specifically with the fundamental. So what the argument is with these targeting speculators is saying, look at the fundamentals here, look at the fundamentals of supply and demand, and look at whether or not we have enough oil in the market. That's where he wants the attention to turn back to and sort of filter out the noise that's on the sidelines, which is what people who are trading oil as a financial product, when they're interested in the daily movement oil up and down, not the fundamentals of what's actually driving them oil in the long term.",

This time around we also see cuts of a million barrels a day by Saudi Arabia unilaterally, and then the extension of cuts through 2024, which basically takes a lot of oil off the market for an awfully long time. There hasn't been a lot of pushback on that right now. And it sounds like even though there's always an OPEC meeting, always a lot of geopolitical stuff happening behind the scenes. It was managed pretty well, this time. And a lot of that stuff stays in the sidelines, or at least deep in the background, to actually allow OPEC to come up with not one agreement, but three agreements, that one to extend and cuts through and through 2024. The other to remove a million barrels a day just by Saudi Arabia itself. And the third one, that resets the production levels that companies or countries are going to be producing at starting in 2024. They often start with the one deal through they got three deals through, which suggests that actually, there's a fair amount of willing to compromise in this circumstance to actually get these model deals through and get a stable oil market, which is what they're all targeting.",

I mean, we call it sort of its baby steps, but significant baby steps in the region. If this actually works, then you're going to see a reduction in tensions between the two countries. And in places like OPEC, you'll have easier ways of reaching agreements. So it's shifting the geopolitical balance in the region. And it won't just be an OPEC; it'll be in other ways as well. The question is how is the U.S. going to do all this? And it seems, again, back to your points ahead of the meeting, we had indications that actually. Whatever happened in the meeting, even if a cut was announced, the U.S. was going to be OK with it.

And interestingly, as it happens,accidents have been going way down, developments are down from somewhere in the four hundreds, in about 20 years ago to somewhere in the low 40s now, so the safety record of the railways has actually improved. And there's a reason for that, because investments have gone on, not just in this government, but also in the previous governments. And in this government in the last seven years or so they've invested about $12 billion in safety. There can be issues recently, the Auditor General of India published a report, which questioned the delay and some of the actions that the administrator -- was taken, some sure there is room for improvement. But this is not a system where people die every day. In fact, it used to be the case that in Mumbai, there used to be a very large number of deaths about candidate on the suburban rail network by people getting run over, that has now dropped significantly.

And in terms of actually rolling out the modernization of infrastructure, it's an ongoing process. But investments have been going on. So this year, capital investments would be about $30 billion. That's about four times more than what it was 10 years ago, so but is their capacity to absorb that kind of investment. And that's not entirely clear the member operations of the Railway Board yesterday, when she was speaking, spoke about our train collision avoidance system, and how they have set aside about a billion and a half of that dollars. But they haven't been able to roll it out as quickly as they wanted to, because they didn't have vendors to be able to provide this stuff for them. So the ecosystem may not be fully prepared to absorb this kind of investment. And we do have delays in major projects, for example, our dedicated freight corridors, the East and the West -- corridors are not running a special -- . If they had run and we'd have less congestion, and therefore less chance of these kinds of accidents to happen. So the commercial considerations all the time whenever you're doing safety, because you need to slow down railways, you need to stop railways, in order to carry out the safety works. But that's there in every organization when they have to. It's there when you repair something at home; we prefer to do it over the weekend or during the day by taking a day off from work. So those kinds of considerations are ongoing and management takes day to day view of that. But there is money in the system now and has been there for a while.",

That triggered a manhunt and then an ensuing a firefight between what turned out to be an Egyptian security officer and Israeli soldiers ended in a third Israeli soldier being killed as well as the Egyptian security officer. Now the Israeli military says it appears as though this Egyptian security officer crossed the border fence the barrier between the two using what appeared to have been some sort of emergency exit and entry point. And we do have an image that was reported by the Israeli public broadcaster Kan News, which shows what seems to be a sort of small square opening in the fence. Israeli media reporting that it was held shut just by zip ties. So those zip ties must have been cut some way for the security officer to be able to cross the border. Now the Egyptian military is saying that this security officer was actually in pursuit of drug smugglers when he breached the border and then engaged in the firefight, although the Egyptian military also saying that they are expressing condolences to those who were killed. Now, the Israeli media is reporting that this officer was found to have not only his regular weapon, but extra magazines on his persons. But all indications we're seeing from both Egyptian and Israeli officials is that they're trying to treat this as a very unusual and isolated incident. And that it is not that it does not spiral into a bigger situation. The Israeli Minister of Defense and the Egyptian Minister of Defense have already spoken on the phone together, saying that they're going to cooperate on the investigation. And the Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson saying that this situation is not indicative of the relationship between the two militaries, which often cooperate with one another, especially to try to thwart guns and weapons smuggling along this portion of the Sinai desert. But a lot of questions still to be still unanswered, including why was this Egyptian security officer crossing the border fence without alerting the Israeli military and he seemed to be by him. Why was he going after drug smugglers as the Egyptian military says by himself. And from the Israeli military there are a lot of questions about those two soldiers in those outposts they should have been checked in upon once an hour that was not done. So according to the Israeli military, how also did somebody cross the border without triggering some sort of alarm, lots of questions still to be answered on this very unusual incident.

And although he argued a little bit with the scope and scale, the goal was the same there. And here, it's the liberate occupied territory. So we asked him about his anticipation for the counter offensive, and how he will know if it will be successful. He said, look, the U.S. and the West other countries in particular have helped the poor in the weaponry that Ukraine needs for this kind of offensive, they're as prepared as they need to be. But war itself is also very difficult to predict. There are a lot of different probabilities and possibilities that lead to the outcome. So he wouldn't go as far as to say whether it would be a successful counter- offensive. He was very careful in his wording here. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: It's too early to tell what outcomes are going to happen. I think the Ukrainians are very well prepared, as you know very well, the United States and other allied countries in Europe and really around the world have provided training and ammunition and advice, intelligence, et cetera to the Ukrainians, we're supporting them. They're in a war, that's an existential threat for the very survival of Ukraine, and has greater meaning to the rest of the world for Europe, really, for the United States, but also for the globe.

He said, look, it's certainly a possibility that Russia might choose to escalate with attacks within their own borders. But to some extent, this is something the U.S. watches very closely and it's a part of war. If Russia was going to attack Ukraine, there should be an anticipation that Ukraine might take the fight back to them. The U.S. monitors this very closely as of right now, it is a war between Ukraine and Russia and the escalation is expected to be in Ukraine. Should Russia choose to escalate outside Ukraine? Well, that puts this entire situation in an entirely different area, Becky.",

And the Belgian international striker, his story is up alongside any and all of them I would suggest. It was wonderfully told around about five years ago by a website called the players Tribune, I don't mind telling you, everybody watching, I read it and cried. And I sent it to my wife and she read it and she cried. And what it was it told the story of when he was a youngster. He, his father was a professional footballer, but when he retired, the money ran out. So they lived a good life up until then, but and as had happened to any one of us, they fell on very hard times. So hard, in fact, that as a six year old, he watched his mother mix milk with water, so that it would stretch to provide him for all of his brothers and sisters. They couldn't even watch the Champions League, because they had no electricity. So he promised his father, his grandfather, I should say that he would take care of his mother, just five days before his beloved grandfather passed away. So when I asked him what this moment would mean, you can understand why he was a little bit emotional. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The Swedish ball star has had a staggering 24 year career spanning nineteen's and 561 goals for club and country. But beyond the glitz and glory, Zlatan brought a persona on and off the pitch that was unmatched. He is perhaps one of the most confident footballers I've ever had the pleasure of sitting down with, if not the most confident. I want to end our show with a classic Zlatan moment from my interview with him just before the 2022 Qatar World Cup. When I asked him the age old question of who is the best, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
