ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTNow, this package includes $95 billion total, but that's nearly $61 billion going to Ukraine's effort in their war against Russia, as well as another $26 billion for Israel in humanitarian assistance, as well now, the president has long pushed for additional Western support for Ukraine, but a lot of those quests had been -- a lot of that had been up in the air as Congress had flounder to pass any type of Ukraine legislation over the past few months. Now, Biden is hoping to dispatch a quick round of aid very soon. He spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to detail what this next aid package could look like. Sources say that the administration has been preparing to send about $1 billion in aid and equipment. That could possibly include long range ATACMS for the very first time, as well as defense and artillery ammunition and also other fighter vehicles as well. But really, the passage of this package, really advances the administration's work that has been going on behind the scenes to try to get this across the finish line. The Biden Administration really drilled in on trying to win over House Speaker Mike Johnson in this process. Johnson really was a relative unknown to this White House at the beginning, when the president first proposed this joint aid for Israel and Ukraine. And one thing that the administration knew that he was grappling with was the right flank of his party, which has pushed for him not to pass aid for Ukraine or potentially risk his speakership. Now, the president gave some directives to his team I am told, one thing that he really wanted them to make clear was what the national security implications would be if additional aid wasn't passed. He wanted them to provide very detailed intelligence briefings, looking at Ukraine's battlefield dynamic as well as what could happen down the road if they didn't get that necessary equipment. The president also told his team to really try to lay off on targeted attacks of Johnson as this process played out, instead trying to use the moment to really just push House Republicans at large to pass this aid bill. Now, the conversations to get this aid across the finish line really picked up steam over the course of the past six weeks, I am told Counselor to the President Steve Ricchetti really served as that main conduit, speaking with Johnson regularly over the course of the past four weeks. You also had the director of legislative affairs constantly in contact with the staff of both parties up on Capitol Hill, trying to hammer out what this aid package could look like. [08:05:00] SAENZ: Ultimately, there was that turning point when Iran attacked Israel when it was clear that the House wanted to try to act and the White House worked them to try to ensure that this included aid for Ukraine at that time. So really, this caps off a moment for President Biden, where he has staked so much of his presidency, so much of his foreign policy agenda over the last two years on having that unequivocal support for Ukraine even as things were up in the air, lots of twists and turns up on Capitol Hill, he has finally secured that win for Ukraine and is expected to sign that legislation a bit later today.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is praising the Senate vote, saying \"It reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy.\" But while the Senate was passing the bill, Russia was shelling Ukraine in the early hours of Wednesday. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live from Odessa, Ukraine, which was also targeted in that wave of Russian strikes. Hi there, Fred.

So, this is definitely one of the places that the Ukrainian say they need to be able to do a better job of protecting. And of course, they hope that more air defense missiles will be key to that and that those will come very soon. Now, it is quite interesting because in the early morning hours here, because that is when the Senate voted to OK that big aid package for foreign countries, of course, also with that Ukraine aid (ph) as well. The president of the country Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he came out and he thanked Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader. He also thanked Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, but then also said that he hoped that the president would sign this order as quickly as possible, and that was sort of the second message that Volodymyr Zelenskyy sent to the U.S. saying it is great that at this package has come through. Now, speed is of the essence to get some of these weapons, to get the ammunition to the battlefield as fast as possible. The three things that he was talking about, one of them were longer distance capabilities. Arlette was talking just now about those ATACMS, longer range missiles that the Ukrainians hope that they will get there soon. But then also, artillery ammunition and of course also, what is needed down here that Ukrainian say are those air defense weapons as well, which they hope that they will be able to keep cities like this one safer than they have been so far, Amara.",

Fred.As Israeli leaders thank the U.S. for approving $26 billion of aid there, we are getting more details about a grim discovery at a Gaza hospital. Civil Defense officials in Gaza say at least 334 bodies were found at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis. The United Nations is calling for an independent and transparent investigation. Israel says the claim that the IDF buried bodies is baseless and unfounded. It says its troops, while searching for Israeli hostages, examined some bodies and returned them to where they had been found. CNN's Nic Robertson joining us now live from Jerusalem.

The government officials there overseeing it or trying to analyze, dig up the bodies, give them a proper burial, and analyze and find out how they died and why the bodies have been moved around from the graves that they originally put in inside the hospital. This is what they're finding in Khan Younis replicates what they found in one of the major hospitals in Gaza city after that had been under siege for several weeks by the IDF.And what the U.N. is calling for is an independent investigation, an effective one, one that has international people involved in that investigation on the ground. And they say the reason for that is that in this current climate, without having an international presence, therefore, you can't really know the results that you're going to get. In essence, they're saying we can't trust what the IDF is saying, and what the IDF is saying is that in this effort to search and find the bodies of hostages who are missing, who they think may have been buried in the hospital grounds because they believe that Hamas operated in and around the hospitals, they say that they put the bodies back in the same place that they find them, that they do this work with dignity, when they dig them up and do the DNA checking. But that is not one washing with the international community and the U.N. is pointing out very clearly that in a time of war, hospitals have a special designated status and that it is an international war crime if civilians who are not part of the combat are killed in such circumstances in such locations. So this is a very strong language that's coming from the U.N. It is not clear that Israel will a cede to what the U.N. wants the relationship between the U.N. and Israeli government right now is bitter, divided and acrimonious to say the least. But this is what the international community is pushing for on the basis of what's being dug up in these hospitals.",

      "sentences": "Sure, Amara, good to see you. And we are right back here, essentially where it started two years ago when the Supreme Court reversed nearly a half-century of constitutional abortion rights and many states, including Idaho, immediately put bans in effect. And Idaho's law says that women cannot get an abortion in that state unless they -- unless death is imminent. And what's at issue is this federal law that would allow women to get emergency care in federally funded hospital emergency rooms if they had serious medical health conditions that were arising from pregnancies that fell short of being, as I said, close to death, but could involve organ failure or serious infections, rupture of membranes.So that's kind of the gap that we are talking about here. That kind of medical emergency that the federal government said its law must prevail, at least in hospital emergency rooms. Idaho will argue -- Joshua Turner, a state constitutional litigator, will be up first, right at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, arguing that federal law should not pre-empt the state ban, that states still control what happens in its own emergency rooms and should have priority here. Countering that will be Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar saying this law will cover rare but profound situations where you do have a health emergency, a serious health emergency that should be covered under this 1986 law that guarantees emergency medical treatment. This law, Amara, as I said, traces to the 1980s and it was originally designed and is still is designed to avoid so-called patient dumping. But Merrick Garland, Attorney General, shortly after the ruling two years ago that reversed Roe v. Wade said, this federal protection will still exist for emergency room. So that's the crux of the issue. The federal power to pre-empt state bans, which I should add, Idaho and about 14 to 15 other states have bans that are pretty serious that would go -- have exceptions only for the true life of the mother, Amara.",

Thank you for having me. This case has nationwide implications far beyond Idaho, as you just heard. And it really centers on the question about the right to emergency abortion care and is part of a broader strategy to ban abortion altogether. Idaho's abortion ban with exceptions, very narrow exceptions, is just another proof point, right, that medical exceptions are really designed to act as window dressing for abortion bans. They don't work and were seeing that right now. Whenever you allow pregnancy into -- whenever you will have government into pregnancy, you are opening up doctors and patients to potential civil and criminal punishments because their decisions will be judged by a political system, not by doctors.

LEE-GILMORE: Well, Amara, I live in Missouri where there is a similar total ban without even exceptions here in this state. I think one thing that we don't talk about enough is the fact that the alliance defending freedom is using fetal personhood, which is the idea that fetuses are people under this state's constitution, to justify denying pregnant people the care they need. Personhood is about, again, when the government can stake a claim in a pregnant person's decision- making or pregnancy, and fetal personhood is the through line to common anti-abortion policy tactics like viability limits. And while personhood is meant to assign rights to an embryo, we saw that play out in Alabama with IVF, it can impact pregnant people throughout the entirety of pregnancy. So, personhood and viability limits are the key central policies that have been baked into abortion policies and state criminal codes since 1973. When we talk about restoring Roe, we are talking about restoring these very laws that are being used against pregnant people who are now seeking abortion care.",

Let's say, the Supreme Court were to side with Idaho saying that, you know, the state's abortion bans actually override this federal law that protects women from seeking emergency abortions in hospitals, what is your biggest fear then?LEE-GILMORE: I think the biggest fear is already playing out, people will be denied the care that they need. They will be left to their own navigating this landscape. Many people will have to travel out of state to get the care. And in an emergency situation, you don't have the time to do that. By the way, even in states with abortion clinics, where it is legal, there are very few of them. And they're being overwhelmed by the system because so many people are traveling to them. So, I think there isn't the scenario that we haven't already seen yet. We already know what's going to happen because we are seeing it happen now.

You can see over my shoulder here, this is just outside Columbia University's gates and sort of highlights the two types of protests that we've been seeing.There have been a number of them happening, again, just outside where people have come in and it could be students, it could not be students, but they protest outside the gates here and then you have the encampments on campus themselves. That is what is now entering an eighth day here now. We were on campus yesterday speaking to some of those folks and they say their main purpose there they say is they want to force the university to divest from corporations they say support Israeli apartheid and genocide. Now, while that encampment has been entering into its eighth day, you mentioned that the university president said a midnight deadline to clear those encampments. Part of the specific progress that they've made up to this point, according to the university officials, is that the students apparently agreed to dismantle or remove a significant number of tents. They are ensuring those not affiliated with Columbia University will leave and that they will take steps to make the encampment welcome to all. That said, student protesters released a statement claiming the school threatened to send in the National Guard and that the students won't be able to move forward in negotiations until they get insurances either that the National Guard or the New York Police Department won't be sent in to deal with students. And that, of course, is significant because, last week, in the early few days of this encampment, the New York Police Department was sent in to clear out students, a move that was criticized by many students and professors as well. So of course, that's a dynamic to keep an eye on if these negotiations don't get to an agreement by this new deadline, 48 hours from now.",

At Yale, over 40 people were arrested as well. A lot of it has seemed to stem from when Columbia first started these protests last week, the encampment style protests last Wednesday, as their president testified on Capitol Hill about anti-Semitism on campus. From there, it seems that this wave of protests and solidarity with some of the Columbia students has spread to other campuses. And we have not seen any concrete signs of that slowing down. But what we have seen is a growing of a dynamic between schools trying to figure out how to balance free speech with what they have described as trying to restore order in some of these campuses. So clearly, this is an issue that is not going away. Now, we have a timetable here at Columbia, a deadline, so to speak, where previously the Columbia University president said if that agreement wasn't reached by the midnight deadline, previously, they would find alternative ways to clear the campus, which makes you wonder what those alternative ways are, Amara.

[08:40:00] WALKER: Today, that other business could include a ruling on whether Trump has violated the gag order in the case. The judge's decision could come at any time. The trial itself will resume on Thursday with more testimony from former National Enquirer publisher, David Pecker. The U.S. government will pay close to $140 million to victims of Larry Nassar, the disgraced former USA gymnastics team doctor. The settlement follows allegations from more than 150 women and girls who say the FBI failed to investigate their claims of abuse by Nassar. Nassar was convicted in 2018 of sexually abusing young athletes under the guise of performing medical treatment and sentenced to up to 175 years in prison. The Justice Department acknowledged its failures in a scathing report that found senior officials did not respond properly to those allegations. Still to come, this new video raises fresh questions over the horrific 2021 attack at Kabul Airport amid the chaos of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan. We'll have that CNN Exclusive reporting just after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

On August 26, 2021, a moment of acute savagery at the end of America's longest war. Two Pentagon investigations insisted all 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. Military who died here were killed by an ISIS bomber, and nobody hit by gunfire. GEN. KENNETH F. MCKENZIE,COMMANDER, U.S. CENTCOM: No definitive proof that anyone was ever hit or killed by gunfire. PATON WALSH (voice-over): But this new video, which begins outside the airport's Abbey Gate entrance, reveals much more shooting after the blast than the Pentagon said. Combined with new accounts to CNN of marines opening fire and gunshot injuries and Afghan civilians, it challenge is the rigor and reliability of the two Pentagon investigations that declared no Afghan civilians were shot dead in the chaotic aftermath.

You cannot see who is still firing here, and we never see marines or anyone firing in this video. Short controlled bursts in isolation. We see (ph) a gas canister has exploded in the blast. It is gas choking this marine. And in a moment, the total episodes of gunfire you've heard will start being more than the three that Pentagon has said happened. The gunfire continues. We leap forward 27 seconds, as Afghans arms raised run into the airport. One burst, now another. They wonder if the Taliban, the TB (ph), is shooting. Two marines told us they saw the Taliban just after the blast, looking as shocked as they were. Multiple marines we spoke to, who were there, said they felt they were under fire. But the Pentagon has insisted for two years, no militant gunmen opened fire here. They've said the only shots fired here where two bursts by U.S. Marines and one from U.K. troops.

That's at least 43 shots in 11 episodes of shooting, just short of four minutes of sporadic fire, most of which the Pentagon has said for two years did not happen. This is how terrifying it was for Afghans outside, minutes after the blast. So, who was shooting? For the first time, a marine eyewitness has come forward and told CNN the first big burst of gunfire at the start of the GoPro video you just saw came from where U.S. Marines were standing near the blast site.

They said that the first investigation had thoroughly looked at allegations of outgoing fire from U.S. and coalition forces following the blast. They said their review released earlier this month focused not on gun fire, but the bomber and events leading up to the blast, but found no new evidence of a complex attack and uncovered no new assertions of outgoing fire, having no materialistic impact on the original investigation. Investigators have also not interviewed any Afghans for their reports, the Pentagon said, leaving the question of how hungry for the truth are they? Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London.
