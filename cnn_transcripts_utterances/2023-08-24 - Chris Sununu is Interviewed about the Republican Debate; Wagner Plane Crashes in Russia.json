At best, the debate turned into an audition in second place in a race that, on the current trajectory, looks likely to catapult Trump to his third conservative Republican nomination.\" But did any of the candidates do anything last night to even slow him down?

If there's any investigation going on in Russia, it's very strongly and directly controlled by the Kremlin. So, it will be interesting to see how they spin this.

I mean the idea that Prigozhin could have done what he did to begin with is - shows a significant chink in Putin's armor. One that I don't think has been healed yet.And I think right now what's happening is, is the elites are looking the Putin and saying, how much weakness are we willing to tolerate and is something like this going to happen again.
