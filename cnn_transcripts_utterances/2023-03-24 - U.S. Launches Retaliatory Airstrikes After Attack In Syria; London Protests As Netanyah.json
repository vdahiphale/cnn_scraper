The Israeli prime minister's visit to the U.K. was met with protests over his judicial overhaul overshadowing his diplomatic trip. The French government and its people enter a showdown over anti-pension reform protests not letting up. So far nearly 500 people have been arrested. Well, the U.S. says it launched retaliatory airstrikes after an Iranian affiliated drone attack killed a U.S. contractor in northeastern Syria, and it says more such strikes could come if warranted. This video posted on social media is said to show the aftermath of the U.S. airstrikes. There are unconfirmed reports of deaths of pro-Iranian fighters. The drone attack also injured five U.S. service personnel and another contractor. Natasha Bertrand is following the story for us from the Pentagon. She'll be joining us in just a moment, and we've got Nic Robertson in London with the wider diplomatic analysis. Nic, great to have you on. I want you to tell me about this attack., the significance of this, and of course the timing.",

Therefore it had -- it was packedfull of explosives, and that was very precise way of accurately targeting whatever this group wanted to target within the compound of the U.S. base. More accurate than indirect fire a rocket, for example. The response coming very quickly. A decision taken by President Biden to authorize that but really, really clearly indicates that tensions are already high, that the United States has a very clear set of potential targets, places that it wants to hit in eventuality as something like this. They haven't gone after the perpetrators precisely who had the drone or where the drone was launched from, but they've gone after other groups who perhaps have ammunition stores or have been working intelligence on the ground for these affiliated groups, these groups that are affiliated with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. So it's the United States' position is this is something that is coming and being directed by Tehran, holding them responsible, but targeting their groups on the ground. And it's not clear precisely what's been hit. It was in a rural area, but in the past when the United States has responded this way, it has hit ammunition stores. And you can see here a sort of huge explosion fireball and perhaps what we can see are secondary explosions coming off of that. So again, this could be an ammunition dump that was hit precision targeting intended not to create additional casualties or to bring about an escalation.",

So what we're told is that the facility is that the U.S. targeted in this airstrikeyesterday, they were essentially housing, according to U.S. officials, munitions and there were also used for intelligence gathering purposes by these Iranian proxy groups, and this is not the first time that the U.S. has carried out these kinds of strikes against these Iranian proxy groups, including in Syria. President Biden ordered a similar strike back in August of last year, and that is because the U.S. currently has about 900 U.S. troops that are stationed in Syria as part of the anti-ISIS coalition. But as Nic mentioned they have come under attack by these Iranian proxy groups about 78 times since the beginning of 2021, so the U.S. feels now that it really needs to start responding proportionally, not necessarily escalating, but letting Iran know that these Iran-backed groups -- I should say no, that this is unacceptable, and National Security Council coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby, he did tell CNN this morning how the U.S. is viewing this.

So this coming at a moment when the U.S. is really trying to send a message they have done so in the past, but clearly has not deterred Iran -- Iran- backed groups and Iran from conducting these kinds of attacks, so we will have to see whether they change their force posture in the country.

Mr. Netanyahu is now vowing to personally work on pushing through the plan, which opponents say threatens Israel's democracy. There have been widespread protests in Israel and we are seeing them in London as well. We have Salma Abdelaziz. She's been in the midst of those crowds.

It's a fantastic read. Now to another major development in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and Syria could be on the verge of resuming consular services. That's what Saudi state TV is reporting. This news comes just two weeks after the kingdom agreed to resume diplomatic ties with its former foe Iran. The Saudi foreign minister says he and his counterparts in Tehran will meet soon to reopen their embassies, Now meantime, Iran's diplomatic push to minimize its global isolation has overshadowed the protest movement inside the country. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins us now from London. You've been covering the protest action, the unrest in Iran extensively since it began and now seeing the mending relationship between Saudi and Iran, that's gaining big momentum.
