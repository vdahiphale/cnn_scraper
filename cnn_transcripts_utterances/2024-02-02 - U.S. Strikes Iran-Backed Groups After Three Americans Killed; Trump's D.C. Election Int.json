The U.S. hitting more than 85 targets, in Iraq and Syria, against Iranian-backed militias. B-1 bombers flying, non-stop, from an Air Force base, in Texas, ultimately striking seven facilities, in a mission, that, the White House says was successful, but also not over yet. It is without a doubt a sharp escalation of the war in the Middle East. Those bombers, in the air today, as President Biden was attending the dignified transfer, for those three soldiers, at Dover Air Force Base. We start with team coverage tonight. Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Retired Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton, in Washington. And Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. Oren, let me start with you. Because obviously, we are hearing from the Pentagon, confirming these strikes, laying out their rationale. What's the latest that you're learning, tonight?",

To be more precise, four in Syria, three in Iraq, going after, not specifically Iran.The U.S. didn't strike directly in Iran, in this case, but going after Iranian-backed militias, and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, the elite part of the IRGC. Trying to send a message not only to Iran, but also to these militias, that the attacks, on the U.S. forces, in the region, have gone way too far, including, especially that attack that killed three U.S. service members, and wounded scores more, in Jordan, on Sunday. The response now beginning to play out, coming through five days later, as the U.S. carries out strikes, on 85 targets, including not only weapons, and the U.S. saying there were secondary explosions, at some of these facilities, indicating weapons were hit, but also command and control centers, intelligence centers, and much, much more. This is at least an order of magnitude larger than the strikes we've seen the U.S. take, in Iraq and Syria, over the course of the past few months. It's also, I should note, the first time we have seen the U.S. strike both countries, at the same time, with very much the possibility of more expected, perhaps in the coming days. President Joe Biden strongly suggested this was just the beginning. And Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, put it even more bluntly. In a statement after the strikes, he said, \"This is the start of our response. The President has directed additional actions to hold the IRGC and affiliated militias accountable for their attacks on U.S. and Coalition Forces. These will unfold at times and places of our choosing.\" Austin very much saying, there will be more here. And we will wait to see how that looks, how that unfolds. But this is a very strong first message, not only in the target, and the amount of strikes here, but also in the platforms used. B-1 heavy bombers, much more significant, in terms of the payload and the bombs, they're able to carry, the missiles as well than the fighter jets, the U.S. normally uses, to carry out these sorts of strikes. Following that in a briefing, the U.S. says, they're confident in the targets they hit, and the effect that the strikes have had. They say there are likely members of the militia, who were killed here. But for that, we'll need a battle damage assessment, which could start to come together, once it's daytime, in the Middle East, Kaitlan.",

For more on how this retaliation went down, I want to bring in retired Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton. And Colonel, obviously the Pentagon here, as you just heard from Oren, in his report, talking about what they hit. Command and control ops, intelligence centers, supply chain facilities, other of key locations. But what can you tell us about where they struck? And just how active the militias are in these areas? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Yes, absolutely, Kaitlan. So, one of the key things to think about here is where this actually happened. And this is the Euphrates River, right here. It was during -- in this valley, in Syria, that most of the attacks occurred. Right here at the border crossing, at Al-Qa'im, between Iraq and Syria, was also a place where the attacks occurred. And then, the Euphrates continues into here. All of these areas are basically places, where these militias operate. And they also operate in areas of western Iraq, right here, and some in the northwest, as well as in other parts of the country of Iraq. But because they are doing all of this, these areas become so important, from a military standpoint. Because what they're doing is they're taking out all of these different nodes, like you mentioned, and Oren mentioned in his report, the command and control nodes, the logistics, areas, all of that, because this is the main supply route, for these militias, to get the stuff that they need to do their work, from Iran.

The first time, the B-1 flew in combat was actually in 1998, for Operation Desert Fox, which was also done here in the Middle East. But the key thing for this particular operation was they were able to fly non-stop, from Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, all the way to Syria, and Iraq. And they were able to do this, because they had the capabilities. And of course, they also have the weapons on board, to do the kinds of things that they need to do, in order to really go after those 85 targets that were hit today.",

Because when we look at this response, obviously it's sent as a message, from the White House that they say it's just the beginning. Do you think the first round sends a strong enough message, in your view? ADM. WILLIAM FALLON (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND, U.S. NAVY (RET): Well, Kaitlan, I think you've hit the nail on the head. It's the first round. This is the opening salvo of what I expect is going to go on for some time. And that message has already come out of the White House. In my view, there are really three, at least three different levels of activity and intention here. First is the strikes, today, retaliation -- retaliation, to strike back at the perpetrators, of the -- caused the death of our soldiers, and other activities. The second thing is to attempt to deter further attacks. Third thing and I think, most important, is to send a message to Iran. Because there's no doubt that Iran is behind all of this activity. They coordinate it. They arm it. They fund it. And they encourage it. And so, at the end of the day, the real objective, in my mind, is to get a message to Iran. And we've had enough of it.

I get the feeling that we're kind of maybe not being as tough as we say we are with that. And I note that Iran, for example, continues to export oil. They're cranking out 4.5 million barrels a day. That's a lot of oil. And guess where most of it's going? To China, like, probably 90 percent of it. So, this whole business is connected. Iran, Russia, China, the countries of the region.

The B-1 bombers, cruise missiles, very, very accurate, they hit what they were shooting at. The problem is, the last couple days, these forces have been dispersing personnel, and ammunition, weapons and the rest of it. So, they were preparing for this attack. I think mainly this attack will serve as a message to Tehran is that we are willing to escalate, if they keep attacking our forces, in the Middle East. And we have forces in Iraq, Jordan, and everywhere else. So yes, I think it's a strong message. And let's see what the Iranians do.

Obviously, if they deny, certiorare, and say, we're not going to hear the case, which I just can't foresee happening, in something this important? Then, she could just bring the parties together, and jump right on, and try to have the case, go to trial, in the summer or fall. But, again, realistically, with the first bite at the Supreme Court landing was such a thud, in terms of expedition, that I think they're going to be on their regular briefing schedule.

I'm lucky if I've taken a true shower, and didn't just grab a handful of wipes, and scrub off the best I can, on my way running out the door. Actually, I have an oopsie baby. My fourth one.

I understood what she was trying to do. She was trying to say, look, this could be any one of you. We are all human. We all make mistakes. There are no perfect parents. Don't find her guilty because she is a mother that has made mistakes. But what was missing from this argument are the facts of this case. This is not a case of someone that has to use wipes, because they don't have time for a shower. This is a mother that had clear opportunities, to prevent her son, from committing these murders. She had the warning signs, big red warning signs, and she ignored them. And I think the jurors are going to be smart enough to distinguish, between a busy working lawyer that has four kids, and a mother of one child, where the evidence has shown that she has spent more time with horses, and perhaps with a boyfriend, or trying to find a boyfriend, on an online app, than she did taking care of her child.
