University police say shots are fired on the campus in East Lansing. And they are advising everyone, students, staff, everyone there to secure in place.A spokesperson for the university says one fatality is now confirmed. That is according to the Detroit News. Police believe there is only one suspect involved who they believe is on foot. Police are searching for that suspect right now. The ATF and the FBI are also responding to what they are calling an active shooter situation here. I want to bring in CNN Senior Crime and Justice Correspondent Shimon Prokupecz, CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey. Shimon, what is your reporting? What is the latest there?",

      "sentences": "Right, Alisyn. So, we are just getting word of this one fatality inside Berkey Hall at the school, this according to Detroit News, we spoke to the school spokesperson.So, some sad news out of there, and we're also hearing of multiple injuries. We don't know what those injuries are. But as you can imagine students, faculty running from this situation, certainly could have been injured during those moment as well. Priority now there by the police, which has really responded en masse there, dozens and dozens of officers from all over that area, now searching for this gunman. They have a brief kind of description, not a very specific description of who they're looking for. Witnesses described him as a black male wearing a mask. And so that is what police are working on. This all unfolded sometime around 8:30 or so, and the first notice that really went out on this was it was a note, an email and text that came from the school police, warning students and faculty of the shooting. And what it said was that, there was a shots fired incident occurring on or near the East Lansing Campus, secure in place immediately and then they told students and faculty to run, hide and fight. And then they explained what to do and they wanted student to evacuate and then some to hide. But we know that many student and some of the faculty are hiding in classrooms and rooms around the school as police go from floor to floor, classroom to classroom, room to room, searching for victims, searching for the gunman. But right now, the key here is that this is not a secure situation. Police are still searching for this gunman and that is all we really know at this point. The governor tweeting a message, Governor Gretchen Whitmer there saying that she has been briefed on the shooting at Michigan State University, the Michigan State Police along with the police -- Michigan State University Police, local law enforcement, first responders are on the ground. And she says, let's wrap our arms around the Spartan community tonight and we will keep everyone updated as we learn more. So, that's what we're now waiting. We're waiting for more information. As you can see the heavy response there -- there's an officer there in tactical gear armed with an AR-15, again, with looks like an axe. This is all because they're going through these rooms in this school and they're using some of those tools to get inside some of those classrooms. But, again, at this point, all we know is that there is at least one death, one fatality here, sadly, and several others injured, as police from all over there in that area are searching for this gunman as we await for more word here from the police. But this is all still very much developing and very much still an active scene, as you can see there.",

That's a big campus. They've got to do a thorough search. So, they have to organize the people who have responded because they are going to have people through the various buildings, trying to find this individual who is responsible for this.One thing that I think is very important that we say for those students that are right now on lockdown, stay where you are, do not venture out and do not let anyone into your area that you do not know. And so I think that's very, very important, they just stay put. I know it's been a while. I know they get a little antsy. But right now, that's the best course of action. Let the police do what they do, thoroughly search all the buildings, every area of the campus. But it's going to take time. It's a very large campus. They've got a lot of response vehicles that have shown up, a lot of police officers. But now the trick is going to be coordinating it so that it's a systematic search of the campus to find this individual.",

They are many cities (ph). So, you're never going to be able to enclose them in the way that you can, say a high school that might have limited building. Also the residential aspect of it, the party aspect of it is very different because people are coming in and out. There were no identification systems. MSU and other major universities have lots of students living nearby, in housing. So, basically, we spent a lot of time on response, which is what do we know at the moment that it's known and what are you telling these young adults.And I have to say from the moment this started, the Twitter feed in the communication by MSU has been incredibly -- I know people want more information sooner, but their primary goal is to protect students. They are still getting called a potential active shooter. They just got on Twitter about seven minutes ago with the suspect description and saying just possibly black. So, they're not even confirming the race of the suspect. They are still getting reports of potential active shooters. A lot of these are going to be false positives. People are nervous, we know that. But as Chief Ramsey said, stay put. And then what you're seeing here is how an incident commands should work. We've talked -- Shimon and I have talked a lot about incident command after Uvalde. This is how it works. You've got to university and college police out in front. They have been, if they're doing it right, which they clearly have been working with local law enforcement emergency management. Those then in a case like this will search quickly into the surrounding areas, searching resources and even the state. I think I saw some state police. And that's how it's supposed to work until you essentially destroyed the threat, which they're not at yet. So, that's what we're looking at right now. So, the students watching this, stay put and follow the communications of local public safety and verified public safety, not a lot of the noise that is going on, which always does in these cases.",

Mission number two is there are a lot of people got shelter in place or heard shots and are hiding. So, they are going building by building. And they're getting calls and they're going to those places and they're getting people out into groups and then getting them out of the buildings.At the same time, as Shimon said, you have these calls of shots fired that keep coming in. So far, police have responded to all of those. None of those has panned out as a new shooting. That can be cause of people who heard the original shots and say, we heard shots, we're hiding, and that gets translated differently. You have got a unified command. So, that means you have got the campus police, you've got the Lansing P.D., you've got the state police.",

I'm not going to say which building but that is where they are running it out of. And they have a very organized and systematic approach.What they do not have is who the gunman is, where the gunman is, and there are some conflicting descriptions of the gunman. What they're getting a lot of, and this is causing a lot of running around, is reports of two men with rifles, three men walking in the dark armed. And they are responding to those and determining that those are two and three and four-person police teams with long guns who are moving around, responding to the calls and trying to get people out. So, right now, we are in a process. Now, by experience, we've seen a number of these things before. You have a gunman who struck and fled. You may have gunman who struck and took their own life by self- inflicted wound. Statistically, we see that in about half of the cases.

If it's two campus police officers and two Lansing people or state police person, they form that initial contact team and move towards the threat to stop that threat. When the second group gets there, whether it's mix and match or whether they're all from the same agencies, who has a long gun? Who has a radio? Who's taking points? Who's going to do communications? They form a second team and they go forward. The good news is, what usually have is too many teams at some point, and somebody takes over command of the scene and says this is the systematic way we're going to do this. In this incident, what we're seeing is, because as you described, Ali, the size of the campus, the breath of the buildings, the number of people hiding in place it is -- if we -- if we're not making contact with the shooter, now we're searching for the shooter inside the buildings and outside the buildings. In the, meantime, we have those people hiding. We're telling them to shelter in place until law enforcement reaches them. What we're seeing at this point, because now we're a bit into this incident is, you're seeing groups of 20 and 30 students getting together and saying, well, let's exit. So, people who are handling the perimeters are seeing people exiting and then they have an entirely separate mission, which is, you don't want those people evaporating. What you want is immediate triage, is anybody hurt? Was anybody injured? And then you want something altogether different, which is witness triage. Okay, what did you see? What did you hear? Nothing, nothing, okay. What did you, see what did you hear? And we've learned these lessons in places like San Bernardino where one of those people said, I saw the gunman, I think I know who it is.

Earlier this evening around 8:15, we got a notice on our phones that there was an active shooter situation here on campus at Michigan State University. And as you might imagine, that sort of sent the entire campus into a state of heightened alert. What I understand to be the case at this point is that the shooter is still on the move and as you reported, we have one person who we know is deceased and there are injuries on campus. What we are experiencing now is what often happens in these situations. Because the shooter has not been captured yet as we have students and faculty members and staff sheltered in locations around campus, everything begins to look suspicious. And so, we're seeing lots of reports of shots fired. We're seeing lots of reports of suspicious individuals. And so, law enforcement right now is working very hard to isolate the location of this individual and to really try to make sure that those people who are sheltered, as John said, that we get the information that we need. We get them moved out of these locations where they are on lockdown.

And at this time, police, number one, still looking for this gunman. But think about all of the students and faculty that are still sheltered in place hiding, fearful for their life as police still continue to search this massive campus. So, at this hour, police are still going door to door inside these buildings trying to evacuate some of the students and faculty and staff members that are inside the school. We're waiting for police to hold a press conference here shortly in about 15 minutes or so. They said that they would do -- they would have one at 11:00. But you know, as you said, we're getting updates from the police and from the school, which have been obviously very helpful certainly for us, but for family members as they say, five victims right now are being treated at Sparrow Hospital. The police also saying, tweeting that they are canceling all activities at the school for the next 48 hours including athletics, classes, and all campus related activities.
