And Americans are not being kidnapped here. Families are not being forced to flee their homes for war here. Thankfully, all that happens to be true. But the hate that's spreading around the world is very much being felt right here in the U.S. of A.

They are there. They are here. The antisemitism, the Islamophobia, they have exponentially increased. And it's not somebody else's problem to grapple with. Really, as a society, it is our problem.

The first being that as someone who works in the civil rights space to combat hate, one of the things we've told this White House in particular is there is a White House initiative to combat hate crime, and that we think it's important to leverage that work and to engage in that work and prioritize that work because hate doesn't -- hate is really intersectional. It targets all communities equally regrettably.So, when they released a strategy initially on antisemitism and said there would be one on Islamophobia and what they called related forms of hate and discrimination, put sort of simply, I think all hate is related. All forms of hate are related. And therefore, I think the best approach is one that brings us all together to do that. Having said that, they released the antisemitism strategy, and then there was this effort to release the one on Islamophobia. It was expected last week. I will personally be honest enough to share that it pushed back and said this is not the right time to release the strategy.",

COATES:  That's fascinating to think about because one of the reasons that hate crimes and people sometimes were bothered by the fact that you'd have hate crime legislation because he would say, look, we already have murder charges, we already have assault charges, why do you have to add this additional layer there? And people would say in response, I think is a good response, the right response, hate crimes are so terrorizing because it is indiscriminate based on your perception of who you think I am, and anyone is a walking target based on your exercise of bigotry at any given moment. So, it's interesting to think about the idea of collectively addressing it and not bifurcating it in the way you're talking about, but there are moments, given the numbers that Christopher Wray has spoken about, is there not a need at times to target and ensure that there is a focus on certain groups at certain times as priorities?",
