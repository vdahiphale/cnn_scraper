      "sentences": "Welcome back to the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.At this hour, we are learning critical new details about when the Pentagon learned about the Chinese spy balloon and when they realized they must tell the president about it. This comes as U.S. Navy divers and other military personnel are scouring the ocean floor off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. And we're getting new video into CNN. A resident in South Carolina shot this and said he believes it could be debris from the balloon. To be clear, CNN cannot independently verify whether or not this is, in fact, debris from that Chinese spy balloon. We're reaching out to the Navy for comment. In the meantime, Republicans are condemning President Biden for failing to take action on the balloon sooner. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us now with more. Alex, you're learning more about this timing, when it came down to the decision-making that was taking place inside the Biden administration. We heard the president stating to reporters emphatically yesterday that he made this call on Wednesday that the balloon be shot down as soon as it was safe to do so. But there's more to the story. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there is, Jim. And a lot of the criticism that is being directed at President Biden is because of the length of time between when he was told about it to when it was eventually shot down.We now know according to the Pentagon, Jim, that this balloon first entered American airspace up in Alaska on the 28th. So a full week before it was eventually shot down, and it wasn't until three days later, on Tuesday the 31st, that President Biden, in fact, gotten his first briefing. He was told by his top military commanders that this balloon was swooping down through Canada and was about to enter American airspace. It did so on that day, on Tuesday, into Idaho. And it is then that President Biden, we're told, did ask for military options, which he then got the next day on Wednesday when military commanders told him that they didn't think that he should shoot or order the balloon shot down over American territory because of the damage that it could do to people on the ground. President Biden, we're told, made clear that he did want to see the balloon shot down, not only when it was safe for people on the ground but in a way that that surveillance payload, all those electronics that hang below that balloon, could be salvaged and could be used for counterintelligence reasons. That balloon, of course, shot down yesterday off the coast of South Carolina. A lot of questions remain, Jim, and the administration is going to have to answer a lot of them to lawmakers as early as Tuesday, when we understand there will be a briefing to the so-called Gang of Eight. Those are the leaders of both parties in both Houses as well as chairman and ranking members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. You can imagine that during that briefing, the administration will be asked why they didn't shoot the balloon down sooner but also about their claims that they were able to not only block the balloon from gathering intelligence but that they, themselves, U.S. intelligence, U.S. Military, were able to gather intelligence about the balloon itself, and about how China carries out its intelligence-gathering measures. They will also be asked, we can assume, about the recovery efforts, what has been recovered so far, what they've learned so far, and what they expect to recover and learn in the coming days and weeks -- Jim.",

You can see that tweet there from Waltz, who says that one flew near Florida, asking why it wasn't shot down. We're also told that it was -- that at least one flew near Texas or at least off of Texas. What was different about this one that was shot down, Jim, we're told is the path. It swooped down from Canada, flying over the northern, central, and eastern parts of the country, and that it loitered. It hung out, in the words of a senior Defense official, for a longer period of time. Of course, we can't forget the very sensitive political moment we're in right now. Very tense relations with China. This balloon spotted and then shot down right as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to travel to Beijing for a very important meeting -- Jim.",

Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): I want to start by doing something that I don't do very often, which is commending Joe Biden for actually having the guts to shoot this down. That was the right thing to do. That is absolutely what the president should have done. Unfortunately, he didn't do that until a week after it entered U.S. airspace. He allowed a full week for the Chinese to conduct spying operations over the United States, over sensitive military installations, exposing not just photographs but the potential of intercepted communications. And more broadly, I think this entire episode telegraphed weakness to Xi and the Chinese government. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And apparently while President Trump was in office, there were a few of these balloons that were up, and it appears that President Trump and his administration never took action against the Chinese because of that.So President Biden was decisive. He took the military's advice that the best time to do it, mostly because of public safety, was when this thing was over water and it was taken out.",

And so for China to be this brazen about it and then make a statement about it after this thing was shot down and not distance themselves from this thing or say, oh, it wasn't ours or so forth, I thought was incredibly interesting and incredibly telling.A sign, I thought, of Chinese aggression and a little bit akin to what the Russians did in 2016, where they essentially were part of an operation to dump all this information from the DNC and weaponize information. This, of course, was different. But in a similar vein, it was the Chinese being more aggressive and not keeping quiet about intelligence.",

Those are things that the president and the country -- that we can be incredibly proud of.So I think he's going to talk about the economy, about where we are now. But I hope that he'll talk about things like immigration and finally getting some big issues done that have been lingering with the Congress and the administration for quite a while. You know, and then of course I think he's probably going to have to address some of the issues or some of the ways that Republicans are waging culture wars in the country, like banning books in Florida and so forth.

The first time he will do so before a divided Congress.Now Republicans throughout this incident have tried to paint President Biden as indecisive, slow-acting, and also weak in his position towards China. But we have heard from White House administration officials pushing back, really defending the president for his decision to wait to shoot down this balloon until it was over water. They argue that the president was deliberative and responsible in his decision-making process. Today Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg went out on the Sunday shows defending the president, saying that what he was trying to do was ensure that the safety of Americans was the first priority. They've also pointed to the president's desire to make sure that they were maximizing the opportunity to recover the payload from that balloon, trying to glean as much information and intelligence as possible from this device by waiting to shoot the balloon while it was out at sea. That made that ability to recover that payload a bit easier.

They've been trying to repair this U.S.-China relationship that significantly deteriorated throughout the pandemic, and that Blinken meeting, which has now been postponed by the U.S. Secretary of State to China, that was going to be a big political win for Beijing, for Xi Jinping. Meanwhile on Chinese social media, Jim, the reaction has been a lot of mocking of the U.S. and some people even joking that why shoot it down, it's just a lantern that blew over from this month's lantern festival. Now we know that both the U.S. and China already use surveillance satellites to spy on each other from the air. The big question remaining is still why would China use a balloon? We still don't know if this was an accident, if it really just blew over, if it was deliberate, if it was a test to see how Biden and the U.S. Military would respond. We also don't know if there were some bureaucratic problems and if Xi Jinping was actually looped in. But as you say, China, they're doubling down on this claim that it was a civilian research aircraft, a weather balloon. State media even announced that they've dismissed the head of China's national weather service. Analysts see this as a move from Beijing to try and shore up its argument that it's a weather balloon. That, of course, is something the Pentagon strongly rejects, saying they are confident it is a spy balloon and that this balloon and the one spotted over Latin America are part of a fleet of Chinese spy balloons that have been spotted around the world in the last few years -- Jim.",

So what I think this says to me is that Zelenskyy is looking, first of all, of taking care of the corruption piece but also making sure that there is complete military experience, military knowledge when it comes to the response to this new phase of this war. And so when the Russians -- if the Russians do, in fact, mount this offensive, that the Ukrainians think that they'll be ready, even more ready with this new minister of defense.",
