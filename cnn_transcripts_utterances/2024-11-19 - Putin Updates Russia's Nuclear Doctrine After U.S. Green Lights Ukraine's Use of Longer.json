A State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said that Russia bringing in North Korean troops, I think the U.S. estimate right now is it's over 11,000 that are operating there in the Kursk region, along with Russian troops. That it's, quote, \"a major escalation by Russia.\" Then you have the U.S. OK'ing Ukraine, using U.S.-made longer-range missiles. Is the Biden administration's calculus here that this is OK to do because it may actually be time limited by Trump taking over the White House. How do you see this, as Trump certainly wants to end the war quickly?",

So if Ukraine is -- is winning, then we don't do as much. If Russia is going to win, we don't want Ukraine to lose. So we're going to do more. And we've managed to continue this policy with slow motion on artillery, HIMARs, tanks, F-16s, ATACMs, and now ATACMs into Russia. It's always the same decision process. And we're probably at some level even talking to the Russians. Anow we're considering this because the Russians have already begun fortifying their airfields and so forth that are in ATACM's range to reduce their vulnerability to it. So this is a political gesture. From the beginning, the administration has not wanted Ukraine to win this war. I don't know how they thought it was going to end. At one point, Jake Sullivan was saying, well, time is on our side, time is on our side. But actually, if you look at Ukraine's manpower, if you look at the fragility of Western democracies, if you look at Putin's resolve and now bringing in the North Koreans, we don't know if time is on our side or not. It really depends on American leadership. And Ukraine's manpower is about a fourth of what's available for Russia. So that was never a good recipe for success. Really there's -- this is going to continue until Putin decides he can't win or until we give him most of what he wants and he's willing to take a pause and wait to get the rest of it.",

We'll have his remarkable story next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:44:57] SANCHEZ: After receiving a life-altering face transplant, Derek Pfaff looked in the mirror and said he'd been given a second chance, that he finally looked like a person again. Pfaff's face had been severely injured after he tried ending his life with a gun back in 2014. He lost his nose, lips, teeth and other parts of his face. But now, thanks to an army of at least 80 people at the Mayo Clinic, the majority of his has been reconstructed and replaced with donor tissue. CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard, spoke with him. Jacqueline, walk us through this miraculous surgery and how this all came to be.",

They were helpful, but his doctors said he really was a good candidate for a full-face transplant.Because he had some difficulty speaking, he had some difficulty chewing, he was still missing a nose, portions of his forehead. And that's when he was connected with the medical team at Mayo Clinic. And they replaced and reconstructed 85 percent of his face with this transplant surgery. And like you said, Boris, this was more than a 50- hour long procedure involving at least 80 people. This was a huge, huge operation. And here is Derek with his parents on what that moment was like when he first saw his new face. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he's encouraging any other young people out there, if you're struggling or feeling stressed like that's what he was feeling like when he was in college, to definitely reach out for help, call the crisis lifeline 988, and that's where you'll find some support.
