Both leaders are expected to address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. Members of the United Auto Workers have launched targeted strikes at three U.S. plants after their contracts ran out late last night. It's not a full-blown walk out of all 145,000 Union members, but it's the first ever simultaneous strike against the big three U.S. automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Union members are demanding an immediate 20 percent pay rise, plus another 5 percent annually for the next four years. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It's closed to the media, all around me and close to other observers inside, according to the court, will only be the judge, the prosecutor, Rubiales, his defense lawyer and possibly the lawyer for the player, Jennifer Hermosa, but not the player herself.Now the two charges, sexual assault. The prosecution service tells CNN that that the language of that sexual assault charge in the Spain -- Spain's Penal Code, has only been there since last year. Because a new law was passed last year by the leftist government to clamp down on sexual assault and that required affirmative consent from a person receiving, in this case a kiss, not just being silent, you have to say yes. It's a sign of the changes going on in Spain between the old way of looking at things and this new thing of trying to get gender equality. Mr. Rubiales says that the consent was -- the kiss was consensual. The player says it was not. The second charge, coercion, prosecutors say that the player says that she was pressured after that kiss, which was seen around the world right after the Spanish women teams won the World Cup just about four weeks ago. Global television audience and inside of the stadium, thousands of people watching this kiss, she says she was pressured later by Rubiales and people around him to come out and say, yes, it was consensual. And that's where that charge is. It's a very preliminary hearing. There is certainly no trial. It's an investigative stage right now. But it's not the only thing going on because Rubiales three weeks ago today defiantly said he would not resign. But he did resign last Sunday. And now, in the coming hours this afternoon in Madrid, the new coach of the women's team, who is a woman, who was a formerly an assistant coach, she will announce at the federation headquarters the names of the female players who are expected to play on the team's next game, which is next Friday against Sweden. So a lot of changes going on, but the attention right now is on whether Rubiales or his lawyer will say anything as they come in or leave the courthouse -- Max.",

But in this case the player is saying that she did not think it was consensual. She didn't like it. She felt like she was a victim. This is what she has told prosecutors.And this is why the case is coming up here to the court.
