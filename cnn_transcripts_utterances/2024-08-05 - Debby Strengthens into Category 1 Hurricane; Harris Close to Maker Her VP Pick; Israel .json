Unfortunately, we didn't have as many take our advice and get out of the evacuation zone as we would like to. We expect to see some very serious effects of storm surge a little bit later today.The next high tide is going to be at about 6 a.m. We are experiencing tropical storm force winds here in Citrus County today. We're under a tornado watch, a flood watch, and also a hurricane watch as Hurricane Debby continues to bear down on the victim area, which is a little bit to our north and to our west from where we're standing right now. We are encouraging everybody to please stay indoors because the high winds and the downed power lines are causing some problems. We have some localized flooding. We also have some winds down south of Austin. When I told the sun comes up in a few hours, we really won't be able to do too much in the way of damage assessments, but we do anticipate additional localized rainfall that will probably equate to a foot or more in a 24-hour period here for the Citrus County community. So, again, we're encouraging folks to keep those warnings, stay indoors, and if you've any power outages to call your local power provider. We've got about 400 homes right now in Citrus County that have lost power overnight, and we anticipate to see those numbers go up during the day. As the high winds continue with thunderstorms and the heavy lightning continues to move its way north, the potential for some tornado outbreaks a little bit later today is pretty high as well. Overnight, we saw some to our south, and those storms are now working their way up north towards Citrus County.",

It exceeded the no-name storm of 1993, and it exceeded what we saw in Hurricane Jermaine and Hurricane Irma a few years back.And again, last year, it came in like a vengeance well after Hurricane Delia made landfall up in the Big Bend area up in Taylor County. And so we could see very similar storm surge effects tomorrow, late today into tomorrow morning, as a matter of fact, because we've got two high tide cycles.",

What I would say is based on the predictions, we're going to see a lot more tornadic activity and a lot more hurricane activity long before we get to the end of November this year.And again, it's always the thing that we preach to everybody is please be prepared, have your go kit ready to go with your medicines, your documentation that you need, and be prepared to evacuate when the word does come out so that you can get to a safe place and then go back and assess the damage after the hurricane passes and then get life back to normal as much as possible as quickly as possible. We can restore a lot of things, but we cannot restore someone's life if they tragically lose their life being electrocuted or falling a victim to being swept away and then drowning in some of the storm surge that we could see later today.",

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Throughout the process Harris has been asking close advisors who would make the best governing partner for her at the White House.Another top consideration though is electability. She's been looking at how each of them would balance out the ticket and how they'd help in key battleground states. Shapiro and Kelly of course from states that will be critical in November. Now the VP pick is often a political afterthought once they're selected but for Harris this is the biggest decision that she's going to make as the presumptive Democratic nominee and she's still working to introduce herself to many Americans. She's been speaking with a close group of confidants including her husband Doug Imhoff and former Attorney General Eric Holder whose law firm is helping with the vetting process. A reminder of just how quickly this process is taking place. Just a couple of weeks ago Harris was President Joe Biden's running mate and now she's selecting her own VP. We will hear a decision soon because she and her running mate are expected to appear at a rally on Tuesday in Philadelphia. That kicks off a battleground blitz. They're going to be crisscrossing the country visiting key states ahead of the Democratic National Convention which starts on August 19th. In Washington Julia Benbrook, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Its security arrangements are far superior.And so, also with the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, although Israel has not admitted responsibility for that, this definitely shows a security breach inside Iran. So, Iran at the moment is actually taking a bit of time just because it is measuring what response it can do that would save its face, but at the same time, it really knows that it is vulnerable and its proxies like Hezbollah are also vulnerable.",
