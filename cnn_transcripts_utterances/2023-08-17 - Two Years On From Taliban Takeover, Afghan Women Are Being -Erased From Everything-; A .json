The Taliban swept to power after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan following its 20-year war, handing back control to the same group of Islamic extremists who ruled in the 1990s. While the Taliban promised to be more moderate and honor women`s rights within Islamic law, the past two years have brought only a hardline stance towards women. The closure of secondary school for girls, the forced implementation of the burqa, the restriction on travel without a male chaperone, the banning of women from universities and working at NGOs including the United Nations. And just last month the Taliban closed all beauty salons that employed roughly 60,000 women, many of them the sole breadwinners of their homes. MAHBOUBA SERAJ, AFGHAN WOMEN`S RIGHT ACTIVIST: Women`s freedom doesn`t exist. There is no such a thing as women`s freedom anymore. COREN (voice-over): Women`s rights activist Mahbouba Seraj, who stayed in Kabul while more than a million Afghans fled, says the Taliban government is erasing women from society.",

BILAL KARIMI, TALIBAN DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Afghanistan was freed from occupation. Afghans were able to regain their country, freedom, government and will. The only way to solve the problem is understanding and dialogue. Pressure and force are not logical.

Now, the empire that he put together, not only was it one of the largest ever, it was also done in record time. It took him 25 years to put together an empire, the size of which it took the Romans 400 years to do. (Voice-over): The trading route known as the Silk Road started around this time. And it continues to influence the global economy today. Mongolia`s immense mineral wealth and underground bounty of copper and gold. It`s learning in foreign investors. (On camera): Nearly a mile underground at Rio`s mine in the Gobi desert. And in some ways it`s quite difficult to connect this basic mining operation with the energy transition until you realize this is what it`s all about. This is the original awe.
