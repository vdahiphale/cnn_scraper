The stuff that Apple spent a lot of time talking about were sort of incremental and potentially really helpful changes. The example they used was what if you could just on the way to pick your mom up from the airport, go to Apple and -- go to your phone and say, hey, Apple, when am I picking my mom up? And where's our restaurant reservation? And you wouldn't have to go through both your e-mails and your calendar and your texts that Apple's A.I. will be smart enough to go through all that, synthesize it, and give you one answer. If you've used a Siri right now on an iPhone, you know, it's nowhere near that. So, it's a big step in terms of what Siri has been able to do for a long time.

Apple has no clue what's actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They're selling you down the river. I mean, we know that OpenAI requires enormous amounts of data in order to train the models that are used for generative A.I. And of course, when you look at Apple, they have monster amounts of data, but they've always been very cautious and careful with privacy.

So, you've got a trust apple there, but they're -- they've they made a point of highlighting that multiple times, that sort of what's important to you and private on your phone stays on your phone. As far as Elon Musk goes, Elon Musk says a lot of things. He's in a feud with OpenAI. You may recall that maybe in the first few months after he bought Twitter that he was complaining about Apple not being supportive enough to his plans and they're going to take too much money from these subscriptions he was going to sell and he was going to sort of like rain hell down on Apple. And then Tim Cook invited him to the Cupertino campus. So, they had a walk, and Elon Musk announced that everything was now solved with Apple. So, maybe this is something that involves another walk.

It makes the computer chips that power artificial intelligence, and demand has been through the roof. The company's been so hot that it just completed a 10-for-1 stock split. That means for every one share owned, investors will now own 10. Now, the per share price has gone from above $1,200 on Friday to around $120 today. The goal of any stock split is to put the share price within reach of small investors. When a stock skyrockets into the thousands of dollars, as NVIDIA did, it can be hard for retail investors to buy more than one share or even that much. So, this is a fix designed to make it more accessible. It's important to remember, though, that the fundamental market value is unchanged. It's just spread across more shares. This is something that Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and others have done in the past when their share prices spike too. NVIDIA was long known as the company that makes computer chips for video games. But, about a decade ago, NVIDIA made a bet that it could become the brains for A.I. And that bet paid off massively, because now A.I. is exploding, and NVIDIA is cashing in. The share price has enjoyed a meteoric rise that's rarely been seen before by a major company. Last month, NVIDIA revealed that its revenue tripled, profits soared more than sevenfold. This company is now worth about $3 trillion. Some context, that's more than Starbucks, Boeing, City, AT&amp;T, J.P. Morgan, Tesla, Exxon, Home Depot, and Walmart combined. NVIDIA is now one of the most valuable companies in America. It's worth more than Amazon and Google owner Alphabet. Last week, it even surpassed Apple. It's not far behind Microsoft, which of course is another A.I. player. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. But guess whose computer chips power ChatGPT?

      "sentences": "Well, Julia, first of all, thank you so much for having me. Lumet solves one of the big problems in solar celleconomics. You know, solar panels are sold on dollars per watt. So, the industry has had a relentless drive to increase the watts and decrease the dollars. So, one of the key costs of solar panels is the solar cells, which make up the panels. Now, on those solar cells, you print metal conductors, metal collectors of the current, and these are printed today, unbelievably, despite the fact that the industry is extremely technologically advanced, these are today printed with a technology that's 1,000 years old. It was first developed in China 1,000 years ago. It's called screen printing. Of course, the original silk screens have been replaced with metal meshes. But nevertheless, the technology is really primitive. And so, it produces a relatively wide fingers. Now, the problem, these wide fingers is twofold. First of all, they mask a lot of the light. And secondly, they're made of silver. They must be made of silver in order to give the cells a 30-year life. And so, these wide fingers reduce the amount of light actually reaching the solar cell. And secondly, they use a lot of silver. And so, what we have developed is a very advanced printing technology that enables us, instead of having wide, thick fingers of silver, we have very narrow, highly shaped fingers, triangular shaped fingers, so they mask much less of the light. They use a lot less silver. And even the light that falls on the triangular shaped fingers gets reflected back into the cell. So, it's simultaneously increases the efficiency and reduces the cost.",

But just if we're talking about one solar panel, for example, that peoplewould recognize on their roof, in percentage terms, how much cheaper? Because we all know how expensive silver is. So, if you can use less silver, that's a good thing. But how much of a reduction in cost are we talking?",

So, this technology reduces the cost. It's the -- it's not -- the cost reduction alone, it's the cost per watt. So, it enhances the cost per watt by about 17 percent. So, it reduces the cost per watt by about 17 percent. Of course, there are additional cost to producing the panel other than the cells. So, you will never see a 17 percent reduction in the cost of the panels. And hopefully, with competition, much of this saving, which is a saving of the cell producers, will eventually be felt by the end consumers.",

Spain's Carlos Alcaraz winning the men's final of the French Open for his third Grand Slam title at the tender age of 21. The victories made him the youngest man to conquer all three tennis surfaces. Clay, grass, and hard courts. Now, despite his historic win, Alcaraz isn't the world number one at the moment. The man he beat in the semifinals, Jannik Sinner, made his debut at the top spot on Monday. Don Riddell joins us now. Don, I don't think he's too worried about that at this moment.

And it was just so wonderful to see the way he played this tournament and to see him win an event that means so much to him because so many Spanish players have triumphed at Roland Garros on the Paris clay, and he is just the latest superstar from Spain to add his name to that list. Of course, he's playing in this tournament, which could well prove to be the last time that Rafael Nadal ever plays Roland Garros. He went out in the first round. And there was Alcaraz beating Alexander Zverev, the man that knocked Nadal out. A terrific achievement. You've mentioned the fact that he's the youngest man to win on all three surfaces. He is the first man to win his first three majors on three different surfaces. Remember, the hardcourt U.S. Open two years ago, Wimbledon on grass last summer. Now, this. And he's just got, what, three weeks to turn himself around and go and try and defend his Wimbledon title in London. But as he told CNN World Sport earlier on today, he's pretty beat at the moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARLOS ALCARAZ, 2024 FRENCH OPEN CHAMPION: Honestly, first of all, I'm a (INAUDIBLE). Basically, he was really tough one. But, you know, I feel like it is a dream come true for me. I really wanted to leave this trophy one day and then be able to do it. It's a great feeling, you know. And being in the same court, in the same bench as yesterday's match, you know, it's a flashback from yesterday. It's great. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
