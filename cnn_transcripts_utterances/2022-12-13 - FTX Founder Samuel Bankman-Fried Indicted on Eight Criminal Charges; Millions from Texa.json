      "sentences": "Yes, Jim and Erica, good morning. This indictment was just unsealed moments ago. And what federal prosecutors are charging here at eight criminal counts, multiple counts of conspiracy and counts of wire fraud.What they allege here were several different schemes, one these schemes they say that Bankman-Fried had defrauded customers in this account using customer assets in the trading platform but then transferring it illegally into a hedge fund called Alameda Research that Bankman-Fried also ran. Now, this is, of course, what prosecutors say was a fraudulent scheme because the customers in the FTX trading platform did not know that their money could be used in this other way. That is one of these elements. Another allegation here is that they had defrauded lenders to that hedge fund Alameda Research by giving these lenders false information about the financial condition of that hedge fund. And they're also charged with crimes related to campaign financing, that they exceeded federal limits on how much individuals or companies could contribute to politicians and political parties, saying that they exceeded these limits and that they also had made donations in others' names, so just a real bare bones indictment, 14 counts. But what we also learned earlier today was a lot of information about what authorities think went on inside this company. We look at the civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and they get into more details of what happened with this money. They say that the investors in both FTX, the company, as well as the trading platform customers were defrauded. And just to sum up what the SEC said, they said Bankman-Fried promoted FTX as a safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform, specifically touting FTX's sophisticated, automated risk measures to protect customer assets. In reality, Bankman-Fried orchestrated a year's long fraud to conceal from FTX investors. And they say that the money that he allegedly stole from investors was used for these political donations to buy luxury real estate in the Bahamas and also $1.3 billion in loans were taken out by Bankman-Fried personally.

The bigger storm that had all of the damage that we were showing you in Parker County, that was to the west here, quite a few miles near Decatur, Texas. But this is a mess. Dallas, you're about to get it with this severe thunderstorm warning here, severe thunderstorm warning here. We don't have rotation at this point but these storms have been rotating. So, do not let your guard down. When you get the warning on your phone or you just stay away from windows, anyway, get to your safe place until this is all gone. You have got 45 minutes and this literally is over. Still a tornado watch, in effect, so these storms could spin. When they get closer to where our Derek Van Dam is right here later in the day, right there through Shreveport, that is where we are going to see the storms possibly even after dark. Days are very short this time of the year so we don't get a lot of light in the afternoon. There is the snowstorm. Here is the ice. And then this is the severe weather on the tail end of this storm. There is your blizzard warning. And it is a blizzard. I guarantee it. 39-mile-per-hour at Scottsbluff, 46 in Sidney, 46 in Rapid City. Look at the visibilities. The visibilities are in a quarter mile range, a quarter mile in Sidney, a quarter mile in Akron. Interstates are closed here.

That process alone causes this energy. And that part sounds wonderful and interesting and very cool, but the breakthrough is that they were able to produce more energy on the output than they actually put into the process. And the reason why that is so important is if you're going to have a viable source of energy, you have to have more energy on the output than on the input for creating or generating that energy.
