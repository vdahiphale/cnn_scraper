And President Joe Biden is planning a rare stop to stump for Democrats in Florida. The president has kept a relatively low profile on the campaign trail this season as his party fights to win a few crucial races in several swing states.A prominent senator was on CNN earlier this morning warning that Democrats need a messaging shift. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Is the abortion issue important? Yes. But we have also got to focus on the struggles of working people to put food on their table. I am worried about the level of voter turnout among young people and working people who will be voting Democratic. And I think, again, what Democrats have got to do is contrast their economic plan with the Republicans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So this is kind of what we've been seeing from the president. A lot of private receptions, not so many big rallies with Democratic candidates running for office and the reasons for that pretty obvious, the candidates and their campaigns are looking at the situation, and they're kind of doing a cost benefit analysis, whether it's a good idea to appear with the president given the fact that he's got the low approval ratings, the high inflation, the concerns about recessions and so on. The White House chief of staff appeared on Jake Tapper's primetime show last week and essentially was asked why the president isn't going to so many big rallies, and what he pointed out is this isn't the only president who's had trouble with the midterm elections.

He is the author of a new book called \"The Scheme: How the Right Wing Used Dark Money to Capture the Supreme Court.\" A very important topic. And Senator, thanks very much for your time. I do want to talk about the book in just a moment but first let me just -- to dovetail off of what Joe Johns was talking about a few moments ago, you know, Democrats they had this advantage in the Senate. It is so narrow, as you know, you work there, and Republicans need just a net gain of one seat to flip the chamber and you have all these Trump-friendly candidates like Herschel Walker in Georgia, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, who are polling better in these final days, this final stretch, despite some baggage weighing down their campaigns. Did you expect this and how worried are you? SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): Some baggage, my god, they've got a whole baggage train. But with overcoming that I think, Jim, is that, as NPR just reported, the Republicans are about to hit $1 billion in dark money spending more their candidates just in the Senate. Just in the Senate. So when you have that kind of an advantage, when close to 90 percent of their spending is from these big anonymous special interests, you're going to have a very powerful footprint in the media. And I think that dark money pressure in literally a billion dollars is making a big difference. As the article said, Democrats will be swamping them on the airwaves if it weren't for this billionaire, big corporation, dark money tsunami that is washing through.",

Armed individuals, we were showing this in our last hour, we want to show it to you and get your response to it.

And then you see a whole array of phony front groups come in also funded anonymously to tell the justices what to do as what are called amicus curiae, friends of the court, who just come in to file a brief but aren't proper parties.

That's damaging our national security. That's damaging our national security. And I think it's very important considering what Putin is doing today as we speak, he's doubling down on Ukraine, he's killing innocent men, women and children, and destroying that country, for the United States when our allies not to stand unified in supporting Ukraine basically would undermine our own national security in protecting democracies not only here but abroad as well.",

I think it is very important for the United States and our allies to double and triple down as well and provide the weapon systems that are absolutely essential to Ukraine to be able to defend itself. What it needs is a comprehensive air defense system similar to frankly what Israel has in the Iron Dome system.Israel's defense system can take down over 90 percent of the missiles that Hamas directs towards Israel.
