Now, this kind of contradicts claims from House Speaker Mike Johnson who said there would be legal impediments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  And in some of the states there are impediments to just switching someone out like that. Fourteen million people went through the process and chose this nominee, Joe Biden. Now, a handful of people have gotten together and decided he's no longer suitable. That's not how this system works. They are violating democratic principles. And I think that's a real problem and I think they'll be a lot said about that in the days ahead. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, his office did not respond to us when we reached out and asked exactly what he was referring to when he was speaking about these possible impediments.So, CNN -- my colleagues Daniel Dale, Casey Gannon, and I -- we reached out to all 50 states and asked election officials in those states if there is any potential problem with Harris appearing on the ballot. Now, 48 out of 50 states did respond to us and said no -- there is no issue. Let's take a listen to what some of these states said to us and how they explained why there isn't really an \"impediment\" here. For example, in Georgia, they said, \"Biden dropping out will not impact Georgia's ballots. As the Democrats haven't had a convention, there is not 'nominee' to replace.\"' And then, for example, in West Virginia. \"The candidate that will appear on West Virginia's ballot in November will be the candidate that is nominated by the DNC. Presuming that is Kamala Harris, then there will be no issues.\" Now, two states did not respond, Florida and Montana, but experts say there's no indication there would be an issue there. A reading of their rules also gives no indication that there would be any litigation. And I want to emphasize that this includes states that are considered swing states -- that had the closest margins in the last election -- like Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, and Nevada all indicating that there is no issue with Harris appearing on the ballot as long as she is the one who is nominated at the convention. But, of course, this doesn't mean that they won't file lawsuits because there is a potential political advantage to be gained by merely filing a lawsuit. That helps to sow chaos and confusion. You can even fundraise off of a lawsuit even if you are not going to ultimately win. So at this point we know that Trump allies certainly have discussed the potential legal implications of switching to Harris, but at this point it's unclear if there will be challenges. But it appears pretty clear, John, from our reporting that on this issue they would not be successful.",

They rounded up the endorsements they needed. They kind of closed off the field to others. And then, they put her out on the road and captured this incredible wave of momentum that followed this sigh of relief that the party was giving that we now have a nominee that seems really capable of prosecuting the case against Trump. And I think what you're finding is that the Trump team is definitely not ready. I mean, they have these ridiculous lawsuits. They're now saying they're not going to debate her.

And then it goes on dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. They're not going to commit to debates just yet. Of course, Obama then, this morning, goes out and endorses.

So people who might have been buying something bigger or more expensive are now -- they're all competing in the same pool for these starter homes.The pandemic -- you know, people were working from home. They were looking for more space, so that drove up the market. A lot of people were buying homes in the last four years. And then, the cost of getting into a home in general is more expensive. The Fed has been trying to fight inflation with hiking interest rates, so mortgages are a lot more costly for people these days. This has all contributed to 76 percent of people do not think it's a good time to buy a home. Very low enthusiasm out there for homeownership these days. But I think there are some signs of positivity out there. The market itself is becoming a little bit looser. There's more listings on the market this summer than there were last summer.",

But NASA and Boeing both say that they have been making progress in determining what exactly caused all of these problems with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft during this first crewed test flight.You'll remember John the issues were with two things: helium leaks and then problems with thrusters failing. So NASA and Boeing now say that while these astronauts have been up at the International Space Station, they've been conducting tests here on Earth. And they've been able to recreate the problems with the thrusters here on Earth, and that is what led them to believe that they have, indeed, found the root cause of what caused those thruster failures. And what it is is they believe that too much heat built up inside those thrusters causing the seals that seal that propellant into bolt (PH). And so that seems to be the root cause. They're getting closer to getting to a point where they feel comfortable to allow those astronauts to come home on that spacecraft. But yesterday, a top NASA manager, Steve Stich, was asked pointblank: \"Can you say definitively that this Starliner spacecraft is the one that is going to take NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home?\" Here's what he said.

I think we're starting to close in on those final pieces of the flight rationale to make sure that we can come home safely. And that's our primary focus right now.We have contingency options. We've put those in play. NASA always has contingency options. We know a little bit of what those are and we haven't worked on them a whole bunch, but we kind of know what those are.
