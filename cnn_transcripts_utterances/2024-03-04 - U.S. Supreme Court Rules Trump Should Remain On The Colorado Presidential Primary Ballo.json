      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"OneWorld\". Well, the question of whether Donald Trump can be removed from the ballot has been resolved. In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court says Trump should remain on the Colorado presidential primary ballot. Colorado Supreme Court had barred him, finding that he had taken part in an insurrection. A handful of other states issued similar rulings after that. But a majority of the Supreme Court justices said that it was not up to states to bar individuals from federal office under Section Three of the 14th Amendment, saying that that power rests with Congress. Four of the justices said that the majority went too far in outlining how an insurrectionist could be banned. Justice Amy Coney Barrett summed it up this way -- \"The court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a presidential election. Primarily in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up. For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity. All nine justices agree on the outcome of this case. That is the message Americans should take home.\" While on his Truth Social platform, Trump declared it, quote, a \"Big win for America.\" We do expect Donald Trump to speak live at any moment, and we will bring that to you when it happens. First, let's get right to CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider. So, Jessica, the specific question at hand, did the Colorado Supreme Court err in ordering President Trump excluded from the 2024 presidential ballot? Well, that, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed as yes. But from there, we see some divisions among the justices. Walk us through them.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Bianna, so all nine of the justices agreeing on that crucial question that Trump should remain onthe ballot. And the justices really stepped in at the 11th hour here, you know, one day before Super Tuesday. And they wanted to add some certainty to those voters in the 15 states headed to the polls tomorrow. So, now, those voters know that all of the justices, all nine, said that Donald Trump will be on the ballot. And if people vote for him, their votes will count. So, that was the unanimous part of this. Where there was that five-four split was in the particulars. Five of the justices here, the majority, so that's what rules, said that states can't unilaterally decide to take presidents or any federal officers off the ballot. And instead, that's a decision that Congress would have to make in the form of legislation to decide which candidates could be disqualified by the 14th Amendment so-called insurrection ban. And remember, the insurrection ban was what -- was at the heart of this case. That clause in Section Three that says any officer of the United States who engages in insurrection can be barred from holding office. It was Colorado, also Maine and Illinois that all acted via their state courts to rule that Trump should be taken off the ballot because of that clause. But now the Supreme Court stepping in to say that a state cannot decide who is on or off the ballot in federal elections. We saw Donald Trump already weighing in on this, saying it's a big win for America. But on the flip side, the Colorado Secretary of State, Jenna Griswold, she really spoke out with disdain on social media. She says she's disappointed. And then she continued to argue this, saying that \"Colorado should be able to bar oath-breaking insurrectionists from our ballot.\" So, Bianna, the unanimous decision from the Supreme Court saying that Trump should be on the ballot, it draws all kinds of reactions. But really the takeaway is that Trump will be on all the primary ballots moving forward. And crucially, you know, there's no question that if he is the Republican nominee that he will be on the general election ballot. That was something that was really hanging in the balance before this decision from the Supreme Court. So, the justices, all nine of them, deciding this narrow issue, keeping Trump on the ballot. Bianna, what they didn't address was what the courts in Colorado had ruled, that Trump engaged in insurrection. That really wasn't something that was part of the arguments either. So the justices really just steering clear of that, not even getting into that issue, only the issue of whether Trump can appear on the ballot, saying that, yes, he can and will. Bianna.",

AndI got the sense during that time that this decision was really foreshadowed. The reason being, the court was very, very focused on whether or not states actually had the right and ability under the Constitution to take an action like this when it relates to a federal office. The questions were so focused on that. The other piece of this, and this is where the majority of the court goes a step further, they say that Congress actually has to act. They have to have -- pass some sort of law or legislation that would allow this particular type of action to be taken, taking off the ballot from the federal level. So, all of that was really foreshadowed. We heard these arguments about whether or not the Constitution in this sense, this section, was self-effectuating. And that's really where the decision lies here, that the court really found that the states don't have that power and that the Congress would actually have to act in order to take action.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, let me just read for our viewers some of the decision from the majority here, and that is, \"The Constitution empowers Congress toprescribe how these determinations should be made. The relevant provision is Section Five which enables Congress, subject of course to judicial review, to pass appropriate legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment. We conclude that states may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office, but states have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section Three with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency.\" So, we have that. Then we hear sort of a dissenting take from the minority here. Four other justices, we showed our viewers what Justice Amy Coney Barrett had to say, where she said, \"I agree that the states lack the power to enforce Section Three against presidential candidates. That principle is sufficient to resolve this case, and I would decide no more than that.\" Then you have the three liberal justices, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson, writing that, \"The majority went further than necessary to decide the case.\" They wrote, \"To allow Colorado to take a presidential candidate off the ballot under Section Three would imperil the framers' vision of a federal government directly responsible to the people. The court should have started and ended its opinion with this conclusion.\" What do you make of their disagreement here in terms of how the majority went one step further in their decision?",

However, what the three justicesare arguing in their opinion is that the majority went a step too far, and going a step too far, and by saying that, in order for any action to be taken under this insurrection ban section of the Constitution, that legislation must be passed, that Congress has to act. Now, the reason that the judges are at odds with that is because they say that closes the door to any other kind of federal-level enforcement. So, saying the states don't have the ability to act in this manner with a federal office, everyone was good on that point. But taking it a step further and basically saying there'd be no avenue to approach this without some sort of legislation from Congress, the three justices disagree with that. They say it shuts the door and it overly protects Donald Trump because it does not leave a path to pursue anything under that insurrection section of the Constitution.",

He is also slated to meet with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. And officials have said there's reporting from our colleagues, that Israeli officials have said that Benny Gantz is not representing the Israeli government while he is part of this trip. Our colleague Alex Marquardt reported that Israel's ambassador to the U.S. was told not to participate in these meetings between Gantz and various U.S. officials, and it does come at a time when the U.S. has been ramping up pressure on Israel, specifically when it comes to trying to ease the humanitarian situation in Gaza. You heard Vice President Kamala Harris there speaking quite forcefully about the situation on the ground, saying that people were starving and facing inhumane conditions, and it's the belief of the Biden administration that Israel needs to do more to get additional humanitarian aid into Gaza. She said yesterday that there's no excuse for this, that President Biden has also said that Israel needs to have more aid trucks going in, open more routes for that assistance to get in, and the U.S. has done some work as well, very small work in trying to airdrop some food to people in the region. But it also comes as the U.S. is pressing for this temporary ceasefire of about six weeks to get that humanitarian aid in, but also to get the hostages out. The U.S. officials have been working around the clock. There are currently talks underway in Cairo to see if they can reach some type of agreement. The President had been hopeful that today would be the day that they would have some type of deal when it came to this latest push for a ceasefire, but so far that has not come to fruition. So, this is something that the administration has been pushing for quite some time. And just yesterday you really heard the Vice President speaking, making one of the most forceful cases for this for an immediate ceasefire of a temporary nature so far of this administration. Of course, this comes as they're not just dealing with this conflict overseas, but also the domestic pressure here at home. President Biden has been pressed to act trying to get a full ceasefire in Gaza. That is something that so far the White House has resisted calling for, but we've heard from wings, elements of the Democratic Party who are frustrated with the President for the way that he's approached this conflict, for the way that he's supported Netanyahu as he wages this military campaign against Gaza. So, what we've been hearing from White House officials, from the President on down over the course of the past few weeks is really trying to push for this temporary ceasefire. They had hoped by Ramadan, which is set to begin on Sunday. Right now, it's entirely unclear whether they'll be able to make that timeline.",

And there are a lot of these voters inthe Republican primary and Republican caucuses that are going to the exit posters and saying not only are they voting for someone else, but they're not going to vote for him if he is the nominee. He's got a fractured party. The Republican National Committee is out of money. His campaign is having to buy furniture at yard sales. So, I think this idea that he has all this momentum is kind of misguided. He's going to be the nominee because he's getting more votes within the primary, but I don't believe he has anywhere near the momentum that Joe Biden does, who's gotten 97 percent of the vote in South Carolina, 80 percent of the vote in Michigan, and got 64 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, and he wasn't even on the ballot.",

It happened in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023, and 2024 in the New York Three Congressional District. I thought that race was a perfect example of how, you know, going into that, the pollsters and the pundits said that would be a toss-up race. Tom Suozzi won by eight percentage points, and he ran on the Biden agenda. In fact, he ran on the President's bipartisan border deal, went on offense on the border where everybody says that we're on defense. So, I think what we should look at is election results instead of polls, and the election results, we're winning, and Donald Trump, MAGA, and Republicans are losing.",

March is going to be our time to make that choice crystal clear. So I'm not even saying that I would buy that argument, but let's, for the sake of this question, say that, yes, they weren't aware, and now they are. Given that, and given what's at stake in this pivotal month, according to his own campaign official, what does the President need to do to reverse things, to really have voters focus in on what he calls accomplishments in his administration, starting off from what we're expected to hear Thursday at the State of the Union?",

A lot of people know about his legal troubles, and I think a lot of people don't believe that he is going to be the nominee facing Joe Biden. And we've always believed, from the DNC and the campaign, we've always believed when the American public is aware that the choice, again, is Joe Biden, with what he's accomplished, and Donald Trump, who is worse than the person that they voted out of office in 2020, that the election will turn in our favor. Look, I think what the President needs to do is, first of all, he needs to be as he has been and he's been the President. I mean, we've seen the strongest economic recovery in the entire world since COVID.  We have the best unemployment -- the most steady unemployment below four percent since the 1960s. Inflation is starting to come down. Gas prices are around $3 a gallon. So, I think that first and foremost, he needs to continue to be a good president. We've seen consumer confidence is moving up.

I do want to bring in Attorney Misty Marris to talk about some of the legal issues that he touched upon. And Misty, he started by praising the Supreme Court decision that would allow him to stay on the ballot in Colorado, though he did say that an opponent would like to have it not be that way, that Biden somehow brought this case. That is just not true. The case was brought by six Colorado voters. But he quickly turned the conversation to what we are expecting to be a much more significant decision by the Supreme Court, and that is one of presidential immunity. The former President was granted a win just in the fact that this will delay whatever trial may happen if, in fact, they do rule that a President is not immune from any liability and any legal action. That having been said, if you could break down what you heard from him, because it seems like his interpretation of the risks at hand, if the Supreme Court does not rule in his favor on immunity, are not exactly accurate.",
