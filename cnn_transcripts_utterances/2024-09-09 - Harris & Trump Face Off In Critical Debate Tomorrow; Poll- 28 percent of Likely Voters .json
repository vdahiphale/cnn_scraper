      "sentences": "Today on INSIDE POLITICS, great expectations. We are just 33 hours away from Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, meeting face to face for the first and potentially only time before votes are cast. We're going to break down how the candidates are preparing for the debate, showdown tomorrow night.Plus, mind games. The Harris campaign is clearly trying to get into Donald Trump's head, releasing a new ad featuring his former vice president, defense secretary, and national security adviser, all explaining why they think their old boss is unfit for a second term. And Melania speaks. We hear but don't see the former first lady in a new video promoting her memoir, while claiming there are, quote, \"efforts to silence her husband.\" Could this be a sign of more campaign comments or even appearances to come? Or is this just a clever marketing tool for her upcoming book? We're also going to give you an update on breaking news from across the pond regarding the health of Catherine, Princess of Wales. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and INSIDE POLITICS. First up, debates matter. We all saw it 74 days ago right here on CNN when one debate completely upended this presidential race and the stakes are just as high, in different ways, for tomorrow night, because in some states, early voting starts in just 11 days, which means that debate stage will likely be the candidate's last chance to make their case to those all-important undecided voters. It will also be the first time Donald Trump and Kamala Harris meet, literally. The Vice President talked about the big night in a taped interview with the Rickey Smiley morning show that aired earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE (via telephone): He plays from this really old and tired playbook, right, where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go and we should be prepared for that. We should be prepared for the fact that he is not burdened by telling the truth. And we should be prepared for the fact that he is probably going to speak a lot of untruth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Dana, there is no doubt there will be a global audience on this debate, but it is the voters here in Pennsylvania, really across the commonwealth, that are perhaps the most important audience of all here as Vice President Harris and Donald Trump do have their very first meeting.We know that because look at the spending. There is no battleground state that has seen more advertising, spending some $157 million. Democrats have a slightly edge on that, but Republicans also spending more than 70 million here. So look, the backdrop of this is a very, very tight race. The Vice President has been preparing all weekend long for five days in Pittsburgh, the western part of the state. I'm told she has one objective overall to still introduce herself to some voters who may be exhausted at the notion of a second Donald Trump presidency, but also who are not sure about her. So to fill in some of those gaps and also to be seen as the candidate of change. For Donald Trump, of course, he wants to tie her to the Biden administration. So talking to voters as they begin to tune in, there's a bit of a sense of exhaustion as well. Of course, they've been living and breathing this debate for a very long time on television with candidate visits. But the head to head contest tomorrow evening in Philadelphia here certainly is likely one of the biggest final moments of this debate. So voters certainly will be tuning in, paying attention because they know that once they vote, they can tune out some of those advertisements that have just been deluging them here. But there is no doubt a big moment. And the slice of undecided voters, they are still out there. Sometimes they seem as though they're unicorns. They are out there. So that is what both Harris and Trump are going after tomorrow night, Dana.",

We were joking, like, who are the 9 percent who don't know all about Donald Trump? Kamala Harris makes a little bit more sense since she's a relatively new candidate at the top of the ticket.Manu, I do want to talk about the way Donald Trump has been preparing for this debate, not so much about the mechanics of it and the informality of it and all of the things that we have told, but what he is saying on the stump and on his social media platform. He's going back to election denialism, threatening voters -- excuse me, threatening poll workers, both past and present and future, talking about mail-in ballots being fraudulent, which I'm sure that really thrills the people who are trying to win Pennsylvania for him. But then also this truth, cease and desist. I, together with many attorneys and legal scholars, am watching the sanctity of the 2024 presidential election very closely because I know better than most the rampant cheating skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 presidential election. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, prosecuted at levels unfortunately never seen before in our country. If I'm a swing voter -- well, first of all, we should also say, just for the record, there is no evidence that what he said is true. It went through in 2020. All of the courts, including Trump appointed judges, they did not see any evidence, nor is there evidence yet that anything that he is suggesting will happen, will in this election. But going back to sort of the politics of this particular argument, do you know any swing voters who hear this and say, oh, OK, so I better vote for Donald Trump?",

I mean, this is the reason why that Harris wanted the microphones unmuted, because he could say things like this and pop off in ways that will make him look unelectable to a lot of voters who want to move on past the 2020 elections. The challenge for Trump is going to try to make Harris look like someone who's going to be a continuation of the last several years and that he can actually represent a serious change to something completely, totally different.Because voters in that New York Times CNN poll made clear they are tired of the status quo. They're tired of -- 61 percent want to break from Joe Biden, but they don't necessarily want to go back to all the chaos from the Trump years and all the things that he's been saying. So can Harris draw out Trump to say things like that that will undercut his credibility in the eyes of those swing voters? That is something that Joe Biden was not able to do in the last debate where Harris wants to change.",

And really, this debate could be the one that could actually change the dynamic or maybe we'll be back where it is.What will be interesting, and when you're talking to Democrats in particular, how much does she want to make this race an issue about Donald Trump's character, which you saw that ad that was played going with his former Trump officials questioning, saying that he should not be president again. Democrats believe focusing mostly on -- making it focused on Donald Trump's character. Trump falling into some of those traps, making it about himself saying things about the past, election stolen and like, could it change the dynamic and could disqualify him, for a lot of those suburban voters in those very battleground states where it says is essentially tied.",

You saw that happen -- go back to the 2018 Georgia governor primary there, where Stacey Abrams was running against a white woman who was more liberal than her on the issues. But Stacey Abrams, as the black woman, got raided by a lot of voters as the more liberal candidate in the race.So Harris has to push back on that. But I think that that's part of why she has not been focusing or even really talking about herself as a woman or as a black candidate. You're not going to see that out of her in the debate tomorrow. She wants to, as I said, talk about things that she wants to do for the middle class, talk about ways that she can project strength, what she wants to do on the world stage, what she wants to do in fighting for Americans. And at the same time, again, highlight these things that Trump has said and let him continue to say them. I think, honestly, if we were to have Joe Biden read the transcript of what Donald Trump said at the rally that he had in Wisconsin over the weekend, that we would think that he had completely lost it.
