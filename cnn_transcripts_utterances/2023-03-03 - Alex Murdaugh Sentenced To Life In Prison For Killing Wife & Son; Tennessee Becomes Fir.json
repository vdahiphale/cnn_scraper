In the end, it was Paul's video, that video we have talked so much about, the one that he recorded of his friend's dog just minutes before the state says that he was murdered, that captured his father's voice at the kennels. And we heard witness after witness identify Alex. That made Alex Murdaugh get on the stand and admit to the jury that his alibi was a lie. That there, the juror says, was what convinced him of his guilt. But he also said Alex's testimony, which, by many attorneys, was praised because of his skill in a courtroom, his ability to sit there for 14 hours and talk about all of this, the juror said he didn't buy any of it.

JUSTIN BAMBERG (D-SC): Well, honestly, I was surprised the jury came back that fast. I'm not surprised by the verdict. I was thinking that we would still be here about this time today waiting on the jury to give us their decision. But Judge Newman did what I thought he was going to do and he basically fried Alex Murdaugh like a catfish. Two consecutive life sentences send a very, very strong message. Alex Murdaugh was a black eye to our community. He was a blackeye to the legal profession. And he was a black eye in the courtroom because, even with his life and other people getting answers on the line, he still lied to everybody, the jury included.",

So this legislation - and I'm talking about the drag bill first. The sponsor says it's not targeting drag performers. It's not banning public drag performances. Instead - and I wrote this down - \"making sure children are not present at sexually explicit performances.\" \"Sexually explicit\" has a legal definition from the Department of Justice.
