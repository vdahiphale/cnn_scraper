      "sentences": "Breaking news tonight, Donald Trump and Elon Musk sink a spending deal that now puts America 48 hours away from a government shutdown. The question, of course, is there any way out of it?Plus, the student and teacher killed in the Wisconsin school shooting have been identified, as police now say the shooter had not one, but two guns. The student whose locker was next to the shooter joins me to tell us all about the shooter. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" Tonight, Congress is scrambling to come up with a brand-new deal to keep the government open past this coming Friday. It seems like we've been here time and time again, haven't we? Except this time, it's different. That's because a bipartisan agreement that appeared to be a done deal just 24 hours ago is now sitting on the scrap heap. So, how did it get there? Well, thanks to a full-on assault from President-elect Donald Trump, who's not even in the White House yet the word president-elect, right? And the man he is tasked to slash government spending with the DOGE, Elon Musk. The momentum against the agreement started to grow once Musk began attacking it on X about, what, 19 hours ago? This is one of his first posts: A picture of the 1,547-page behemoth negotiated by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Musk's message? Ever seen a bigger piece of pork? He went on to rail against the bill in a flurry of posts. Dozens and dozens of them, I mean. He urged Republicans to ditch the deal and wrote that any lawmaker who supports it should be voted out of Congress. Cue the GOP pylon. Several Republicans posted their own opposition to the agreement. And then by late afternoon, Trump himself publicly weighed in. He released a statement, along with J.D. Vance, trashing the bill for what they call -- quote -- \"Democrat giveaways\" and demanding an increase to the debt limit before he's inaugurated a little more than 30 days from now. Well, Trump echoed Musk with his own threat, saying any Republican who doesn't address the debt limit before he takes office will be primaried. Now, a short time after that, GOP leadership declared the funding plan was dead. So now, Congress has two days to come up with a solution. That means Speaker Johnson has to come up with something that Trump would be happy with. He's got to wrangle Republicans in open revolt, and he's got to make sure that he has enough votes to get it all through in 48 hours. A tall order? Joining me now, T.W. Arrighi, vice president of Push Digital Group and former communications aide to Lindsey Graham and Mike Pompeo, Mychael Schnell, congressional reporter for \"The Hill,\" And Ameshia Cross, Democratic strategist and former Obama campaign adviser. Good to have you all here. Mychael, let me begin with you. You and I have talked about this impending deadline for quite some time. There was confidence that it would never get to the point of a shutdown. They had the principle. Now, it's the details to be ironed out. Now, that's all gone. Where did the opposition come from? Was it really all just Elon Musk?",

There are issues with the debt ceiling, also legitimate. When you put a bill this size together, there are proposals written by junior staffers that get in there that are junk.

I think that what Democrats are doing now that's different than what they did in previous years, as you know, we've hit this funding cliff multiple times at this point, is that they are not willing to bail out the Republicans.So, at the end of the day, if an agreement is not reached and the government does shut down, they are not willing to -- they are not willing to cast their votes to try to save it. I think that, at this point, it is also Republicans will have to own it. Congressional Republicans will have to own the fallout. They will have to own things related to holiday travel. When it comes to the FAA, they will have to own things related to, you know, Social Security checks, SSI not getting to people. They will have to own military benefits. They will have to own all of these things that could hinge on falling apart should this not happen. And I do think that it was an expansive C.R., and it was expansive because it answered a lot of the things that Americans want. Whether we're talking about expanded healthcare benefits, whether they were talking about issues with higher education, there were things in here that were helpful to the American public. And Elon Musk has an outsized role in an administration that hasn't even started yet, even though he does not actually have a congressionally-approved role or a Senate-approved role. DOGE is a made-up entity. And at the end of the day, this is a guy who stands the most to gain from government contracts, mind you, an oligarch in and of himself, who funneled over $200 million into republican candidacies in the last election cycle. He is more than willing to hold Republicans hostage to get what he wants out of this because he holds the purse strings.",

Because of the nature of these negotiations and bipartisanship, Democrats got a number of wins in that legislation. Full federal funding for the rebuilding of the Key Bridge, a number of some health provisions, right? They're celebrating some ideas there. So, they're okay with that.But if you talk to some conservative Republicans, it depends, because A, on one hand, this is better than what it's called the sprawling omnibus, which is a whole of government legislation that is typically crammed in at the end of the year. That is a massive bill that folks get a little time to review and then have to vote on. So, this is absolutely smaller than an omnibus, but it's still sprawling. So, it depends on who you ask. But again, this is sort of the nature of what happens when you have some of these must pass pieces of legislation. They give these lawmakers leverage to try to get their policy priorities in there, not to mention this is the last one of the 118th Congress. So, lawmakers are trying to get anything they can into that bill to let it ride to the White House in their last-ditch effort in the 118th Congress.",

And with search warrants, with subpoenas, they were able to get the I.D., the user I.D.Not to mention, I believe he was already reportedly reaching out on social media regarding this and putting out the supposed manifesto. Thus, it gave it a little bit easier for investigators to identify him, to locate him, and to interview him. Now, Madison, Wisconsin is the lead investigation, so the FBI is assisting this. So, all their interview is all supporting the Madison investigation.

And I think that is not what Americans expect. We do not believe that someone on the way from church to the job should be stopped or pulled over while they're trying to pick up their kids.

Those are kids who have been working, supporting our city. That particular individual got citizenship and joined the U.S. Army to give back to this country.
