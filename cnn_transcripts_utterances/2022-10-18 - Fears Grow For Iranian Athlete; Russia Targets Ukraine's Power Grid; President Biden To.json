      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Ana Cabrera in New York. Thanks for being with us.Three weeks until the midterm elections, and President Biden is seizing on abortion rights to rally Democrats. But it is still the economy that tops voters' list of priorities by a long shot. And on that front, a new forecast today says a recession is coming and that it will look a lot like the one that turned the phrase, it's the economy, stupid, into political gospel. Let's discuss all of this. CNN's M.J. Lee is live at the White House, Abby Phillip is in Washington, and Matt Egan is here in New York. M.J., we know the economy blows away all others as the top issue going into midterms. So why is this, abortion rights, the focus for the president today? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ana, I think this White House would certainly argue that this isn't the president focusing on abortion issues over the economy. I think they would say that they have been very focused on both issues, but that, yes, today was the day when he wanted to take the opportunity to make a big political speech to talk about this issue that is certainly very divisive, but that they also know has been very politically salient. It is no surprise, of course -- we have been reporting on this -- just how much the White House and Democrats in Washington have really seized on this issue ever since the Supreme Court earlier this year overturned Roe v. Wade. And now that we are just three weeks out from the midterms, yes, this is an issue that they feel confident will hopefully help them galvanize and mobilize their base and their supporters. But I do think a healthy dose of a reality check is really important here on one of the things that we heard the president make a promise on, and that was that he would try to codify Roe v. Wade in the new Congress. And there are just so many caveats that go into this, right, for Democrats? One, they would need to keep the House. That is going to be a very challenging thing to do. They will need to expand their majority in the Senate. That's also an uphill battle. And then they would need to change the filibuster rules and make sure that there is a majority in the Senate that actually supports and votes to codify Roe v. Wade. So all of these things are actually going to be pretty challenging in the big picture. But, again, I think that this White House is cognizant that this can be an issue that can rally the base. But, at the same time, I think what you laid out about the economy being the top, number one issue for voters right now, the White House is certainly aware of that reality as well, Ana.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is really a base turnout strategy at this point.We are three weeks until the election. A lot of Americans already have the opportunity to vote. And President Biden's job right now is to bring up the level of enthusiasm among Democrats by talking about an issue that is particularly salient to Democratic-leaning voters. And so that's about half of the strategy in a midterm cycle is to get your base as high as they possibly can be in terms of turnout, while also dealing on the persuasion side of things. And when it comes to the economy, I think that's where the persuasion piece is a little bit more salient. In order to get independent voters out to vote, they're going to have to address concerns that they have about the economy, and, frankly, about Biden's own leadership during this economic period of time, and what Democrats have done with power in Washington. But it doesn't surprise me at all that, at this particular moment, what Biden is doing is talking to the true believers and telling them that, if they come out to vote, if they cast a ballot, that he will continue to fulfill the promises, frankly, that he has made to them when he ran in 2020 and also as president. CABRERA:  Republicans clearly see the economy as an opening. Here's what we heard from them in some battleground debates last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J.D. VANCE (R), OHIO SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I really wished Tim Ryan had stood up to his party on this vote, because it might have made the inflation crisis we have been seeing over the last few months a lot better if he hadn't done what he always does, which is vote with Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden 100 percent of the time. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  Georgians should know that my desire is to continue to help them fight through 40-year high inflation and high gas prices and other things that our Georgia families are facing right now, quite honestly, because of bad policies in Washington, D.C., from President Biden and the Democrats that have complete control.

They're talking about transportation investments. They're talking about the Inflation Reduction Act, which, while it doesn't have a huge effect on inflation in the moment, down the road, some of those provisions could impact inflation in the long term. But you're hearing them talk about those very discrete issues, not really talking about this sort of, like, macro picture of inflation being, as you heard the Republicans say, at 40-year highs. But Republicans have an easier task here. They don't really have to present a plan to combat inflation. They can just say that Democrats' policies have created this problem. And voters will have to sort out whether that is a good enough contrast for them, the choice between what Democrats are saying and what Republicans -- Republicans are playing the blame game, not really presenting much in the way of actual policies in the future.",

The silver lining, though, is that they are not projecting an economic meltdown. They're forecasting a mild recession, like the one that began in the summer of 1990. And there are some similarities between today and 1990. Just like then, the Fed is raising rates rapidly. There's a war-fueled oil shock and consumer confidence is low. There's also some key differences, though. Unemployment is very low today, at -- tied for the lowest level since 1969. The U.S. economy is, of course, still recovering from COVID. And, if anything, the Federal Reserve is even more aggressive today, raising interest rates very rapidly. And I think it's that last point, Ana, that has everyone's so nervous. We just don't know how this is going to play out when the Fed is so focused on inflation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, for so much of this presidency, this White House has had to contend with ongoing warnings about the possibility of a recession. And for the most part, White House officials here, including the president, of course, has said we don't think that it's going to happen.Last week, interestingly, we of course, saw the president open the door just a little bit to that possibility. He said that, even if there was a recession, it would only be a slight recession and that, again, he doesn't predict that that is going to happen. Ana, I think that the White House right now is in a bit of a tricky position, because even just until a few weeks ago, we saw them feeling pretty confident about what kind of economic message they could give to the American people. They had a number of big legislative accomplishments. They were seeing gas prices consistently falling. And now gas prices are no longer consistently falling. We have a number of economic reports that indicate that inflation remains such a stubborn problem for people across the country. And so we are seeing this White House really try to juggle and showcase some of their big accomplishments on the economic front, but also really acknowledged that this is an issue that they have to deal with, whether it's gas prices or just high prices overall. And as my colleague Phil Mattingly reported today, this is a part of the reason why we are expecting to see the president announce another 14 million barrels of oil released from the Strategic Reserve. This is something that the White House and this administration has tapped before, and they are hoping that it could make the difference. But as you know very well, these things take a lot of time. CABRERA:  Yes, Matt, what kind of impact could that new release of oil have? Can the U.S. also keep dipping into that reserve?",

There was a lot of attention being paid to the voting rules in Georgia, voting rights, whether people were being disenfranchised, whether they would face obstacles to voting. And every time that I spoke to activists down there, voters down in Georgia, people were incredibly determined to get out to vote, no matter what. And I think that is what we are seeing here. People understand how important the gubernatorial race is, the Senate race especially is for the balance of power in Washington. They also probably understand that that is a race that might not end on Election Day. There is a run-off process in Georgia. So I think Georgia voters, they have now been in the eye of the storm. This is their second cycle. And I think that they understand their role in the process, and they're showing up to vote. I think it really says more about the voters than it does about anything as it pertains to the rules related to voting. It just shows that, when voters are ready to show up and vote, they will overcome whatever is in front of them in order to do that. And they will do it early too. I think Americans, by and large, have shown they want to be able to vote early and on their time. And that's what's happening in Georgia.",

As men -- as many men and soldiers and service men and women as can be thrown at the fight, they will slug it out in the battlefield. Well, Putin's losing them. So he is turning this war of attrition to the electricity supply, as you say, at a critical time, just coming up to winter. And he is using different tactics. He's using these Iranian-made drones. Russian says they're not Iranian-made, but there's -- Ukraine certainly believes they are. The United States certainly believes there are, these Ukrainian-made -- Iranian-made drones to target cities around the country. Kyiv yesterday, 28 drones, 24 of them shot down. But, today, Putin mixed it up over Kyiv. He used missiles to hit the power-producing facilities here. So you have parts of the city here tonight without electricity, without water. That's replicated, as you were saying, big numbers across the country. The power -- the guys who sort of repair and fix the power grid reckon that the damage that's been caused, most cases, they can repair it within about 48 hours. But Russia knows really well how the power- generating facilities here work. They're Soviet-made. They're cut-and- paste, the same system, the same factory layouts as they have in mainland Russia here in Ukraine. So Russia knows just how to target them, so absolutely a war of attrition, but some help may be at hand. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has just announced in the last few hours that NATO is going to send hundreds, hundreds of drone jammers to Ukraine in the next couple of days, and that could give some respite to some cities. But it seems that Putin is set on this course of targeting the power.",

Now, of course, it's mandatory for all Iranian female athletes to wear the headscarf when they're competing outside Iran. And a lot of people took this to mean that she was taking part in the protest back in the country, because we're not only seeing women leading protests, taking part in these demonstrations, Ana. What we're seeing is a lot of women with these individual acts of defiance in Iran, walking on the streets without their headscarves, standing up to the morality police. So a lot of people thought that that's what she was doing. And then a lot of reports started circulating that she might be in trouble. IranWire, that's a new site based outside of Iran that is very critical of the Iranian regime. They allege, according to their sources, that she was going to be transferred to prison as soon as she arrives in Iran. We can't confirm this information. The Iranian Embassy in Seoul put out a statement on their Twitter account, basically denying this, saying that she was on her way back to Iran with the rest of her teammates. And they say -- quote -- \"They strongly deny all fake, false news and disinformation.\" We also saw this Instagram Story posted on Elnaz Rekabi's account. We don't know the circumstances under which that was posted. But, in it, she says that she was unexpectedly called to climb the wall. And she says: \"I inadvertently created a problem with my head covering.\" And she apologized for the concern that she created. And she said that her return back to Iran was part of a predetermined schedule. This is doing very little to reassure people who are very concerned about her safety. And I can tell you, Ana, all eyes right now are on Tehran, where she's expected to land in the coming hours to see what happens after she gets back home.",
