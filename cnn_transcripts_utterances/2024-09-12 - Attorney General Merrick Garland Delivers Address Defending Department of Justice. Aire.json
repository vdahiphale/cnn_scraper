Of course, Trump is alleging all of this while vowing to jail his political enemies if he wins reelection. I want to bring in our senior law enforcement analyst, the former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Andrew, thanks very much for joining us. Set the scene for us. This is going to be a major speech by Merrick Garland. I don't think it's going to be very long, but he's clearly going to be addressing the threats made by Donald Trump. And I think he's beginning to speak right now. So let's listen in. Oh, that's actually tape we're looking at. So, go ahead, Andrew. Give us your sense of why the attorney general has decided to make this address.",

But is there any doubt in your mind, Andrew, that the attorney general has decided to deliver this major speech right now because of all of the threats coming from Donald Trump about the Department of Justice, about the people who work there, saying that they unfairly targeted him for various prosecution?",

      "sentences": "No doubt whatsoever, Wolf. That is where these threats are coming from.It all emanates primarily from Donald Trump, but also then is reverberated and echoed by his supporters, particularly his supporters on the Hill. Republican politicians on the Hill have picked up this mantle from Donald Trump and carried it in a way that is abusive and destructive to the Department of Justice. That is exactly who he's addressing here. He may not use their names, but that is who he's talking about. It's this kind of pressure, these attacks and accusations of weaponization. That's exactly what he's talking about here. We have a committee on the Hill, in the House, to address the weaponization of the Department of Justice, which is an absolute falsehood. It's nonsense. But that's how actively Donald Trump and his acolytes have engaged in this campaign to try to break the will of the Department of Justice. And Merrick Garland is going to try to turn that around this morning. BLITZER:  Yes, I suspect you're right. He will clearly be addressing all the threats coming from Donald Trump, but I also suspect he won't mention Trump's -- Trump by name in going after him, but it'll be clear who the target of this speech is. I want to read to you parts -- a little part of the speech. The Department of Justice released an advanced text, at least of some excerpts. This is what the attorney general, Merrick Garland, is going to say. Actually, I'm not going to say it now, because he's about to speak. Let's listen in. He's walking up to the microphone right now, the attorney general of the United States, Merrick Garland. (APPLAUSE) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE:  Hello, everyone. Thank you, Dawn, for that overly generous introduction. (LAUGHTER)",

      "sentences": "The purpose of those principles, as we wrote in the preface, was -- quote -- \"to promote the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority and contribute to the fair, even-handed administration of the federal criminal laws\" -- close quote.Much of that document is devoted to giving guidance to prosecutors about which factors they should consider in a multitude of situations, from initiating prosecution to selecting charges, disclosing exculpatory information, entering into plea agreements, and making sentencing recommendations. But the core of the principles is its directive about which factors an attorney for the government may not consider. In the words of that document -- quote -- \"The attorney for the government may not be influenced by a person's race, religion, gender, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, or -- or political association, activities, or beliefs, by the attorney's own personal feelings concerning the person, the person's associates, or the victim, or by the possible effect of the decision the attorney's own professional or personal circumstances.\" This provision of the principles ends with an admonition -- quote -- \"Federal prosecutors and agents may never make a decision regarding an investigation or prosecution for the purpose of affecting any election or the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.\" In short, we must treat like cases alike. There is not one rule for friends and another for foes, one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless, one rule for the rich and another for the poor, one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans, or different rules depending on one's race or ethnicity. To the contrary, we have only one rule. We follow the facts and apply the law in a way that respects the Constitution and protects civil liberties. Over the past 3.5 years, I have spoken to you often about the importance of these norms. I know that, to many outside of this department, they may seem abstract or even inconsequential. They are anything but. And they must not be taken for granted. For us, adhering to these policies, principles and norms in everything we do is how we fulfill the promise that is foundational to our democracy, that all people will be protected equally under the law and that all people will be held accountable equally under the law. Our norms are a promise that we will fiercely protect the independence of this department from political interference in our criminal investigations. Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this department to be used as a political weapon. And our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics. (APPLAUSE)",

      "sentences": "... and defending the extraordinary people who work here.I came back to DOJ as attorney general believing that our norms are some of the most powerful tools we have to ensure our adherence to the rule of law. Having now served as attorney general for the past 3.5 years, I continue to believe deeply that our norms matter now more than ever to our department and to our democracy. I also believe now more than ever that the most important resources the Justice Department has are the dedication and integrity of the people who work here. As we wrote in the preface to the first edition of the \"Principles of Federal Prosecution\" -- quote -- \"Important though these principles are to the proper operation of our federal prosecutorial system, the success of that system must rely ultimately on the character, integrity, sensitivity, and competence of those men and women who are selected to represent the public interest in the federal criminal justice process. It is with their efforts that the purposes of these principles will be achieved\" -- close quote. I know that many of you have heard me talk about why the work of the Justice Department is so important to me personally. I have often shared that I wanted to give back to the country and to the system of laws that took my grandparents in and protected them when they had nowhere else to go. That protection is what distinguishes America from so many other countries. The protection of law, the rule of law is the foundation of our system of government. Our democracy relies on an independent law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice, to ensure those protections. And, critically, our democracy depends on people who dedicate themselves and their careers to ensuring those protections, people like all of you. Protecting the rule of law is the obligation of every generation of public servants at the United States Department of Justice. In this time and place, that responsibility is yours and it is mine. I know we are up to it. I am grateful to each of you for your commitment to this department, to the norms that sustain it, and to the people we all serve. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)",

Evan, this is -- I think it is pretty extraordinary that he was delivering this speech clearly designed to go after Trump and Trump allies who have been really bitter in condemning the Department of Justice, sometimes calling it the Department of Injustice. He never mentioned Trump by name. He never mentioned other Trump allies by name, but, clearly, that was the attack that he was launching.",
