So, we feel as though we're in a really good position. And I will tell you -- for all that gets thrown at Donald Trump, I will tell you he's leading, as you know, in almost all the battleground states, in fact, in all the battleground states, including Wisconsin right now.

Orban can be a conduit to Putin. It's a very disturbing prediction, I think, of troubles for NATO generally and troubles for Ukraine specifically.

Notwithstanding, I see a lot of commentary by media reporters that they thought he did well on the substance. I didn't think so.When he had a question from David Sanger on what the U.S. Could do about China-Russia relations to keep them from growing closer together, which they are at a very rapid rate, Biden responded with an essentially incoherent string of words after some time, and I don't have a transcript in front of me. I haven't found one yet. But after some time, Sanger intervened again and said, well, what about dealing with the Russia-China connection, indicating that that Biden hadn't gotten to the answer. And then there were more words, and it just drifted off. He gave basically, another incoherent answer about Ukraine arms the U.S. was providing and restrictions that were put on the use that Ukraine could make of them. I mean, I don't -- I think if it were not for the catastrophic debate performance, people would have said this was not another good event for President Biden. And, you know, other comments that I saw about it said, well, this Joe Biden rambles all the time. That's just typical Joe Biden. Which sounds a little bit like Trump supporters who -- when Trump says, I only want to be a dictator on day one, the supporters say, don't worry about that. That's just Trump. Well, that's just Trump's not a good answer. And that's just Biden is not a good answer either.",

AT&amp;T revealed this morning that it learned in April of an illegal download of data of a third-party platform. The company says they immediately launched an investigation and they learned that a ton of data was exposed, including data on records of calls and text messages on \"nearly all cell phone customers between May and the end of October of 2022.\"Unfortunately, millions of non-AT&amp;T customers are caught up in this too, because the company says that the stolen data included customers of wireless providers that use its network and people who were called or texted by AT&amp;T customers. So, that is, of course, the wireless network pretty massive. Now, it's important to note that AT&amp;T says at this time it does not believe this data is publicly available. Emphasis on at this time. Thankfully, AT&amp;T says the content of text messages and calls, that was not stolen here, nor is the name of the customers or their Social Security numbers, but the phone numbers that was exposed here, and the company acknowledges there are publicly available tools that are out there that can link names of customers with phone numbers. Another really interesting point here is that AT&amp;T says that for a subset of customers, their cell site ID numbers may have been exposed. And that is really important because it can actually reveal where people work or where they live. The FCC, in just the last few moments, put out a tweet saying that they are investigating. They're working with local law enforcement. AT&amp;T promising that they're going to alert customers who were impacted. But, Jim, look, this feels like just the tip of the iceberg, and we're going to learn a lot more about this in the coming days and weeks.",
