A major storm slamming California's central coast, causing high surf and flooding, even leading to one death after a man became trapped under debris on a beach. That high surf and the coastal flood warnings do remain in effect today as well.In Santa Cruz, a portion of a wharf collapsed from the rough weather conditions that sent three people into the ocean. Wharf had been closed for renovation. The victims were inspecting the structure when it gave way. Two of them were rescued by first responders. The third person was reportedly able to make it out on their own. And some scary moments a little bit further north at a Lake Tahoe ski resort, when two lift chairs collided. Witnesses say one chair slid back would slam into the other, sending skiers falling to the ground. At least five people were hurt and had to be taken to the hospital. The resort said it is investigating what caused that malfunction. And after a three month break, new video shows one of the world's most active volcanoes putting on a pretty fiery display. Lava shooting as high as 300 feet, spewing from the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's big island. That spectacle brought packed crowds to Hawaii volcano's national park to witness it in real time. Authorities say nearby communities important to note, they say, are not in danger. Well --",

So first of all, it's just in a much weaker position. And that's not a function of the past four years. It's really a function of the past 2 or 3 months.It's lost Hamas and Hezbollah, its two major proxies that could strike Israel. It has lost Syria, the country through which it sent most of its weapons along the way. It had some missile exchanges with Israel, and it lost in each and every one of those, unable for its missiles with except -- with a few small exceptions, to get through the shield that Israel built up with the United States and some Arab allies. So Iran is feeling exposed in a way it never did when President Trump left office. And then, of course, Iran has built up its nuclear capability -- in part, that's a function of President Trump's decision in 2018 to pull out of the earlier nuclear accord, which it had been largely observing. And it's built up a lot of capability soon. So the question is, might it raise for a bomb? HILL:  And as we look at this, the fact that Iran is weaker, the current national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, speaking with my colleague Fareed Zakaria over the weekend, said that could actually serve as an incentive.

And the Iranian president has shown some openness to that.But I also think that the fear that Iran will move quickly to try to get a bomb, and it certainly accelerating its production of material, will also ramp up the pressure for Israel to take military action, perhaps with U.S. help. And so I think you're going to see both of these movements happen simultaneously.

Well, some people, we understand are taking the holiday pause from these drugs so they can chow down. But is it a good idea?Let's discuss with the Dr. Megan Ranney, the dean of Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Ranney, thank you so much for being with us on this Christmas Eve. So tell us right off the bat, what should people know about skipping some of these doses? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, DEAN, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Gosh, I am getting this question a lot right now. Almost half of Americans with diabetes are taking one of these GLP-1 drugs, like Wegovy or Ozempic or Zepbound, and 1 in 8 American adults are taking the medication for some reason or another. They do have side effects. So it's not surprising that people are thinking about skipping a dose for the holidays. Now, my best advice is, of course, to talk to your own doctor, but knowing that its Christmas Eve, you might not be able to do that. So there are two things that I tell folks to think about. The first is honestly, skipping one week of your medication is not going to be the end of the world, even if you are taking it for diabetes, your blood sugars might go up a little bit. You might gain a little weight because you're going to eat a little more. But when you take your dose next week, you're going to quickly re-equilibrate. So if you really must skip a dose, so be it. The second thing, though, to think about is the reason why you are taking these medications. Again, for most people that are taking them, it's because they have diabetes or heart disease or something that this medication really treats. So rather than skipping a dose, think about how you can use these holidays to celebrate with your family, but also create new traditions that honor your new, healthier self. You know, maybe eat a little less food, or find traditions that are not so food centered. But try hard to not skip the dose simply because of the message that it sends to yourself and to your family about what you're committing to for the New Year, which is taking care of your body.",

      "sentences": "And, Dr. Ranney, I'm curious because some of these drugs are weekly injections, as you noted, if you stop and skip one dose, say, will the effects linger or will it really be almost immediate? You can. Those curbed cravings will go away.",

    },
    {
      "timeStamp": "15:50:12",
      "speaker": "RANNEY",
      "sentences": "Yeah, that's a great question. The medication does stay in your body for a while, particularly that injectable version of the medication. So it's not going to completely disappear over the course of a few days. We actually tell people if you miss a dose, you can take a makeup dose even a few days later. So missing one week doesn't mean it totally disappears from your body.So, but there's the other side of it, too. Again, which is the effect does decrease over time. So you don't want to miss more than one week if you can possibly help it.",

      "timeStamp": "15:50:12",
      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "sentences": "Now, I guess here's the other question that I imagine you are getting are there. You know, some of the users of these drugs, they sometimes have side effects nausea, uncomfortable abdominal pain. If people are considering pausing, though to just enjoy some of these holiday, you know, delicacies, could those side effects return when they start up again? Could they be stronger than before? What is the data say?",

    },
    {
      "timeStamp": "15:50:12",
      "speaker": "RANNEY",
      "sentences": "So not totally sure. One of the things again, that's with only missing one week, you don't have to start at a lower dose than you did before, right? When you first start, you started a low dose and then you slowly titrate up.If you only miss one week, you can stay at the same dose that you were taking before. But if you're eating a lot of fatty or greasy or heavy foods, you may find more side effects when you restart. That's why we recommend with these injectable medications that you eat multiple small meals, lots of protein, lots of fiber. And those holiday cookies, roast beef, and so on are not going to interact super well with the medication. So try to keep those portions small.",
