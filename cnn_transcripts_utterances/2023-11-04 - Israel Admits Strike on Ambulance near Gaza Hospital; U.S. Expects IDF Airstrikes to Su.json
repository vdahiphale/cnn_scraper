      "sentences": "What we do know is the IDF says they were targeting Hamas operatives. From the other perspective, from the Palestinian Red Crescent, they are saying this was a convoy carrying injured patients that were heading to the south from the north. The international organization, as well, the International Committeeof the Red Cross also saying that they were aware of this convoy, that even though they weren't involved in this convoy, that no ambulance or hospital should be targeted. And I want to give you a reaction from the U.N. secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, a short while ago, saying he is \"horrified by the Israeli strike on the ambulance convoy, saying that the images of bodies strewn on the streets outside the hospital are absolutely harrowing. Now for nearly one month, civilians in Gaza, including children and women, have been besieged, denied aid, killed and bombed out of their homes.\" So this is a significant response coming through from the United Nations. Of course there has been a lot of concern in terms of the intensity of Israeli airstrikes into Gaza and the civilian death toll. It is over 9,000 at this point in time. And of course, Antony Blinken, the U.N. secretary of state in Israel yesterday speaking with Benjamin Netanyahu, appealing for some kind of a pause in order to get aid into the Gaza Strip, for mediation talks. Of course, Benjamin Netanyahu pushing back, saying that is only a possibility if all hostages are released. But I want you to take a listen to what Blinken said about the civilian impact. And he spoke really emotionally about it. I want you to listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I have seen images, too, of Palestinian children, young boys and girls pulled from the wreckage of buildings. When I see that, when I look into their eyes, through the TV screen, I see my own children. How can we not? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The big concern from the IDF is that it is going to end up in Hamas' hands. And the other perspective here is that hospitals cannot offer any assistance to the injured and keep the lights on and keep vital equipment going without access to fuel. And we are hearing these reports not only coming through from the ministry of health that is led by Hamas but also from doctors and international organizations, saying that the situation in Gaza is becoming absolutely catastrophic.",

Where does this leave U.S. aid for Israel? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  It's going to be a torturous process to get to the finish line but I still believe they probably will get to the finish line. This bill that the House passed was not a serious attempt at legislating. It was kind of an indication of where the chamber is going under the new speaker, Mike Johnson. It really comes from the far right flank of the Republican Party, despite his kind of mild-mannered Clark Kent demeanor. And he put forward what they call the U.S. messaging bill, really a bill that was designed to unify Republican members and excite Republican voters, FOX viewers, not a serious vision of where this might end. I suspect that there will ultimately be aid for Israel and Ukraine. But there may have to be a third piece involved, which involves immigration reform and spending on the border.

Republicans by 2:1 supported aid to Israel and Democrats were about evenly split. On the other hand, Democrats supported aid to Ukraine about 3:1 and most Republicans opposed it. So it is complicated to get there and it may not be possible to get there just by joining the two issues. It may require Biden to also make concessions, which, by the way, the White House may be inclined to do, to Republicans, on changing some of the rules about asylum and other ways trying to secure the southern border. It is possible that a three-cornered agreement about Israel, Ukraine and dealing with the border, packaged broadly as enhancing U.S. security against threats around the world, might be the way out of this impasse.",

But as I say, he is going to let it go further than I think Barack Obama might have. I think the real question about the political impact in '24 is what comes next. Unless they are still fighting in Gaza City in the fall of 2024, I think Joe Biden is going to put enormous pressure on Netanyahu to restore some kind of peace negotiation. Some kind of discussion toward a two state solution with the Palestinians. It may not lead anywhere, as our previous examples over the last three decades have also kind of failed to reach the finish line.
