Obviously, there is less than the $35 million that the Trump campaign said they raised during this period.

And Marjory Taylor Greene is one of Trump's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill. But what I can tell you, Bri, is that there has been frustration bubbling up in the Freedom Caucus over the last few months.And really, it boils down to the fact that Marjory Taylor Greene has become one of the biggest allies of Republican leadership. She publicly criticized some of her Freedom Caucus colleagues for supporting -- for not supporting Kevin McCarthy for Speaker during a speakers battle. She also criticized her colleagues for the backlash that they gave Kevin McCarthy for hammering out this debt ceiling deal and for blocking the House floor. And then the real straw that broke the camel's back, according to Congressman Andy Harris, he's a member of the Freedom Caucus -- was that -- the last week before recess, there was dust up on the floor. A confrontation between Greene and another member of the Freedom Caucus. Where Greene admitted that she called Lauren Boebert, a little b-word -- I will say the word. But that is what she confirmed that she said to Lauren Boebert on the floor. And I want to read what else Andy Harris told my colleague, Haley Talbot earlier today. He said, I think the way she -- Marjory Taylor Greene -- referred to a fellow member was probably not the way we expect our members to refer to their fellow, especially female, members. So a lot of this doesn't really boil down to some personal, internal issues and conflicts between members. But there is a broader identity caucus happening -- broader identity crisis happening inside the Freedom Caucus about whether they want to be a group that just stands up to Kevin McCarthy at every turn or if they want to play the inside game -- Brianna.",

Given the maternal mortality crisis, given the need for a paid sick leave, given the need for child care, health insurance, especially for low and poorer families.

In the reasons go on and on and on.And of course as a physician, I totally understand their reasons. I trust my patients to make the best decisions for them. But when these laws are passed and we have to say, we can't help you. We are legally not allowed to do anything for you. The best thing for you is to go to another state to get this care. And then yet people still say, I'm not able to travel. I can't get out of state. I'm not able to do that. That's not an option for me. And again, the reasons are numerous. And oftentimes, we're left with no options but to say, there is nothing that we can do.
