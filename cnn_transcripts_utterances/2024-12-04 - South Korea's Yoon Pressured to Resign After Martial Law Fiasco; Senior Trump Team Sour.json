And at times they confronted some of several hundred military troops who tried to block them. And despite those confrontations managed to conduct a vote, 190 lawmakers voted to overturn the martial law decree. And among them were at least 18 members of President Yoon's own People Power Party, which has largely condemned the emergency martial law decree in the hours since. In fact, by 4:30 in the morning on Wednesday, President Yoon had overturned his own decree. So now you have people that have gathered here. Many of them are holding signs that say, Resign Yoon. Gathering for a rally here. Many of them very angry at what their president tried and now apparently failed to do. His own party has called for the resignation of the defense minister. The president's chief of staff has resigned. And inside, opposition lawmakers have tabled a resolution calling for the impeachment of the president. It has plunged this country into political uncertainty. But amid that, what is also striking is how little this seems to have impacted ordinary life in Korea. The airport was functioning normally this morning. And in Seoul, businesses were open. People were bustling around in the streets. Certainly talking about what has taken place, which was definitely a short-lived challenge to decades of democracy in this country. [04:05:04] Ivan Watson, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So it is a major U.S. military presence, as well as a critical U.S. military alliance.U.S. Forces Korea is led by a four-star general, General Paul La Camera. So that is part of the critical nature of the relationship between the U.S. and the South Koreans there. The U.S., of course, has been in touch with the South Korean government, and that includes military-to-military conversations here, according to the Pentagon, although they haven't detailed the extent of those conversations. Throughout the hours that this took place, there were no changes to U.S. military force posture there and no additional rules or curfews that were imposed on U.S. service members there, according to the Pentagon. But this is a situation they're obviously watching and continue to watch very closely. And that, of course, includes because of North Korea. This is sort of a situation where you might expect to see Kim Jong-un try to take advantage of this and carry out a ballistic missile launch or a drone launch or a military exercise that would sort of flex his muscle, especially because the South Korean president blamed what he called North Korean communists for the situation that led him to declare martial law. But at least as of now, the Pentagon says they haven't seen any indication of any major change from North Korea. But of course, given -- frankly, given how sensitive the entire region is and given Kim's history of sort of taking advantage of a situation or a perceived insult and carrying out some sort of military test or exercise, this is something the Pentagon is still watching very closely.

So there's that. So he's stuck with the current government, which means he's stuck with the difficulty of finding another prime minister, which means effectively Barnier is stuck as being a caretaker until Macron can find another prime ministerial candidate that will have enough support across, again, the diminished center and with the increased left and right.",

He thought he would challenge them. And this is a challenge in a way that's been long coming.But the way that he called it so quickly, and it did backfire on him because, again, the politics that he represents has been, or the parties and the politicians within the National Assembly have been diminished. So his gamble to call a snap election really backfired on him and left him on the back foot. So now even worse than being on the back foot, he may be facing this vote of no confidence also.",
