I have a feeling that some of you might have gone to sleep before this was projected.John Fetterman, CNN projects, will win the Senate seat in Pennsylvania by a reasonably comfortable margin. He's ahead by 2 and a half points. And just for frame of reference, where did he outperformed Joe Biden, what Joe Biden did two years ago? Almost everywhere. John Fetterman did a really good job in a lot of these red counties. I just wanted to point that out, in case you're waking up without knowing who won in Pennsylvania. Now, let's talk about these other key races. Let's go around the country to the races that aren't called yet. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin with a narrow lead of 32,000 votes, 94 percent in. We will watch this closely. There is still vote to be counted in Milwaukee, just 82 percent in. Mandela Barnes, lieutenant governor, the Democrat there, leading by a lot there. He could make up maybe some of the 32,000-vote margin there. Can he get all of it? We'll have to wait and see. It is a tall order. In Nevada, counting all night long. They're at 80 percent. Adam Laxalt has a narrow lead of 22,000 votes. This actually flipped overnight. Early on, Catherine Cortez Masto, the incumbent Democrat, was ahead. She is now trailing. Very importantly, Clark County, the most populous county in the state, 84 percent in. But all the votes they have left, mail-in votes which there tend to skew toward the Democrats. Are there enough votes in Clark County, which is the district, the county that Joe Biden won by 9 points there, for the incumbent Democrat to make up the margin? Possible. Again, we're going to have to wait and see. Mail-in ballots in Nevada can arrive and be counted until Saturday. Let's go South to Arizona. The incumbent Democrat, Mark Kelly there with a lead of about 6 percent over Blake Masters. Sixty-seven percent in, 107,000 votes. Mark Kelly's lead has been getting smaller as the night has become morning. They are county more votes there. Maricopa County is the crucial county in this state. Joe Biden won it by 2 percent. Mark Kelly, you can see, has nearly an 8-point lead there. That could bode well for him. They have counted all the election-day vote in Maricopa County, which tends to skew toward the Republicans. Just mail-in ballot left to count. However, I should note that in Arizona, some of the late-arriving mail ballot that may have arrived yesterday --",

We'll have to wait and see, once again. I ended here in Georgia because in Georgia, with 96 percent reporting, you have Raphael Warnock with 49.2 percent of the vote. Why is that important? Because in Georgia, if no one gets to 50 percent plus one -- plus one single vote -- there will be a runoff, and that runoff will be December 6th. The secretary of state's office tells us they believe this is headed to a runoff. Raphael Warnock is ahead. His lead may even grow some because of the votes still remaining, for instance, in Cobb County, 93 percent in. Still more votes to count there. Fulton County, 95; more votes to count there. These are very Democratic counties. His lead may grow. But the secretary of state's office does not think it will get to that 50 percent plus one. What would that mean overall? Again, the reason I put this up here is if things remain where they are -- imagine this blue state isn't there. It would be 49 Democratic seats, 50 Republican seats. The Democrats would need to win that runoff on December 6th to maintain control. They need to have 50 seats. Vice President Kamala Harris would break the tie.

She joins us now.Good morning to you, Patricia. We appreciate you joining us. You have been listening to us and our assessment and what John has here on the Magic Wall. What say you? PATRICIA MURPHY, POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION\": Yes, I think you guys are exactly right. We are going to probably keep Thanksgiving very interesting here in Georgia. We have a razor-thin margin between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker because of that state law that says a candidate needs to get over 50 percent of the vote. Neither one of them looks like they're going to be able to pull in enough votes from anywhere in the state to get up over that. Or right now, it's still too close for us at the AJC to call. So we're not calling the race yet. We're not even calling it as a runoff yet. But this has just been an unbelievably tumultuous race between these two. Herschel Walker, obviously, lots and lots of allegations against him. Raphael Warnock has been able to outperform the rest of the Democratic ticket here in the state for a whole lot of reasons. But if this comes down to control of the U.S. Senate, Raphael Warnock has been here very recently. Georgia has been here very recently. The exact same scenario happened in 2021, and we could be here again in 2022.",

If you look at the governor's race here, you can see that Brian Kemp, the Republican -- and we have projected he has won this race. Won by almost eight percent. So there is, you know, roughly a 7.5 percent difference between the governor's race, what you were talking, and the Senate race there. That could show you the weakness of Herschel Walker as a candidate or the strength of Brian Kemp as a candidate, of the strength of Raphael Warnock as a candidate. But there is a very big difference there. Historically, Patricia, there's been a sense that runoffs favor Republican candidates. I should say historically, because that was the case until two years ago, when both Democrats won the runoffs there. Is there any sense who might be favored in a runoff in Georgia?",

But they are willing to look past some of those shortcomings of Herschel Walker's if it comes down to controlling the Senate, if it comes down to putting the brakes on the Biden administration. Joe Biden right now has about a 37 percent approval rating, and then that is why we're seeing this really interesting dynamic between crossover voters between Brian Kemp and Raphael Warnock. Seems unusual, but we've got a really unsettled, unusual Senate race here in the state. And I think it looks like it's going to continue to be unusual and unsettled and very interesting.",

Because if you look at the map, it's the one county where she's leading right now. The other county with the second largest population, Washoe, which is about 15 percent, she's trailing Adam Laxalt by almost 5 points. Only 64 percent in. She may not be trailing when the counting is done, depending on how much mail there is left to count. Also, we just don't know.

Congress still hanging in the balance. M.J. Lee is at the White House for us. And M.J., you know, President Biden was making a lot of phone calls last night before he went to sleep. Congratulatory calls that the White House wasn't necessarily expecting the number of calls that he would be making last night, compared to what the numbers look like now. M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You know, Kaitlan, as the results were coming in late last night, there were two things that Biden advisers felt convinced of. One is that they felt like the races across the board were very competitive. And two, they felt like Democrats had probably avoided a blood-bath that so many had predicted and feared. And what they are waking up to this morning is really reason for that optimism to basically hold up if things sort of stay on track. You know, one thing is, of course, that the Democrats' chances of keeping the Senate, that still remains a real possibility. That door is still open. And second, White House officials and advisers have been glad to see some of these Democratic governors and House frontliners, seeing them win these very competitive races overnight. Of course, the huge outstanding question for this White House, as it is for all of us, is what is the fate of the House, and how many seats do Republicans ultimately end up picking up? Because of course, what ends up happening with the Senate and whether Democrats keep the Senate or not and then just how big the margin ends up being in the House, that is going to have huge implications for the ability for President Biden to govern in the next two years.",

This is what they told me. They said, \"We knew the economy would be bad, and they,\" being the White House, \"didn't have an economic message at all.\" So I think this just reflects the key criticism that we've heard when it comes to this president and this White House, this -- this idea that there wasn't a clear enough economic message and that the president didn't spend enough time talking about economic issues. Now, White House officials, of course, have been defensive about their strategy and their messaging. And they would say, you know, there's just no universe where President Biden wouldn't have talked about abortion rights issues, given what happened with the Supreme Court. You know, there's no universe -- universe where he wouldn't have talked about threats to democracy when Nancy Pelosi's husband is getting hit in the head with a hammer.

Michael, what are you making of what you're seeing in these numbers, especially for the White House and what this means for Democrats? Because typically, the White House was bracing for some serious losses here. That is exactly what they would expect, given it is the sitting president; his approval rating is not great. What is your reaction this morning? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN ANCHOR, \"SMERCONISH\": So all politics being local, I of course, am Philly burb-based. They are a bellwether of what's going on in the national climate. Yesterday I was with you from Bucks County, and I said, you know, welcome to the swingiest of counties in a swing state. What's amazing to me as I scrutinize these numbers is how John Fetterman was able to outpace his statewide numbers in those Philly burbs. So in an area where you would think it would be right on the bubble, right on the margin, instead, he blew away Mehmet Oz in Bucks County, in Montgomery County. And it's so shocking, I'm almost reluctant to give the number on CNN, because I can't believe it's as high as it is. Josh Shapiro is a resident of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. That may accounted for the boost that Fetterman received there. But to answer your question, if I were the White House, I'd be looking specifically at the Philly burbs and trying to take away a lesson from how successful Shapiro and Fetterman were in the final analysis.",
