And then there are Super Tuesdays, friends, the Election Day energy filling the air. I know you can feel it this early in the morning. Right now, polls are open in seven states. Next hour, four more states will be joining them. And that continues throughout the day, throughout the morning, as millions of voters will be casting their Super Tuesday ballots. So, while few things are certain in life these days, we well know one thing that does seem almost assured, is that by the end of the night, the needle will be moving closer to deciding the general election matchup. 865 Republican delegates are up for grabs today. And for all of those keeping track at home, right now Donald Trump has 276, meaning tonight he could get really, really, really, really quite close to securing the nomination, which requires 1,215 delegates. For President Biden, today is less about the delegate math and more about his campaign learning a lot, learning a lot more about his ability to get Democratic voters excited for the potential of a second Biden term. John Berman in Castle Rock, Colorado. Happy Super Tuesday to all of those who celebrate, John.",

      "sentences": "Well, good morning. Yes, the polls opened here in Richmond, Virginia, at 6And, John, I do just want to share, you know, how some of the Trump campaign is viewing this today and specifically how they're viewing this state in particular here in Virginia. First of all, his campaign is very confident about Super Tuesday. They are really hoping to sweep most, if not all, of the states we're going to see voting today. But the other thing that they're also keeping an eye on is Nikki Haley, of course. They know that Nikki Haley has pledged to stay in through Super Tuesday, but it's still very unclear what she will do after today. And depending on her performance, if she will drop out, their goal or their hope, I should say, is that she will ultimately drop out. I know that Donald Trump and his team want him to be able to get on that stage tonight in Mar-a-Lago, where he's going to be having a watch party and be able to declare victory and also declare himself the presumptive Republican nominee. But as you all mentioned at the top here, regardless of how many states Donald Trump wins and his performance here today, he will be shy of the necessary delegates to declare him the presumptive nominee. But their goal is to really keep building momentum here in Virginia and across the country in these different voting states and try to convince a lot of the people who want a Trump alternative to get behind him. And that's not just Republican voters, but also Republican donors. They very much recognize that they want to have the infrastructure of the Republican Party behind him and the money that can come with that to really launch him into a better position for a general election rematch against Joe Biden. Now, about Virginia here specifically, this is a state that Donald Trump lost both in 2016 and in 2020. But from my conversations with Trump senior advisers, they do see it as a battleground. That's how they've been describing it to me in our conversations. And they do think they can make a good play here. And it's not just about the primary, but also, again, looking ahead to potential general election. And one thing I know they're going to be doing a lot of here in the state is, of course, building up their ground game strategy, but also really targeting suburban voters. They tell me that they think the economy, one of the top issues I know that Donald Trump plans to run on this year, is something that a lot of Virginia voters care about specifically. So, you can expect that messaging as they look ahead.",

The big question is, can she decisively win any states tonight?I think tonight really serves as the ultimate test of her message. She's such a disciplined campaigner, and she has really stuck to this electability argument that she would be the best person to go up against Joe Biden in the fall. She's delivered that message in ten states in the past week. But she has been very vague about concrete expectations, only saying that she will continue to run this race as long as we remain competitive. You know, with her -- I was with her during her New England swing, and she was attracting Democrats, independents and anti-Trump Republicans that said that they would rather vote for Joe Biden than vote for Trump in the fall.

A little more than a third of Republican delegates are up for grabs. And some of these states are winner-take-all states, where I was in Vermont over the weekend, Maine, Massachusetts. If she doesn't give above 50 percent, that means she loses the chance to get all of the delegates in that state completely.Haley's team, though, they say that she will not address supporters tonight because the polls in some states close at a very late hour.

The real electors from that state filed a civil case against the fake electors, and this came out as part of a settlement just yesterday, hundreds of new texts, emails, photos, videos. You just saw the clip of the fake electors voting in Wisconsin, but there is so much more. And it is revealing that this fake electors plan was deeper than we thought. We're still learning new things, Sara, almost four years later, three or four years later.Let's go through -- I want to show you three things that we learned from this document dump. First is a text message exchange between Cheseboro and Trump's top attorney in Wisconsin, Jim Troupis. This is in December 2020. And he says, Jim, can you send my December 6th memo to Trump lawyer Justin Clark? The messaging on January 6th being the real day is key. That memo is where he spelled out the fake electors plan. Troupis says, I have sent it to the White House this afternoon, the real decision makers. We didn't necessarily know that Troupis had sent that very detailed memo directly to the Trump White House. Now, he did not say in the messages who he sent it to, but that is notable, because just a few weeks later, they carried out the plan in seven states across the country, Trump electors cast their ballots, and then on January 6th, Trump tried to get Mike Pence to count those ballots. And who was in the crowd outside of the Capitol? None other than Kenneth Cheseboro himself. Our K-file team broke that story last year, but we are now seeing brand new selfies, photos that he took that day. This is him outside of the Washington Monument, and the other photo you just saw with him in the red MAGA hat, that shows him in the front, and Alex Jones in the back, the noted conspiracy theorist. But even after witnessing the carnage that day, Sara, even with Cheseboro in the crowd that day, he was still pushing to overturn the election. Look at this text from two days later, January 8th, 2021. He says to Troupis, the events of the last two days open up legal options in the states for winning rulings favorable to Trump. Sara, after all that, he was still scheming, still pushing the plot.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's 5becoming an extraordinary refrain, frankly, of the third year of this war, Ukraine's ability to project attack power into parts of the Black Sea, where Russia were just a year ago, probably felt entirely safe with its fleet there.The Sergei Kotov patrol ship, according to Ukraine's defense intelligence, who say they carried out the operation, worth $65 million. Ukraine saying that what they call a MAGURA V5 attack drone hit it. Now, this has happened multiple times before, often to high priority, high value vessels. And it has, frankly, caused part of Russia's fleet, which would feel very comfortable in the ports of Crimea, that it annexed ten years ago to the day almost. Now, they've had to move back closer towards Russia's mainland coast, an extraordinary development here. But this and other issues we've heard from Ukraine, where they've claimed extraordinary successes inside Russia, hitting a bridge 500 miles in this morning, a Russian official in Belgorod saying infrastructure appears to have been hit after a drone attack. Very much success stories that are unexpected for Ukraine's strategic ability to project power, but in quite stark contradiction to how difficult things clearly are for Ukraine, on the most important thing, their frontlines inside the country itself. Now, we hear repeated suggestions of difficulty around a key front line near where I'm standing, to the west of Avdiivka. Ukraine gave that up two weekends ago voluntarily, but they said they'd hold a defensive line to its west. They gave up a bit of villages between that, and now they seem to be under extraordinary pressure around three villages of minimal consequence themselves, Orlivka, Bedidzhia (ph), Tonenke. Ukraine says they're holding them. Some Ukrainian (INAUDIBLE) suggest there's intense pressure. The point is not these villages themselves, the point is if Ukraine is unable to hold that defensive line, there could be a knock-on effect, because, frankly, we're not seeing extensive fortifications behind those areas on our trips around the frontline, and there are fears, I think, that Ukraine has been ill-prepared for a continued Russian advance here. They're throwing everything at it, frankly, and that may be a very difficult few months ahead, because it comes exactly when western aid supplies and ammunition are running out. Sara?",
