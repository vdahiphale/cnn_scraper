Today marks one year since he was arrested in Russia and charged with espionage. It's an accusation thoroughly denied by Gershkovich, the U.S. government and \"The Wall Street Journal\". Now, Russia has never presented any evidence to back up those claims. And the U.S. claims and classifies that Gershkovich is wrongfully detained. He has yet to face trial, and this week, he was ordered to be held in jail for another three months by Russian security services. Diplomatic attempts to secure his release have been unsuccessful. And today, \"The Wall Street Journal\" marked the grim milestone by this, by leaving the front page blank, the headline is, \"His story should be here\". CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more on the efforts to bring Evan Gershkovich home. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  No media allowed at Evan Gershkovich's most recent court hearing in Moscow, just this short clip by the courts press service. Despite a year and a Russian jail, a defiance smile from \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter. No surprise. His detention was extended yet again through June 30th. The U.S. ambassador to Russia ripping into the verdict. LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA:  The accusations against Evan are categorically untrue. They are not a different interpretation of circumstances. They are fiction.",

I found it hard to believe some days.

He has a First Amendment right to speak. But just because you have that right doesn't mean you should say some of the things that he does say. And so what you heard from Judge Walton just a minute ago, by the way, he is a nominee for George W. Bush, conservative president. And what he was calling to attention was that when you have a position, someone of that position, somebody who's running for president, right, someone who was a former president, that it does come with greater responsibility and you should just at least watch what you say because you don't know that someone out there might take it to heart an act out on it.

The bottom line is, they were projecting to donors for $25 million, mind you, that for that type of an investment, the Democratic coalition will hold. The person, the pudding with the polls, right? Biden got some great poll numbers this week according to the decision desk HQ. \"The Hill\" polls and the Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls. He actually has closed the gap, and in other times has surpassed Trump in some of the battleground states. I'm thinking of Michigan, Pennsylvania, as well as Wisconsin. Those are the blue wall states so that Democrats need to hold in order to have the sign of support to keep Biden in the White House.

So, look, I think that Jewish Americans across America are deeply concerned about the rise in antisemitism that has spiked within hate crimes across the country. And I also believe that the Biden administration has done a lot of outreach to moderate and independent voters who are going to decide this election. So, look, to say that someone who wants peace is only on the side of Rashida Tlaib, it just doesn't match any of the reporting that I've done.",

His father says that he died in front of our eyes asking what his son did to deserve turning into, quote, skin and bones from hunger. Our Jomana Karadsheh has more on this story and we do want to warn you that this report is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This video filmed 11 days ago at a northern Gaza hospital captured little Mohammed's final days, his labored breaths and all that staff tried to do to keep him alive. On Thursday, six-year-old Mohammed became the 24th Palestinian child to die of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza. And the fear is many more vulnerable lives could be lost. Hunger is in every corner of this besieged territory. The pain visible in the eyes of mothers like Najla, who's helplessly watched her children go hungry for months. Her husband, Mahdan, has thought the unthinkable, throwing his children in the sea, to spare them this torture of an existence. Dante's family endured months of bombardment in northern Gaza, but it's a looming famine there that's pushed them out of their home. If you grab a bag of flour, someone can kill you to take it, Mahdan says. Our daily meal for our children became things we hadn't heard of before, like ground soybeans in a wild plant that we never tasted before, food that animals refuse to eat, we ate. What they'll do, where they'll go, they don't know. All they want right now is to feed their little ones. My children were crying every night asking for a piece of bread, Najla says. We were dreaming of white bread. We were eating animal feed. For the first time in five months, they say, the children are having real food. Even if only plain bread. This is what Dante's family left behind in the north, scenes that tell of the desperation of so many who also just want to feed their children, as they brush the little ape that's made it into this part of Gaza. More than a million Palestinians are now facing catastrophic levels of hunger, according to a U.N.-backed report, with famine projected to arrive in the north any day now. In this man-made crisis, where Israel's been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war, something it denies. People every day find themselves scavenging for food, forced to pick wild plants to boil and eat. This grandmother can't hold back her tears as she washes weeds and leaves. It's today's meal. What else can we do, she says? It's the indignity of hunger. Avoidable suffering, as the world watches on. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We're going to get - get to some breaking news now. This is in Fulton County, Georgia, where Donald Trump and several of his co- defendants have now filed an appeal, again, pushing to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis from the election subversion case. Let's bring in CNN's Nick Valencia, who has been following this very closely. So, Nick, as we know, Willis came under scrutiny for this relationship she had -- past relationship now with a special prosecutor, Nathan Wade. The judge ruled that she could stay on the case so long as Wade resigned, which he did. So what's this about now? What's this effort about now?",

You remember, Judge Scott McAfee granted the certificate for immediate review, which is basically allowing them to appeal to the Georgia appeals court. And so now they're doing that.We just got our hands on this legal filing from Steve Sadow along with eight other of the co-defendants, which include the former chief of staff for the former president, Mark Meadows, as well as his former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and what they're asking the court is listing out the reasons to take up this case and why they believe Fani Willis should be taken off of this case, as well as the rest of her team. This is what part of that filing is saying, it's very strong language here. D.A. Willis has covered herself and her office in scandal and disrepute, and she has squandered her credibility and repeatedly and flagrantly violated the heightened ethical standards demanded of her position. The evidence of a forensic misconduct is overwhelming and her disqualification is required. The trial court's decision not to disqualify D.A. Willis under these circumstances is a structural error, a violation of the defendant's due process rights and the seriously denigrates the public's confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system. That is just a small portion of the filing. We should now expect the state to respond, and after the appellate court has both of those responses, they then have 45 days to decide what they're going to do. In the meantime, we're still going through this filings, something again that we had anticipated, but now we have our hands on and it's officially filed.

You know, yesterday we were talking as though this case was back on track. It was back focused on the facts of this case, that the former president tried to subvert democracy, tried to steal the election here. That's what the prosecutors are alleging. But again, we're now back with this dark cloud and this dark shadow over this case because of a personal relationship that Fani had, Fani Willis had with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade. We don't really know what kind of delay this will have or what kind of effect this will have. But it sort of depends on who you ask. The Fulton County D.A. is being very full-throated and saying she's going to continue to step forward and focus on the facts of this case, but it's clear that defense attorneys have not given up their bite at this apple when trying to remove Fani Willis altogether -- Rahel.",
