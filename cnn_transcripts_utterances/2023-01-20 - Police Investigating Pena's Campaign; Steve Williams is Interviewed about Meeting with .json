Now, an individual named Jose Trujillo is arrested in a car with the gun that's allegedly ballistically matched to the last of the shootings of Democratic rivals' homes, but also nearly 900 fentanyl pills with a street value of about $15,000, $3,000 in cash. This is an individual, who claims to be homeless, with the smoking gun and the drugs driving the candidate's car. And he's also the single largest cash contributor to Pena's failed campaign.So, you have an individual who is now federally charged with being in possession of drugs and weapons and is the guy who was funneling cash from himself and a relative into the campaign to the tune of just under $10,000. And as a suspected fentanyl dealer, who was allegedly working for the candidate, shooting at rivals, one has to ask the investigative question, were those contributions generated by the fentanyl sales.",

So, they're going to start looking into this as early as today. The police investigation is into the shootings. The FBI's violent crime squad has the gun and the drug angle. And ATF is matching the ballistics. So, you have a real mix of Albuquerque PD and federal authorities who are going to be peeling back all of the layers here.Pena's charged, but there's -- as well as Trujillo, but there's a team of four people, including Trujillo's father, who are on the radar here and named in the complaint as potential suspects. Of course, this comes back to a candidate who had to go to court to run for this office because he's a convicted felon who had served seven years for a smash and grab robbery crew.",

Fentanyl is 100 times stronger than heroin. And as a result of that, it's just killing people.In Huntington from 2019, '20 and '21, we had 379 -- 379 overdose deaths, 349 of them were as a result of fentanyl. Now, 349 as a result of fentanyl. I remember several years ago then Senator Biden, in the late '80s, was speaking at Wake Forest University. And one of the things that he was saying is that we're having a proliferation of drugs being shipped into our country and that is an active war. Well, yesterday I heard one of my fellow mayors say something that just struck a chord with me, that fentanyl coming from China is a weapon of mass destruction. Is that there's enough that are coming in to our nation right now, coming through the border and other means and how it's being packaged is enough to be able to kill every American across the -- across the country. And this is frightening. We have to be able to do something of this nature. And, frankly, when we're talking with the president this afternoon somehow expect that that will be addressed because it was addressed yesterday when we were talking with Dr. Gupta, the drug czar, on our panel discussion, and he talked very specifically about the problems of having to deal with China and their shipping of fentanyl over into our country.",

We have resources to be able to fix things and actually correct some wrongs within our community.We have two brownfield sites within my city that have long been shut down that we're able to repurpose those into -- one of them is being repurposed in coal country for a training and logistics program for solar panels and solar panel installation. On another piece of property that was built in the late 1870s when my city was first founded and has been shuttered for 20 years, we've been able to partnership with the federal government, Department of Commerce, Appalachian Regional Commission, EPA, being able to clear that property and now we have a logistics robotic training center that's going to be locating on that and positioning ourselves so that we might be able to bring other digital aging businesses into the area, not businesses that came as a result of the industrial revolution.",

But on every page of its 20-page report, there were many revelations about how the court has operated and how there was something inevitable about this leak, unfortunately. The justices weren't able to really go back and retrace how their technology had been used, their computers and their printers to know, you know, how many copies had been made of this, how easily it might have been to get the document out the door and make it, then, you know -- lead it into the hands of \"Politico,\" which published it on May 2nd, about eight weeks before the final opinion was released. The -- as you said, John, the justices themselves were not interviewed. Likely not any of their spouses or anybody in the family. Law clerks revealed when they were interviewed by investigators that some of them had talked to spouse and partners about the case. So there were all sorts of ways that the court itself was a bit of a sieve during this time when this very important case was being negotiated behind the scenes. And I have to say that when you think of the basic protocols that most legal offices undertake, they were really missing at the Supreme Court. We will never know just how much this leak affected the outcome of this huge case, rolling back a half century of abortion rights.
