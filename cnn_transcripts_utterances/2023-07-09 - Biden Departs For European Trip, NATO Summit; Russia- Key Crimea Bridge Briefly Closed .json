I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with President Biden who will soon arrive in London for the start of a high-stakes trip to Europe. During the five-day visit, Biden will meet with leaders in the U.K. and Finland. And in between those two stops, attend a critical NATO summit. A meeting that will be keenly focused on Russia's war in Ukraine, a conflict right on NATO's borders. The summit comes just days after President Biden approved giving controversial cluster munitions to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Munitions that nearly all NATO members have banned. CNN's Arlette Saenz is traveling just ahead of the president's arrival, already there in London. Arlette, what is first on the president's agenda?",

And tomorrow he will meet with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at 10 Downing Street before heading over to Windsor Castle for an engagement with King Charles, the first time the two men will be meeting since his coronation in May.One of the issues that they're expected to discuss is climate change, which is a key priority and portfolio for the monarch. And after this visit here to the United Kingdom, President Biden will then head to Vilnius Lithuania, which is home to this year's NATO summit. That is really the centerpiece of President Biden's trip. He will then travel on to Finland where he will meet with the country's president as well as Nordic leaders. But at the NATO summit, really the war -- Russia's war against Ukraine will be the key focus, as the NATO alliance wants to once again shore up their support for the war-torn country. Also up for debate is a possible road map for Ukraine to potentially join NATO down the road. That is an issue that has already caused some debate amongst allies. And President Biden told our colleague Fareed Zakaria in an interview that now is not the time for Ukraine to join NATO. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that was to break NATO. He was confident, in my view, and many in the intelligence community -- he was confident he could break NATO.So holding NATO together is really critical.

They do not want these to be used in Russia. They want these as self defense to use against Russians in their own country of Ukraine. I don't see anything wrong with that because, quite honestly, Jake, as you look at the counteroffensive, it's been slowed tremendously because this administration has been so slow to get the weapons in. These weapons would be a game changer. They are highly effective and particularly hitting flanks of troops inside of Ukraine. They would be a game changer in the counteroffensive.

So Erdogan has just won an election. And maybe if he gets his F-16s, which he's been asking for, he might give a little. So this may not be as tough for Biden. I just wanted to add that President Biden and the Biden administration had been really great at knitting together NATO after the Trump years when the United States seemed to be flirting with leaving NATO. But one of the challenges for the president, I believe, is that he has to get to that point David raised about escalation. I think this administration has been far too concerned about the ladder of escalation when I don't think Russians, at least in my study of Russians, they don't really think that way. And so this might be the time to discuss with NATO allies when air power will be part of this. Because the issue with cluster bombs is a symptom of a war that drags on in an almost like Iraq war or World War I-type scenario. When if you had air power, you could actually do real damage rather quickly to the Russian defenses. And that's something NATO actually could do not as a NATO attack of course, but as a repainted fuselage, Ukrainian air force attack.

And secondly, with regard to the Republicans, the war in Ukraine is a problem for the Republicans. And there's -- it's nothing to do with President Biden. It's the fact that Republicans themselves cannot agree. So as we watch the primaries, the Republican primaries or the competition of the primaries, we'll get a sense of that debate.

You mentioned the shooting in Cleveland from last night that left nine people injured.We covered just yesterday here in Queens, New York and in Brooklyn, this individual that according to police was randomly shooting individuals, at least four of them shot, one of them fatally, an elderly man that was shot in the back in Queens. So each one of those is a clear example at really just the latest reminder of America's constant struggle to overcome gun violence here. When you look at the numbers alone, just nine days into July of this year, and we have already seen just this month alone, you see the number there, 32 mass shootings. An average of 3 or 4 a day. And then the larger picture there, when you look at numbers that we have seen so far, 367, considering that up against 647 total last year, that tells you that we are basically on pace to exceed what we have seen before. July 4th and July 5th was key here in the United States, recording at least ten mass shootings. And this is certainly not uncommon, I should say. The Gun Violence Archive, which actually would classify mass shooting as an incident that results in the deaths of four people or more, not including the shooter reporting that Fourth of July holiday usually accounts for the most mass shootings of any other day in nearly a decade. Again, that's according to the Gun Violence Archive and the second most frequent day, July 5th. So that's certainly telling here. So it's telling us that just some or overall based on historic trends, also we tend to see that increase in numbers. Now the question as to why we're seeing this. I mean just look at the locations of the mass shootings in 2023 alone. We have seen them obviously, saw some in the West Coast, or in Louisiana recently and of course plenty in the Northeast. The question of why, well, social scientists we have heard from them for decades now. Some might say there's a correlation, at least an indirect or direct correlation between temperatures, for example. And also the propensity for violence. Then the question of a solution, right? It depends those who you ask. You might hear those who say that the key is to address mental health, while you have others who will propose legislation, for example try to eliminate gun show loopholes. So it really is still that on going debate and caught in the middle are people as a result of some of these guns that have been used as well, Fred.",

A Tennessee General Attorney Jonathan Skrmetti who is a Republican acknowledged Saturday after the ruling was announced that this case is far from over, he said, but this is a big win, adding that the court of appeals lifted the injunction meaning the law can be fully enforced and recognized that Tennessee is likely to win the constitutional argument and the case. On the other side, the American Civil Liberties Union blasted the decision in a statement, also saying that this case is far from over and calling the ruling disappointing and heart breaking. As we and our clients consider, our next steps the ACLU said, we want all the transgender youth of Tennessee to know this fight is far from over and we will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Tennessee is made a safer place to raise every family.

Meantime not so great news here, dangerous heat alert is in effect across the Southwest, Texas, and Florida. And residents can expect high temperatures well into the triple digits. CNN meteorologist Britley Ritz has the very latest. Okay, ridiculous. But now, we're past ridiculous, right? That was your word yesterday and that really stuck with me, because now we're talking really dangerous. I mean, life-threatening stuff.",

Now, we can finally get to the beach in this heat and not have to worry about that stinky sargassum because it really does put off an awful scent.But over the southwest, here we are with excessive heat warnings still in effect, as well as heat advisories that's now been extended back into Texas and Florida, including even parts of the Pacific Northwest. This ridge of high pressure really holding on. We were hoping the summer-time monsoon would set up over the Southwest and bring us much-needed rain. Unfortunately, it's taking its time doing so and our temperatures will continue to rise. Phoenix, look at your numbers, over 100 degrees. And in some cases, over 110 degrees, and that's the forecast here as we progress all the way into the upcoming workweek. Look at our average, should be around 107 degrees. We're pushing 116 by the time we roll into Friday and Saturday. Florida, that heat advisory still in effect from the palm beaches down into the Florida Keys. You factor in dew points of 70-plus. It feels ridiculous, as Fred and I have been talking about. Our temperatures are in the 90s, which is above normal and records are a possibility, rolling into next week as that ridge continues to build. But it feels like 103 degrees in places like Ft. Myers and Naples, 104 degrees, Miami 102. So we've got quite a bit of heat going on out there, Fred.",

She scored 63 times so far at the international level for her country, including the sixth, remember the 2019 World Cup in France, she got 6 in that tournament, she would go on to claim the gold -- golden ball award. Rapinoe, though, I think this is really important to make it clear, Fred. She's about so much more than what is already an amazing football career. She is so passionate. She cares deeply about her fellow human beings. She has this massive vocal platform as well. A whole range of social issues as well over the years, including LGBTQ+ rights, racial inequality, voter rights as well, and probably most famously her tireless efforts on behalf of gender and pay equity.
