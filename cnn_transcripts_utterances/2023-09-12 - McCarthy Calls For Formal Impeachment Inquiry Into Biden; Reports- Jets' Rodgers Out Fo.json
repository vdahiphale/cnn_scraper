Now, I want to add one thing, though, what Kevin McCarthy does have in this moment on his side is public opinion. I mean, we just released a poll last week.And we saw that despite that lack of evidence having been presented, a majority of Americans I believed something afoot here. I mean, 55 percent, in our poll said they think President Biden has acted inappropriately during the course of this investigation, while he's been President. North of six and 10 Americans think that either Biden did something illegally or acted immorally, or in bad faith in some way. Did something wrong here, when it comes to the business dealings of under Biden, when Joe Biden was Vice President. So, there is a perception issue that the White House is going to have to battle. And that is the perception issue that the House Republicans and Kevin McCarthy right now are leaning into both sides are going to need the evidence or lack thereof to make their final case, the American people as this goes forward.",

      "sentences": "It seems almost certain that they would have to go that in that route. If you just look at the sheer politics of this. When talking to Republicans, the reason why a lot of them were simply nervous about going down this route is that once you begin the process of an impeachment proceeding, it is very hard to pull back.Because politically speaking, if say the Republicans decide not to move forward with a charge of a high crime or misdemeanor against the President, while investigating all the allegations they've been talking about all year. Essentially, what looked like Joe Biden was clear that Republicans cleared them. A potentially give the President a boost as he has in this pivotal reelection campaign next year. So, that's where the betting at the moment is that they would go forward with actually charging the President with high crimes or misdemeanors, despite not proving any sort of wrongdoing on behalf of the President taking official action to help his son allegations that they have been peddling all year. They've been investigating but yet, to specifically prove that point. But nevertheless, this still goes back to the central question. Even if they try to move forward with the impeachment of Joe Biden because they feel like they have to or they feel like they've got the evidence to prove their case. They still need the votes at the end of the day, that will take a long time to get there. So, and as we get closer and closer to an election year, things will get harder and harder. And just remember the first Trump impeachment, Nancy Pelosi announced that Trump the impeachment inquiry. Ultimately, there was about a vote about a month after that inquiry, began looking into President Trump's lead taking action to call for an investigation into the Biden's and withholding aid to Ukraine. That's what that investigation was about. That inquiry ended when the actual impeachment ended by the end of December of that year. It's about a three-month process, because Democrats were concern of a dragged into the election year. It could potentially boost President Trump heading into the election year. That's going to be one of the calculations Republicans make as well as they move down this route.",
