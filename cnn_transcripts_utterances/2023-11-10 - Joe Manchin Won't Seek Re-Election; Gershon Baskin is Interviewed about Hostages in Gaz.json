It becomes much more difficult.And all the historic accomplishments of the Biden administration to legislate are because Manchin ultimately came on board, consistent with his, you know, negotiations, conscience, his constituents, but how the system's supposed to work.

So, if a video was released last night, it was done with the agreement of Hamas.And it's part of the psychological warfare that's going on, aimed at putting pressure on the Israeli government through Israeli society. When they see live hostages, first of all, we're all very happy to see that they're alive, but we all have to understand that this is part of the negotiations that's going on, and it's a tool to apply pressure on Israel.",

The head - the former head of central intelligence in Lebanon went there after being engaged by the American diplomat Amos Hochstein.But my thinking, my understanding is that the more direct channel and the channel with more influence is the Egyptian channel, who have negotiated not only with Hamas but with the Islamic jihad. The last two rounds of warfare between Israel and Gaza was (ph) Islamic Jihad and it was the Egyptians who negotiated the ceasefire. The two women hostages who were released early on in the war were released through the Egyptian mediation, and they came from the Kassam (ph) fighting unit. And it was negotiated from Egypt's intelligence to the Hamas military command. So, I really would put more emphasis on there. Yesterday, some of the Hamas leaders from Doha traveled to Cairo and they met with Abas Camel (ph), who's the head of central intelligence in Egypt.

I mean the latest CNN poll for the president is not great. A loss of support among some crucial groups.But I'm going to focus in this weekend, Saturday at 8:00 a.m., on non- white male voters, because the poll finding that Trump is at 49 percent, and Biden is at 46 percent, is stunning. Now, that's within the margin of error. But consider that in 2020, President Biden won non-male white voters by 34 points, according to our exit polls. Now, will Biden ultimately win non-white male voters? History would suggest yes. No Republican of the last 50 years has won with that group. Trump came closest in 2020 at 31 percent. But we've got two questions we're going to try to answer, why is this happening, and where will it make a difference. First up, where will it make a difference? Right here where I am in Georgia. In 2020 there were more than 500,000 black male voters in this state. Biden won it by 12,000 votes or so. If enough black men stay home or vote for Trump, that could certainly switch this state back to Republicans. In Arizona, more than 300,000 Latino men voted. He won that state by fewer than 11,000 voters. Of course, if enough Latino men in Arizona switch to Republicans or stay home, that could be a Republican state again. Now the why. We've talked about the voting rights legislation that did not get passed, policing reform, immigration, but the economic conversation is so important here too. President Biden came here in October of 2020, in Atlanta, and said, a $15 minimum wage, we're going to get it done. Nobody should have to work two jobs to stay out of poverty. Well, the economic numbers came out from the Labor Department for the third quarter and said nearly 8.4 million people in this country are working at least two jobs. That's the highest number since 2019. The economic story is what people feel often and they feel first. So, we're going to talk with a pollster about the significance of these numbers. We're going to talk with someone who is focused on men of color and why they're voting the way they are. And then we've got someone from the Biden campaign. What are they going to do about this? You've got less than a year, and these numbers are softening.",
