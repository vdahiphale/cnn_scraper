He's tested positive for COVID, but he has asked me to read a statement. \"I am devastated by the senseless act of violence that took place last night in our city. My prayers are with all of those affected, the victims, their family, their friends, and their co-workers. I'm grate of for the quick actions taken by our first responders who rushed to the scene. Chesapeake is a tightknit community, and we are all shaken by this news. Together we will support each other throughout this time. Please keep us in your prayers.\" Before I turn it over to Chief Solesky, I'd like to make a few remarks. First of all, I'm very, very proud of the response of our public safety team and our other first responders, including those in human services and mental health. You hope a day like this never comes, but we train for it, we practice, we talk about it, we discuss, we learn lessons from other places. We try to put those lessons to good use, hoping that those lessons will never have to be put to use. But it's kept us in good standing today, and hopefully we'll continue to do so in the challenging days ahead. I also wanted to let everyone know that we as a city and a leadership team have been in very close communication throughout the evening with Mayor West and with the Chesapeake City Council. They have been fully briefed on everything that's going on from our response to what's moving forward in the days ahead, as well as Governor Youngkin and his staff, the attorney general and his team, members of our federal and state delegations, several of whom are here today. And I want to let you all know that we are united in our support for the victim, their families, their coworkers, and our entire community.

Not giving very much information about him, saying that the next of kin has not been notified, but we do know six victims here, four in the hospital according to the police chief there. They said that they executed a search warrant on the suspect's home and they are still getting information. It is not confirmed whether it was a supervisor, someone said that on the air earlier, but again, no confirmation there.A pistol they believe that he used, and they don't think that they found any other guns at this point, but of course this is all ongoing right now, this investigation. They're saying that this Walmart is closed and it will take them days to figure out what happened at the scene. And 10:12 p.m. the call came from 911, 10:14 the officers arrived, 10:16 they entered the store, and by 11:20 p.m. they said that the store was declared safe. By the time police got there, the suspect, they believe, had taken his own life with a gun. He was dead when they encountered the suspect.",

Normally with something like this, we would generally hear what sort of level they're at, so let's hope for the best. But we don't know.So let's process this with our senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe, who is former deputy director of the FBI. Andy, thank you very much for being here.

But until we know this person's kind of the details of his life, he may have lived alone, he may not have any kind of clearly identifying information in his residence, which we know they've searched, that would point to individuals, family members, those people may be out of state, they may be hard to locate themselves.

He gave a timeline of how this attack unfolded, saying that the first 911 calls came in at 12He did confirm what we had heard from a law enforcement source that this was an employee of the store. That's who the shooter was. They are not giving the shooter's name because the shooter's next of kin have not been contacted yet. We do know that we -- something we didn't know before, the type of weapon used, it was a pistol. I asked -- we all asked a couple of times whether there were any other weapons involved, and the chief said he did not know of any other weapons involved. Again, this is a current employee. We do not know whether all of the victims were employees, the chief did not have that information. We're also chasing some information that one of the bodies might have been outside, because we have heard accounts of that. But again, the chief did not -- he was not able to kind of confirm any of that information yet. We know that it took them several hours to process this crime scene, even after they declared it safe, Don, because they were combing through the Walmart trying to find out whether anybody was hiding, whether there were any other injured people in the building. And of course, this Walmart, like many of them, is a very large complex with rows upon -- you know, row upon row of merchandise, counters all over the place. And this store was currently open when this happened. He did not have the information of how many people were inside the building at the time.",
