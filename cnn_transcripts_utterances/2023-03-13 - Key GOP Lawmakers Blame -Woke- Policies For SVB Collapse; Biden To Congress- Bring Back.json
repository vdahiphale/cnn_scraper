And that imposing the requirements, the Dodd-Frank requirements, it put an outsized burden on us. That was his argument.Now, Barney Frank, remember, liberal congressman from Massachusetts. He was the House sponsor, lead House sponsor of Dodd-Frank. He introduced it with Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut. He joined the board of Signature Bank, that's the New York bank that New York had to take over over the weekend in '28 -- in 2015. In 2018, he said Barney Frank, who pushed the big Dodd-Frank said the rollback does not in any way weaken the regulations. When he said that, he was on the board of Signature Bank. Now, there is no doubt that Donald Trump and his administration wanted the rollback. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So we're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank.

You just heard their Donald Trump repeatedly saying let's repeal or at least revise Dodd-Frank.His top economic adviser at the beginning of administration, Gary Cohn, a quarter of the weekend, saying he's looked at what they did in 2018 when they revised Dodd-Frank. And he doesn't see anything in the changes that would have stopped. If he had left it in place that would have stopped what happened at Silicon Valley Bank, but progressives disagree.",

Over the weekend, members, were briefed by the Treasury Department. But it was not until last night around 7But they got very little notice before that briefing, and very few members actually joined that, I'm told. But nevertheless, it has not stopped the finger pointing. Republicans contend it has liberal policies, woke policies, as they say, of those two banks that led to the collapse. And the Democrats pointing to those changes that were made in the Trump administration, that 2018 vote to weaken Dodd-Frank saying that is a key part of what is actually happening in their view. That is what Elizabeth Warren argued this morning. She, of course, was central and championing the Dodd-Frank law, she pushed back against those efforts to weaken it back in 2018. She wrote an op ed this morning, \"Had Congress and the Federal Reserve not rolled back the stricter oversight, SVB and Signature would have been subject to stronger liquidity and capital requirements withstand financial shocks. They would have been required to conduct regular stress tests to expose their vulnerabilities and shore up their businesses. These bank failures were entirely avoidable.\" And you mentioned that it was a bipartisan majority, John, that did vote to do that in 2018. That included some members of the Senate who are up for re-election in this cycle. Joe Manchin, for one was one of -- ones that voted with Donald Trump, same with Jon Tester of Montana, other Democrats joining us as well. So John, if Washington and Congress has to intervene here in a more aggressive way, it'll be incredibly difficult to get a coalition to try to stabilize the system here was what the administration hopes. They can do this administratively and not have to have Congress intervene.",

What happened over the weekend happened because of woke policies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: This bank, they're so concerned with DEI and politics and all kinds of stuff. I think that really diverted from them focusing on their core mission. REP.

President Biden recently taken the side of Republicans, for example, on that controversial D.C. crime bill and he's proposing more restrictive policies to reduce the influx of migrants at the southern border. Our great reporters back at the table with us. So progressive see this as, you don't have a primary challenge, race to the middle, you know, get to the middle early before 2024.

So we're getting whacked from the left is not the worst thing that can happen to Biden at this moment. I mean, I think they, in some ways, welcome it.You have to understand that when Biden came in, I looked up some Gallup polling, in 2021, 24 percent of independents said they were very concerned about energy affordability, that number doubled last year. It's now 48 percent among independents. There's just a dramatic shift that's happened since the war in Ukraine. I think the immigration problem has gotten worse, not better. The President has to find a way to respond. And this is what the Biden people see is one of the big advantages right now. They don't have a primary. The Republicans is going to be running to the right for the next, you know, 10 months here, and he can now run to the center and get re-elected.",

They don't want extremism. And the country wants fiscal responsibility. The President taking on the deficit understands that.\" So there's someone who says, yay, yay, move to the middle. On the other side, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the head of the progressives in the House says, \"Nobody on the Republican side is ever going to say, 'Thank you, Joe Biden for being so tough on immigration or crime.' So that is not the right approach. It also is not the values-based approach that we need to have as the Democratic Party.\" The President's making these decisions, his team is behind these decisions.

And that's why a lot of the left has not trusted Biden, but the fact is, they voted for him because he was -- what was on the plate. I mean, I think he does have to walk this line and try to figure out how not to alienate the left, but be able to, you know, tack to the middle. Because when it comes to issues like crime, people do want something to be done. When it comes to issues like gas prices, people don't want to pay a lot at the pump.
