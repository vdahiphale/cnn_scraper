I'm Phil Mattingly, in for Jake Tapper today.And we are live outside the New York courthouse where today, one of Donald Trump's most loyal aides and the first former Trump White House employee to testify, took the stand in the hush money cover up trial. Hope Hicks acknowledged to the jury she was nervous to testify at times. She giggled in one instance, actually cried on the stand leading to a brief delay in the trial. Now Hicks describes starting to work for the Trump organization in 2014 before becoming the Trump campaign spokeswoman in the 2016 race, and ultimately, the White House communications director. Now she testified about the campaign's panic behind the scenes when they learned of the now infamous Access Hollywood tape that Donald Trump was upset when he heard the news and staffers agreed that this was a crisis. Picks went on the testify that when she learned about Karen McDougal, who alleged a nearly year-long affair with Donald Trump, when contacted by \"The Wall Street Journal\" just four days before the 2016 election. I want to dive right in with CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid and Manhattan criminal defense attorney Stacy Schneider. Paula, let's start with you, because this was a significant day. Everyone was waiting for Hope Hicks to testify, see where she was going to go with things, given her proximity to the former president. But the atmosphere I think was also critical in this moment. Hope Hicks said from the top, I'm very nervous.",

And it was a few moments after she said that while they were switching to defense lawyers, that she broke down on the stand, one of our colleagues on the side said it was when she realized that she had just provided something really damaging against her former boss. Now, we'll say, once defense attorney has got a crack at her, she also provided some helpful testimony to them, most notably that Trump was concerned about the impact that the Karen McDougal story would have on his wife, and that's really a large part of the defense.

But the big takeaway from Hope Hicks' testimony is Michael Cohen, nomatter how hard Trump's defense is trying to distance Michael Cohen from campaign activity. He's still calling Hope Hicks all the time and saying, I've got this intel on Stormy Daniels, I've got a negative statement on Stormy Daniels retracting the story, so campaign, don't worry because I've got it covered. So, you know, whether he was in the campaign or out of the campaign or acting as Trump's attorney, it's all connect -- Trump's world is all connected. The campaign, his private life, Michael Cohen, and even though we were talking about just now and throughout the broadcast today, how the defense scored this victory because they were able to get Hope Hicks to say, yeah, Trump was really worried about Melania. Well, why wouldn't he be? It's an allegation about an affair. It's disruptive, but that doesn't take away the motive and the intent and the concern Trump would very likely have on his campaign and bringing in the whole trial is about bringing all of these witnesses into show. Trump's motive and can -- an intent allegedly was to benefit his campaign, his family may have been a motive, but it's likely secondary considering all the machinations we've seen so far, and we're not even halfway through the trial.",

And I'm not sure you can find a lot of people who have a kind of a more analogous path than Hope Hicks than you, Alyssa, on some level, including the idea you've testified in front of different panels related to the former president.

She was close with the family, like truly a friend of the family.So I think for her, this was a lot more. She felt like she was having to testify against somebody that she cared about. For someone like me and others who spoke out just about his unfitness for office, the -- you know, just the oath -- trying to overturn the election, the events around January 6, it was frankly a lot less emotional. It was truly just this is what's right for the country. It's the obligation we felt we had as public servants who collected a taxpayer salary. This is a very different individual without regard.

Where jurors are filing in, walking behind him, where you would normally have a buffer zone that's quite extensive Secret Service. Now you've got different court personnel who were lining the hallway, lining the actual aisle. But in all respects, it showed you just how this is an actual criminal proceeding in this level.

It seemed to me, unlike the demeanor were hearing about when say David pecker, who was someone who knew for decades it wasn't like somebody who is who knew everything about them, although he certainly had a relationship with them it took a very different scenario.And I couldn't help but wonder, given that Hope Hicks at first come into the family operation through his own daughter, Ivanka, they're not that far apart in age, frankly Ivanka and Hope Hicks, although Hope Hicks is younger. And I couldn't help but think of bout the fact that she was being brought in and part as a kind of character witness in the way that Rhona had been, the right-hand woman of Donald Trump. They both talked about him and being having their trust and respect. They both talked about their relationship, the excitement and what she called chaos, but a good chaos at times. But then and there was this moment fell when she described the Access Hollywood tape and the fallout as a crisis. She wasn't mincing words. She wasn't trying to hedge and suggest I mean, wasn't a thing. I mean, I guess it was. She knew that it was. They talked through the Republican response what was happening at that time. He was leaning in. I understand as well on those issues, but I was looking to the jury. I wanted to see how the jury was receiving her because in the end, that's all that matters for the prosecution. And I noticed that when they were taking notes and her testimony first before she was crying and emotional, they were looking towards the person asking the question, the prosecution, he looked back at her almost like a tennis match. But then after the moment she began to cry they were leaned in to understand, I think in part what had happened, but also what was going to happen next. Was she going to be triggered somehow again? Did her testimony the offend Trump in some ways? Did it help the prosecution? And I think that was the moment you realized how much of an important witness this was, for the same reason you were leaning in waiting for Hope Hicks or some connection to come in, so was the jury. And I'll end you with this because this is how Emil Bove ended. He said, so after all going through her resume and working for the White House, et cetera, he asked her, but in all this, you had no idea was going on back at Trump headquarters and documents, right, in business records? And she says, no, I did not ,which remember that's why we're here. We're not here just to talk about whether he respected his wife or her opinion right here and talk about whether or not Mitch McConnell or Senator John McCain criticized Trump. We were here because its a falsified business records case. And so as important of a witness as she was to connect the dots, the area where the prosecution must prove is there a case about falsified records -- well, that's a missing jigsaw piece that we will look forward to hearing in the de account.",

He was rude, at times obnoxious, and that really hurt him when it came to the verdicts in those cases. And they said that he had learned some lessons there. But I think what we've seen is in his answers and evolution, making it seem less likely that he's inclined to do that. That could be because he sees the risks. It could also be because the defense is like, we don't need it. We're really doing well here with the witnesses that the prosecution has put on. I hope they do well with their own witnesses as well.

TOM DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION:  I think we're going to get a ruling on those other gag order issues early next week. I don't think the judge has a huge amount of patients for Trump and violations of the gag orders that happened in the past. That said, the latest batch of alleged gag order violations didn't seem to irk the judge quite as much as the first batch does, although I would expect them to impose some sort of sanction, I don't think he's going to the hammer here.

DUPREE:  Well, I don't know if he's next, but I can assure you, we're going to hear from Michael Cohen at some point. I mean, he's the one who's going to have to connect all the dots here, Phil, because what the prosecutors had been doing is putting forward an arguably compelling circumstantial case. They're showing that Michael Cohen was working behind the scenes, busy is a beaver trying to open LLCs and cut deals and that sort of thing. But what the prosecutors have yet to do is to directly connect Trump to what Cohen was doing. That's the missing link. They need to draw that line. I'm not sure how they're going to draw that line other than putting Michael Cohen on the stand. And when they do that, its going to be Katy bar the door and cross- examination because you know, that is the moment that the Trump defense team has been waiting for all of these months.",

Also Karen McDougal, again, her catch and kill deal is not at the center of this criminal case, unclear what additional value she would add. So I'm sure they might have some other summary witnesses, perhaps these folks who get up, help introduce evidence is possible. They can call some folks who worked at the Trump Organization. We know the defense lawyers will do that to bolster their argument that Trump really wasn't aware of what was going on with the invoices and this retainer, but it is possible that Cohen could go next week.",

Donald Trump never portrayed himself as this great moral arbiter, if you will, this great spiritual person. It's just not who he is. And the reality is as a strategist, when I think about why people aren't concerned about this, I'm not thinking about Phil, what they're telling pollsters in terms of, oh, I'm a good person, I'm a decent person.

I went and took a look at the top websites viewed in the country. Two of the most top sites in the country, Phil, are rather salacious, if you will. So the point that I'm trying to make here is that there are a lot of Americans who will look at this and I say, well, he's a guy. It doesn't matter, just like an Access Hollywood tape came out, a lot of people say, well, that's just the way men talk.

So, it's not just this case that will be a deciding factor, but its still totality. The one thing about today's testimony though that is like kind of sigh of relief almost as someone who is looking at the 2016 election and saying, how can people not care? Is that when you talk about grabbing some women by their private parts, you know that's wrong. Even if that's just how men talk. And when you are busted and caught on tape, and it should have tanked your campaign, and the fact was today we know they knew it was wrong, too. For so long and the Trump era and the Trump world and pretended like that's just how men talk, no, they know what was wrong, and now they are had to -- Hope Hicks had to admit on the stand today that it was wrong.
