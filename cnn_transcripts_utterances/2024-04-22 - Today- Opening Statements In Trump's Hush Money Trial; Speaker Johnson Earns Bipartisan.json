I'm Kasie Hunt.We're just a few hours away from opening statements in the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Donald Trump facing 34 felony charges in an alleged hush money scheme to conceal an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trump will be in the New York courtroom with the presidential election just six months away. He has, of course, wasted no time attacking the judge in the case right after the jury was seated on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is a witch hunt by numerous judges -- Democrat judges. You take a look at it. Engoran is a whack job. This is a giant witch hunt to try and hurt a campaign that's beating the worst president in history. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He is the former publisher of the National Enquirer.Joining me now is former federal prosecutor Andrew Cherkasky. Andrew, good morning. Thank you so much for being here. This is a real cast of characters that we are expecting to come through this courtroom. Why start with Pecker? ANDREW CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR (via Skype):  Well, he is the one who essentially initiated the payments to Stormy Daniels and that is an important factor in all of this. The payment to Stormy Daniels is the initiation of what they say is Donald Trump's efforts to effectively interfere with the election by making a payment -- a hush money payment that was not reported in any sort of campaign finance books and was part of his overall scheme to interfere with that election. Now, the prosecutors have to prove several layers of Donald Trump's specific intent and it all goes to the question of whether he was making that payment in order to -- in order to help him through the election versus what the defense is going to say, which is effectively, that he was doing it to protect his own reputation and the reputation of his businesses.",

There's a question about whether or not Trump is going to testify in his own defense when you get to that phase of the trial.If you're the prosecution -- first of all, do you think that that's a realistic threat that Trump is making or a realistic promise, depending on how you want to look at it? And two, what are the risks for Trump? You've prosecuted these type -- I mean, you are -- you are a former prosecutor. How are you, if you're in the shoes of the prosecutors here in this case, thinking about the possibilities and the things you need to accomplish if Donald Trump were to actually take the stand?",

And I am a criminal defense attorney, at this point, so I see it from both sides.Now, if Donald Trump chooses to testify, it's because the underlying elements of this case require the prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt what was the specific intent of Donald Trump himself. And so, if he testifies, he's effectively getting up there to say that it was not his intention to cook the books, as it were, or to interfere with the election by not reporting certain payments to election officials. The prosecutors, meanwhile, are going to have to build a case to show that Donald Trump has limited credibility. That he's lied on several occasions, depending on how you do that. And so, the prosecutors have no doubt prepared that. They've prepared a long list of specific instances of untruthfulness and that's what ultimately will be the fight here -- if he testifies, can he be believed?",

It will likely sound much like the original indictment but will be much more colorful, I'm sure. Trial lawyers, at the end of the day, are putting on a bit of a show for the jury.[05:35:10] We can expect the defense will similarly take their opportunity to give an opening statement and they will start to present issues with credibility of witnesses, but also really hammer on the legal elements and how difficult it is for the prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the thoughts and the intentions in Donald Trump's mind at the time that he was engaged and effectively paying Stormy Daniels to remain silent on the issues of her alleged affair with Donald Trump.",

We mentioned a few things there -- his own son who is entering the Naval Academy, Donald Trump -- but it was a cast of so many others -- such a weird, wide cast. It was Zelenskyy himself. It was President Biden and the CIA director. It was folks like Mike McCaul who you saw. And it was, like, evangelical Christians -- Ukrainian Christians talking about the impact on their own lives. It was the history of John Quincy Adams. Like, it is -- he really had a moment where he went for everyone. We've been talking about how he was -- his journey from back-bencher to House Speaker -- sort of a cheap, easy way to say it. But he went from a guy who didn't have to deal with the consequences of the decisions he would make to this moment. And it certainly seems that he reached that moment of reckoning and thought well, if this is why I lose my job, so be it. But I think he still may lose his job. And he is -- if he seems stronger it's only because there's a coalition of Democrats led by the Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries who are working now, it appears, to be ready to sort of prop him up and keep him in the speakership.

Johnson waited all of these months -- and you heard Ukrainian President Zelenskyy over the weekend saying -- essentially saying it is -- it's been very, very long. We're very grateful to have it.

The world number one had the shot of the day with a chip-in for birdie on the 10th hole. But she was not done. Her tee shot on the par-3 17th hole nearly went in for the hole-in-one. She has been playing so phenomenally. The 25-year-old finished in style, too. She had a birdie at the end of the day on the last hole to win by two strokes. The only cool thing that she could do to cool herself down was, of course, cannonball into the pond in front of the 18th green. A lot of women have made that jump. And good for her. She has just been out of control -- five straight tournament wins. Remarkable stuff from Nelly.",
