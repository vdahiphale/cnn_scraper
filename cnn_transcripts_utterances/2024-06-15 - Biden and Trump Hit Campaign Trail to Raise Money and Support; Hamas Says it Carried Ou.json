I was looking at the screen right here, 12 days, two weeks. Boom. First presidential debate of this election season between President Joe Biden and the former President Donald Trump, and this weekend, the candidates are out on the campaign trail. After spending the week on the world stage at the G7 Summit, President Biden is trading world leaders for Hollywood leaders. Biden is in Los Angeles tonight at a fundraiser that is breaking a new record for the Democratic Party. We are going to have more on that in a moment, but tickets range from $250.00 to $500,000.00 with a contest for small dollar donors. They could when tickets to the event and a chance to meet President Biden, former President Obama, and Oscar winners, Julia Roberts and George Clooney. Jimmy Kimmel will moderate a Q&amp;A with Biden and Obama tonight. CNN White House correspondent, Arlette Saenz joins us now. All right, Arlette, a big haul for the campaign even before the event starts, but obviously that's not the only thing that they are focused on with the debate not so far away at this point.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Omar. But tonight, Biden campaign officials are saying that this will be the biggest Democratic fundraiser in history. The president heading into the night has already raised $28 million, really tapping into some help from celebrity friends like George Clooney and Julia Roberts as well as his former boss, former President Barack Obama to try to entice people to buy tickets to this event.Now, the campaign has been working and trying to engage celebrities in different ways to try to help mobilize voters, and whether its fundraising or to get out to the polls in November, but this is also coming at a time when Biden is trying to maintain his cash advantage over former President Donald Trump. Biden has led Trump in fundraising through most of the year, but recently Trump has really made some significant gains in his own fundraising operation, especially after securing his party's nomination. Now, tonight's event is really modeled after an event that the Biden campaign did back in March in New York City, when Biden appeared with Obama, as well as former President Bill Clinton. That event raked in $26 million. Tonight's event will eclipse that. They have been trying to draw in those high dollar donors, but also making those appeals to small-dollar donors as well. There was a contest, as you mentioned to come to this fundraiser, to meet the two presidents and these Hollywood stars. The campaign has also offered another opportunity for people to donate about $20.00 and have a chance to tune in virtually. So the Biden campaign is really pouring a lot of focus and energy into this fundraiser tonight, as they are hoping to post a very big haul, but also so as campaign officials argue, they believe that this will also be a show of force from the entertainment industry in its support for Biden.",

But here at this event, Turning Point Action, just such a key strategic partner for the president that is because these are the true believers, these are the die-hards. I see people here proudly wearing shirts with Trump's mugshot on it. There are people here holding up signs with Trump's mugshot that is saying \"never surrender.\" And the organization itself is planning to spend over a hundred million dollars on get out the vote efforts not only here in Michigan, but in battleground states across the country.

Now, it is not clear at this point if that bomb was attached in some way or fixed to the vehicle, or if it was a missile or projectile fired at the vehicle. But the armored personnel carrier itself had explosives already on board that were part of its use as a combat engineering battalion and that is when the IDF says those explosives detonated, either as a result of that side bomb or for some other reason, and that in and of itself is a problem because they are supposed to withstand any force that would cause them to explode. Still, the IDF says it resulted in what they called a significant explosion, making it difficult not only to locate remains of the eight soldiers, but also parts of the vehicle itself that had exploded. So that part from the IDF side is still under investigation. The Al- Qassam Brigades, that is the military wing of Hamas, say they laid what they call a complex trap attacking first, a military bulldozer and then when a rescuer extraction unit came, they say they then fired a missile at that armored vehicle and caused it to explode. At the same time as this is happening, Rafah Civil Defense Unit says but there was significant artillery and airstrikes in this part of Gaza since early this morning, so it is possible they are describing the exact same incident here as this is all under investigation.

There was bonfires as part of the protests, that was one of the most stunning images. According to police, there was at least one arrest for starting those bonfires. You see the force and frankly, you see the fury in these, week after week, for a tremendous amount of time, the longevity here is just as stunning as size of the protests, yes, they took a break after October 7th and became part of trying to help the military and the country in that time. But you now see them returning and I suspect, they will be here week after week calling on the government to resign as they are furious with how this government has handled not only the war to this point, but the negotiations about a hostage deal and the country in general as the war drags on nearing its nine-month mark now.",

CNN's Patrick Oppmann got to board one of these ships though and has this exclusive look inside. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Several hundred Cubans wait in the broiling sun tour a Russian warship. Russian diplomats told me the public would be allowed to visit the Admiral Gorshkov, one of the most modern warships in President Vladimir Putin's Navy, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. It is the first of three days the ship will receive visitors, a rare opportunity for people here to see the up-close a frigate belonging to Cuba's Cold War era comrades. OPPMANN (on camera): We are going to have to get in line and see if we are able to board. OPPMANN (voice over): After nearly three hours waiting, having my Cuban resident ID card run through a database by police and passing through metal detectors, we are told to board the Gorshkov. Just next to us is the nuclear nuclear-powered submarine, Kazan, the first of its kind to come to port here. The visit of the four Russian ships, the largest Russian convoy to Cuba in years is not a threat to the US, both Russian in Cuban officials say, but the US is closely tracking the ships and their movements. A sign in English by the gang plank to the Gorshkov says the ships \"main purpose is combat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\" Although none of the vessels were currently carrying nuclear weapons, the Cuban Armed Forces Ministry said. \"Hello,\" I say in rudimentary Russian to the sailors aboard the Gorshkov. We are only allowed on the main deck and Russian sailors watch our every move.

This is greater than your standard descent, it is greater than a normal descent and same with the climb. The climb was a much greater than a normal climb, which is you know, three airliners can do 2,500 to 3,000 feet per minute is kind of typical.

The man had entered the U.S. through the southern border and requested asylum, raising no red flags when initially vetted by immigration officials, but it was the later discovery of their potential ties to an ISIS affiliate that set off a flurry of urgent investigative efforts by FBI agents and analysts coast-to-coast. No specific attack planning was detected, sources said, but senior U.S. officials decided late last week to arrest the men and begin proceedings to expel them from the country, rather than continuing surveilling them to determine any possible plot. The FBI investigation continues, sources say, along with a renewed focus on threats from central Asia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATIE BO LILLIS, CNN SENIOR INTELLIGENCE REPORTER: And we have seen a number of high-profile attacks and plots, both planned and carried out by Tajik nationals acting on behalf of ISIS-K, several in Europe, as well as in particular, the deadly attack on a concert hall in Moscow earlier this year that killed more than a hundred people.
