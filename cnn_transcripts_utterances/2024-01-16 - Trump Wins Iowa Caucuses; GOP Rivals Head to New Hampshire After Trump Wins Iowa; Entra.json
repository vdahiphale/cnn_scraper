Iran claims have destroyed a spy base for Israel's Mossad and the sides of anti-Iranian terrorist groups. Kurdish leaders in Erbil Iraq report at least four civilians were killed. Iran says some of the missile strikes were in response to the recent ISIS terror attack in command near the grave of slain military leader, Qasem Soleimani. The U.S. says no American personnel or facilities were targeted and that it supports the territorial integrity of Iraq. Well, meantime, Houthi militants in Yemen are sending a clear warning to anyone planning to launch an attack on the country. It comes after they claimed responsibility for attacking an American vessel in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. U.S. officials say an anti-ship ballistic missiles struck a bulk carrier causing minor damage. Here is what a Houthi military spokesperson had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN.

When you say that you want to have a federal law at 18 weeks or 20 weeks that would override a state like Iowa, that is enacted pro-life protections. That would mean more abortions, not less abortions, because very few abortions are happening that late anyways.So, he has flip flopped on this issue. I don't know if it's because of political convenience, or this is all where he always believed in. But here's the thing. Some issues are pretty fundamental. How do you flip flop on something like the sanctity of life? I think, though, one thing in this race that I think is important to point out is Donald Trump flip flopping on the right to life. Why shouldn't he have to answer questions? I mean, he's running on things like deporting illegals and building a wall. But he did that in 16 and didn't get it done. So, I think he owes answers to those questions. He has not been willing to do that. Obviously, if you go by polling, it hasn't hurt. But I think now that we're in the new year, I think voters do expect you to answer those questions. I think Iowans expect you to show up and debate. But he couldn't even negotiate funding for a border wall when he had a Republican Congress. He is now running in 2024. promising to do the exact same thing he promised in '16 and didn't deliver on.

When Republicans are feeling wounded, they're going, hey, maybe we do need a different direction. That was where Ron DeSantis was pulling the strongest against Donald Trump. Now, the question of all of these tough arguments, he is starting to roll out now. Would that have worked if he rolled them out earlier? There? I do have a little bit more question there. There is a lot of evidence that the harder you hit Trump, the more there is this antibody response from Republican voters, they feel the need to defend him. But I do wonder, there is got to be a difference, I think between how a Republican voter hears a criticism like that, from Ron DeSantis, who used to get rave reviews at CPAC.

But in a somewhat unconventional schedule moving forward, he will be immediately going to South Carolina tomorrow for a stop before continuing on to New Hampshire. New Hampshire of course is up next on the primary calendar.But DeSantis' aides and sources familiar tell me and our colleague Steve Contorno, that they really see South Carolina as the next target where they really want to try to knock the former governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, out of the race in her own home state. We're told the campaign staff are moving from Iowa to South Carolina, that they think that Nikki Haley is vulnerable after people are beginning to give her a closer look. And they also, sources tell us, that they believe that Donald Trump could be vulnerable moving forward if he ends up being convicted on any of the counts that he is currently facing. But there is, of course, one x-factor here and that's money. Do they have enough money to continue going forward? We are told by sources that they do, but we also know that starting on Tuesday morning rather, they will begin calling donors all over again, telling them this is a marathon, that they came in second place, that they have got to get South Carolina where they can knock out Haley and make it a two-man race. But Abby, the question is can they actually get that done? They think the voters there in South Carolina are their kind of voters that will react well to Ron DeSantis' message. But the fact remains he did not do quite as well as they had potentially hoped that he would do here in Iowa. He did come in second, but was still a very distant second from the former president, a lot of ground to make up there. And they spent millions of dollars and a significant amount of time here in Iowa to get that distant second place finish. But again, DeSantis now moving ahead in this race with that first stop in South Carolina and then on to New Hampshire tomorrow. Abby?",
