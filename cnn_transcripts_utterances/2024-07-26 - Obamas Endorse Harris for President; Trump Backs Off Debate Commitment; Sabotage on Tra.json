So, certainly there could be an opportunity for him to use this to reopen the conversation about the terms. And then if the terms do not change, then try to reopen the conversation on the timing.The Trump campaign has been non-committal at best to most of these events. And Harris was trying to seize that moment and seize that spotlight yesterday. She walked up to a group of reporters while she was doing some travel of her own and walked up to them and said that Donald Trump was backpedaling, that she was ready to go. Of course, we'll see if after that critical endorsement from former President Obama changes things because on social media, Trump had said that that was one of the reasons why he wasn't planning to participate, or hadn't at least committed.

I was thrilled to see the Obamas and the Clintons endorse the vice president. But so much of this is just organic. I mean I talked to my kids about TikTok, and there are young people, but they're not being coordinated by central command, producing hilarious, biting, effective commentary. And I think this is what has Trump so scared. You know voters are like - they're kids or horses, they can just smell fear. And this guy stinks. He reeks of fear. He's panic-stricken. He's - that's why he's crawfishing out of the debate. I mean when you're 78 and out of shape, the moonwalk is really not a good look for you. And so I think that he just doesn't know what to do with a movement like this. And now Kamala Harris has got to keep building on it. She's got to keep reaching out, keep going. She's got to go to rural and ex- urban (ph) areas where Democrats didn't use to go. And I think that's her next step. And I think that's probably what she'll do.",

So, look, we know the Democrat Party, if her polls don't continue tohold up or get better, they'll cast her aside, just like they did Joe Biden. So, let's wait till she's actually the nominee and then actually go out and debate. But I think going back to that earlier point, you blunt the momentum with the truth. Americans cannot afford what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have done to our country. Our border is wide open. Kamala Harris doesn't think it should be a crime and wants to give them free health care. The more you go out there and talk about the bad policies, that is the reason why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were the most unpopular president and vice president in the last 70 years, you keep reminding them of it, people will come back after this little honeymoon period and the campaign will continue just like it was going.",

Tens of thousands of military and police officers - the streets are completely closed now. There's about 100 cops for every pedestrian. They are - they were fortifying that area. And then, of course, in the middle of the night, the day before, a sabotage. They're - we don't know who did it. The ministers from France are suggesting it's domestic in the sense of maybe politically motivated. But it was done for pure disruption because it wasn't - no one - it wasn't done at a time when anyone could get hurt.

They're just going through fields and other areas. So, the exact target may have been relatively easy. These are just arsons that are meant to disrupt the rail line. This is not a sophisticated cyberattack. This is not something where, you know, lots of people are in the train station. Those are the areas that were fortified. The rail line is hard to fortify, especially in - in France where rail is sort of a dominant form of transportation here.
