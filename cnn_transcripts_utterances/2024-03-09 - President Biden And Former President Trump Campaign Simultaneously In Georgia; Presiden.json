I'm Rahel Solomon in New York live, in for Fredricka Whitfield today who is off.All eyes on the state of Georgia today where the Biden-Trump rematch is about to take center stage in that critical battleground state. Any moment now, Biden is expected to land in Atlanta. He will be appearing at a campaign event in the next few hours, and his presumptive Republican rival, Donald Trump, is holding a rally in Rome. Thats north of Atlanta. And Georgia is a key swing state that Biden won in 2020 by less than a percentage point. And it is the only swing state among primary contests happening on Tuesday. We have team coverage of these dueling campaign events. Steve Contorno is with the Trump campaign, but let's begin with Priscilla Alvarez. She is live in Atlanta where Biden is holding that campaign event in just a few hours from now. Priscilla, set the stage for us on what we can expect from the president.",

We got a preview of what that looked like yesterday when he was in Pennsylvania where he used forceful language to go after former President Donald Trump while also laying out his own accomplishments and trying to relay that to voters and make the connection between what they're feeling and what the administration has provided to that effect. Now, of course, Rahel, as you noted there at the beginning, this is acrucial state for President Biden. It's one he only narrowly won in 2020, and its one were early polls show that Donald Trump holds the lead right now. And so key to what he is doing here today is going to be voter outreach and connecting and engaging with those voters in the state. And Democratic strategists tell me that that is really going to be key at a time when this time around we don't expect to have those key statewide races that also bolstered who was showing up to the polls in November. This is going to have to be coming from a place of enthusiasm for President Biden, which as we have seen in polls, has waned among some voters, particularly black voters. So that is who the president is going to have to talk to you today. Now, while he's here, he is going to accept an endorsement from three political action committees that represent Asian Americans and black and Latino Americans. So all of that coming together in his visit today.",

It was starting because they landed here in LAX, but there was a problem with the hydraulic system. This was an Airbus 320 with 105 passengers, five crew members, and they had to make that emergency landing here at LAX. Eventually, all of these passengers were put into another flight and they made their way to Mexico City. But again, just a very scary situation.And it wasn't the only incident yesterday, because there was another flight that was going for Memphis to Houston, and that flight head 160 passengers with six crew members. And this was a Boeing 737 Max. And what happened here was it was raining. And so as this plane is landing its skids off the runway and into a grassy area. So the deplaning situation here was very scary and complicated for passengers. And then of course, there was that other very scary incident on Thursday. This was a flight from San Francisco to Osaka in Japan. And what happened here was that the tire fell off. A lot of us have seen those images. This was a Boeing 777 with 235 passengers, 14 crew members. And this tire falls off the plane into some cars. This flight also diverts to Los Angeles. And again, eventually they made their way to Japan on another flight. But passengers, of course, terrified of what was going on. And then on Monday this week another terrifying situation. This was a flight from Houston to Fort Myers, and this was a Boeing 737 with 161 passengers, six crew members. And what happens here is that the engine in just some bubble wrap, and it goes up in flames. CNN spoke to a passenger on that flight who said that they thought they were going to die. They sent an email, he sent an email to his wife, essentially saying goodbye, saying that he loved her. And this is what a lot of these passengers have gone through this week, just terrifying moments. And so of course, these incidents are all under investigation.

That's where you want to see it. That's consistent with the Federal Reserve's inflation target.
