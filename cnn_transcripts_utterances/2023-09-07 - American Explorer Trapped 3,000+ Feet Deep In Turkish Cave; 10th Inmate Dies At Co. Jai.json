Remember there are various base camp's underground. You mentioned around 3,400 feet. Picture this, this is almost three times the height of the Empire State Building.That is how deep is under grind right now. 150 rescuers on the ground trying to assist including Americans. So, Mark Dickey fell sick on Saturday, that is six days ago. So, we're talking about something that has been going on for quite some time. He has received already six units of blood, he's stable, he's able to walk. But if you know anything about caving, you need to be crawling and climbing, you need to be in a certain state of physical and mental strength to be able to get out. We're anticipating that this could take a matter of days to be able to get him out with the assistance that they're talking about. They're talking about a stretcher. Now, imagine a stretcher being taken underground, to try and get through those narrow spaces, that perhaps might not be the best option. At this point in time, from what we understand from rescue operations. They're trying to stabilize him to get him into a better physical state. This is a very experienced caver. He's had over three decades of caving around the world. So, that is going to help pull him through. But then the question becomes, will he be physically fit enough to be able to be removed? What we do know is that there are many teams on the ground to try and figure out a way firstly, to get as quickly as possible into that base camp to get him more medical assistance and then way to get him out on a good day, Kate. It takes around 15 hours with a very experienced caver to be able to get to the very top.",

It's as if Beijing thinks it's getting what it wants, but not quite enough to earn Xi visits to the G20. There is going to be another chance for Biden and Xi to meet this year.

But historically, unconventionally, India is the name that has been used, India as the name everybody recognize, everybody not recognized as most Indians refer to themselves as such as Indians.Bharat as you point out is something that is especially favored by Hindu nationalists, although not exclusively by them, but certainly by the Hindu nationalist. There is an echo in Bharat and the name of Modi's party, which is the Bharatiya Janata Party, the BJP. So, it's a little bit of political signaling, political propaganda. It shouldn't really take attention away from the main agenda up G20. This is the domestic consumption. The international audience is not really intended for this messaging.
