It has been seesawing a little bit all day, but again, basically flat right now. The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are slightly lower as well. Those are the markets and these are the main events: Investors look ahead to a busy week at the start of earnings season, and fresh inflation data as well. The Pentagon is trying to determine the scale of a leak of classified documents online. And an inside look at the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral in France. Coming to you live from New York, it is Monday, April 10th. I'm Zain Asher  in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, good evening. Tonight, we are monitoring the situation in Louisville, Kentucky, where at least four people were killed in a shooting at a bank. Officials are scheduled to hold a press conference any minute now. We'll bring that press conference to you when it happens. The Pentagon says it is still working to determine the scope and scale of recent Top Secret Intelligence leaks. Many of the documents appear to have come from within The Pentagon. Some expose the extent of US eavesdropping on allies like for example, South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine. Others reveal America's penetration of the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Kremlin's private army, the Wagner Group. Oren Liebermann joins us live now from The Pentagon. So, Oren, just walk us through what we learned from these leaks in terms of weaknesses within the Russian military and Ukraine's military as well.",

      "sentences": "There are a number of different topics covered within the 53 pages CNN has reviewed, and one ofthe great concerns of the Defense Department and the entire US government and the Biden administration is that there may be more out there already, or more that may be coming. Remember, this was on a chat messaging platform known as Discord for quite a number of weeks before it was disseminated further, and it was only at that point that the US government and the highest levels, highest officials in the government became aware of it. In fact, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and President Joe Biden were briefed just late last week, when the documents had already been leaked for quite some time here. In terms of what's in here, first, there is an incredibly detailed assessment of Ukraine's military, or at least parts of Ukraine's military, including their capabilities when it comes to air defense, how much ammunition they have, how long that ammunition might last to defend Ukraine's skies, and then a detailed look at some of the offensive actions Ukraine has taken, some of the results of Russian strikes, information that would be incredibly helpful if it fell into Russian hands for them to see what's happened there. Even if some of this is a bit dated, some of the dates on these documents from late February to early March, it would still be incredibly valuable in the wrong hands, and that is the sort of damage that might come from this, as well as compromising how this information was received, whether it's through human Intelligence, or sources, or signals Intelligence, which might lead for example, the Russians to change how they are communicating and make it impossible to pick up on those signals again. But some of these documents are damaging from a completely different perspective, because as you pointed out, they reveal the extent or at least to some extent, US spying on allies such as Israel and South Korea, internal deliberations. Some allies have sort of shrugged it off, while South Korea said they wants an explanation for this, and to look at how this came about. And because of that, the US government is looking and reaching out to allies and partners to make sure that there is no damage to the relationships and to work through if there have been some issues because of that. So there is a rather large effort now, not only, of course, a criminal investigation from the Department of Justice to figure out who was behind this, but then to make sure this doesn't happen again, and to make sure that relations with allies and partners remain in good standing. So, the extent of the damage here is still being figured out, but you see some of it playing out very much in real time.",

He has more than 25 years of experience as an Intelligence officer in the US Air Force. Colonel Leighton, thank you so much for being with us again. I just spoke to you a few hours ago, but just the fact that some of the pages within these documents appear to be doctored, what does that tell us? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:   So it tells us several things. So the initial dump, it appears to have been on this platform called Discord. From there, it went into three areas. It went through the 4chan messaging board system, and then from there, it made its way into Twitter and Telegram. Especially on telegram and to some extent on Twitter, Russian accounts, seem to have propagated these revelations of these documents, and as a result, what we're seeing is that some of these documents have actually been altered. For example, as Oren was mentioning, the casualty counts on the Russian and Ukrainian side, they basically reversed the numbers in just some extent, they made the Ukrainian losses seem much worse than we normally assess, and the Russian loss is much better than we normally assess. So that is one example of the types of things that they've been doing. They're also using some of this information to sow discord in Africa, among some of the countries in Sub Saharan Africa and in the Sahel region. So this is an area where there is a lot of effort being made to, in essence, move the diplomatic goalposts and move them more in the favor of Russia, as opposed to the United States and Ukraine and the NATO alliance.",

I could see the Russians using this information to determine how much and how often they would be firing their weapons into the Bakhmut area to attack the Ukrainian positions there, so that's the kind of thing that they could use with this and, of course, it becomes very dangerous for the Ukrainians from a tactical perspective.",

Let us talk about the Jobs Report that we got on Friday. I mean, it does show somewhat of a cooling beginning, but boy, oh, boy, is the labor market resilient in this country, despite what the Fed is doing.

      "sentences": "That's right.So we're still seeing a very strong labor market here in the United States. So 236,000 jobs added over the past month. So, that is a step down from the roughly 360,000 pace we saw over the prior 12 months, but that is still well above what we saw over the last cycle average. But I think the direction is important as we think about where monetary policy goes ahead, so we're seeing not just in the jobs numbers that we got on Friday, but really an array of data pointing towards the fact that the labor market is cooling overall, as well as we are looking at some inflation data that suggests that, at least over the coming months, we should start to see a more market slowing that suggests that the Fed is probably near the end of its tightening cycle.

So we we're looking in terms of overall inflation, a little bit of a friendlier print, but a lot of that has to do with the recent dropin gasoline prices that moved through March. So since then, we've seen gas prices move back up, so it's really not indicative of necessarily where the trend is going forward. But if you look at the core Consumer Price Index, so excluding some of those more volatile items like food and energy, what we're expecting there is still another pretty strong current, so 0.4 percent, and if you're looking at what that means for just the rough run rate of inflation in recent months, still probably somewhere close to five percent, still well above the Fed's target and still not enough to keep up with wage growth that we're seeing here in the US labor market.",

So essentially, to pull off that soft landing, you had to get growth to slow just enough below potential,but not so much that it actually turned negative and that is a pretty difficult thing to do when you only have potential GDP running close to two percent. So there is not a wide margin for error in that dynamic, but to some extent, I think the Jobs Report suggested that it's maybe not going to be quite as hard of a landing as perhaps previously thought where you have labor supply coming back that is taking some wage pressures off of the table, or at least lessening them for businesses, and so that's going to help bring inflation down without necessarily having to see outright declines in job growth. But I think just given how high inflation is, how long it has been elevated, so that the potential that it becomes entrenched, it is still more likely than not that we will see a recession here in the United States, and our expectation is that probably comes somewhere in the back half of this year.",

The spire of Notre-Dame crashing through the cathedral roof as flames burned all around. In the four years since as Giant Oaks have been felled and the ashes cleared away, shock and dismay has turned to confidence that the spire and the cathedral will rise again.

Cutting and fitting precise down to the millimeter. BITTERMANN (on camera): Well, much care and effort and money are being expended to make sure the reconstructed Notre-Dame is just like the old one. The workers who are working on these giant pieces of wood say they are sometimes amazed at how they could have done all this 1000 years ago. BITTERMANN (voice over): One person who's had a better view than most of the Notre-Dame reconstruction is photographer Tomas van Houtryve. His photos are going up along the walls of the Notre-Dame worksite. He began taking pictures with a cathedral long before the fire, sometimes using an ancient wooden camera as old as the iconic spire itself. Can Houtryve was then commissioned to document the working side by National Geographic and the French establishment charged with the Notre-Dame restoration and preservation. As the monument slowly rose again from the ashes, he emotionally recorded the work inside and outside.",

It's the lowest round by a 50-something player ever at the Masters. And with three LIV golfers finishing in the top six with Mickelson and Koepka contending for the green jacket. There is renewed focus on the strength and validity of the Saudi-backed rebel tour. Perhaps it's not the golfing graveyard that some establishment figures had come to believe.
