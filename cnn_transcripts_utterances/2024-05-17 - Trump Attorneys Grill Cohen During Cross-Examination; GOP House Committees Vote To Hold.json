Cohen had said it was to \"discuss the Stormy Daniels matter.\"This became an essential piece of evidence in yesterday's cross- examination when Trump attorney Todd Blanche revealed text messages from minutes before that phone call took place. In those texts, Cohen complains about a teenager who has been prank calling him. Schiller responding, \"Call me.\" Trump's lawyers then pressed Cohen saying, \"When you testified on Tuesday that you had specific recollection that you called Keith Schiller and he passed the phone to President Trump, you finalized the death with Stormy Daniels, and you said we're going to move forward. And he said yes because you kept him informed all the time. That was your testimony, right?\" Cohen said, \"That's correct.\" Blanche then responded, \"That was a lie. You were actually talking to Mr. Schiller about the fact that you were getting harassing phone calls from a 14-year-old, correct?\" To which Cohen replied, \"Part of it was the 14-year-old.\" Joining me now, former federal prosecutor, Gene Rossi. Gene, good morning. Thank you so much for being here. GENE ROSSI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA:  Good morning. Thanks for having me.",

So going into this October 24 call around 8They should have fronted -- they should have brought out in the direct exam hey, Michael -- Mr. Cohen, you have all these texts. When you were calling Schiller, trying to reach Trump, were you talking about just the kid who was harassing you or were you also throwing in the SD status? He could easily have said you know what, I remember calling him (Schiller) and I may have talked about the deal with Mr. Trump. That would have neutralized the cross. So I blame the prosecutors. Why I only call it a left jab or a left hook is there are calls on October 26, 27, and 28 where you can tell that Cohen is calling Trump directly, maybe through Schiller, because that's when the deal was closed, that's when they had the documents signed, and that's when the money was going. What I don't understand is the defense is trying to say that Trump didn't know about this at all. That dog's not going to hunt. A jury is going to believe that Cohen was keeping him apprised and a jury will believe that Trump knew that $130,000 of money was going to her. So is it a knockout? No. Does it make Cohen look bad?

That is the DOJ interview that led to Hur's report that states the president retained a number of classified documents because he was \"a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" The president claimed executive privilege over those tapes. And news outlets, including CNN, are suing the Department of Justice for their release. In the hours before the committee moved forward with those contempt proceedings, we heard from Merrick Garland himself in a pretty unusual moment for someone who doesn't speak out this way very often -- watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  There have been a series of unprecedented and, frankly, unfounded attacks on the Justice Department. This request -- this effort to use contempt as a -- as a method of obtaining our sensitive law enforcement files is just the most recent. The effort to threaten to defund our investigations and the way in which there are contributions to an atmosphere that puts our agents and our prosecutors at risk -- these are wrong.

Wonderful to see you.Let's dig into this hearing around -- or first, the big picture question, then we're going to show you a little bit of what actually happened at the hearing. It's a little juicier than what this might suggest. This about tapes -- audio recordings that Republicans want of President Biden talking about his classified documents case. They argue it's transparency. And as we noted, news organizations want to hear them as well. However, it's clear that White House -- the Biden campaign believes that these would be weaponized for political purposes, and that's the point of getting them out there. Where does this contempt go next, and what more is behind it? GRACE PANETTA, POLITICAL REPORTER, THE 19TH NEWS:  Absolutely. Great to be with you, Kasie. I think the contempt motion -- you know, it's unclear how far it's going to go -- if it will even make it to the House floor. Republicans have a very narrow majority, and that vote could put a lot of swing district Republicans in a tough spot. And, of course, the Department of Justice is not going to prosecute the attorney general. So this is really about the politics of it, and it's about House Republicans' broader effort to make the Biden administration look shady and potentially corrupt while also making Biden look weak and in decline. The House Oversight chairman James Comer said as much. They said the White House doesn't want this tape released because it would show that Biden is in \"mental decline,\" which is really a statement more about, really, I think the campaign than the heart of their investigation.

But nobody expected just how last night's game six was going to play out. After looking outmatched for the past three games, Minnesota roaring back to life. They led by 17 at the end of the first quarter and never looked back in this game, going on to win 115-70. The 45-point win, the second largest by any facing elimination in league history. Denver shot an abysmal 30 percent from the floor. They became the first team to score 70 or fewer points in the playoffs since the Grizzlies back in 2016. And Anthony Edwards has been such a superstar. He had a game-high 27 points, flashing seven fingers to the roaring crowd as he walked off for a fourth quarter time out. Game seven set for Sunday in Denver. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

New York down by two goals heading into the final period, then Chris Kreider singlehandedly flipping the script. He scored three goals capping off the natural hat trick for the eventual winner with 4New York winning 5-3, punching their ticket to the Eastern Conference Finals. And check out this great moment after the game, too. Kreider skating off the ice, handing his stick to a young fan before heading to the dressing room. How sweet is that? Meantime, the Canucks had the Oilers on the brink of elimination in their all-Canadian series. With the game tied at two, Vancouver's J.T. Miller finding the back of the net with just 33 seconds remaining. The Canucks win it 3-2. They take a 3-2 series lead as well. Game six scheduled for tomorrow night at Edmonton in that series. And a sold-out crowd on hand at the Indiana Fever's home opener for Caitlin Clark. She's still getting adjusted to life as a WNBA rookie. The number one pick in the draft managing nine points, seven rebounds, and six assists in a lopsided 102-66 loss to the New York Liberty. The league's reigning MVP Breanna Stewart, though, putting on a show. She is a wily veteran in the league -- 31 points, 10 rebounds, four assists, and three steals for her. But for Caitlin Clark, her ability to balance scoring and playmaking still a work in progress here as she continues to get more exposure to the pro game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The world number three made nine birdies and zero bogies enroute to a 62. That ties the single-round scoring record at a men's major championship, and it comes almost 11 months to the day after he and Rickie Fowler broke the U.S. Open record with opening round 62s.And if you take a look at the leaderboard, Schaufelle's incredible round, seeing him hold a three-stroke edge over the rest of the field. A total of 64 players breaking par on Thursday. That's the most ever in the opening round of the PGA Championship. Unfortunately, Tiger Woods not one of them, Kasie. The 15-time Major champ could only manage a one over 72 in the first round, leaving him 10 strokes behind the leader. This was his 10th straight round of even par or worse at a Major dating back to the 2022 PGA. But he doesn't play a lot of rounds of competitive golf anymore. He actually looked good, Kasie, through the first 16 holes, but he three-putted the last two holes. And he said listen, they're just not the same as when I play my flat course in Florida. So getting a little bit stronger but unfortunately, looking tough for the weekend.",
