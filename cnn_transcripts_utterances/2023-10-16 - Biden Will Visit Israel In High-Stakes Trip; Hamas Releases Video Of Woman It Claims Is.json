That's tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" Now, if you thought for a moment that what was happening in Israel and also in Gaza would not affect what is happening here at home, you are sadly mistaken. As the sun rises on yet another day of war in the Middle East, an American president is now preparing to head that way. We already had a secretary of state, secretary of defense, they've already gone to the region. Well, let me add a word to that. They've gone to the now dangerous region. And we are in the middle of a war with Hamas and airstrikes and bombings above civilians trying to get away from the ground, perhaps nearly 200 hostages might very well be below. And President Biden is set to undertake a very risky trip on Wednesday. It will be a huge show of support for Israel and obviously recognizing the stakes here at home. Now, when you really think about all this, it can't be overstated just how risky it must be for the president to go there, to do this. And one can only really imagine the security protocols that are going to have to be in place for an American president to go in the middle of a war zone. Look at the security issues on the ground that are happening right there and all -- and I mean all of the unknowns, like, where are the Hamas leaders who planned this attack? Where can the civilians who have nothing to do with this war, where can they go to escape? And where are the hostages that were taken? Well, tonight, Hamas releasing a video that it claims shows a hostage, a 21-year-old French-Israeli woman, Mia Schem. Now, CNN is not going to show you the video because, well, frankly, we don't know when it was taken, we don't know the condition of this young woman, and the video serves really no purpose beyond propaganda for Hamas. Her family spoke to Anderson Cooper tonight and said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

STEVE ANDERSON, RETIRED U.S. BRIGADIER GENERAL: We're looking at a huge amount of security. I worked on the joint staff and provided airlift support for presidential travel 20 years ago. And I can tell you that it has taken extremely seriously. There'll be an advanced planning team that goes on the ground, that walks every step that he's going to go. They're going to take every single precaution they possibly can to make sure that he's as safe as possible. And the other part of this is intelligence and making sure that we have the best possible intelligence about what the threats are out there, what risk he might be under.

So, this is not only a show of support and a message to the Israeli public, this is also a warning to the other regional players there. This is the same sort of warning we are seeing from those U.S. carrier ships off the coast.It's almost less of a message to Hamas as it is a message to Hezbollah, to the North and to Iran. The border between Israel and Lebanon has been very tense over the last few days. There have already been deaths between Israelis and Lebanese up there and skirmishes up there, rockets being fired, artillery being returned. And so, while it has been so far at a very kind of simmering level, President Biden being there, I think, is also a very clear message to Hezbollah and Iran. Don't get involved. Don't let this blow up into some sort of broader regional war because that could completely change the equation in the Middle East.",

Every time we see something from Hamas, I think we should be very, very skeptical about what they're sending and what they're saying.You know, at one point, they were sending out messages that they said, you know, we haven't harmed civilians. We had them on GoPros, their own GoPros. You know, their own body cams harming civilians. So, you should be very skeptical of this. But yes, the pressure on Israel is growing. We've seen this before. You know, they get attacked. They start an operation in Gaza. There were a few days where they kind of have this leeway to start this operation, and then the pressure starts building as the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens. And I think what we're seeing right now is that the patience is sort of wearing thin. I'm sure the Americans are warning the Israelis. Listen, a lot of -- there's a lot of sympathy for you right now, but the narrative and the images are now changing from the images of these massacres of Israeli civilians to now the humanitarian situation in Gaza. You are running out of time. And also, this is an unprecedented situation. Israel said from the beginning, we're shutting off, you know, the electricity, the fuel on the water until these hostages are released. It's unprecedented situation. It's an unprecedented response. I have never seen this type of rhetoric from the Israelis before. And that gives you the type of -- that helps you understand the trauma that Israel has been through. This is their 9/11. This is why we're seeing this type of response. So, I'm not sure when this pressure will essentially break and Israel will be able to help improve the humanitarian situation. I know they want to. They want to create this humanitarian zone. They're also up against Hamas, who purposely hides within civilian populations. It's a very, very difficult situation to try to grapple with. But the number one priority right now, from the American point of view, from the international point of view, is to get that humanitarian zone established, get that aid into Gaza, and to help get at least some of those Gazan civilians out of Gaza.",
