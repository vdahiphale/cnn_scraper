The good news is, it's staying away from the mainland as any kind of tropical entity. The bad news is that it's impacting Central America with significant amounts of rainfall as it skirts the coastline of Honduras. Get this, Kasie, they've already had over 17 inches of rain along the coastline of Honduras. This is an area that's very susceptible to mudslides and landslides. So, thinking of them at this time.",

Children born between 1994 and 2023, and saying, what impacted did those vaccines that children had - what impact did it have on the real world? And we can show you some of the numbers there, but basically the headline was around a million deaths were prevented as a result of those vaccines. Thirty-two million hospitalizations and 500 million illnesses. So, that's going backwards, Kasie. If you start to go forward and you see that there's already been dips, for example, in some of these vaccinations, including measles, you want about 95 percent measles vaccination, not only to protect your child, but for all the other children around them to protect your child, that herd immunity. We're starting to drop below herd immunity in several places. So, it's tough to anticipate with public health because success means you don't see anything, right?",
