I'm Jake Tapper.This hour new reaction after the rejection from the U.S. Supreme Court denying the request from Special Counsel Jack Smith to settle this dispute over whether Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution because he committed these acts, alleged acts, as president. This is in his federal election subversion case. I'm going to talk to a former Trump attorney coming up. Plus new warnings about Ozempic, one of the most popular drugs out there for diabetes and of course for weight loss. What you need to know about the fakes, the counterfeits leaked into the market. Leading this hour, however, Israel is indicating today that it plans to widen its military operation against Hamas in Gaza. Ordering residents in the central part of the strip to find safety in shelters. Let's get right to CNN's Jeremy Diamond is on the ground for us in Tel Aviv, Israel. Jeremy, the U.N. Security Council finally passed this resolution. It's been watered down a bit. It calls for quote extended humanitarian pauses to ensure that aid gets into Gaza. You went to the Kerem Shalom crossing today. That's one of the few crossings between Gaza and Israel. What did you see there? What's going on there?",

And over the last week, about 300 plus trucks have been able to go directly from Israel, get security inspections at this Kerem Shalom crossing and go into Gaza. We saw dozens of those trucks making that very journey today. But still, it is simply not enough to meet the enormous humanitarian need that exists in Gaza right now. The U.N. World Food Program has warned that about half of Gaza's population is experiencing severe or extreme hunger. And yet today, I spoke with Colonel Moshe Tetro who is in charge for the Israeli military of coordinating the delivery of that aid into Gaza and he looked at us with a straight face and he said that there is no food shortage in Gaza right now. I pressed him on that. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. MOSHE TETRO, IDF OFFICER COORDINATING GAZA AID: Like I've told you, there are 10s of trucks loaded with food entering the Gaza Strip every day.

Those families bravely shared with me their harrowing ordeal that they have endured over the past months as they await news of their loved ones. It's intolerable.\"And he says, \"I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage, we will not stop working to bring them home.\" Of course, Gad Haggai's body is still being held hostage in Gaza, even though he has now passed away and that's because Hamas is believed to be holding about at least 20 dead Israeli hostages as bargaining chips still. But these negotiations, Jake, are going nowhere fast. Israel has put a couple of proposals on the table, clearly looking to try and find a way to bring hostages homes, provide a week long pause in the fighting. But Hamas for its part says it won't negotiate as long as the hostilities continue. Jake. [17:05:00]",

But even here, you get a sense of the degree of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, the sheer intensity and scale.ELBAGIR (voice-over): This is what that looks like up close. Scenes of destruction have become all too for many here. Hit the aftermath of another Israeli airstrike, this time in late October at the Jabalia refugee camp in, one of the most densely populated residential areas in Gaza. The bomb that caused this damage is a 2,000-pound bomb, likely made in the USA dropped by the Israeli Air Force at least four times as powerful as the vast majority of the bombs used by the U.S. in its fight against ISIS. In densely populated Gaza, the human cost is incomparable. Whole families wiped out in one blow. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): These are their names. They were blameless. They are all innocent. ELBAGIR (voice-over): Jabalia refugee camp is one of the epicenters of Israel's bombing campaign. To understand the complete picture and scale of the destruction in Gaza, you need to look from above. In coordination with artificial intelligence companies, Synthetic, CNN was able to locate over 1,900 craters left behind by bombardment in just the first month of the war. Using AI, we analyzed the diameter of these craters, over 500 of which were greater than 40 feet in diameter, consistent with American made 2,000-pound bombs used by the Israeli Air Force. Our analysis covers the one month period to November 6, in which a staggering 10,000 people are believed to have died. The U.S.'s most senior Middle East diplomat testified on November 9, the number of dead could be even higher. BARBARA LEAF, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NEAR EASTERN AFFAIRS: Than this period of conflict and conditions of war. It is very difficult for any of us to assess what the rate of casualties are. We think they're very high, frankly. And it could be that they're even higher than are being cited. ELBAGIR (voice-over): Yet the U.S. continues to back Israel's bombardment. So why is the death toll so staggering? Because it's not just about the point of impact. This is a crate caused by a 2,000- pound bomb. The potential kill zone from that crater can spread up to 365 meters, that's 1200 feet, an area equivalent to roughly 60 soccer pitches or around 90 American football fields. The IDF told CNN, \"In stark contrast to Hamas' intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.\" But is that true? This is just north of the shanty refugee camp along the main coastal road. When you go in closer, you can see in just this small neighborhood at least nine craters consistent with 2,000-pound bombs, which means the potential kill zone could encompass this entire area. CNN and Synthetic's analysis of the devastation of Gaza shows extensive bombardment. In an area this densely populated and using these bombs, it's inherently indiscriminate, and the human cost continues to soar, surpassing 20,000. Many of the dead still unburied, still under the rubble, with no end in sight. Nima Elbagir, CNN, Sderot. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So some aspects, some emotional truth of the season has to meaningfully inform the story for the audience. So the season means different things. It means joy and family togetherness and finding love and compassion and positive transformation can also mean loneliness, cynicism, maybe a disgust with the commercialism of the season.
