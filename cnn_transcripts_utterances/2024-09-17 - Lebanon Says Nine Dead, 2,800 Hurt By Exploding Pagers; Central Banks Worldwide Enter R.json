They appear in this instance, so issued smartphones, well-known the Israelis used them to target down people they want to eradicate, presumably these pagers would enable them to perhaps use other ways of communicating amongst themselves. Now, this would suggest a lengthy operation whoever carried this out, the main suspect, obviously Israel, so months before these were purchased, whoever it was would have had to work out that these were the favorite choice of Hezbollah to communicate with each other, and then intercepted a shipment somewhere into Beirut possibly into Dahieh, an awful lot of stuff comes out there in containers at times. And it seems adapted them, inserted perhaps explosive in to them, a lot of the explosion you see there. It will be pretty hard, I would guess, to pull off with just an overheating battery. So a very sophisticated operation, but Richard, this is what brings me to the ultimate question here is why now? And you heard in that report, the pressure that Israel is trying to put for some kind of military solution to its northern border, issues with Hezbollah. Is this attack aimed at pushing Hezbollah towards diplomatic solution, or is it simply a prestaging, a bid to sow chaos amongst Hezbollah's ranks.",

And I think there are two -- it is important to say at the outset, we don't really know how exactly this was carried out. It is very early to say. I think however, there are two prevailing theories. One is that it was what we call a supply chain attack, which is that if they acquired these pagers in recent months, that the source of production or along the production of transmission process, the shipment was compromised and a small amount of explosives was inserted into the device and an ability to be a remotely detonated at a certain time, within Lebanon.

They're going to overheat. They're going to catch on fire.

We are not talking about compromising military radios or military equipment. We are talking about compromising civilian technology. However, in the year 2024, nobody uses pagers unless you were trying not to have your information and communications and location tracked. Pagers don't have GPS. They don't have audio capabilities, they don't have a camera. So, the only person -- groups, presumably importing pagers into Lebanon at this time would be a group like Hezbollah, but I think that it is important to recognize that even though it was targeted in a sense because you presume that Hezbollah was using these pagers, we don't know -- you know, you have no control over where the pager is going to be when the bomb goes off. And you mentioned it could be a fruit market, it could be on a kitchen table with a child or a grandparent playing around.

Now, if you look and see exactly the way, the Federal Reserve, there has been no cuts since the pandemic. And the issue now is going to be whether it is a 25 or 50-basis point cut. Well, the global rate cutting, think of it this way, like sort of the style of a new season, you cut a ribbon when you saw a new season and you open a garden party or a fete, or something like that. Well, we've already seen the ECB. Now, the ECB where the current rate is 3.5 percent, they've had two cuts so far. They did a quarter point and they have done another quarter point. So, they are well and truly underway. The Bank of England cuts back in August. They cut a quarter point and they basically say, there is a lot more to go, but they're going to take their time. Norway's Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, no cut yet likely to wait until December. So Julia Chatterley, as you look at this, what we have at the moment, we have the Fed. We could see a quarter point. We could see a half point. We could see Elizabeth Warren's three-quarter points. But my question, first of all, we are going to see a bit of cutting come what may tomorrow? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": Yes. That at least I can guarantee you, Richard, but I think the jury is out on what they do. The economic data argues that they go for a quarter of a percentage point cut, which is what the majority of analysts out there are saying, the market on the other hand, as a result of a couple of reports that may or may not be FOMC leaks have now got us really up to point where they are expecting on a two-to-one ratio, half a percentage point. Elizabeth Warren, no chance and we can talk about that in her three- quarters of a percentage point up, but tough to call on this one.

Or they do a quarter of a percentage point cut and they say, look, we have room to go more. Remember the next FOMC meeting after this one is two days after the presidential election.

I think the big difference with the sort of menial one-off things that Instagram has rolled out previously for teen safety is just how comprehensive this is. It is automatically putting on these restrictions by default, private accounts, sleep mode for teenagers, which will mute their notifications overnight. More restrictions in terms of what people are seeing, the kinds of sensitive content they're seeing on the platform. And either teens are going to have to -- especially young teens that 13 to 15-year-old, they're either going to have to live with those more strict restrictions or let their parents have greater oversight. In order to get away from those strict restrictions, the private accounts, they have to set up parental supervision on the app. And so it feels more comprehensive than things we've seen in the past.

I mean, this is Instagram's whole business model. Young people are the most important user sort of category for this company. But the timing here is really interesting because there's an online safety, a youth online safety proposed bill that's actually heading to a really important congressional committee markup tomorrow. And so I think this in some ways is being seen as Meta's attempt to skirt again potential regulations and try to say that it's doing more.
