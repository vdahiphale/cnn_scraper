It doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to lead to increase liberalization and trying to quite the contrast, you are looking at protests that are specifically aimed at a policy that is very much identified with Xi Jinping, the leader, which is the zero COVID policy.And you could be looking at an even bigger kind of domestic crackdown as a result of it, but it's still remarkable to see people take risks like this in closed societies, such as China has become, such as Iran. It's remarkable how quickly they've spread across the country in China. That's the other thing that is really notable at a moment when so many traditional avenues of communication are shut down. They haven't been able to censor the internet so thoroughly, that China's people locked inside their apartment blocks are able and are defying the authorities to come out. The fact that a blank piece of paper is the symbol so far of these protests, again, it's so telling of the nature of the regime that has been formulated in recent years, which is really the toughest China has seen in decades.",

So they do have a long legislative agenda to get done in just a few weeks time. One bill that is pending in the Senate right now will be to protect same sex marriage. That is expected to pass the Senate later this week. Then it goes on to house for final approval. There are other measures, too, funding the federal government and deadline is by mid December in order to ensure that all federal agencies can be funded big question there. Also a big question is how do they deal with the so called Electoral Count Act, those are - that's the law that Donald Trump sought to exploit to force Mike Pence, the vice president at that time, to overturn the elections when Congress met to certify the elections. There are changes to the law that the legislation that are - that is - that the Democrats and Republicans are trying to get through in the days ahead here, and the annual defense policy bill, too. So another major issue that is waiting in the wings that will take some time for lawmakers to resolve and then there's some questions as well, do they try to avoid a debt default which will be on Congress' plate next year, do they try to do it at the end of this year. So all key questions as leadership leaders as all the caucus has tried to sort out their own leadership teams this year, including the Democratic side in the House, where they will meet later this week to select their new slate of leaders in the House Minority when they take power next year.",
