There are two attorneys, as you mentioned, and there are, you know, professional money managers who have experience with accountants and may be amenable and open to Trump's defense of a technical defense.",

I think both sides are going to throw as much of their case out there to the public as possible. Everybody's heard the expression, the first impression is the most important.

And it will be important for them. Lawyers have to convey ideas and information, make it succinct and yet relatable. So, yes, it's a little bit harder for the defense, but they have to do it.

However, I think they do need to stick to their defense, focus on the facts that are favorable to them. And really they'll have to argue their case in a Manhattan jury that will definitely be very anti-Trump. They'll have to at least make their argument neutral.

We heard at the time also from the head of Shin Bet, also acknowledging intelligence failures at the time, said in a statement that despite a series of actions that were carried out by the IDF and intelligence branches, they were not able to create sufficient warnings that would allow the attack by Hamas to be thwarted at the time. Now, of course, we're seeing the resignation of Major General Aharon Haliva, who is the head of the IDF's intelligence branch. He's someone who has been within this branch for over 30 years.
