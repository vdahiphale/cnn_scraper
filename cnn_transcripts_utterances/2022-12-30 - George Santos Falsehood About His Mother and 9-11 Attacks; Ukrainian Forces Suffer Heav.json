And if you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top story this hour.Americans will finally get to see what's in former President Trump's tax returns. After a year's long legal battle a House committee is set to release the documents in coming hours. Plus, new revelations from another round of witness transcripts released from the January 6th Committee. Witnesses described a key Trump's request to find dead voters in efforts to overturn the 2020 election and he spoke of distrust within Trump's inner circle. U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos is facing new scrutiny over his claims that his mother was inside the World Trade Center on 9/11 and that the terror attacks played a role in her death. The New York Republican has spent the last week trying to explain a number of falsehoods including a story that his grandparents survived the Holocaust. He says he embellished his resume when he claimed he attended an elite college and worked on Wall Street. CNN's Melanie Zanona has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Earlier a presidential adviser said Ukraine's forces experienced heavy losses in the east, namely around the towns of Bakhmut and Soledar. Although the advisors said  that Russia has lost more. This comes a day after Ukraine's military warned that Russia diverted resources from other areas to the battle for Bakhmut.Meanwhile, damage assessments are underway across Ukraine after what Kyiv describes as one of Russia's largest missile barrages since the war began more than 10 months ago. And as the war rages Russian President Vladimir Putin says his country intends to strengthen military operations with China. He spoke with Chinese leader Xi Jinping a short time ago. During their opening remarks Mr. Putin invited Mr. Xi to Moscow in the coming months. The Russian leader said relations with China were quote, the best in history. Joining me now in the studio to discuss is CNN's Nada Bashir. And, Nada, we're hearing in Kyiv -- I think there was an alert issued on Telegram telling residents to take shelter. And also, the governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, said that there have been more drone attacks today. What are we learning about what's been happening?",

      "sentences": "Well look, as you described and as you've heard from Ukrainian military officials, one of the largest barrages of Russian missile attacks and the drone attacks that we have seen over the last 10 months. And this was of course targeting Ukraine across its territory from Kyiv to those eastern front lines to also Lviv in the west.Now what we've heard from the Ukrainian officials, that this was largely targeting as we have seen in the past, Ukraine's energy infrastructure. But, in fact, there were significant civilian infrastructure damage in this attack. And of course, we have seen the civilian lives lost as well. Now we did hear from the Ukrainian military officials yesterday saying that they were able to actually intercept successfully a majority of those missiles, cruise missiles that have been launched by the Russian armed forces. But of course, we are seeing a doubling down of the attack by the Russian Armed Forces across Ukraine much as the officials in Ukraine had anticipated around the New Year. And we heard from President Zelenskyy speaking yesterday. He said that this was further evidence that Russia is, in his words, engaging in terrorist activity in Ukraine. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): With every rocket attack Russia is getting into that dead end. Russia has less rockets but the status of the biggest terrorists in the world will have a deeper impact for a long time for Russia and its citizens. Every missile will -- only will show that the tribunal will be right at the end of this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Ukrainian officials say they're now assessing potential next steps for the Russian Armed Forces that you touched on there a little earlier. We are hearing that Russia is now rediverting its resources, focusing on that battle for the city of Bakhmut. So, concerned certainly focused around that.",

Nada Bashir, thank you so much for joining us.The death toll from a huge fire that gutted a casino in Cambodia has grown to at least 24 people. But officials are concerned the number could still increase as emergency crews search for more victims. 70 people were injured in the fire that tore through the building near the Thai border, which also includes a hotel. Officials say some of the victims were trapped in their hotel rooms as the flames raged through the structure. A Cambodian official says the government will investigate the cause of the fire. Another country is set to require negative COVID tests for travelers from China. But Europe is rolling out the welcome mat. We'll also have the details just ahead for you. Plus, former Pope Benedict is said to be in serious but stable condition right now. We'll check in with a live report from the Vatican just ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Italy of course was the first epicenter outside of China, the first round of the pandemic nearly three years ago. Italy's new Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will be so pleased to find out that Spain has also joined restrictions. But she wants the rest of Europe to do the same to try to avoid any further outbreaks. Let's listen to what she had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIORGIA MELONI, ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): This measure risks not being completely effective if it's not taken at the European level. Because we know that we can do it for flights arriving directly from China but not, for example, from those arriving via stopovers. So, I asked Health Minister Schillaci, who immediately reacted in this sense to write to the European commissioner responsible for this matter and asked the European Union to take measures in this sense.

It was one of the last countries to lift restrictions as the pandemic started to get better around the world. So, you've got flights in Milan. You've got a higher percentage of people ending up positive in Milan. But here in Rome they're testing every single person on every direct flight from China and they will do so until at least the end of January -- Bianca.",

CNN correspondents have been closely watching the Vatican for any changes in his health since Pope Francis broke the news on Wednesday. On Thursday the Vatican reported that the 95-year-old Benedict is stable but that his condition does remain serious. Let's bring in CNN's Delia Gallagher for more on this. Delia, as expected with a 95-year-old man, it does look like there are ups and downs in this and different levels of alarm from when we initially heard that he was in more trouble with his health. What are you hearing today?",
