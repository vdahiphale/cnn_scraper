      "sentences": "Good evening.New details tonight about the removal of Tucker Carlson from FOX News. FOX made the announcement this morning, six days after the company settled with Dominion Voting Systems for more than three-quarters of a billion dollars. Had that case gone to trial, Carlson likely would have been forced to testify about how the 2020 election lies that FOX was helping to spread on screen were at odds with what it stars, including him, were saying off screen. Carlson texted other staffers that he \"passionately\" -- that's a quote -- hated former President Donald Trump and that Trump's tenure in the White House was a \"disaster.\" He also used misogynistic terms to criticize pro-Trump lawyer, Sidney Powell and rejected her conspiracies about the 2020 election, even as those false claims got repeated airtime on FOX News. His text messages after the election released by Dominion's attorneys also showed Carlson disparaging FOX leadership. Now, whether his sudden departure is actually connected to the Dominion case or other lawsuits facing FOX or other reasons is a topic we'll get into in a moment. FOX in his statement only said it and Carlson, \"have agreed to part ways,\" and then thanked him for his service, and said his last show was this past Friday. I am joined now by our senior media reporter, Oliver Darcy. So do we know exactly why he was ousted?",

      "sentences": "I would imagine that you can't disconnect this from that big Dominion suit.Even though Tucker Carlson wasn't a focal point of the suit, he did loom large over it. He was set to be one of the first witnesses that was going to testify in the case and there were a lot of disparaging remarks that he did make about his colleagues, including FOX News leadership and FOX leadership that came out. You know, he used a lot of -- he was very critical to say -- to be generous to him -- about the people running FOX, and so I think that may have played a role. And there is also that pending lawsuit now from his ex-booker, Abby Grossberg who alleged rampant sexism, anti-Semitic behavior that was running wild on his show, and then he's also got this legal notice from Ray Epps who he made part of a central January 6 conspiracy theory on his program. And so, there is all of these litigation that's got Carlson's name over it, and you have the Dominion lawsuit, and so it seems that FOX at some point just said, enough is enough. We're going to fire him from the network. And so we know now that Lachlan Murdoch, the Fox Corporation CEO, as well as Suzanne Scott, the FOX new CEO, they made the decision Friday evening to let him go, and on Monday morning, that's when Carlson was abruptly informed that he was no longer with the network. They put out that short statement. And I should note, too, we haven't heard a word from Carlson since this all went down. I've texted him, called him. He is not answering me. He's not answering anyone else. He is totally silent.",

Interesting in that NBC News poll that was recently out, 70 percent of Americans said they don't want Biden to run again. That's an overwhelming number, seven in 10 Americans don't want him to run. I mean, it's incredible. And in these head-to-head polls, I discount it a bit because, this Trump versus Biden, because just like Harvey Gant and a lot of past politicians, people aren't going to admit to pollsters, just like we saw in the 2016 campaign, people didn't admit to that they were going to vote for Trump and then they came out and, you know, Trump amazingly won somehow.

It is very, very early in the small hours of the morning, so one would not expect a great deal of violence to be underway.So it would appear to be holding at least until dawn. Dawn will be the test, really, of whether or not there is something real behind this ceasefire. Remember, Anderson, there was supposed to be a ceasefire at the end of Eid at the weekend, but -- and there was some slight return to normality in one or two pockets of Khartoum and elsewhere in the country. But essentially that series of evacuations that were pioneered by the United States with that daring raid effectively on Khartoum with three Chinook helicopters, was conducted in the teeth of ongoing combat when there was supposed to be a ceasefire.

According to the Kentucky Attorney General, Detective Myles Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Breonna Taylor. You may remember that Taylor was killed during a botched police raid after officers executed a warrant at her apartment.The warrant was linked to Taylor's ex-boyfriend, a convicted felon suspected of supplying a local drug house. However, no drugs were found in the apartment, and Taylor's family and their attorneys have maintained she was not involved in her ex boyfriend's alleged drug deals. Her death partially sparked nationwide protests in 2020, calling for changes in policing policy and laws. CNN's Jason Carroll now with the story of how the man who killed Taylor became a sheriff's deputy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
