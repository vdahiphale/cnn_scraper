Well, police have fired tear gas at protesters in Nairobi has people across Kenya take to the streets again. Activists are calling for government and police accountability off the back of last week's deadly protests sparked by controversial tax bill. President Ruto ultimately withdrew that bill. But today activists are angered by the country's violent response to protesters are demanding his resignation. Kenya's National Commission on Human Rights says at least 39 protesters have died since last month. Let's get you to CNN's Larry Madowo he is been on the forefront. This story was following those protests on the ground now for weeks. He joins us live. What are you witnessing as we speak?",

The High Court recently blocked the police from using tear gas, water cannon or any kind of force on unarmed protesters. But in this case, they've been facing some stones coming from these protesters all morning really for the past few hours. And they're trying to make sure that they are not blocking businesses here. They're not vandalizing anything or looting. But that's the back and forth between these protesters and the police that we've seen all morning. They beat them back, put them to a corner and then they come back and regroup. This began as you mentioned about the finance bear, which President Ruto was forced to withdraw. They have now become protests about President Ruto himself. One of the common chants we hear again and again, here's Ruto must go. They no longer feel that President Ruto is listening to them. They no longer feel that he represents them. And so they are out in the streets, wanting him to step down. That's unlikely to happen. President Ruto has had to compromise. And he said he's willing to engage these young people in whatever platforms they have, they want to, even if it's on social media, on an X space, for instance, he is open to doing that. But the anger on the streets is incredible, especially when you mentioned 39 people have been killed according to the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights, mostly peaceful protesters across the nation, that are people who remain in custody who are still unaccounted for in some cases, the last set of Kenyans calling his abductions, people who -- they're not sure exactly why they're being held and that's building up on the anger here across the country, Becky.",

      "sentences": "I mean, Becky, like you were saying that seems like a deja vu or a nightmare that is not ending for the peopleof Gaza. Khan Yunis is an area where the Israeli military was operating, was on the ground, they withdrew back in April, after their operations, they are concluded after they are supposed to have cleared that area. But what we've seen in recent days, in recent weeks, as you've seen, attacks, strikes, fighting reported in and around Khan Yunis. And in the past 24 hours, the Israeli military reported that a barrage of rockets projectiles targeted Israeli communities near Gaza, 20 rockets, but there were no casualties reported in that attack. And following this, the Israeli military announced this evacuation order for Eastern Khan Yunis, asking people to immediately move to what they describe as the humanitarian zone, which of course is you know, NGOs, aid workers and the residents of Gaza would really dispute that term, when you look at the conditions on the ground in the so called humanitarian zone. And you can imagine, Becky, the kind of fear and panic this cause for people who see these evacuation orders is something signaling a potential ground operation coming. So in the last 24 hours, you have seen people yet again on the move. And as you mentioned, these are people who have been displaced time and time again. And most recently, they were moved out of Rafah back to areas including Khan Yunis, where people have been living on the rubble of what used to be their homes, because they had nowhere else to go to. And impacted by this evacuation order is one of the last standing, the last functioning hospitals in Gaza. The European hospital there that immediately after this evacuation order was issued, they looked at the area and they fall within that zone. So they began, according to the hospital administration, immediately moving equipment, patients, and medical personnel. And we're also talking about they say, babies in incubators, patients in the ICU, moving them to an already overwhelmed smaller hospital Al-Amal Hospital close by. And you know we've seen images on social media of people pushing patients on hospital beds and stretchers on these pockmarked streets to try and get them to another hospital. And as this was unfolding, as we were seeing these reports coming out, as we were hearing from hospital officials from doctors, the Israeli military hours later, posts on X, formerly Twitter saying that the European hospital did not need to evacuate. It is not included in this evacuation order. But no one was really going to take the chance, Becky, after seeing what has already happened to other hospitals over the past few months. And as you mentioned a U.N. spokesperson on the ground saying that this evacuation order is impacting 250,000 people who they are seeing now moving towards these zones. The question is where do they go really? And what happens to them next?",

      "sentences": "So here we're talking about one of two federal cases the former president is facing. This onefocuses on allegations about how he tried to subvert the outcome of the 2020 election. And yesterday, the Supreme Court really handed him what his own lawyers described as a major victory, because they have determined that he has absolute immunity for official acts that are central to his duties in the White House. Things that have to do with his core constitutional powers, then anything outside of that gets a presumption of immunity, but he has no immunity for unofficial acts. But what they ruled yesterday is enough for Trump's lawyers to try to really destroy this entire case. I'm told that they believe not only can they get some of the charges tossed out. But then they're going to move on to the evidence itself, because yesterday, the justices ruled that official acts cannot be used as evidence in a criminal case. And they believe that what will remain of this case after certain charges are possibly thrown out, will need to be supported by evidence that they will argue some of it is falls under this idea of official acts. So they believe they can gut this entire case, thanks to this opinion. But this is a process that will take time. All of these questions now go down to the trial court judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's overseeing this case. She has shown a willingness to move very quickly in these proceedings. But here all of this litigation, this is going to take time. The parties are going to have an opportunity to weigh in, briefings like the hearings. It's going to take a long time to see what remains of this case. But what is clear is that it is almost impossible that this case in whatever form it may or may not survive and will go before the November election and if Trump is re-elected, he can make both of the federal cases that he's facing go away.",
