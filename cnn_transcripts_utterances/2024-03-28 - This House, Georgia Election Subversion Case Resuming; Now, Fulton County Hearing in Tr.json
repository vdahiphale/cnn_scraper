He could either rule from a bench or he could say that I'm going take it under advisement and rule later. But I think that it is likely that we see some resolution today. And as the reporting indicates, we're back to the case, we're over the disqualification proceeding and we are more in line with the merits. So, the judge previously ruled with the other co-defendants who have since pled guilty, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Cheseboro, that the First Amendment argument is something that can be raised at trial, but it's not enough to actually throw out the indictment.

He's not a mobster. He is racketeering, that sort of thing. So, I think it does help Mark Meadows quite a bit. I don't think it really matters much at all for Donald Trump because Donald Trump is facing so many charges, as you point out, that, as a practical matter, the jury is going to have to check not guilty many different times if he's going to essentially escape scot-free here.

We've known about this for a really, really long time. So, it will just depend on what has been exchanged to date and whether or not there's more out there that could potentially be relevant to the case. Look, both sides want to ensure that there's no surprise as a trial that due process is given because that's an appellate issue if it's not. So, there will be ample time to review these documents, but will they be able to delay this much further than the summer? I highly doubt it.

I mean, what you really saw there was sort of a slowly sinking ship as the judge has started throwing argument after argument,making point after point, asking question after question. And I think the attorney was doing a very able job of trying to field all of that. But at its core, the issue really gets resolved by some of the things that the judge said very early on. And so, for example, one point that the judge made very early on is that, as a practical matter, a lot of crimes involve speech and can be committed just with speech alone, right? So, for example, he used the examples of solicitation, which is, of course, one of the crimes that's charged in this particular indictment, or, you know, terroristic threats or other things. So, the mere fact that speech is involved is not just positive. And one other issue that has been going back and forth, there's been a discussion just before we broke about the allegations in the indictment. And the reason that that's so important right now is that there hasn't been a trial yet. The facts aren't asserted yet. We don't know exactly what the evidence is. We don't know exactly what the witness testimony will be. All that we know are the government's allegations in the indictment. And at this stage of the proceedings, they have to be accepted is true. And it's not going to surprise your viewers to know that, typically, prosecutors write indictments in a way that preserves their arguments and makes them look like they are making a defensible prosecution. So, it's just a very uphill battle. And as a result, I think the lawyers are having a difficult time dealing with all of that.",

Essentially, what's happening right now is that Trump's attorneys are arguing that because of the circumstances, because it's political speech, because it was Trump, they're saying validly questioning the result of the election, that it falls under that category of protected speech, and that the indictment itself, and you hear them going through certain counts and pointing to certain counts in the indictment, that the allegation by prosecutors that says those statements were false is not enough to serve as the basis for the indictment and that First Amendment protections should prevail. And what I anticipate we're going to hear from the judge, and I'm saying this not because I'm making up my own arguments, I'm saying this because we've heard these arguments before, we're in Groundhog's Day, right, we've heard two other challenges, the judge is going to say that those are very valid arguments for trial, but they're not enough to overcome the indictment, that there are factual questions, like whether or not the statements were false, and those are questions for a jury. And so at this particular stage of the game, it's unlikely to be successful on this First Amendment challenge. That doesn't mean that it isn't an argument at some point down the line. So, I think that we're just -- what we're hearing now is zealous advocacy in the part of a defendant -- you know, any defense attorney is going to make these arguments, but it's just very unlikely to be successful, especially since we've already heard the same arguments previously, with two other cases that were not successful.",

We've already heard from the prosecution team, so that's the office of District Attorney Fani Willis, arguing that all of the speech that Donald Trump is trying to say is constitutionally protected cannot result in a criminal charge and thus must have this case against him dismissed. The prosecutors are saying that all of that speech, it's part of the criminal conduct. It doesn't matter if it is tweets or things Trump was saying publicly, even though there is a First Amendment right in this country, in the way that it's charged under Georgia state law, that should be considered part of the allegations, and this is a fair case going forward. They've also floated to the judge the idea that this isn't something that the judge needs to deal with just yet without knowing more facts of this case having that portion of court proceedings. And then we have already heard quite a bit from Donald Trump's lawyer. his name is Steven Sadow. And he is saying that these things that Donald Trump is charged with doing as part of his conspiracy charges, his racketeering charges, along with many other defendants, that that is the zenith of protected speech, his tweets, his speech on The Ellipse, the things he was saying personally to people about fake electors, about protesting the election, even if he knew it was fraudulent. All of the allegations, Sadow says, involve expressive conduct or speech, and thus this case should be tossed. We are going to wait and see what the judge says here. He could rule today or indicate which way he's leaning today, but, typically, he would write a written opinion at some point down the line. We also are very likely to be hearing from a co-defendant of Donald Trump today, the attorneys for David Shafer, a top political Republican official in the state of Georgia who's charged as leading that fake elector plot here. They're going to be arguing that he was just following what lawyers were telling him to do and the law as he believed it to be. So, those are the stress test points that are happening today in court. They're talking about the law in this moment that refocuses this criminal case against Donald Trump and 14 others in Georgia on the facts, the allegations, and the legal issues at play here as they head towards trial after weeks, if not months, of distraction that the court has had to deal with in handling ethics allegations against the district attorney that led to the resignation of her top prosecutor recently. Everybody is back in court, and the hearing is still ongoing.",

But what I'm suggesting is if all of the overt acts are nothing more than core political speech or expressiveconduct and nothing else is alleged, which is not protected by the First Amendment, then you have an insufficient basis for which he has been indicted because he's being indicted for First Amendment speech and not for unprotected speech. And therefore the statement that was made about if it were true, we could still use it as an overt act suggests that they can prosecute true speech, which is what we're trying to get to here. It's the nature of the speech, the political speech the heightened value of such, which gets this situation different than others, and the fact that it comes from then- president of the United States. Going back to what was said in addition by the state. What the state claims is criminal here is lying to the government. That's what it said. That's the exact reason why, in several of the Supreme Court cases, it's been found to be protected speech, because it deals with the government and falsity and in the sense of communication with or to the government is best dealt with through true speech, not through prosecutions, because prosecutions chill speech. And when it comes to political core speech, what you don't want is chilled. I use -- fortunately, I have a co-counsel that is able to pull things up and help me inform the court, until the computer shuts down. And looking at what Haley says, just to give you an idea of how the Georgia court, the Supreme Court might look at this. There's a quote from Haley, and it says, while there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact, such erroneous statements are nevertheless inevitable in free debate and punishment of error runs the risk of inducing a cautious and restrictive exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech and press. Accordingly, the First Amendment requires that we protect some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters. And I think that's what we're talking about here. To end this, and, again, we're focusing on President Trump's conduct that at the time that he, in fact, is the head of the executive branch, there is references to this in Brown v. Hartlage, and I cited that earlier.",

This, of course, is just one of multiple legal issues facing the former president. He is also the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, of course. There is no trial date in this Fulton County case, no indication yet from the judge when one will be announced. I want to bring in former state and Federal Prosecutor David Weinstein. David, good to have you with us. As we've been watching this play out this morning, so this hearing is about a motion that the former president's attorneys filed. They want these charges thrown out. They say, basically, look, whatever the former president said, this was protected as free speech, and therefore we shouldn't be in this courtroom. It doesn't sound like the judge at this point is maybe going along with that. We know there have been similar motions from other co-defendants, which were not successful. Walk us through what you're hearing so far and what it tells you about where the judge could be leaning.",

And as you said, we've heard these arguments before, not only in this courtroom, as to other defendants, but we've heard them in district courts, we've heard them made throughout the country in the cases in which the former president is facing the same or similar types of charges. And it's the judge's job to let both sides present their arguments and to have a complete and full record so that there's due process. And just because he might agree on one point doesn't mean that he is going to agree on everything that they've said. They have been successful in a couple of motions here before this judge. We've seen them throw out some of the counts with directions to the district attorney as to how the judge believes they could be re-filed, if that's what they want to do. But I think on this, I think that he's telegraphed a little bit that he'll let them make their arguments, but I also think that he's hearing what the government is saying, that this is, in some way, premature. And you have to remember whether the statement is true or false and whether it's couched as this political speech depends on the statement and the facts behind it. And the people who decide the facts, those are the jurors who are going to be selected to hear this case. And so the judge might trim some of this indictment, and you heard him asking some questions about, well, what if there were other facts that were alleged? Wouldn't that still support the first count? I don't see him going as far as the defense is asking him to go, but he's certainly letting them make their arguments. And that's what a good judge should do.",
