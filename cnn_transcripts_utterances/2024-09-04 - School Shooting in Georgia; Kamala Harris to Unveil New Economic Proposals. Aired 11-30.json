Kamala Harris has been dealing with bullies her whole life, going all the way back to the schoolyard in California.But when she was the attorney general, she took on bullies who were preying on people, who were who were taking advantage of people. She took them on and she won. She got $20 billion from the big banks who were taking advantage of homeowners. So I think she knows a thing or two about how to handle a bully in a scenario like that. I think what she will do in the debate is talk about her vision for the country and talk about how Donald Trump is offering the same old, same old chaos and division that we have seen for the last decade. And aren't we tired of that? Don't we want to turn the page on that and move forward? That's what she's going to offer to the country, including her economic vision, which she continues to talk about today.",

That's a ninth-through-12th grade high school. And we don't know a lot right now. We don't know victims, the number of them, if there have been any casualties. We just know that there is a very active scene with police swarming the area, a scene of large ambulances. There is at least one medical helicopter could be seen airlifting a patient from the scene, all of this unfolding just within the last hour-and-a-half, so still very, very fluid situation. We're still getting details here. But, still, you're looking at an active scene in Winder, Georgia, 45 minutes Northeast of Atlanta, where there is potentially an active shooter there on the scene, police being very limited with the details, only saying that they were responding.

That's a good question. I mean, obviously, banning assault weapons, things of that nature, but the bottom line is nothing's going to be done about it because Congress is not going to take any kind of action that's going to be meaningful that will keep the guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Schools have been taking steps on their own to have better security, locking doors, making sure each classroom door can be locked. I don't know about this particular location, but schools have been taking steps on their own to have better security. But even so, you still have incidents like this take place.

There's some unconfirmed rumors right now of just how many individuals were injured. We're not going to report that out. They're not verified yet by CNN. But what I can tell you is, it's still an active situation, individuals texting me, some of them still in lockdown. You can see crowds out there at the track and field of the local high school, Apalachee High School, again, ninth through 12, about 1,900 students. And we got these unconfirmed reports of a shooting earlier this morning. Now that shooting has been confirmed with a hospital source telling us that there are several, or some, I should say, victims from this shooting on their way to the hospital right now -- Wolf.",

When I drive around here in the Washington, D.C., area, whether in suburban Maryland or in Virginia, and I pass a high school and I see police cars in front of the high school, I say to myself, that's a sign of how awful the situation potentially could be when there have to be police in front of high schools to try to prevent these kinds of shooting incidents.

There's nothing like seeing blood on the floor of a school that brings you right back to reality.I will tell you that in -- I agree with what Chief Ramsey was saying. What we're doing now, besides -- just put the gun issue just to the side for one moment, not that we should as a society, but we know that we're not going to get gun legislation in the near-term. And right now, there's so many guns out there. What we need to do is make these schools about five minutes slower to access. And I don't mean for the regular students. I mean, if you have school in session and you can slow down a shooter maybe three minutes until the average police response time, you can save multiple lives. And there is some fencing on this school, but it looked to be hop-over size. So I think as horrible as it sounds to have to do this, we have to harden our schools the way we have hardened our airports a little bit.",

Are we going -- I'm not saying you take an elementary school and put a metal detector in it necessarily, but a high school? Maybe. But what we find is that the shooters don't come in with the students necessarily the very first moment school starts. They wait until school is under way. So simply protecting the school while this -- while the students -- or while class is in session, that's something I think we can do. And, again, I'm not saying stop everything else. I'm just saying that we can't wait until there's some action on what guns are available in society.",
