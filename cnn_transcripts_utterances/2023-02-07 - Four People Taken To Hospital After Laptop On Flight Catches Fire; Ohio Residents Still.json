This is exactly why the FAA has that rule that has you put lithium batteries and lithium-ion batteries in your carryon bags and not in your checked bags simply because they can become so flammable. The chemical inside is very dangerous.This is United flight 2664. It was on his way from San Diego to Newark. What I'm hearing from United Airlines a battery pack, an external battery pack caught fire, and a crew used something called a thermal containment bag to keep the fire from spreading throughout the cabin. It's been on airplanes since about 2016 because of the fire risk posed by lithium batteries. The flight was only in the air for about ten minutes, but ultimately about six people had to be treated by emergency workers on the scene there. Four of them went to the hospital. But this was such a big risk on board airplanes, these lithium airplanes. In fact, back in 2015, a UPS flight crashed because of a shipment of lithium batteries on board caught fire. There is really, really serious risk here, and the FAA and NTSB have both put out a lot of guidance about this. They are worried this could become more and more prevalent as we see these lithium batteries in more and more devices like smartphones, laptops, those battery backs, cameras, they're pretty much everywhere nowadays -- Victor and Bianna. Kudos for the crew for their quick thinking and response there and their training. And also, a reminder, these rules are in place for a reason, right. BLACKWELL: Yes, certainly.",

When can they go home?First what has to happen is the EPA has to continue to do their testing at the site within the evacuation zone, and that includes testing the air, the water, the soil. They have to see what the safe limits are, and all that research basically isn't in yet. And so, they can't move on that until that research is in. And what happened is just a little earlier, the fire chief explained what they're up against in terms of trying to get that information in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Tonight, the State of the Union address will mark his first in front of a divided Congress. This is an opportunity for the president to tout the accomplishments of his first two years in office, and test out his message for re-election.Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, she is a Democrat from Washington. She's a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Congresswoman, good to have you. Let's start here with a couple of numbers here. This one the ABC News, \"Washington Post\" poll over the weekend, 6 and 10 -- more than 6 in 10 Americans say the president has accomplished very little or nothing at -- close to nothing in his first two years. What does he have to do tonight to potentially convince those 6 out of 10? REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Well, Victor, it's great to be with you. I think people just need to hear from the president. They need to hear him brag about the tremendous accomplishments, and the fact that he has under just this last two years created almost 11 million new jobs, brought unemployment down in this country to the lowest level in over half a century. We're building things in America again. Now some of these things haven't happened across the country yet because legislation takes a while to actually show up in districts, but, you know, I do know that seniors across the country are already feeling the effects of having $35 cap on insulin. These are all the things that I think the president will talk about tonight. And he will make sure that people understand this is a new era where this Democratic Party, this president care about working people, not about the wealthiest, you know, corporations and individuals that got big tax breaks under Donald Trump, but actually about working people, raising taxes on the wealthiest in order to fund things that really make life better for people every day.",

But let me give you one more number, 41 percent of the people in this poll said that they're actually financially worse off than they were at the start of this administration. This is the highest number in the 37-year history of this poll higher than at the worst point of the great recession. So, this is not so much a messaging problem. People are feeling worse financially.",

COVID combined with the economic crisis, that was a tremendous amount of pain that people went through under the last administration, under the last president. This president is the president that actually got shots in arms, that kept small businesses going. I don't expect that people will feel like everything is great because the reality is we've got a lot more work to do. And Victor, I think we're going to hear the president tonight talkabout the biggest inflationary cost that families are facing, things like child care and housing. Those are the things that are still to do in the president's agenda that he laid out that we got very close to accomplishing last session, but that we are going to get done once we have majorities again. So I think you'll hear, of course, what we've done, but absolutely recognizing that Americans are still feeling pain, and that this president is going to use executive action, things like raising the overtime threshold to give workers -- 30 million workers across the country --",

He fixed the ACA glitch to get millions more health care. There's more health care -- more Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act than ever before. So, he has been doing that. He will continue to do that. But I think the key message here, Victor, is this is a president who understands how to get things done. This is a Democratic Party that has delivered a lot for people. We have a lot more to do, and we will take that opportunity over the next two years, and hopefully when we get the majorities back again in 2024.",

Am I getting that number, right? 10 million deaths a year by 2050, because of these? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Yes, I know. It's pretty staggering. And I've got to tell you, before the pandemic, if you would have asked people in the infectious disease community what worries them the most globally, it would have been anti-microbial resistance. This idea that bacteria, viruses, even fungi, we have things can that help treat these in types of infections, but it becomes more limit as these pathogens figure out ways to evade what are the current, you know, sort of medications that are out there. So about 5 million right now deaths associated with anti-microbial resistance. That was 2019. But just like you said, by 2050 up to 10 million. So, you know, this is a significant concern. I think part of the reason they're releasing this report is to just show people just how significant a problem this could develop into over the next several years.

You know, when you think about antibiotic resistance -- again a lot of people have heard this term - there're a lot of things that are driving this. But one of the biggest things is that we are over-using antibiotics. Somebody has an infection, if you give antibiotics, what happens is, it may kill a certain population of the cells, but there may be some cells that were not killed by those antibiotics that will now replicate over and over again and they become these so-called super bugs. The more we use these or overuse these, the bigger problem that problem that I just described is. It's not just in people, but also in livestock, our food supply.Climate change could be driving this. The same factors that warm the climate could also be inducing resistance among some of these pathogens, as well. Pollution, another driver. You know, it's interesting, about something like fungi, for example. Fungi actually -- it's hard to get a fungus infection because our bodies are 98.6 degrees. Fungi don't grow really well in that temperature. As the climate warms, those pathogens start to become more acclimated to warmer temperatures, and as a result, maybe more likely to infect the human body, if that makes sense. So you can see, this is all sort of a big circle of events that kind of feeds itself.",

In the United States, if you sort of track between 2012, 2017, 2018, we seem to be making some progress in terms of deaths associated with anti-microbial resistance. Then you go to 2020, and all of a sudden, the numbers go back up. Close to 30,000 people, 29,400 people died as a result of anti-microbial resistance in 2020. Many of them, 40 percent, while in the hospital.Now, the exact relationship is, you know, is not entirely clear. But one of the things that happens is that a lot of times, even for viral infections, people inappropriately receive antibiotics. Which are supposed to treat bacterial infections. That leads to an overuse of antibiotics, which again, can fuel this anti-microbial resistance.",
