And, Wolf, talking to voters throughout the day, it was clear, if people liked Fetterman going into the debate, they certainly liked him coming out of the debate. But it's the undecided voters that sliver in the middle who, of course, are so important to this. Now, all of this comes as nearly 700,000 people have already voted here in Pennsylvania.

And I think this is going to have an enormous view on the race. John Fetterman couldn't articulate his views on fracking, a major economic issue in the commonwealth, he couldn't speak about crime or he's been questioned about his record on the board of pardons. So, that performance was bad. Yes, Dr. Oz made a gaffe but I think that's going to be a much smaller issue than the issue of qualifications of John Fetterman, which have been legitimately called into question.

But the reality is it became an untenable situation for them about six weeks or so ago. The Oz campaign was pushing the Fetterman campaign to debate. And that is something that voters also wanted to see these candidates side by side.So, at first, the Fetterman campaign resisted for several weeks but then it simply was looking clear that he wasn't ready for this. So, really, the only thing to do in the eyes of his advisers was to hit that debate stage, but it was a definite high risk, without question. What I was picking up here today was a sense of disappointment among some of Fetterman's supporters, that he was not able to prosecute the case against Oz as well as his social media accounts have throughout the summer and early fall. They've been, of course, going after him about his residency, the number of homes he's owned, et cetera. That was not something that Fetterman was able to do with much success last night. But I also think this is something, as Kaitlan was saying earlier, all voters do not watch debates. I ran into several voters here today who said, I didn't watch the debate. I'll catch up with it in the coming days. So, it certainly is another opportunity for both sides to still reengage, but this race seems as close as ever and, of course, it's one of the most important, if not, the most important Senate race in the country.",

It's a part of a series of smaller bore targeted efforts, whether it's on airlines, car rental companies, the internet, to try and lessen or lower fees over the course of time. What it underscores more than anything else, though, as you've seen the president acknowledge, is for an administration that helped navigate and put into place one of the quickest economic recoveries in history based on the post-pandemic economic state of play, there is still very real concern outside in the country about the state of the economy.

The thing that -- and this is what Phil was talking about, the thing that the president thinks about all the time, especially as it relates to the economy, he thinks about how is he going to deliver for American families, how is he going to lower costs? You heard Phil talk about what he did in the post era that we're in when it comes to the American rescue plan, making sure that we have a strong economy and we see this with jobs going up, with strong jobs market, low unemployment at about 3.5 percent. And so that matters. And we're going to continue to do the work to lower costs for American people, as we did today. So look, we understand what's at stake and that's what the president has been very clear about these last couple of days, to show the American people that there's going to be a choice that needs to be made and to be very clear about what the other side is trying to do as well. They're trying to take away the gains that we've made. The plans that they have put forth, it's not a plan to fix inflation, it's actually a plan to increase inflation, not lower it.

He is -- I've also said the president sees him as an authentic advocate for the middle class and that matters. And so the president has been the lieutenant governor for quite some time over the past several months. He was just there a week ago today when we were in Pittsburgh talking about the Fern Hollow Bridge that collapsed in January when the president talked about the bipartisan infrastructure law, his law that helped really not just create jobs but also is going to help build that bridge back up in less than a year.

Has he discussed with you or do you have any sense of how the U.S. would respond if the Russians, for example, were to use some sort of radioactive dirty bomb against Ukraine? JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we've been very clear. We have categorically called the Russians and said what they are claiming is false. We have been very clear that we are going to continue to assist the Ukrainian people and support them until this war ends. The president has been very clear about that. We have seen how bravely they have been fighting for their freedom, for their democracy. And so what you're seeing is our allies, our partners coming together in a way that Putin didn't know we can do. And so we're going to continue that support. Look, I'm not going to go into our conversations with Russia. I'm not going to specifics, but we have been also very clear we have not seen any evidence that that is going to occur, the atomic bombs that they have been saying that Ukraine is going to potentially do, which is, again, not true.

What can you tell us about that?JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we have been very clear about how we believe parts of that report was mischaracterized and there has been some changes that have been made to that report. Look, we've also been clear that our trip, that the president's trip to the Middle East was not about oil. What the president is focused on currently in today and has been for the past several months since the war started, remember, because of Russia's war, we have seen a spike in gas prices, so as you hear us say, Russia's tax hike. And so we have done everything that we can and continue to do the work the president has to lower the prices for the American people. That's why you see gas prices go down.",

The judge has decided he was necessary to the investigation and was pretty skeptical of the arguments Meadows was putting forward for why he shouldn't have to show up.So, this is a victory for prosecutors in part because it sort of gets them over the first hurdle, which is this judge saying, look, you do need to show up in Georgia. Prosecutors put forth a couple of dates in November where they thought he could show up and testify. But Meadows' team is already saying that he plans to repeal. They're going to look at their legal options. We're waiting to see how that plays out. We haven't seen court filings to that effect. And, remember, this goes back to this criminal investigation in Georgia into efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to try to overturn the 2020 election. We all remember that phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find the votes needed for Trump to win Georgia, a state he lost. Meadows was on that call. That's one of the reasons that prosecutors want to talk to him. But there are a number of other things he did related to the Georgia election in 2020 that prosecutors are interested in. We should also note he's not the only high-profile witness who's trying to fight this subpoena. We've talked about South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. He's another one who is still trying to fight his subpoena to appear before the grand jury. The Supreme Court has temporarily put that subpoena on hold while they decide if they're going to weigh in on this case. And these are two very big witnesses for the D.A.'s office and waiting to see what happens with them.",
