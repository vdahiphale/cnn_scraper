But she certainly knew of and I'm assuming was supported by Emily's List over the years, as I was. It's a formidable group supporting women for Congress. And getting their endorsement was a huge deal. She probably knew this woman. The new news for me is no preconditions. I had thought he was planning to nominate a caretaker, but this does mix up the race and there already is an African-American woman in the race, Barbara Lee, a former aide to Ron Dellums, whom I served with and adored. So -- and the other candidates, Katie Porter and Adam Schiff, I think are formidable, too. But my point is that this could mix up the race if she decides to stay in it. It also will give her more clout in the Senate if she is not a caretaker, I suppose. The crucial thing is for Alex Padilla to help her learn the ropes quickly and be a senator, not just a campaign person. And I assume he wants to do that. I've read some very positive comments by him about her.",

So, the fact is, in my opinion, it's Taylor Swift who is dominating the average NFL team. Now, let me take you a little nugget further and give you an understanding of why perhaps Taylor Swift is so big and is propelling the interest in the NFL and, of course, her beau. Statistically similar great performances. So, my buddy Neal Payne (ph) over at \"The Messenger\" basically put Taylor Swift on a -- the same page sort of statistically, how good she is compared to the average. How good is Taylor Swift? Well, if she was an NFL player, she'd be on the same page as Tom Brady through this point in her career, and Barry Sanders, who, of course, could run with the ball like nobody's business.

And them you get a pop princess. This is our sports version of Megan and Harry, right? Like, you get a bona fide pop princess in Taylor Swift, you get our royalty in America, a sports athlete. This is a match made in media heaven. Look, I saw more Travis Kelce commercials than I've ever seen in last night's game.

He is accused of accepting bribes to benefit Egypt in exchange for cash, gold bars, home mortgage payments and other compensation. Menendez has denied any wrongdoing and is dismissing calls from 30 Senate Democrats urging him to resign.New Jersey Congressman Andy Kim was one of the first lawmakers to call on Menendez to step down, has now jumped into the 2024 race for the Senate seat Menendez has held since 2006. Congressman Kim joins us now. Appreciate your time. I want to get to kind of the House dynamics of your day job in a minute, but to start with your decision to jump in. I think, in talking to Democrats, most of whom speak highly of you, they were still surprised by how quickly you made that decision. Did you have an infrastructure kind of in wait or did you just decide to go without a campaign apparatus set up? REP. ANDY KIM (D-NJ) AND NEW JERSEY SENATE CANDIDATE: No. Yes, no, no infrastructure. It was not something I was planning on doing. In fact, Saturday, when I announced my run to challenge Menendez, it was my kid's eighth birthday. I had to ask him permission to step out from our family celebration to be able to send that tweet out. I felt compelled to do so. I felt compelled in part because of my family. The fact that he is my senator, he is my kids' senator, and I want them to be able to look to a leader with integrity and I believe that New Jersey deserves better. So, that's why I jumped in.",

And, you're right, when I jumped in to run for Congress six years ago, you know, no one in the political establishment knew my name at the time, but it was my home. You know, I was running in my home community. People here knew me. So, you know, that's what we're up against right now. You know, we just want to make sure that, you know, we're all trying to have the accountability that we need.We were able to raise about a million dollars in this first week. I mean it's been incredible seeing the outpouring of folks all over the country. So, you know, I'm excited about the energy and I hope that the people have a choice in this and that they see this as a choice for integrity.",

They'd need Democratic help. What's your sense right now? You're not considered a far left progressive who doesn't come across the aisle. Is that something you would be amenable to?",

I mean we had millions of federal employees unsure what's happening. A lot of people concerned about what -- a lot of seniors concerned about Social Security and other issues. So, I really think that we need to make sure we're focused on the American people. And if it looks like we're just trying to figure out our own internal musical chairs, you know, people are not going to stand for that.So, I - look, I'll deal with it as it comes, but right now it's not something that's taking up any of my bandwidth.",

KIMare - that are happening, that's thinking through these priorities. I mean certainly if that were to actually come to be it would need to be something where we see what are we getting out of it, because I'll be honest with you, Kevin McCarthy is someone who's been on the wrong side of almost every issue that I've been trying to push forward, whether it's health care or climate change or, you know, the concerns about a nationwide abortion ban. These are things we cannot see come to fruition. So, we need to see something significant. But like I said, right now the main thing is we need to focus on delivering for the American people, making sure we don't have a shutdown, making sure that we can show that we can govern and we have adults in the room.",
