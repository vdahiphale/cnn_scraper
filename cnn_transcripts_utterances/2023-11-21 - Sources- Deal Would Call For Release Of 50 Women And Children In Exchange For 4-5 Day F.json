      "sentences": "Yes, captain mediators have been involved from the very outset over weeks of complex negotiations. They are mediating these tools between Hamas on the one side and Israel on the other who are not in direct negotiation supported, of course, by the United States as well.And what I've been told by a diplomatic source very familiar with these talks is that Qatar hopes to announce a deal in the very near future, and we are talking about ours, at this point, if not less than that. We do know that the Israelis are gathering their war cabinet, then there'll be a security cabinet. And then this deal, the details of this deal will be put in front of the government. And at that stage, if it is all agreed on, there will be an announcement. On the release in the first phase of 50 hostages, mostly women and children. In fact, almost all women and children are in this first phase, and I'm being told it will be mostly children, Israelis and some jewel nationals potentially. This is in exchange for Palestinian women and teenagers held in Israeli prisons. For every one hostage released. In Gaza, it will be three released from Israeli prisons. So that's the sort of -- those are the sort of parameters of this deal. Names at this point are not available, but multiple sources telling us that this is a four-day truce. And I use that term very specifically, this is not a ceasefire, Dana, that is being agreed to here. This is a truce in the Gaza Strip. The pillar of this deal, of course, is the hostage release. It also includes the entry of some 300 trucks a day of aid. The Israelis in this agreement, as we understand it, are to stop their ground operations for this period of four to five days. And at periods during the day, will stop flying surveillance drones. So this is a truce agreement, brokered by Qatar here with the support of the United States between Israel and Hamas expect to see the first phase, the first 50 of these hostages released in groups over those four to five days. And I'm told by those who are very close to these talks, that should this be successful, should it hold, should this four-day truce hold. There was a very good likelihood that there will be another phase of this almost immediately, which will allow for the release of another 50 hostages. This is not all the hostages, we know that. We are talking about probably around 100 in this agreement, ultimately. So for families who've got young men, soldiers still being held or held by Hamas in Gaza, this is going to be very disappointing, but it's a big breakthrough, the first breakthrough in -- since this conflict began and it's certainly a start, as far as those involved in these talks are concerned.

Just the thinking that they might be in the tunnels and for more weeks and days, and eventually some of them will get killed or ill. This is who we are as Israelis. I'm actually proud of that. So if it's 123, 123. If it's 104, 104. What's important is that eventually we get them all back, hopefully alive.",

This is who we are as a people. This has devalue the core value of us as a Jewish people. We need to get them back. But this won't end because there will be no future for the Gazans as long as they are ruled by Gaza. The Gazans -- Hamas has betrayed his own people, not only a strike a massacre upon us.

We saw earlier today two very, very large explosions louder than we have seen in recent days. [12And we also saw there was a smokescreen deployed in the area of Beit Hanoun, the northeastern most city in the Gaza Strip, indicating that troops -- Israeli troops are likely moving either vehicles or personnel. And clearly, the fighting is continuing even as the Israeli government nears a possibility, the possibility of finalizing this potential agreement to free hostages. And it is also very clear that the fighting will continue right up until a truce agreement is potentially announced. That has been the history of this conflict in the past, where in the hours before a truce or a ceasefire is announced, oftentimes, the fighting intensifies very often on both sides. But at this hour, Dana, I also want to tell you about some conversations I had with the families of some of those children who are held hostage inside of Gaza. I spoke with a couple of different families. One of them is the family of Shiri Bibas who -- a woman who was taken hostage inside of Gaza with two of her children, a 10-month- old and a four-year-old. I spoke with Yifat Zeiler, her cousin, who told me that at the at this moment, they feel largely in the dark about whether or not these family members who are being held hostage in Gaza are or are not on the list of people who will be released as part of this initial deal if indeed it goes through. And she said that it is really an anxious moment. They are largely getting their information from news reports. And they are really trying to avoid getting their hopes up too high because of the uncertainty about whether their family members are still alive and whether or not they are indeed on the list to be released dinner.
