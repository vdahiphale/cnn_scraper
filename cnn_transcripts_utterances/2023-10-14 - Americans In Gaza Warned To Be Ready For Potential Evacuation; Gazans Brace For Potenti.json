There's breaking news we're following this hour. Americans and other stuck in war ravaged Gaza are on alert to evacuate potentially at any moment. The State Department is urging U.S. citizens to move closer and closer to the Rafah border, the southern part of Gaza crossing from Gaza into Egypt in case it opens up with little notice.Local media reported earlier that Egypt was not, repeat, not allowing American citizens through the crossing. More than one million civilians in the northern part of Gaza are under Israeli orders to flee to the south. And evacuation the United Nations is calling impossible. The humanitarian crisis escalating right now amid widespread destruction and a mounting death toll in Gaza now rising above 2200. It's been a full week of punishing Israeli airstrikes in response to the horrific and very deadly Hamas terror attack on Israel. Last weekend that killed some 1300 people. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaling a ground invasion of Gaza could in fact be imminent, as he met with frontline Israeli troops and declared they're ready for the next phase. I'll bring in my colleague Sara Sidner who's joining us from Tel Aviv right now. Sara, Israeli leaders have warned this war is only just beginning.",

We have been watching the troops amass on the border. We're talking some 300,000 reservists who have come into Israel, come to the border in preparation.We've watched those preparations. We've also seen here in Tel Aviv. A city that is bursting with activity normally, even on the Shabbat. This place has beaches and people are usually having great fun on a Saturday. It is absolutely quiet. That is not normal. Places are close, people are in their homes for the most part. A very different scene than we're used to. And also, thousands of Palestinian civilians are moving to southern Gaza after the Israeli military warned them to leave northern Gaza for their own safety. The U.S. told American citizens also to move closer to the Gaza border with Egypt. The U.N. has said the evacuation though of a million people in one of the most densely populated areas on Earth is impossible. And today, the U.N. condemned the evacuation order as a crime against humanity and a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. The U.N. is also saying that food and fresh water is running extremely low and quickly will run out. Salma Abdelaziz is following all of these developments. Salma, the U.N. chief says look, the humanitarian situation in Gaza was already critical.

And this as yourself know, Sara. If they go into, for instance, refugee camps, in Shati Refugee Camp. One of the most crowded areas, in a strip of land, it's already very crowded. The alleys are maybe a meter and a half wide. So, getting in there and conducting military operations among these breeze block houses is going to be a bloodbath.

Now, according to the Israeli military, 30 mortar rounds were fired into Israel.Initially, the Israelis responded and this set off a back and forth of fire. The likes of which we haven't seen since we got to South Lebanon. Now according to the Israeli military, in the process of this exchange, there was an attempt to infiltrate into Israel. They say they conducted an airstrike to neutralize those infiltrators. Hezbollah for its part put out a statement stating that it is struck with precision weapons, targets within -- Israeli targets in the Shebee farms area. Now local Lebanese media are reporting that to an elderly couple in the town of Shebaa, the Lebanese town of Shebaa was -- were killed when their house was hit. That's today.

Hamas planned at least a two-phase, maybe a three-phase operation here.The first phase was going to Israel, kill as many people as you can, make them as mad as possible and invite them to attack on the ground. Second phase, let them come in, keep your civilian population in place, use the civilians as human shields, get the world's press attention on it, show how inhumane the Israelis are, use world opinion against the Israelis. If it takes three weeks, four weeks, five weeks and the Israelis get really bogged down, maybe Hezbollah will even come in from the north and maybe even Iran. But at the minimum, what you've done is you've shown up in front of world opinion the Israelis. Hamas is deliberately doing this. They're deliberately putting two million people at risk. They're deliberately using the civilians as human hostages. And when I see the United Nations secretary-general talking about crimes against humanity, it's Hamas that's starting the crimes against humanity. This was a terrorist act. It was a slaughter last Saturday. It was done deliberately to provoke what the Israelis have no choice but to do. They can't live with this. They can't let this threat persist on the border of their country. So everybody knew what was are going to happen, especially Hamas knew. So I think the condemnation starts with the condemnation of Hamas. This is an organization that was created with the express purpose of eliminating Israel. So the people that voted for Hamas knew what they were voting for. Maybe some of them were coerced into it. But Hamas is a militant terrorist organization. It's not an alternative government. It's not the Palestinian Authority. It's not someone you can reason with. I think we have to understand this is a war not only on the ground in Gaza, but a war of global opinion. And right now, on CNN, on of the battlefields, this is what it's about. It's the American public, the global public watching this and saying, oh, what's happening, why, and who's right, who's wrong and what can be done on this? The simple fact is it began with Hamas. Israel is going to do what it has to do to survive as a state. Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of Israel, using its own civilian population as hostages and weapons in this war. It's a totally immoral, terrible approach. I hope it will receive the global condemnation that it warrants.",

Israel says, look, we have cut off the electricity, in particular, to try and stop Hamas from being able to operate at its normal operations trying to build things, rockets, sending them over. I'm curious from you, this ground incursion, if it happens or when it happens, as a lot of people believe, what are the goals for Israel as they go into this? One of the things I have heard, having lived here for a while in years past, is that Israel doesn't want to rule or be the ruler of Gaza. They don't want to have to deal with ruling Gaza.

If it gets bogged down, if reinforcements have to be sent in, if it drags on and drags on, maybe the mullahs in Iran make a mistake and decide this is their moment. You know, we say it's terrible that Israel has declared war on Hamas, but Iran has declared war on Israel for years, and at every step, declares it's committed to the total destruction of Israel. Vladimir Putin has declared war on NATO. His people say, you know, this is a fight by Russia against NATO. We don't say that, because we don't want that to be the case. But in the case of Israel here, they're in a battle for their survival. They know it. It was a horrific attack that was perpetrated last Saturday.
