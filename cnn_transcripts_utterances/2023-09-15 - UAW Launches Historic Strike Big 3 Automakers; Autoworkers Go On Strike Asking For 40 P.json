They believe in the union's work. They believe in the union's demands. You have people who came from the picket lines to be here, you have people who came from inside factories.I met a busload of people who traveled all the way in from the Ford plants out in Kentucky. I also asked them how they were feeling about negotiations, they said that they are so happy to hear that the automakers and the union are getting back to the table tomorrow because ultimately, they want a deal too. They are also very encouraged that President Biden announced that he is sending senior adviser Gene Sperling and Labor Secretary Julie Su, to come to Detroit to try to help out with negotiations. They think that move only helps the situation. Now the plan is to hear from speakers on stage today. And then this group of hundreds of UAW members are going to walk a few blocks down the street to GM's headquarters, rally outside those offices and then make their way back here. But in just moments, Shawn Fain, Bernie Sanders and Governor Gretchen Whitmer are going to be taking the stage and people here are very excited to hear what they have to say, Jake.",

We did everything -- Barack Obama, when he took over and offered the bailout money to the companies, he met with us. And he said you guys going to have to take -- share some pain in this, and we did. An example I will share with you is starting pay at the Chrysler plant is $15.78 an hour coming out of bankruptcy. And here we are 14 years later, it's still $15.78 an hour. So, that's ridiculous.

That defiance still carries on today despite the constant brutal crackdown aimed to silence the courage of these protesters. CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour joins us now.

And the reason I say this is because they -- at least in Tehran and the big cities are now able to and are leaving their homes without their hijabs on, a mixing with members of the opposite sex and in, you know, in restaurants and other such places. And there are all sorts of reports and eyewitness accounts of women who say, yes, they have to screw their courage to the mosque as they leave their homes without the hijabs and sometimes they get abused and heckled and maybe harassed, but they basically tell those people to, you know, to go to, you know, do whatever themselves, and they are continuing to be able to go out without this hijab.Having said that, the regime is trying to preempt any, you know, demonstrations and protests over this anniversary. So it is cracking down on activist journalists and others. It is doing that kind of stuff right now. But this, we're told was never in the current circumstances going to be what many in the west envision like another revolution. It was women protesting for their rights alongside their male allies.

And today the Pentagon announced it is going to interview 19 additional service members who were firsthand witnesses to the bombing, but for some reason were not consulted for the Pentagon's initial investigation.This news comes amid an ongoing push from gold-star families and witnesses who cast doubt on the Pentagon's assessment that the attack was not preventable.

I've been shown an image by somebody who was there of who they thought the bomber may have been, or somebody associated with the bomber.

The initial Pentagon investigation, leaving so many individuals unsatisfied, essentially saying that many of the people whose testimony are presented in documents released by the Freedom of Information Act may have been confused because of brain trauma, leaving those who survived deeply angry at the official version of events.

And we spoke to dozens of Afghans who were the relatives or survivors of what they saw, were gunshot injuries there. There were 19 people who saw individual shot or was shot themselves. There were 14 cases where we had documents where individuals weren't shot or indicated gunfire. And there were staff at five separate hospitals in Kabul, who treated gunfire, but the U.S. and U.K. who also had personnel there as well say that No, the only people there firing were their personnel, and they didn't hit anybody at all. And in fact, all of these injuries and all of those accounts of people seeing gunfire amongst their own personnel were mistaken result of brain trauma, or the injuries that were seen were in fact, the result of the explosion itself, whose ball bearings, the shrapnel that the bomb detonated, were very similar in size to bullet wounds. A huge amount of holes here that need to be further investigated. And we are learning from CENTCOM today that in fact, they will interview those 19 U.S. military personnel but they're also holding out the possibility.
