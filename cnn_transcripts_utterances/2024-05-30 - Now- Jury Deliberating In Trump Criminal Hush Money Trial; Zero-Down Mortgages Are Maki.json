Earlier today, they reheard portions of the jury instructions.Here's what the reading of the instructions that Judge Juan Merchan covered: Reasonable doubt, how the law addresses the concept of an accomplice, in this case, Michael Cohen, the requirement to find the defendant guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree, definitions for enterprise, business record and intent as well. Joining us now is retired New York Criminal Court Judge George Grasso. He's been in court every day since the trial began. Judge, thanks so much for being with us. What's your take on the jurors asking for these instructions to be re- read?",

They want to -- they're not just diving in. And it's very unusual, frankly, in my experience that, on the first day of deliberations, which was yesterday, the jury sent a note out that they wanted to have such a wide swath of the judge's instructions re-read to them. That shows us that they are doing exactly what they should be doing in this case. They're going to dot the \"I\"s and cross the \"T\"s.",

Since I already took extensive notes of the instructions previously, yesterday, I spent the majority of that time carefully observing each juror. I was making a couple of notes about how I saw them. And in particular, I noticed the foreman, jury number one, juror number one, he was just so locked in, locked in in a way that I hadn't noticed him before. Every juror -- and I watched this very carefully from my vantage point inside the courtroom -- they were literally hanging on every one of the judge's words. It -- let me tell you, as a judge who has delivered instructions to jurors, you just don't see it like that so often. So very impressed. So this tells me they're starting in as a team. They're going to do this as a team. And I think they're going to work hard to come to verdict. But I wanted to hold my breath about hearing of them getting a verdict today or maybe even tomorrow. We may go into next week on this. I wouldn't be surprised.",

What they don't have to agree on is what those unlawful means were, right? They can choose from several different unlawful means. Would you have handled instructions in the same way?

Now this comes from United Wholesale Mortgage. They've launched this 0 percent down payment mortgage program. Yes, 0 percent down. It's open to first-time homebuyers and lower-income borrowers. And essentially, it's two loans. The first one covers 97 percent of the value of the home. And the second one is the remaining 3 percent, up to $15,000. Now, experts are stressing that borrowers really have to read and understand the fine print here. Because the good news is that second loan, it's interest free, which is great. And there are no monthly payments. Now if there's a catch, it's the fact that that's second loan, it doesn't go away. It is due in full when the mortgage is paid off, refinanced or the home is sold. Now, the mortgage company told me that the demand for this 0 percent down mortgage is off the charts. They just launched it two weeks ago and they've already gotten thousands of applications.",

So, sure, home prices continue to go up and up, but eventually, that may stop. And the problem is that if home prices actually go down, then theborrowers would instantly be underwater. Meaning they owe more than the home is actually worth. That's exactly what we saw during the subprime mortgage meltdown. So imagine a scenario where someone has to sell their home because they lose their job or they have to relocate, well, they still owe that second mortgage in full. And if they can't come up with the cash, well, they could face foreclosure, they could damage their credit. That's why Better Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher, he told me that this program has the potential to, quote, \"turn the American dream of home ownership almost immediately into a nightmare.\" Now the company is pushing back, saying that this program is good for consumers and that critics are, quote, \"uneducated about the current state of the industry.\" At the end of the day, Boris and Brianna, this is clearly a potential solution to the affordability problem. But it's just really important that borrowers understand what they're getting into because this is a solution that is not without risks.",
