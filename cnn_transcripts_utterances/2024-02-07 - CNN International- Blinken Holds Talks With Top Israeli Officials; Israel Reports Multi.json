      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London, in for Max Foster today.Just ahead, as the U.S. Secretary of State visits Israel, an Israeli official tells CNN there is no way it will accept a Hamas counter offer to a proposal aimed at releasing the hostages. We'll have all the details live from Tel Aviv. Plus, missiles strike multiple sites across Ukraine, cutting power to parts of the capital. We're live in Kyiv for the latest. And as pop superstar Taylor Swift rocks Tokyo days before she's expected at the Super Bowl, CNN catches up with some of her most devoted fans. And as pop superstar Taylor Swift rocks Tokyo days before she's expected at the Super Bowl, CNN catches up with some of her most devoted fans. America's top diplomat is holding crucial talks with key Israeli officials today, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will press for a humanitarian pause in Gaza and will discuss Hamas's response to a proposal to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by the group. Meanwhile, we're getting new details of that Hamas counter proposal. The group is outlining a three-phase plan lasting several months that would include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, freedom of movement for people in the enclave, as well as a massive humanitarian effort. This drone video shows the scale of the destruction in northern Gaza after four months of war. An Israeli official familiar with the negotiations says there is, quote, \"no way that Israel will agree to the Hamas proposal.\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now live from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, there was quite a bit of cautious optimism in the lead up to these proposals and counterproposals that a deal could be struck, but that seems to have been quite rapidly atomized by the response from the Israelis. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, yes, to a certain extent, I think that's true. But I also think that when you look at the details of this counterproposal from Hamas, you'll find that at least in the first phase of these three phases that Hamas has outlined in this counterproposal, each phase lasting 45 days, that first phase is actually not all that different to the initial broad framework that Israel proposed to Hamas as part of an agreement with the United States, Egypt, and Qatar.And that's because if you look at this, they're looking at the same category of people who would be released, women, children, sick, and the elderly. 45 days versus six weeks, about the same amount of time. An intensification of humanitarian aid, a temporary ceasefire, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from population centers. That's largely in line with what the Israelis initially proposed. But this starts to fall apart when you get to phases two and three. And that's in part because Hamas would see the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza during that second phase. And then in the third phase, you would see the exchange of bodies and remains of the deceased. Now, there's also another problem with phase one, which is that Hamas has effectively suggested that all prisoners detained by Israel since October 7th should be released. And an Israeli official is telling us that that there is no way that Israel will agree to those conditions, including a total ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. They are also saying, pushing back on this idea of releasing prisoners captured on October 7th. So there's no question that there is still significant, significant daylight, especially when you look at the broad goals that each side is trying to achieve. Israel, the Israeli prime minister in recent days, making clear that this war will not end until he has achieved victory in terms of releasing all the hostages, but also removing Hamas from power in Gaza. Hamas, meanwhile, is looking for a permanent ceasefire, a way to end this war. But the question is now, will they be able to reach a deal on phase one, for example, and then continue the negotiations to get to phase two, phase three? I think that's a real possibility here, but we will see. The ball very much back in Israel's court. Secretary of State Tony Blinken meeting today with the Israeli Prime Minister and other Israeli officials, and there's no doubt that they will be discussing this counter proposal and readying one of their own.",

And what we're seeing is that the fighting is continuing to be very, very close to several of these hospitals, in particular, Al Nasser Hospital, where thousands of internally displaced Palestinians are currently sheltering.And we've seen numerous videos on social media of what appeared to be sniper fire in the streets surrounding that hospital, making it nearly impossible for people looking for some sense of safety to actually be able to flee those hospitals and to head somewhere safer. The Israeli military, for its part, is claiming that once again in the last 24 hours, they killed dozens of Hamas fighters. What's also clear is that the fighting is continuing, not only in southern Gaza, but also in central and in northern Gaza. And the Israeli military is issuing warnings to civilians not to return to northern Gaza today. Bianca?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, it was a very big attack. And I have a bit of an update for you. We're saying that 40 -- that four were killed and 38 were injured. It's not actually 40 people who were injured here in the capital of Kyiv. That went up just a little bit, but it certainly was a large scale attack that we saw here.Certainly a lot larger than we've seen over the past couple of weeks. And on the one hand, it was large as far as the regions of the country that it targeted. You mentioned some of the places. Mykolaiv, for instance, where also a person was killed. That's in the south of the country. Also in the west of the country around Lviv places, they're targeted with missiles, some other places with missiles and with attack drones. Also in Kharkiv in the northeast of the country, there were some attacks. They're using some shorter range missiles. But the other thing about this attack, and we witnessed this on the ground in the early morning hours because most of us here were actually woken by air raid sirens and then by explosions at around 6:00 a.m. local time, I would say, was just the duration that all of this took. It went on for a very long time and it really came in two ways where we saw the surface to air missile systems here around this city really get to work. And I can tell you, it's a pretty awe inspiring experience when you see those surface to air missile systems launched their rockets and some of these cruise missiles and ballistic missiles that are coming in. So that certainly was a spectacle that people here saw. I don't know whether or not it has an influence on the morale here of this country. I do think it does show that the surface to air missile batteries that they have in the troops that are working on them certainly did a pretty good job. As far as we could tell, there's some interesting statistics that we've discerned from what took place. Apparently, the Ukrainians managed to shoot down about two-thirds of all the drones and missiles that were fired here at this country. Most of the, if you will, slower moving cruise missiles, especially were taken down by some of these surface to air missile systems. However, there's two types of missiles that the Ukrainians seem to be having problems with. One's a ballistic missile called the Iskander, that's a medium range missile that's often used here on the Ukrainian capital by the Russians. The other one's called the X-22, which is known as the aircraft carrier killer, which is designed to destroy aircraft carriers The Russians apparently shooting that also at urban areas, and you can imagine the damage that that causes when it hits the ground, Bianca.",

He brings something different to the royal family, a much more casual approach than his father and his grandmother often of course, ditching a tie and he just got that more casual approach.But then there's the other side of the job and we're seeing him having to be much more supportive now to his father, given he won't be doing public facing engagements. And this is an example of that other side of the job, much more formal. I think we've got the pictures of him at the investiture today. You'll see him wearing the gold braids, which are known as Aiguillettes, which is part of the camp -- age of camp role to the king. So we're seeing this different side to him, and this is going to be his future. So we're seeing him step up much more, I think, into the role that will definitely be his. And also a test of character, because you've got to remember that at the same time, he's got a wife at home who is recovering from abdominal surgery. He's just had a few weeks off to try and support her and his family, and he's just been told that his father has been diagnosed with cancer. And on top of all that, he's actually got more work, not less, and much more, I think, of a limelight around him.
