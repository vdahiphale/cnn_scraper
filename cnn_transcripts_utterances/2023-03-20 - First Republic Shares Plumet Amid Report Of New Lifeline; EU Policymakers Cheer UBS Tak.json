The Dow, let's take a look here is soaring more than three -- actually almost 400 points. Those are the markets and these are the main events. First Republic shares plummet on report that rival banks are working on yet another rescue plan for the midsize bank. UBS throws credit Swiss a lifeline over the weekend, as Swiss regulators step in to stem the banking crisis. And President Emmanuel Macron's government survives two no-confidence votes as anger over his planned pension reforms spill onto the streets yet again. Coming to you live from New York, it is Monday, March 20th. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague Richard Quest, and this is of course, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, good evening, everyone. Tonight, as one struggling bank in Europe finds a buyer, another in the US is sinking deeper into crisis. Shares in First Republic closed nearly 50 percent lower. You can actually see that they got a short lived bounce midsession, but I emphasize the word \"short lived.\" Around that time, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Jamie Dimon was leading a new effort to help the midsize bank. Last Thursday, JPMorgan CEO, Jamie Dimon as I mentioned, helped arrange a $30 billion lifeline for First Republic. Eleven major banks contributed to that effort. Rahel Solomon joins us live now. So we saw, as I just mentioned, Rahel, last week this group of banks coming together to help First Republic trying to provide $30 billion. Clearly, it was not enough. First Republic in a desperate situation right now trying to reassure depositors.",

      "sentences": "Zain, I sort of heard some of what you said here, so I'm going to pick up where I think you left off.But yes, Jamie Dimon, the catalyst today and JPMorgan that he may be trying to shore up another rescue effort for First Republic. I want to just show you just sort of some of the action of First Republic stocks since September of 2022. Just take a look at how much of a dramatic fall it has taken. Shares are now less than 20 bucks. I think we can pull up the stock chart for you. But take a look. If you look at September 2022, that stock was closer to 140 bucks. So it has been a dramatic fall for this stock. So Jamie Dimon essentially, according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" at least trying to shore up some more support for First Republic, that's on top of the 11 banks last week, including JP Morgan pulling together their money to provide $30 billion in uninsured deposits, so you can see, it is just hard to even watch here. Shares are off 47 percent today. Interesting to note, Zain, Jamie Dimon, he was leading Bear Stearns in 2008, almost exactly 15 years ago, when JPMorgan stepped in to buy Bear Stearns. So interesting to see him again, sort of take this role. We will ultimately have to see what this ultimately looks like, but he has played this role before, he has been here before. So what could this new rescue effort look like? Well, it could potentially mean First Republic issuing more shares, which on the one hand would allow it to sort of have access to more capital. On the other hand, it would dilute existing shares, which of course investors don't like perhaps part of the reason why we've seen the reaction we've seen. All that to say, Zain that ultimately, if all of this becomes a movie, Jamie Dimon will have his role, at least his character at least, will have a pretty big role.",

It was in the middle of a restructure. Many of its problems were of its own making -- scandals, many scandals over the last two years, risks of corporate governance -- sorry, failures of corporate governance, failures of risk management over the years. But would this emergency takeover had happened if it wasn't for the fact that the whole sector came under so much pressure and this was a very weak link, so this was the link that buckled. We'll never really know. But it came together very quickly over the weekend. As you say, this was very much forced on UBS in some senses by the Swiss government, the Central Bank, and regulators and it was sweetened, this deal, in terms of lots of government support behind it. It is important to remember that Credit Suisse, while it had issues over the last few years, was undergoing a restructure and this was a bank that met all the liquidity and capital requirements that regulators want, which are very strict in Europe, but it was at risk of an uncontrolled collapse. So a forced takeover was the preferable option. Take a look at how it unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEWART (voice over): Emergency steps to settle a panicked financial market.",

It was founded in 1856 to finance the expansion of Switzerland's railway. The last few years have been particularly fraught. Its former CEO, Tidjane Thiam had to resign in 2020 after two spying incidents, amid claims of surveillance carried out to former executives. Thiam said he had no knowledge of those efforts at the time. A year later, it lost billions after the collapse of the hedge fund Archegos. Then in 2022, Credit Suisse recorded its worst loss since the financial crisis in 2008 and was fined $22 million after a Swiss Court found it guilty of failing to stop the laundering of Bulgarian drug money.

And of course, there is also the problem that, you know, prices are rising significantly, and its job is not done.

I mean, words to that effect will perhaps have a calming influence in the markets also, while saying they are still continuing on the inflation issue. Now, they will say, this gives us a month-and-a-half to watch and see what else is happening without signaling to the markets that we have paused and we will do what it takes.

Just because you shore up the banks and provide money doesn't necessarily mean that depositors are automatically going to be reassured. If you end up having a lot of people at the same time pulling their money out of these smaller banks. I mean, you know, that could lead to really mayhem for the banking sector.

Now, you know, the real issues have they assuaged the large uninsured depositors? Now, in many small and medium-sized banks, those depositors also have business links to the bank. They have credit from the bank and they could be stickier than some of the depositors in First Republic or in Silicon Valley Bank, but that is something the Fed will be paying attention to. So if there is a silent deposit run going on and as you said, it may well be the corporate treasurers of small or medium sized corporations treasurer doesn't want their money to be subjected to any kind of risk, even the risk that the Fed will step forward and support those deposits or not. So they might think the better part of that is to withdraw the deposit and put it in JPMorgan or Citi or Bank of America. So I think the Fed will be looking at whether there are silent depositor runs going on or whether they've calmed down, and if they are going on, it would move them more towards zero, but also saying this is not a pause, we are watching. While the system clams down, we will watch, but we're not done with rates as yet. A lot depends on what happens to inflation going forward. So they will sort of talk to both sides.

Now, there is some possibility that the opposition will argue that the decision by the government of Macron to ram this through the National Assembly without a vote in that Assembly was unconstitutional, but it has been done a hundred times in the Fifth Republic, so it is not an unusual act in and of itself. Now on the streets here in Paris, there were spontaneous protests here in the Place Vauban. There were protests about an hour ago, they have since moved on. They are much smaller demonstrations than had been anticipated. Groups of dozens or so of people are in different parts of the city, walking around being followed by police burning the garbage that has built up here, following the extended strikes by the garbage collectors in a lot of the capital city and elsewhere, in response to Emmanuel Macron's plan to raise the pensionable age from 62 to 64. There have been demonstrations elsewhere in the country. And as you rightly say, Zain, I think all eyes now are going to be what happens on Thursday, when a much more organized union protest from the private and public sectors is going to be called across the country effectively, a general strike being announced. There is a large number of different parts of the economy already running on the limited capacity and more than a third, for example of oil refinery workers are out on strike that is causing some degree of problems to the economy. There has been a disruption now for some time since the middle of January in terms of public transport, again, because of strikes, but a big focus now on what will happen on Thursday when they will combine the opponents of Macron's policy, the anger on the streets with the organizational capacity of the unions here in France in the hope of somehow getting the Macron administration to back down. But if they fail, this piece of legislation in all likelihood will go through and it has been a central part of the social and economic reforms that Macron has announced back as far as 2019 -- Zain.",

Obviously, we have the backing of the Volkswagen Group. We have over 200 plants throughout the globe, so we know how to build things. We know how to secure supply chains, we know how to get good cost out of suppliers. And I think the other secret sauce is we can act more nimble. We can act like a startup.

You want to offer a car that is super cool, which we will do, and you want to offer it at a great price. So that's what we're going to do. And yes, I recognize certainly there are some challenges in the EV marketplace, but I think we've got the right combination to do it. I think the other thing that's worth looking at is the EV market in America is about five to six points. It's going to move to 50 percent of the market. So this is a massive transformation.
