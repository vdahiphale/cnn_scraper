Former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich, and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva released from Russian prison back on U.S. soil. They're now in San Antonio undergoing medical evaluations, which are typical after spending months and in some cases years behind bars abroad. And in Germany, prominent Kremlin critic and journalist Vladimir Kara- Murza said his release feels surreal. Kara-Murza recalled the moment the plane left Russia and its conversation with a foreign servicer officer escorting him to freedom. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, RELEASED RUSSIAN PRISONER:  The moment our plane was taking off, he told me, look out the window, it's the last time you're seeing your motherland and I turn to this guy and I laughed once again and I said, look, I didn't know his name. I didn't know his rank. Obviously, they didn't feel the need to inform us of all those things. I told him, look, man, I'm a historian by education. I don't only feel, I don't only believe, I know that I'll be back in my home country and that'll be much quicker than you think. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They paused for a while because it looked like inflation might be reigniting. Now, it looks like inflation is heading back in the right direction going down while the job market may be softening. And so, if you look at, for example, what markets were expecting the Fed to do yesterday, the markets based on what traders were trading, treasuries that were expecting about a 20, 22 percent chance that the Fed would cut rates by a full half of a percentage point in September which is a lot. Usually, it's by a quarter of a percentage point. Today, after today's jobs report, the odds of a big fat rate cut of a half a percentage point went way up to about 70, 75 percent.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And then you are half an hour late. Just so we understand, I have too much respect for you to be late, they couldn't get their equipment work in or something was wrong. For you to start off a question-and-answer period, especially when you're 35 minutes late because you couldn't get your equipment to work in such a hostile manner. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, according to Lemon, the Trump team asked, well, can you not fact check? He's not going to take the stage if you fact check.Trump's team for their part are doubling down on their version of events, saying that they waited close to 40 minutes while audio issues were being fixed. This all in addition to backlash, Trump is already facing from the Harris campaign and Democrats and others for just amazingly claiming his opponent turn black in recent years. CNN fact-checked Trump's NABJ appearance and found that Trump made at least eight false statements about Harris, immigration, January 6, and the economy. When we come back, the Middle East remains on a knife's edge following two high profile assassinations this week. The former prime minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett, joins me to discuss the rising tensions, and what he thinks should come next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Israel is still yet to confirm or deny any involvement in Haniyeh's assassination in the Iranian capital on Wednesday. His death, along with a series of high profile killings in Lebanon and Gaza have led to vows of retaliation from Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah, pushing the region to the brink of a broader conflict. Iran's supreme leader says he considers it Iran's duty to avenge Haniyeh's death. Hezbollah's chief suggested a coordinated attack on Israel could be coming soon. The U.S. says it is ready to move resources to the region to counter that threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Haniyeh, despite what some people say, was a relative moderate in Hamas, certainly compared to Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and eliminating him certainly doesn't help pushing that negotiating process forward -- Jim.",
