Miller, of course, is top - Trump's top immigration advisor who has led calls for more restrictive border policies. Trump has also picked his border czar, naming his former acting director of immigration and customs enforcement, Tom Homan, for the job. And Trump also nominated longstanding ally and New York congresswoman, Elise Stefanik, as his choice for ambassador to the United Nations.Let's take you now live to West Palm Beach to get the latest from Mar- a-Lago with CNN's Alayna Treene.

Elon Musk was on stage with him, and you've seen him really every day at Mar-a-Lago since. He's brought his kids there. They've been going around golfing with Donald Trump and his family. Donald Trump gave them a tour the day after the election. And so, he's having a very big role. He's going to have an outsized role.Now, one key thing I think to note about Elon Musk is as - even though he is very influential, he is not expected to take on a major role in a second Trump turn. However, people close to the former president say that doesn't matter. He can still wield a ton of influence on the outside.

First, to deploy as much money as possible that's available to the government under the President's signature infrastructure, manufacturing and clean energy initiatives. That process has been underway.He also wants to fill the dozens of open judgeships for which he has already put forward nominees. Of course, that will depend on Congress. And then there is also the need to fund the government around this time next month when a short-term government funding plan is set to expire. And we could see the President and the administration try to add on to that bill some of their key legislative priorities to try to upsize funding for some things going forward. So we'll wait to see about that. But the process is going to be clouded by the fact that Democrats are widely frustrated with the outcome of the election and the amount of ground that they've ceded over the last four years. And then there's just the crowded calendar. And when I talked to a senior administration official about how much they can actually do, the person acknowledged that the best way to Trump-proof your legacy is to get your own people elected. And obviously, that didn't happen. And then the President's also going to be stepping out on the world stage. On Thursday, he's going to be leaving for a swing through South America to greet leaders from the Indo-Pacific and the G20, where he's going to try to reaffirm the U.S.'s commitments to its allies and try to fortify some of its national security positions toward its adversaries. But of course, that is all going to come after that critical meeting that Biden will be holding with President-elect Trump here at the White House on Wednesday. Brianna.",

To me, that's the most significant story of the campaign.The left tried to demonize him and tried to focus on his language. And in the end, they said, you know what? There's more for Trump. There's more for us in Trump than there is in Harris. And critically, it was about prices. And it was about immigration. And what people don't understand is the Latino population who's here and voting, they don't like illegal immigration. They think it makes them look bad.

I do believe there are Democrats who could have beaten TrumpThe Democrats have every right to be mad. They spent more than a billion dollars that was wasted and she should have won. I know we have to get out, but Trump was indicted, what, 91 times? He was impeached twice. He's the oldest president ever to be elected - to be elected and he had January 6th, and he still won.

And, of course, the North Korean troops in all of this, of course, something that is of huge interest and of huge concern, not just to the U.S., but to European allies in NATO as well. And essentially, we're speaking of about 11,000 North Korean troops that are literally on the ground there. And the Ukrainians say it is so important because those 11,000 Ukrainian troops, while they may not be on the actual front line, they free up more of those Russian forces that could then go and attack the Ukrainians. And again, trying to push them out of that territory in the Southwest of Russia.For the Ukrainians, trying to hold onto that territory is obviously extremely important because they want to use that territory as a bargaining chip if and when any sort of negotiations with Russia happens so that they could possibly exchange that for territory that the Russians are currently holding in Ukraine. But the Russians are saying they want to take that territory back. They've also said in the past that there are actually no rush to do that. For the Russians, they continue to say that their own offensive in the Northeast of Ukraine to them is really the key thing, right? The area around Pokrovsk where they have been making gains. Nevertheless, the Russians have also said that they do intend to take back that territory, Brianna.",

So basically what they need is a fresh infusion of troops. And what are the North Koreans? A fresh infusion of troops. So there are about - as Fred was mentioning in his report - there are about 10,000 to 11,000 North Koreans that we believe are in Kursk right now. What could happen is that over the next months, they could potentially get as many as a hundred thousand North Koreans into Russia. There's some reporting to that effect. Whether or not that happens that way, that remains to be seen. But that would mean potentially somewhere around 15,000 per month rotating into the Kursk area or other areas like the Donbas region is also possible. And what that means - that fresh infusion, what that means, Boris, is that they have new people who are coming in who are not worn down by the war. That's kind of like what happened in World War I when the American forces entered World War I. They were the fresh troops. They changed the dynamics of the battlefield. And even though the number appears to be small, when you're talking about only a few hundred thousand troops on either side, 10,000, 15,000 can make a huge difference.",

They are used to, of course, the North Korean environment poised to - against South Korea. And so they've gotten some training to deal with the Russian environment and the Ukrainian environment.
