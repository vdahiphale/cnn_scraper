That medal recognizes firefighters, law enforcement officers or emergency service officers who have exhibited exceptional courage regardless of personal safety in the attempt to save or protect human life. Two of the recipients were killed in the line of duty here in New York City. A lot of people remember NYPD Officer Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera being shot and killed responding to a call in an apartment building. They received the awards posthumously. Also receiving an award was Officer Sumit Sulan, who ultimately shot the man who opened fire on the other two officers.So, a solemn ceremony this morning recognizing fallen officers as well as people for their courageous work in the line of duty. President Biden very shortly, by the way, leaves for Japan on an abbreviated trip to meet with world leaders. He cut that -- will be cutting that trip short to come back to Washington to get involved in the debt ceiling negotiations, which are frankly at a new level. We'll have much more on that in a bit. First, though, the news that broke just before we saw this ceremony taking place. Authorities in Philadelphia have now captured a second escaped inmate after an extensive search. 18-year-old Ameen Hurst escaped a Philadelphia prison ten days ago alongside another inmate. They got out through a hole in the prison yard's fence. U.S. Marshals captured the other inmate last week. Now, they have both of them. CNN's Danny Freeman has been covering the story from the beginning and is with us. Danny, the question is, so how did they get him?",

We'll let you get back to work digging on how the second capture happened. Thank you so much. Sara?",

There are just 15 days until June 1st, the date the treasury secretary says the U.S. could default on its debt if no deal is reached. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill for us.

      "sentences": "Yes. Ain't no question about that. And the White House has resisted any negotiations for months, as have Senate Democratic leaders, but that posture changed in the aftermath of the refusal of the speaker of the House to simply raise the national debt limit without any conditions, without any spending cuts. He says there needs to be spending cuts and conditions.They passed a bill in the House to do just that and, ultimately, the White House reversed course and now these direct negotiations are happening in earnest. We expect the House speaker's and top representatives, Garret Graves, to sit down and have negotiations with three top White House officials, including as well as the speaker's staff to see if they can hammer anything out. The goal is to try to find an agreement by the end of this week, draft legislative text, will move it through the House and the Senate by June 1st, which is a significant order, a very tall order to move through all of those hurdles. But that is where the push is right now. But there are some major dividing lines, including one issue involving work requirements for social safety net programs, including for the Medicaid program for the poor. Republicans say there need to be some work requirements for certain Medicaid beneficiaries to get those benefits, but Democrats are pushing back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GARRET GRAVES (R-LA):  What about that is bad? We should all be supporting it. It helps to shore up Social Security and Medicare that helps to put people in charge of their destiny. This is something we should all be supporting. I'll say it again, Senator Biden -- then- Senator Biden voted for this. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  What the Republicans are engaged in is just a cynical game to see if by tying people up on one more requirement and one more hurdle and one more twist and one more turn, that some people will walk away --",

This happened last night here in New York City. That's all the information we have right now.The phrase near-catastrophic car chase is in quotation marks in the statement from Harry and Meghan's spokesperson. Hopefully, the fact that it was near catastrophic does mean, in fact, that this morning they are okay. I will just remind people the history here. Obviously, Harry's mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a high-speed car chase in Paris involving paparazzi many years ago. So, obviously, this has even deeper meaning for Harry and Meghan. We are trying to get much more information on this. Max foster, our Senior Royal Correspondent is working his sources. We will get back to you as soon as we know more. But, again, the headline and, frankly, all we know is on the screen right there, Harry and Meghan involved in a near-catastrophic car chase here in New York City last night.
