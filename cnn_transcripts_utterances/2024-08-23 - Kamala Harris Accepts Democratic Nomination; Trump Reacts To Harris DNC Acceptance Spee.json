You know I kept thinking of the Nikki Haley line from February where she said, the first party that ditches their 80-year-old nominee is going to have a leg up. If her core argument is that we can turn the page on what we have been living through in the Trump era, this kind of valley of conflict and polarization, she embodied her message in a powerful way. Now, I think the one blind spot was she did not give people enough sense of how she's going to help them make ends meet she kind of went she talked more about Ukraine than about inflation, I think.

It may divide the Republican Party, but there are many Republicans in the suburbs women in particular, who care about these issues are her conversation, her discussions about the military and strength, American strength, NATO, partnerships that transcends political parties in America. It splits the Republican Party. I'll also say, if you look out on that audience last night, you would see a sea of women in white jackets, suffragette white.

Peggy Noonan wrote about the speech -- of course, a Reagan speechwriter and \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist. She said: Kamala Harris speech was fine delivered with assurance, stuck to resume values, life experiences rather than a sharing of her thinking. I'm not sure it advanced her position with those who aren't already with her. She says there's a small but persistent cloud that follows her, distilled down to the idea that she was swiftly and mysteriously elevated to a position.

And I do think that you're -- the vice president is the most famous, unpopular -- famous, unknown person in the country. She got to reintroduce herself to the country.
