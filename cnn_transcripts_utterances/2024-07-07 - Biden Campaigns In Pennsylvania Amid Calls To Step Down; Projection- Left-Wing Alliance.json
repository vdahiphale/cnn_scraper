Of course, all of this is to try to put questions about the president's candidacy to rest, but that hasn't really done it completely yet. Many Democrats are still sort of skeptical here. One House Democratic lawmaker I spoke with said, yes, the interview that we saw Friday night was better than the debate, but there are concerns about him regressing and in an interesting exchange, Senator Chris Murphy also said that not all questions are yet answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Voters do you have questions and personally, I love Joe Biden. I don't know that the interview on Friday night did enough to answer those questions.

Look, I mean, it is interesting what we have seen, like you said, is the president out on the trail saying he is going to stay in the race, but what we haven't seen is a groundswell of senior Democrats, including Democratic senators coming out and saying that they support the president, that he should stay in the race.

Look, the Senate is a place where Biden was for decades. This was his base of support when he clinched the nomination in 2020, one of his main selling points was that he had these relationships on Capitol Hill, that he could navigate and use to be an effective president and this next week, the next two weeks, if he were to lose his base of support in the Senate with Democrats, I mean, I just don't see many options going forward for the president.",

Those are the folks on the far-right part of the political spectrum and they were expecting and hoping for a much better result than what they had this evening.They have now fallen in the third place in the Parliament in the number of seats that they have in the Parliament. I'm here at the prime minister's office and we are expecting him to come out any moment now because he is going to say something about what's going to happen next. And we heard a little bit of that from the former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe who said the truth is that none of the political box and the assembly has a majority on its own. The dissolution of the assembly, which was intended as a clarification, has ended up with vagueness. The central political force therefore have a responsibility to stay which means I think that the prime minister is going to stay, the prime minister and see what happens after that because it will now depend on the Parliament to either vote and approve his action, his staying here or to bring a motion of no confidence in the Parliament, which would promote someone else for the seat of prime minister. It is going to be a very complicated time coming up. My guess is, Fred that they will probably come up with some kind of a fudge. Emmanuel Macron said, the will of the people will be respected. That was the one statement he said tonight after the vote, but they will keep things in place that leads to the Olympics because this is the next major event that is taking place here.

Well, yes, here in Port Lavaca, along the Texas coast, we are staring down what promises to be the first hurricane strike in the US of what promises to be very busy Atlantic 2024 hurricane season.Now Beryl, Tropical Storm Beryl, still a tropical storm, not quite a hurricane just yet, but its track record is a dubious one. Think about what it has done. Over the past 10 days, it has been a named storm. It has impacted multiple countries. It has made two landfalls, about to make a third landfall here on the Central Texas coast and it has also proven to be very deadly. So this is a storm that we do not want to take lightly. The positives, the storm is running out of time to strengthen. That is the good news. It is also going to be low tide at the time of landfall. So that could help minimize somewhat the storm surge component. But let's talk about the potential impacts and get right to the graphics because we are seeing some ominous signs. Look at the radar and satellite overlaid on each other and I thought that was interesting because we've seen a closed eye, meaning that it has given the opportunity for the storm to take advantage of the warm tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico, by the way, are running about three degrees Fahrenheit above average here in our new normal climates. And look at this. This is explicit language from the National Hurricane Center, even though you don't see a Category Two on this projected path, the timeframe between the Category Ones that you see at 7:00 PM on Sunday and 7:00 AM on Monday, they talk about the potential of the storm ramping up so quickly, it could reach Category Two status. So you need to prepare for that as you make your final preparations here going forward in to the coming hours before the sun sets this evening. So get to the next graphic, you can see just how far this wind impact will be. It is going to be west and south of I-45 and Interstate 10. That will be our greatest threats. We are talking west of Houston all the way to the coastline, and that is where we could feel the brunt of those winds in excess of 74 miles per hour. Of course, that will take down power lines, trees, and of course brings some minor structural damage as well. The storm surge component, four to six feet maximum that is above normally dry land. The positive here though, is that we are working across a low tide when this makes landfall overnight sometime between three and five PM. Now, this is what people have to say here on the ground as their final preparations are underway. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TERRY BRADER, OWNER, TERRY'S SEAWORTHY MARINE SUPPLY: Whether this turns out to be nothing or something catastrophic, we don't leave any rock unturned in preparation, that's for sure.

They are trying to prepare for a world where Trump could return to the presidency. And for allies, when I talk to them, the they officials, they always say the same thing.

So I think what everyone is trying to do is to manage these big shifts in politics in a way that allows them to operate no matter who becomes president. And so you'll see a left government in the UK look more to the Trump people and try to appeal to where they have some common ground and we don't know what is going to shake out in France yet, but we know that they are going to have to deal with whoever wins in Washington, too.

The president trying to have more unscripted moments with supporters. This is one of those, and after this morning, delivering a speech at a church of a predominantly Black congregation in Philadelphia.And of course later on in the week, the president heads to Michigan. All right, meantime, CNN has now gained access to Rafah, a city in Southern Gaza ravaged by two months of relentless Israeli military operations. This marks the first time the media has been permitted to enter the city, and it is important to note, CNN reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces escort at all times, but CNN retained editorial control over the final report and did not submit any footage to the IDF for review. Here now is CNN's Jeremy Diamond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Thick clouds of sand shroud the road to Rafah, but as the dust settles, the destruction is unmistakable. Flattened homes and bombed out buildings, Gaza's last refuge devastated by the Israeli military assault on this city. DIAMOND (on camera): We are now entering the third month of Israeli military operations in Rafah and you can see all around me the kind of destruction that these last two-plus months of military operations have wrought inside of the city of Rafah -- all around destruction, very similar to the kind that I have seen in Central Gaza, as well as in the northern part of the Strip. DIAMOND (voice over): This is the first time CNN has gotten access to this devastated city. Israel and Egypt have barred journalists from Gaza except under tightly controlled military embeds like this. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL'S CHIEF MILITARY SPOKESPERSON: We are working in this area very, very precise, very, very accurate unfortunately the destruction is one to blame, Hamas. DIAMOND (voice over): The Israeli military says it has killed over 900 Hamas fighters here and believes it is close to defeating the group's Rafah Brigade. The fighting is clearly not over yet, nor is the effort to uncover Hamas' vast network of tunnels in Rafah.",

DIAMOND (on camera): Right behind me here is the Egypt-Gaza border. We are now driving along what is known as the Philadelphi Corridor, a strategic corridor that the Israeli military seized two months ago. They say they did so because they believe Hamas was smuggling weapons across from each Egypt and then from this area deeper into Gaza. DIAMOND (voice over): Israeli forces say they have uncovered dozens of tunnel shafts here, but cannot definitively say if any of the tunnel stretching into Egypt were operational.",

One hundred twenty counties are now under the state's disaster declaration. People are being urged to voluntarily leave some coastal communities while heavy rains and wind could impact inland areas of the state as well.We are joined now by Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who is the acting governor during Beryl, while Governor Greg Abbott is on an economic tour in Asia. Good to see you, Lieutenant Governor. So during your press conference, you expressed concern that more people have not left the Texas coast yet, even after evacuation orders were issued yesterday and today, specifically calling on visitors who may be vacationing along the Gulf Coast. What are your concerns right now? How are you going to get the message out? LT. GOV. DAN PATRICK (R-TX): Well, thank you for helping getting the message out. This is a storm that will strengthen over the next 12 to 15 hours as it comes close and finally makes landfall early tomorrow morning, somewhere between Corpus Christi and Galveston, somewhere in that area and that will probably shift. There are people on the coast, as you mentioned that I am very concerned about because it is a holiday weekend and it is summertime on top of that. So a lot of people, when they are away at the beach, they're out of their normal routine. They're not watching the news and the weather or they're not on their internet, and so we want to get the message out to all the people who are vacationing along the coast or wrapping up your trip, your four-day weekend to get on the road today and get home because we don't want you on the road tomorrow. You will not be able to get on the road tomorrow. Wherever the storm hits and it could grow to a Category Two, by the way. In the last few hours there will be significant rain, six to ten inches. There will be significant wind, 80 to 90 miles an hour, you're not going to be able to drive tomorrow. So wherever you are on the coast and if you have family, friends, either e-mail, text or call them and say, hey, I know you're away. Do you know that Beryl is on its way? As I said today, we've already had nine deaths in the wake of this storm. We don't want a death here in Texas. Flooding is the biggest a threat to Texas. And I want to add that inland, we are going to see places like College Station, Tyler, Texarkana, other small communities around Texas inland get flooding and heavy rain. So this storm will be with us. It is a serious storm and I want to be sure that Texans are paying attention to be safe because our number one issue at the state is to prepare and protect, and save your life.",

      "sentences": "No, it is ahead. It often is post, obviously working with the federal government, but our FEMA coordinator is in Denton, Texas and they have been working with our management team and will work with them after the storm.There are certain thresholds you have to meet. For example, FEMA does not come in and reimburse you until you have $54 million worth of public damage to public buildings and government structure. So we hope we don't reach $54 million. That means the storm is more serious than we see right now, but it is a serious storm. Cat One and Cat Two is very serious, but whether we get to that threshold of FEMA reimbursing us, we will decide that later. Right now, our focus is on letting people know we are prepared. Your county judges and mayors are prepared, but individually, you need to be prepared. Don't turn your back on. Beryl. This is a serious storm and where it lands, there is going to be significant devastation. Power will be out. Structures could be blown over and destroyed. Trees will be uprooted. Streets will be flooded, and heavy rain. So take this storm very seriously. Again, between Corpus and Galveston Island is where the National Hurricane Center says it will hit. We don't know exactly, but experience will be that overnight, these storms can often move 15, 20, 30, 40 miles. In fact, the Hurricane Center usually says that storms can move 50 to 60 miles from their last track. So everyone needs to be alert.",
