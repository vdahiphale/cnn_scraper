I do know of some people who tried to get out and couldn't and so just went back to their homes to sit and try and wait this out.But a lot of people did leave, abandoned their cars on the road and those cars were just bulldozed out the way by the Los Angeles Fire Department because they needed to get in with their trucks and men and hoses to try to contain this place. Listen, we knew yesterday that this was coming. We knew there were Santa Ana winds, we knew there could be fires. The state had pre- positioned trucks, firefighters, but you never know exactly where it's going to ignite. And also, I certainly was not expecting it to be quite this. I hate to use the word apocalyptic, but that's what it looks like. You know, we've been driving along Sunset Boulevard, the famous Sunset Boulevard, and you just see houses in flames, in the darkness because there's no power. So all you see is black and little splodges of terrible orange of houses just burning, burning, burning. And now we're in Pacific Palisades in the village. There's a huge pall of very dark smoke coming now over us. That's -- I don't know what that's burning, but that's burning some heavy fuel. That is not a good sign.

CNN's Jeff Zeleny has the details from West Palm Beach, Florida.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Less than two weeks before taking office, President elect Donald Trump made clear he has his eye on a full agenda both domestically and internationally. Speaking at Mar-a-Lago, his resort, giving his first full throated news conference of the year, he made clear about the Gaza hostages. He said if they are not released by the time he takes office, all hell will break loose in the Middle East. He also did not rule out pardoning January 6th defendants. He said that he would still evaluate case by case, but made clear that he was sympathetic to the defendants on January 6th over the police. But it was the international law that drew so much attention on Tuesday here in Florida when President-elect Donald Trump for the first time said economic security is the reason that he would like the U.S. to acquire Greenland. DONALD TURMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it, but if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security.

He said it has cost the U.S. billions. And even more than that. He said, also for national security reasons, that should change. Now, it is an open question whether any of this actually can happen, never mind U.S. law. Speaker Mike Johnson in the U.S. House of Representatives said that he has not had any discussions with Donald Trump on this, and it would be a violation of international law. However, that does not mean that this is not going to be more than an obsession for Donald Trump. He's been talking about this repeatedly. But for the first time on Tuesday, also talking about the Gulf of Mexico, the context, of course, he was really aiming some sharp criticism at President Joe Biden for putting a ban on offshore drilling.

Firefighters battling a massive blaze in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which is about 20 miles west of Downtown L.A. It has been growing rapidly, and it's been fueled by gusty winds. Officials estimating that at least 2,900 acres have already burned since the first 9-1-1 call came in to authorities about 12 hours ago now. And they're warning that stronger wind gusts are expected in the coming hours, worsening the situation, making it harder for firefighters. The blaze, also threatening thousands of homes and businesses, abandoned cars lining the roads, with many people deciding to just walk to safety. And L.A. police saying that about 30,000 people have been evacuated. Those images just absolutely ominous, especially when you see some of these people that are rushing to safety with their belongings, with their pets. Here's what one resident described, what she had to do to get away from the dangerous wildfire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The captain of the L.A. County Fire Department calls it the perfect storm for a once-in-a-decade wind event. Our meteorologist, Chad Myers, with the lay of the land. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: And we've already had hurricane force wind gusts in places here in southern California, especially on the mountain tops. But here's what happens in the desert. Unlike everywhere else in America, when the sun goes down, the winds die off. Here because of the cold air that's going to sink down into the desert, that cold air is going to splash onto the dirt, and it's going to spread out. Well, where does it spread out? Well, kind of in all directions. But when it spreads out through the canyons, that's when the winds actually pick up in the dark, which doesn't make any sense for most of you as you're watching this, but it happens here. So red flag warnings still going. Winds were 40 to 60, but they could go from 60 to 80 overnight. So we're going to have to keep watching this. Now by later on this afternoon, somewhere around 4:00 things are going to calm down. But that is a long time from right now for the highest class here of fire weather. The extremely critical warnings here, category three of three here across parts of southern California. The firefighters have a long, long night and probably a fairly long morning before the winds begin to die off. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
