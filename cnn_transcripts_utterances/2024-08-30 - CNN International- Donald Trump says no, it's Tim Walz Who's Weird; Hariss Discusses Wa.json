Just ahead U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz sit down with CNN for an exclusive interview. This Harris's first since her historic nomination for the presidency. Harris reiterates her call for a ceasefire and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas and she says she'll support and sign a bill aimed at securing the U.S. border with Mexico.Well, in measured tones Kamala Harris completed her first major TV interviews, the Democratic Presidential Nominee with relatively little drama, calling for what she described as a new way forward. Sitting alongside her running mate, Tim Walz Harris, fielded numerous questions from CNN's Dana Bash as she spelled out for the American people, how her presidency would differ from another Donald Trump term in the White House.

I will tell you first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward, in a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by hope and by optimism. I think sadly, in the last decade, we have had in the former president, someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation.

The United States supplies, absolutely the support is there for Israel, absolutely, they have a right to defend themselves, implying the weapons that Israel needs to do -- to do that will keep coming.The question is that she raises there, and I think perhaps this is where she aims to differentiate herself, without differentiating herself, but appeal to that base of perhaps younger, more progressive Democrats who otherwise just may not show up to vote. It's how Israel does it. And of course, the question for the Israeli government, should Harris win the election, will be how, and if she decides to apply pressure to try to modify because that's what she's implying, that all those deaths, there has to be a better way. She's framed it as the importance of getting the hostages released. That's concurrent with what President Biden has said. But this will be where to look if she were elected, and for the Israeli government, to ponder how that position, that diplomatic position, what the diplomats, what the Secretary of State would say coming here to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu? What President Harris, if she were elected, would be saying on the phone with Prime Minister Netanyahu, if he was still the Prime Minister, then? About how he is setting about achieving that right to deterrence, that right to protect the Israeli population? But at the moment, we're really passing words here. And again, when you listen to what she had to say, and we're going to hear it right now, what she had to say about a two-state solution, again, sounds very similar to what President Biden has been saying.

And it's -- the reason he could not give a cogent answer, is because Donald Trump has been all over the map even recently. And here's the -- here's the nub of it.At first, he claimed full credit as he deserves, whether you like it or not. He deserves full credit for the overturning of Roe V Wade and the end, effectively, of abortion rights in many, if not most of the states. Then he found out how unpopular it is. In fact, support for abortion rights and reproductive rights increased a good 10 percent if not more. So now it's a question of backpedaling and trying to get the issue off the table. And of course, Harris and the Democrats are not going to allow that to happen. But you saw, I couldn't see the interview. I just listened to it sitting here. My guess is he looked like a pretzel at the end of the interview, because he had to stretch here and stretch there and stretch all around. The other thing that stood out to me from the interview Max is that nobody's told him, I guess what a vice president actually does? A vice president is standby equipment. They do not make the decisions unless they become president for one reason or another. So, Kamala Harris didn't make the decisions in the Biden Administration. Her job as vice president was to support the president. That's what the modern vice president does. Yes, there was an earlier era when vice presidents often disagreed publicly with the president, but that's long gone.

If he indicates that he is not going to support enshrining abortion rights, thereby sticking with the six-week rule, you must have an abortion by six weeks, even though a lot of women don't even know they're pregnant by the end of the six-week period. Then he's going to lose a lot of the moderate support that he may or may not have.

It is, of course, a prime target for the Russians.But this pilot Moonfish, together with another pilot whose name was call sign was juice, they were really more instrumental than I think anybody could ever imagine, actually getting these F-16s to Ukraine. He's one of the pilots who was lobbying for the West to donate F-16 to the Ukrainians, one of the pilots who started learning how to use the F-16 well before the training programs even started. And one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that these Ukrainian pilots who are now flying the F-16, there's only a handful here in the country. The training that they received is really condensed. It's a couple of months of training that normally would take years. And so, the loss of this specific pilot of Moonfish is definitely a big blow for the Ukrainians. At the same time, though, of course, the program of the F-16s is now well in place here -- in here with in Ukraine. And I think one of the interesting things about this incident, which of course, is a huge issue for the Ukrainians, is they're trying to find out what exactly happened? Why this jet went down? They don't believe that it was some sort of enemy hit in the jet. They don't believe it was pilot error. But of course, right now, they say an investigation is ongoing. And this happened on Monday as this large missile barrage was hitting Ukraine, the biggest the Ukrainians say, in the entirety of the war, more than 120 missiles used, more than 100 drones used by the Russians. And of course, the F-16s were up there trying to shoot a lot of those missiles down. That's what these aircraft are being used at, at the moment. And it was in all of that that all of a sudden, the Ukrainians say they lost communication with the F-16. It later turned out that it had crashed and that the pilot was killed. The Ukrainians are saying that they are inviting international help to try and look into this or to try and conduct this investigation, because, of course, they want to know exactly what happened and how something like this can be prevented in the future? These jets Max obviously invaluable for the Ukrainians. They believe that these jets, the F-16s, are the future of the Ukrainian Air Force as their Soviet era, jets become older and older, and of course, get more depleted. But even more so, of course, the pilots who fly these jets absolutely key for the Ukrainians now shooting missiles down, but they also hope in the future, taking the fight to the Russians as well Max.",
