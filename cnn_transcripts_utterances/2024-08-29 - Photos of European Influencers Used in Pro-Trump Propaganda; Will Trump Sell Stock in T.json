It's part of a three- day trip to strengthen ties between the two countries. CNN's Arlette Saenz is traveling with the president in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Arlette, in terms of how the White House is framing things right now, this is a very rare visit from the national security adviser. How do they feel like it's gone so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, Phil, the main goal of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan's trip to China is essentially to keep those lines of communications open with the country that the U.S. views as a key competitor, but is also trying to avoid from really engaging in any type of conflict with.Now, Sullivan has spent three days on the ground there meeting with various leaders, including China's foreign minister, top military officials, and, perhaps most importantly, President Xi Jinping himself. The White House has said that they are working towards scheduling a meeting between Xi and President Joe Biden in the coming weeks. It's not clear when exactly that might happen, but Sullivan today, when he was speaking to reporters, also left open the possibility that Biden and Xi could potentially meet in person in the coming months before Biden leaves office. He said that the two could potentially be attending either the APEC summit or G20 summit in the weeks just after the November election. He wouldn't commit to any type of meeting, but said there's a possibility the two might be there. It comes as President Biden himself is still keen on trying to manage the relations with China at a time when there are various tension points with the country. There is tension over trade policy, the posture towards Taiwan, and also China's moves in the South China Sea, the U.S. especially concerned about some of the aggressive posture that China has taken, specifically with the Philippines, which is a key U.S. ally. Take a listen to Sullivan talking about that matter a bit earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  So, the PRC well understands the longstanding commitment to the United States has under its mutual defense treaty to the Philippines, and the Philippines well understands that we have an ironclad commitment to support them in their lawful exercise of their rights, their maritime rights. At the same time, nobody is looking for a crisis, not the Philippines, not the United States, and we hope not the PRC. But I did raise our concerns about some of the destabilizing actions that have taken place, including the ramming of Coast Guard vessels and unsafe intercepts near Scarborough Shoal.

So it's a really interesting point as you're thinking about a possible transition if Harris were to win from a Biden to a Harris administration. Of course, right now, China is viewing this election, trying to determine who they might be working with down the road. So it's interesting to hear Sullivan say that he talked about Harris' experience in those meetings. He also, to the reporters, was quick to tout Harris' work when it comes to foreign policy and also specifically when it relates to China. She -- he said that Harris is in lockstep with President Biden's approach to the country. These are all things that could potentially come up in that big interview she has tonight with ABC -- or with CNN at a time when people are still trying to ascertain what exactly Harris' foreign policy might be going forward in the next administration were she to win.",

      "sentences": "Yes, let's start with what we know about the crash.Now, we're being told by a Ukrainian defense official that this occurred during the F-16 and its pilot, Oleksiy Mes, by the call sign Moonfish, were repelling one of the largest Russian assaults on Ukraine that we have seen in the past years, frankly, that occurred earlier on this week, over 400 projectiles fired this week at Ukraine, sort of Moscow's retribution for its losses on the border, the F-16 involved, this defense official says, in repelling that attack. And we heard from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said somewhat cryptically that F-16s had been used to try and stem some of the missile attacks earlier this week. The defense official refers to a crash, and so there will be discussion as to exactly whether this was a technical problem caused by a role in combat or the plane shot out of the sky as it flew over Ukraine. But, remember, this is one of six that have arrived in Ukraine already,the pilots perhaps trained at such a compressed rate, maybe even more a valuable resource potentially than the jets themselves, 80 of which have been promised by European allies to Ukraine. The Biden administration had to sign off on this because these planes are U.S.-made. And it could potentially, when they arrive en masse, be a bit of a game changer for Ukraine, who's suffered from a lack of air superiority for the past years. They have limited jets and helicopters, but it's the Russians who have enough jets to bomb Ukrainian positions at will. That's been a huge problem for Ukrainian forces across the front line. The F-16s may have been able to change that, but here we have a piece of news which I think military analysts will say is not entirely surprising, if you put pilots in a compressed training regiment into some of the most complex combat scenarios seen over Europe for decades, and then, of course, rush into the field as well these F-16 jets with a maintenance regime that must be so complex, given the environment they're functioning in. So, a key moment, certainly, for Ukraine, the F-16 in combat defending its skies, but now enduring a loss as well. There will be questions as to what this means, the technical viability going forward, but it is a startling moment. And I think the loss of this pilot known as Moonfish, Oleksiy Mes, felt keenly by many Ukrainians, a very experienced man, chosen for this particular role. And he went to the U.S. to advocate for the F- 16s being delivered, and now meeting his death, it seems, while defending Ukraine -- Phil.",

We have seen it since Monday, 400-plus aerial projectiles, Russia's retaliation really, many are seeing this, for the humiliation they're enduring from Ukraine's surprise incursion into the Kursk region on the border areas, and it seems too potentially in the last 24 hours into the Belgorod region as well, where local Russian officials are asking for evacuations. Zelenskyy clearly, Ukraine's president, throwing everything he can in this moment into the fight, asking the Biden administration and Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, presidential candidates and serving presidents, to approve the use of U.S.-supplied longer-range weapons to hit a specific list of targets inside Russia, as well as already using longer-range Ukrainian drones and missiles to hit oil depots. You're seeing there ammo supplies, even potentially airfields. As far north as the Arctic Circle, there was an alert in aviation last week, so, so much moving here, and I think many analysts are seeing this as Ukraine urgently trying to change the dynamic on the battlefield ahead of a winter where they might find themselves pushed into a negotiating stance, maybe by a change in U.S. president -- Phil.",
