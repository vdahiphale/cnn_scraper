Here you're looking at live pictures of theUkrainian President Zelenskyy meeting with Canadian officials ahead of an address he's expected to give to Canada's parliament. This is the first address and the first time in Canada since Russia invaded his country. Well, Mr. Zelenskyy is looking up to shore up his support for his country in its fight against Russia's brutal and unprovoked war. Let's just listen in for a moment. You just heard that Mr. Zelenskyy been described as an inspiration to so many people. Well, this is all happening as Russia's Defense Ministry says one soldier is missing after a Ukrainian attack on a Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Crimea. And State Media are reporting that debris was scattered for hundreds of meters and a large number of ambulances work or to the scene. Well, the Ukrainian President will address the parliament in Canada in the coming hours. He is of course seeking more aid. And this is Mr. Zelenskyy's first visit to Canada since the Russian invasion. We have our team covering this from all angles. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is on the ground for us in Ukraine, in Dnipro. Paula Newton is live from Canada's capital Ottawa. Good to have you both with us. I want to start with you, Paula, so 19 months into this war. This is President Zelenskyy's first trip to Canada where he will address the parliament. What is he hoping for when he speaks?",

He has addressed parliament before virtually this will be in person, definitely a lot of anticipation for this visit in Canada. And as I said almost a unanimous applause will be there in the House of Commons, as many people in Canada do feel that this is a situation that Canada needs to be involved in and they fully support Ukraine and its endeavors and its military endeavors to try and push back the Russian invasion. You heard Jagmeet Singh there, Lynda, actually one of the opposition members say that, of course, President Zelenskyy and his country were an inspiration to Canadians. He is an opposition leader and again, near unanimous support here in Ukraine. The point is how much money is Canada willing to back up that support with and that is a crucial issue, when Ukraine has come here with President Zelenskyy and not just him, but also his Defence Minister at this hour meeting with Canada's Defence Minister to see what else can be put on the table. President Zelenskyy comes here as well, understanding that there was a very large Ukrainian diaspora here. We're largest in the world anywhere outside of Russia. He knows that they will be a formidable force in trying to convince Canada and not just Canada but other allies to continue to convince democracies around the world to support President Zelenskyy, even though he himself admits this will be a very long and grinding war, Lynda.",

Instead, some skeptical congressional Republicans questioned the future of U.S. support. At the same time Mr. Zelenskyy secured another aid package from the Biden Administration.

The National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the President Biden ultimately decided not to provide that system at this time after conducting an assessment of Ukraine's battlefield needs and also weighing that against the U.S.'s own defense arsenal needs. But to be clear, he said that it's not off the table entirely. And it is certainly possible that that system which Ukraine has been asking for some time now could eventually be provided. We have seen of course, time and again, the United States deny Ukraine's request for step up weaponry, we look at fighter jets, look at tanks, look at various long range artillery systems.
