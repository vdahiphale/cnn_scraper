This is very unusual, like Trump referring to the enemy within or referring to vermin.This is a vocabulary we know very well, but it's a vocabulary we know from history and generally the history of other countries and fascist leaders. And the second thing to recognize here is that the fascist leaders or the totalitarians that we remember, they're not the ones who pulled the trigger themselves. They're the ones who used language like this as they tried to rise to power.",

There is no excuse. There is no way to make that normal or OK. There's no way to change that so that it can be unheard by the people who might react to what Mr. Trump said.

You can always find a way to say something in American English which will sound vaguely plausible. But from the point of view of history, this kind of language is definitely unusual and it's the kind of language that we know is the atmospheric of the sort of person who wants not to win an election, but to take power and to change a regime.

And it is kind of an astonishing thing to absorb, but is there some truth to that and that, if it works, what's the message to take that on?",

This is not some kind of comparison that's been imposed on him from the outside. He is familiar, at least intuitively, with the techniques and the history of fascism. It's not a coincidence that he chose to have his last big rally in Madison Square Garden, where there was a big American Nazi rally in 1939. It's not a coincidence that he's citing word for word things that Hitler and other fascists said in the 1930s. He knows it works. And so the response is, those of you who don't want this sort of thing but are resistant to these comparisons, you should know that this is not a comparison. When Mr. Trump says he wants Hitler's generals, as he did, he's putting himself inside the story. He's saying, I want to be in the position that Hitler was in. I want to have the relationship to my generals that he had. I want to be able to rule the way that Hitler did. Some Americans like that, but not enough to elect Mr. Trump.",

It's up about 550 points. But getting back to the jobs report, about 12,000 jobs were added last month. CNN's Matt Egan is here to explain. Matt, walk us through the factors shaping these numbers and it doesn't look like the stock market is freaking out over that jobs report. What might all that mean?",

Now, let me run you through the numbers, as you mentioned, 12,000 jobs added in October. That was much worse than expected. That's a sharp slowdown from September. It's actually the weakest figure for this metric since December of 2020 during COVID. And yet the unemployment rate didn't budge. It stayed at 4.1 percent, which is historically low. So, on the surface, those numbers are kind of hard to square. But we knew all along that this jobs report was going to be really messy because of two big forces. One, there's the worker strikes at Boeing. The other thing is, there's those back-to-back hurricanes that hit the Southeast. Now, first, on the workers strike, we saw in this report that manufacturing jobs tumbled by more than 40,000 last month alone. And the government said that that drop was -- quote -- \"largely due to strike activity.\" On the weather front, the Labor Department said the hurricanes also caused weaker numbers here. But they said it's kind of hard to quantify just how big of an impact this storm has had. So, at the end of the day, Jim, this does look like more about Mother Nature and worker strikes than any new alarming trends in the economy.",

It fell sharply yesterday. On Wednesday, it lost more than 20 percent of its value, the worst day for this stock since it went public back in March. You can see how it was going straight up and now it's going straight down. Look, Trump Media is probably harder to make sense of than even the jobs report, because these numbers never really made sense. We're talking about a company that brought in just $1.6 million in revenue so far this year, million with an M. I think there's some local pizza shops near where I live that bring in more sales than that. And yet, even after today's drop, this is a company that's still worth more than $6 billion.
