Today, President Biden heading to Camp David where he'll hunker down with close advisers for several days of intense debate prep. That includes mock debates with advisors, pretty standard. While former President Trump is taking a less formal approach, holding \"policy discussions\" with some of his vice presidential contenders and other Republican allies. Joining me now to look at some of the key numbers ahead of the debate is CNN's Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten. All right, where do things stand? HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Gosh, tight, tight, tight, tight. Tighter than my first New York City apartment with all this stuff in there. I think it was like 200 square feet. All right, here we go. Biden versus Trump margin, no clear leader. Look, we had Fox News come out last night. In February, Trump was ahead by two. Look at this, Biden ahead by two. But again, these are both within the margin of error. But I think the trend line here is interesting, right? Trending a little bit towards Joe Biden, we see that in the aggregate as well, right? In February, it was Trump plus two, now we've got a tight race nationally. So, the fact of the matter is, there is a lot on the line heading into next week in a race that's exceedingly exceedingly tight, tight, tight.",

I don't tend to think it's a good idea necessarily.But you know, one of the things that was so surprising given, you know, all the questions about Joe Biden's age and Donald Trump kind of lowering expectations for Joe Biden was how would voters sort of perceive things going into the debate? So, Biden versus Trump, who will win the first debate? All right, in June of 2024, look at where we are, voters do think that Donald Trump's going to win but just by five points. I expected this margin to be significantly wider. And indeed, compare this to where we were heading into the first debate back in September of 2020. Look, Donald Trump, they thought would win the debate but by just by a point. So, yes, maybe a little bit more on the side of Donald Trump expecting to win the debate this time around than four years ago, but not significantly wider. That was a bit of a surprise to me. Of course, remember that the post-debate polls last time around found that Joe Biden won the debate in the minds of the voters by a wide margin. So, it was Joe Biden exceeding expectations. Of course, this time around, we're just going to have to wait and see on that one.",

Yes, tens of millions will watch this live, it'll be replayed. But it's also going to be sliced up, chopped up like never before. And I would argue right now Trump is winning the so called meme war, he is out there pushing out of context, distorted clips about Biden.

They know about all of Trump's temper tantrums. They know about all of his claims, his talk about being a dictator. But Biden is also aware and his aides are aware that many Americans have not heard about all of this, they've not been tuned in. So, for Biden, especially, it's a chance to raise the salience of Trump controversies and scandals and bring those home to Americans. Those are the moments I think Biden is going to want to create, to try to clip. For Trump, you know, it's anyone's guess, right? He's claiming he's not going to be prepping the way Biden is. So, it's anyone's guess. But I've been interviewing some former debate moderators for Vanity Fair. They say they want to always focus on policy. That was the goal in the past, policy questions, substance questions. I think the danger or the fear with this debate is that Donald Trump's going to try to make it much more about personality and personal issues. Just to boil it down, how cruel is Trump going to be, right? How cruel will he be to Biden? Those mo -- those actually those moments might really become viral in ways that could be positive or negative, and no one knows for sure.",

I also think Trump's going to talk extreme -- you know, extremely about affordability, right? About those basic price issues. I'm just happy this debate is still going on. We're going to -- we're a week out. Neither candidate has threatened to back out. You know, remember how much speculation there was back in May about whether this would actually happen? And here we are with the details now being finalized. Other networks coming out and announcing they're going to simulcast the debate.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. So, of course, Judge Cannon's handling of the documents case has been highly controversial. She had earlier intervened in the investigation that led to the indictment in a way that shocked experts across legal lines, and was later reduced for that and reversed by a conservative appeals court that included two other Trump appointees.So, that was the backdrop of what happened last summer when the random wheel assignment system in the Southern District of Florida popped out her name as the judge who would handle the case itself after a grand jury indicted the former president. And it turns out that we didn't know until now is that two senior judges, that is to say, more experienced judges, not the term of art senior which means semi-retired. Two more experienced judges in the -- in the Southern District of Florida, including its chief judge Cecilia Altonaga, who is also a Republican appointee, separately went to her or called her up and urged her to step aside, essentially to recuse and let some other judge take over the case through the -- through the assignment system again. And both times she turned them down. The first argument put to her was she was just too far away from Miami. She's way up in Fort Pierce. That's a two hour drive away. Her little courthouse up there didn't have a facility that can hold classified documents. There is one in Miami, that's where the grand jury was. So, some judge who sits past chambers much closer to that courthouse in Miami should take it, so very face saving neutral reason for her to decline it. And she the -- we don't know the name of the first judge who went to her, but she rejected that rationale. And then, the Chief Judge Altonaga went to her, called her and said offered a very more pointed, let's say, rationale for her to step aside, which was what had happened during the investigation when she had intervened to help Trump and then was rebuked for it by conservative Republican appointees on the appeals court. That, because of that, just the optics of her handling this case were suboptimal. And it would just be better if someone else handled it. Again, what we're told is Judge Cannon insisted that she wanted to keep the case. And of course, since then, she's had a very testy relationship with prosecutors. It's moved extremely slowly. She has essentially ensured that President Trump -- former President Trump is going to succeed in his strategy of trying to prevent there from being a trial before the election. And of course, if he wins the election, Justice Department will get rid of the case.",

So, there's not like there's a roadmap here that makes anything about this normal.However, one room over is it is quite normal for novice judges newly appointed to the bench, like Judge Cannon to look to her colleagues or their colleagues, who had many, many more years of experience being judges for advice and mentorship about how to do the job. And you know, that is -- there's a sort of informal culture in federal courts, probably state courts to -- of mentoring and helping young judges sort of get their feet under them.

About 46 of them were told, are expected to appear before the judge here for the first time.Remember, it was back in April, around April 30th when the large presence of officers, some couple of hundred officers have moved in onto the Columbia campus after dozens of students and some outside people got on campus, and then took over one of the buildings on the campus Hamilton Hall. And so, the police that night moved in with such force, they went through windows, they searched through that entire area, and they arrested over a hundred people in total on the campus that night. Now, 46 of them are in court today to see what happens to their case. Many of them are expecting their cases to be dismissed because of just the low level nature of the charges, the trespassing charges. So, we'll see what the D.A. here does. It's ultimately up to the district attorney's office and the judge on what the outcome will be.

If you look at the global heat, I know we have a heatwave going here in the U.S. There's a heatwave in Europe. There's another one in Asia and all the way across the globe. This is not just the, oh, you're cold, we're hot. Yes, OK, we'll get over it. This summer so far, that's already been what, not even four hours yet. Before we get to summer, it has been hot just about everywhere. For us, on the East Coast, it has been the heat dome, the bubble, the heat, just staying here at the surface, things not cooling off at night. 83 percent of the U.S. will see temperatures above 90 degrees. Look at this, in Manchester, New Hampshire. I mean, we're not talking like Tucson, 98 degrees yesterday, an all-time high there and even here for Caribou, 96. The heat index was 103. In Maine, temperatures feeling like 103. I think that's pretty outrageous. So, you -- for you Nova Scotia, we have not lost track of you and even Ontario, Quebec and on up, even this is going to be a heatwave all the way up toward Newfoundland. So, yes, this continues to be hot all across the eastern half of the U.S. for today, tomorrow and even in to Saturday. And for D.C., Saturday is 97, Sunday 99 and it's going to feel more like 107.
