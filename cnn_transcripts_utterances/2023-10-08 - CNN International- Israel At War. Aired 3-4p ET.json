Security Council is holding an emergency meeting as intense fighting rages between Israel and Hamas. You're looking at live pictures there from the U.N. Now, these are closed door meetings taking place in New York and it comes after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack, Saturday, into Israeli territory killing hundreds of people. That meeting taking place at the U.N. We are monitoring that U.N. meeting as soon as there's any developments, anyone speaks on this, of course, we will break bring in the news as it breaks. So do stay right here for that. In the meantime, a major announcement coming from Israel, just a short time ago, a declaration of war against Hamas. And right now we can confirm this is propaganda video from the Palestinian militant group. Let me show you this. It shows paraglide, as you can see there, and a barrage of rockets launched from the field in Gaza. This was early, we're being told, in the attack. Hamas says its fighters are still in several Israeli cities, as you can see there on your map. Officials and others are trying to estimate the death toll. A government minister tells CNN he expects the number of people killed in Israel to considerably surpass 600. In response to the attack, Israeli airstrikes have been pounding Gaza. And you're looking right now on your screens footage of nighttime explosions. Palestinian health officials say at least 413 people have been killed by the Israeli bombardments. The shock terror attack by Hamas has led to the deadliest day in decades for Israel. And I want to bring in as we look at these pictures to CNN's Hadas Gold who's live for us in Jerusalem. So, Hadas, the death toll, as we just stated there, rising almost hourly. Just bring us up to date on the very latest and what the Netanyahu government has being saying.",

That has been his sort of modus operandi while he has been Prime Minister. That is what he is known for.And that's why I don't -- that's why I think this is such a test for him, because he is up against the wall here. There is going to be a question almost not -- not if but when a ground incursion will take place for him. And this is also this is a huge moment for him. Up until two days ago, we were discussing how Benjamin Netanyahu will likely be known potentially for maybe even bringing peace with Saudi Arabia, normalization that his note in the history books will be about normalization with the Arab countries. I think now, he will potentially be better known as the golden year who, of course, was Prime Minister during that Yom Kippur War, versus potentially whatever achievements there might be a normalization with Arab countries.",

Take a look at how that has begun. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): These are the first moments to what Prime Minister Netanyahu warned will be a long and difficult war. Airstrikes in the densely populated Gaza Strip that the Palestinian Health Ministry says left hundreds dead and thousands more wounded.

We're moving around a bit heavy so we're actually now back again, just outside Sderot where I interviewed the Israeli Defense Force spokesman there.This is a medical facility, a field medical facility, literally, dozens of ambulances were here in the last couple of hours. They've been here, over 24 hours. They've been treating the casualties. They've been going out to sort of the areas where people have been injured, have been killed, and trying to rescue and save them. Bringing them back here, sending them out by helicopter, sending them off to other hospitals, just trying to save people's lives. Dozens upon dozens of doctors, and I was speaking to one of those doctors earlier. And the emotion that he was sharing and the experience that he was sharing was so powerful. He's used to, as a medic, going in after terrorist attacks in Israel, and trying to save people's lives and trying to help them nothing he said have prepared him for what he was seeing over the past 24-36 hours. A level of barbarity, he said. A 90-year-old woman shot in the chest. People, young people just stabbed, throats slashed. He said that some people have been killed with rocket propelled grenades, a sort of thing that's use for blowing up a building, not killing people, as well as so many people shot. He is quite clearly affected by what he has witnessed here. But I think that's the whole experience here, everyone, that people that have been caught up in it, the people trying to help them out. And the population in the town of Sderot where we were earlier on today, who most of them seem to have gone the streets were deserted. There were a few people staying in their houses. And they were staying in their houses because they are still afraid to come out. There were troops still on the streets. They're searching for possible Hamas infiltrators. Still, in that town, there was a small gunfight not far from us, at one point, an explosion in another building. So this is an ongoing situation, and it has been. And it certainly seems that for the security forces and for the medics who have been redeployed from here to other areas close to the Gaza Strip. It does seem that this is something that's not going to be wrapped up quickly. Because to find all those infiltrators coming across the border from Gaza, the Hamas infiltrators, it's hard to prove a negative, how do you prove you've got them all. You don't know how many there were, you don't know where they're hiding. So this is going to be quite a long job. I think that's what we're witnessing here tonight, Isa.",

And any number they give out, if it was too big, would be used by Hamas. It's not clear if Islamic Jihad telling the truth that they actually know how many people have us have, is Hamas telling Islamic Jihad, these are competing organizations. And they might be together in fighting and hating Israel, but they're competing organizations. So even that messaging, I think, really needs to be tested.What the Defense spokesman, Major Spielman, told me, he didn't want to comment on the numbers. And what we continue to hear is dozens. That's the number that the Israeli Defense Forces are giving, dozens. And again, we cannot stress too much how uncharted this territory is, that this has never happened before, but also how much of a huge propaganda tool it is going to be for Hamas going forward. The leverage of having hostages for them is huge. And the more they have, the bigger the leverage. So Israel will be very careful about how they deal publicly with that sort of number. SOARES: Yes. Let's talk about that, Nic. I mean, right now, as you clearly stated, the Israeli operation is on kind of defensive mode with Hamas still fighting inside Israel. When it does become, if it does become, an offensive operation, what would that look like? A land incursion into Gaza, difficult but also potentially blooded, as Salma was saying, it's a densely populated area. What would that look like?",

You would see big sand berms being built so that the -- so that Hamas in Gaza couldn't see what the Israelis were preparing behind those berms.But yes, Hamas hideout in the civilian population in Gaza, that is very dense.

Complicating what Israel has promised will be a devastating response to the Hamas attacks. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says that the death toll there is at least 370. And as Israel has masked forces and continued airstrikes ahead of a likely ground assault, Hamas has called for regional conflagration. In the Lebanon, Hezbollah launched a token attack on Israeli forces who responded in kind.

How do you see this developing here? STEVEN COOK, SENIOR FELLOW COU.N.CIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Well, it seems pretty clear that the Israelis are gearing up for a very, very significant military operation. That will include the introduction of significant number of ground forces into the Gaza Strip, given the number of Israeli casualties killed and wounded, and the damage done to Israel's deterrent. It seems incomprehensible that the Israelis would pursue their military operations along the same lines that they have over the course of the last decade, relying predominantly on air power and artillery. As the Israeli government itself has said, there is -- everything has changed now. And I think we can expect a long campaign that may in fact result in Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip.",

Hamas says it has more than a dozen. I mean, talk to the challenge of this because at least trying to limit the civilian casualties here was also bearing in mind, the hostages.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And this does pose a very significant dilemma for the Israelis on the ground. But it strikes me that even with hostages in the commitment to rescue all those who have been taken by either Islamic Jihad or Hamas, the Israeli public writ large is not going to countenance anything other than an invasion of the Gaza Strip in order to destroy Hamas, which is the strategic objective here.",
