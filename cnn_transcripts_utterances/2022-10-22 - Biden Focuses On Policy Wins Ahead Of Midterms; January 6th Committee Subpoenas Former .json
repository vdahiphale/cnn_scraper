Second, Donald Trump and his team, they can try to negotiate with the committee.

You've got to make me do it. If that happens, the committee then will have a decision to make. Do they go to court and try to get an order from a judge? Probably not because that's going to take way more time than the committee has.

If you just look at the Black Letter Law, what's in the statute books, there are some laws where prosecutors have to prove documents are government documents.There are other laws that you have to prove that they're classified. But just how sensitive isn't technically a consideration. But I can assure you that's something prosecutors will be looking at. It will make them more likely to charge really just as a matter of prosecutorial discretion. Prosecutors can and do and should exercise discretion.

HONIGDebate Clause is part of the Constitution that says sitting members of Congress cannot be forced to answer questions outside of Congress but about their legislative duties. And so Lindsey Graham argued well, I'm immune from a subpoena. Well, the Court of Appeals disagreed and the District Court disagreed. They said you do have to answer questions about topics other than your legislative activities. And by the way, Senator Graham, according to the Court of Appeals, your coordination with the Trump campaign, your efforts to reach out to state legislators, your public statements, none of that is legislative, quote-unquote, so you do have to testify about that.

I don't think Steve Bannon, personally, I don't think he will win on appeal. But this is a sensible ruling by the judge because the last thing you want is for someone in that position to go in, serve their entire sentence, four months, and then six months, 12 months from now, however long the appeal process takes, the appeals court to come back and say the conviction was no good. Then you had somebody serve time that they never should have been served in the first place. So I think the judge found a reasonable middle ground here by saying you have your appeal.

And the very fact that they are there, that they are physically on the ground in Crimea, possibly in other areas, that really means that they are directly involved. So, what this might do is it might also allow for NATO forces to set foot in Ukraine as well, in a kind of a tit-for-tat response if the West was willing to go down far.

And I think he understands that Putin does not want to be backed into a corner and does not want to find himself on the losing side of things. In that sense, from a character assessment standpoint, what the former president says might be correct. I think it is less likely Putin that will go with nuclear weapons right now. He will probably go with more sabotage-type operations. But nonetheless, we must consider it a possibility.",
