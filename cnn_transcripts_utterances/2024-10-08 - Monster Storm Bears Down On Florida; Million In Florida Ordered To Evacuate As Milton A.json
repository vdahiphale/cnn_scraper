The plywood is up here in downtown Fort Myers and the folks are getting ready for the forecasted six-to-10-foot storm surge. They've got the sandbags out.And just to give you some perspective on some previous hurricanes, a Hurricane Ian really destroyed a good part of Fort Myers and Lee County. And the folks tell us that at that time, about two years ago, the flood waters reached about here, with the expected storm surge to be that we're expecting, rather, it's going to be well above this water line. So, we're talking about a real concern when it comes to flooding. Mandatory evacuation orders are already in place for Fort Myers Beach as well as Sanibel, and we're told that the town of Fort Myers is going to put into effect a curfew at 10 o'clock tonight. The concern with this storm surge is the Caloosahatchee River, which is just on the other side of where we are behind that building. That River connects out into the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Okeechobee in Central Florida. So, the concern is that when we get all of this rainfall, between six inches to a foot of it, you get high tide, and then you get the storm surge pushing in. That river is going to overflow. It is going to crest, and all of that water is going to push into where we are, which is the concern that folks are having. And so right now, everyone is getting ready. The waiting game begins, and the hope is that the storm continues its track north of here, and that the impact that we're going to see in Fort Myers won't be as great as what we saw during Hurricane Ian.

I note that Hurricane Ian, its initial track had it in the Tampa Bay area, and that storm ended up making a last-minute change to the south.And so, this area was almost caught off guard two years ago by a pretty powerful storm. And so, folks really are not taking any chances. We've encountered a few folks who said, look, we've evacuated from Fort Myers Beach. We just finished rebuilding our home there, but we're not going to ride out that storm. And in fact, we've also seen a few Fort Myers' police officers drive around in their squad cars. They're playing out a message on their loudspeakers telling folks out here, look, this is a mandatory evacuation. You need to get out of here. You cannot stay here because of the flooding concern. Again, Hurricane Ian two years ago, was a direct hit, and the flood levels again were about four to five feet. This, if the projected path stays to the north, we're still looking at a storm surge anywhere between six to 10 feet.

And so, what the most important thing right now is making sure that everybody is taking the actions that they need to take to prepare.As you mentioned, there's going to be rain in portions of the state that many people may not think are that close to the hurricane. They need to make sure everyone's doing what they can to get their preparations in order to check on their neighbors. The most important thing, though, is to make sure those individuals in those evacuation zones evacuate. It was just discussed, you know, we've had, unfortunately, hurricanes in the past -- in the recent past where we've lost lives. And those were people just like the viewers that are watching now that for whatever reason weren't able to evacuate. So, asking everyone, please, don't take chances, follow the direction of your local officials and evacuate those storm surge areas now. You don't have to go hundreds of miles.

And what that means is that if you can be in a safe structure, inland, outside of the surge zone with the winds that we're expecting, that you're going to be fine in those types of structures.If you're in a mobile home or a manufactured home, of course, you want to leave those types of structures. But if you're in the surge area, and that's 10 to 15 feet of storm surge that you can potentially see. It's not impossible -- difficult, if not impossible to survive that. And so, you need to move out of those surge areas. And the other thing I'd say is, if Florida has a lot of experience with hurricanes, but this particular storm at the track that it's coming in at could flood areas that have not flooded in a very, very long time. So please don't use the previous storms as a sense of where the flooding maybe, it could be in other areas. Listen to your local officials and evacuate now. BASH: When is evacuate -- when is it too late to evacuate? We just saw the live pictures of the highway, which is understandably jam packed. At what point do you say, change your -- to people, if you haven't already evacuated.
