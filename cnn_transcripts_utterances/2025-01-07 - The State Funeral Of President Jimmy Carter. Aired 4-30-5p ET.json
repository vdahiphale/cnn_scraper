You know, this moment for him to leave Georgia and to leave the South. And he talked about later how that shaped, shaped him in life, leaving the family farm and having that that moment and that experience. Same for Rosalynn, who obviously grew up right nearby him. His mom was actually the midwife when she was born, and he was just a baby at the time. But then obviously his time here in Washington and just seeing, you know, those moments that shaped someone who left the office at a relatively young age.

We're going to hear from Senator John Thune, majority leader of the U.S. Senate. We're going to hear from Speaker Mike Johnson.They're going to talk about Jimmy Carter and this somber moment that is going to be very bipartisan, but also in the context of Trump, you know, who -- who obviously, he has said -- he's been talking about the Panama Canal.

Although in recent days, Trump has been gracious, of course, he is going to be attending the funeral, but you -- when you speak in these moments and you are John Thune or you are Mike Johnson, you also have that audience of one. KATE ANDERSEN BROWER, CNN CONTRIBUTORthink, incredibly respectful in these remarks. And they -- I think it's we've been talking a bit about how President Carter issued, you know, a lot of the formalities and the pomp and circumstance. But I think he wanted people to be watching this. He wanted to get this respect that he felt he didn't always get as a one term president. I know Rosalynn said it was the biggest regret of her life that he wasn't reelected. And so I think that these politicians that are speaking today should really go out of their way to -- to try to bring the country together in this moment, in this rare moment where there's so much division. Mike Johnson, you know, I think should do a can easily. I mean, there's so many things to choose from to praise Jimmy Carter about that are not purely political.",

It was not what was done. And then, subsequent to that, only Reagan. Ford chose not to. H.W. Bush chose not to. Carter actually chose the pomp and circumstance here.",

As you mentioned, both Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush decided they did not want this pomp and circumstance.And we can speculate as to why Carter -- President Carter did. But I think there are two reasons. One, as Kate mentioned, as Kai mentioned, I think that though he didn't like things like hail to the chief because it made him think of the imperial presidency, it made him think of Richard Nixon.",

And number two, as we watched the procession, for those of us old enough to remember watching Jimmy Carter's inauguration, it in many ways evoked that inauguration. Had he gone to the -- had he gone to the laying in state in a hearse, it would have been over in minutes. Instead, we watched a slow procession exactly as it was in 1977. Carter, in a sense, is returning to that moment of possibility, in the case of his presidency and in this case, evoking the best part of his presidency.",

There is no big, powerful newspaper person you need to impress anymore. There is no salon you need to go to, to solve it all. You heard the president-elect this morning calling Mar-a-Lago the winter White House and going into its history with Carter selling the building because it had once been held by the U.S. government. So he has he outlasted a lot of those rivals. Tip O'Neill -- there can't be a House speaker like Tip O'Neill anymore. There isn't an Edward Kennedy level senator anymore.

Is this the pallbearers, I believe, or just at least members of the family are walking in and this is the -- as we've discussed with Anita McBride earlier, this is the east side of the Capitol where President Carter wanted to be brought in.

Jimmy Carter, at the age of 100, outlived almost everybody. He outlived his vice president, whose son, Ted Mondale, is going to be reading the eulogy. And he outlived the man he defeated and became good friends with Gerald Ford, whose son, Steven, is going to read the eulogy for Gerald Ford. STUART EIZENSTAT, AUTHOR, \"PRESIDENT CARTER: THE WHITE HOUSE YEARS\": So there's a beautiful story about this. They fought a very bitter presidential campaign. It was decided by a half of 1 percent. And they went to Golda Meir's funeral together on what would have been Air Force One. And for 12 hours sat next to each other, and they really bonded. Now, interestingly, Ford told me that Nixon was on the other side of the aisle and for that whole 12 hours never said a word. But they bonded and they went to each other's libraries, and they committed themselves to give eulogies at each others funeral. And then I got Jim Cannon, who was Ford's domestic advisor, and we created in 1988, a bipartisan commission that they both chair to give advice to whoever wanted in 1988, which was George H.W. Bush. We went once to Atlanta. We went to beaver creek. It was beautiful to see, Jake, the relationship they had.",

The China normalization, the collapse of the Soviet Union was due in part to his soft power of using human rights, but also he was the one that reversed the post-Vietnam defense decline.
