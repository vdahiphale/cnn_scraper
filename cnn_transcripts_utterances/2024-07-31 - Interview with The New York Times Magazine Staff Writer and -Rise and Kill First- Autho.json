      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up. The Middle East on edge.Regional tensions rising after Hamas political leader is killed on Iranian soil. Israel says it doesn't want war but is preparing for all possibilities. This hour, we'll get reaction from Israel, Lebanon and beyond. Including the former head of the IDF Intelligence Directorate. Is escalation avoidable? And where does this leave negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire and the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages? Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York in for Christiane Amanpour. We begin with the tinderbox in the Middle East and the threat of all-out war between Israel and Iran. Here's what we know at this hour. Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an early morning strike Wednesday in the Iranian capital, Tehran. Iran and Hamas claim Haniyeh, who was a key player in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations, was assassinated in Israeli airstrike. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. But we do know that senior Israeli officials vowed to eliminate Hamas in the wake of its October 7th attack. Haniyeh's death came just hours after Israel said that it killed Hezbollah's most senior military official in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, which was breaking news on our show yesterday. Israel blames Hezbollah for an attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, which killed 12 children last Saturday. Right now, an ominous signal from Iran's holy city of Qom, where a red flag symbolizing revenge has been hoisted over Jamkharan Mosque. Senior Iranian diplomats say Tehran will retaliate for the death of Hamas' political chief. And Iran's supreme leader is vowing revenge, saying this, you killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment. We've got a lot to unpack this critical hour. Let's get the very latest from our correspondents. Ivan Watson is in Beirut, but let's start with Nick Paton Walsh in London and the enraged rhetoric coming out of Iran. And, Nick, no surprise, this rhetoric coming out of Iran and what is clearly seen as an embarrassment for them. Israel has been behind previous assassinations inside Iran of Iranians, but to have somebody from a visiting country come in, as the supreme leader said, a guest of that country's to be killed with such precision is quite an embarrassment in terms of Israel's intelligence deep inside that country.",

And we're just now getting word that his body was recovered in the rubble. Give us a sense of the reaction thus far from Beirut and any statements out of Hezbollah itself.",

      "sentences": "Right. I mean, Hezbollah has not confirmed any of this information, but CNN has learnedfrom a Lebanese security source that the body of Fuad Shukr, the target of Israel's strike at around sunset yesterday evening, was in fact recovered from the rubble of this building. Five stories of the building kind of sheared off by the Israeli airstrike. Fuad Shukr, a senior official in Hezbollah, he's been wanted by the U.S. government for years, which has had a $5 million reward for information about him. Because they've labeled him a specially designated global terrorist. And they've accused him of playing a central role way back in the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks here in Beirut that killed more than 200 people. So, this somebody who was wanted by not only the Israeli government, but also the U.S. government. And while it does appear that Israel succeeded in killing this important Hezbollah official, they also killed a number of civilians here in Beirut in this strike. There were funerals today for two siblings, children, a 10 and six years old, who were killed in that airstrike. Hassan Fadlallah. Age -- sorry, Hassan Fadlallah age 10, and Amira Fadlallah, age six and their older brother, Ali (ph), is in a hospital right now. At least two other women also killed in that attack. Hezbollah has issued a statement expressing condolences for the assassination of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, clearly an ally of Hezbollah, which has been carrying out prosecuting a border conflict with Israel over their mutual border basically since the October 7th attacks in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. So, the tension here between Lebanon and Israel has been huge for the better part of nine months. And now, a country very much on edge, worried that it could be brought into a much larger conflict now that these two assassinations have taken place together, so close together in both Beirut and in Tehran.",

But stressing once again that this all a bigger part of what he says is his continued winning path against the fight against Hamas in Gaza. Going on to say that the Israeli public should be prepared for any sort of response as is the IDF as well. But also noting that they are still working and hopeful on finding a ceasefire agreement that would bring the hostages home. Let's bring back Ronen Bergman to unpack all of this. There you heard a victory lap, a typical victory lap from the prime minister sort of taking credit for yesterday and what we saw in that assassination attempt of the senior Hezbollah official, Fuad Shukr, and also avoiding any mention of the killing there of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, but going on to once again highlight what he continues to say is Israel's ongoing victory and the path towards victory in Gaza.

You mentioned the prime minister's return and his increasingly hawkish stance since he's come back from the United States. Some things are clearly were out of his control and that being specifically Hezbollah's attack in Northern Israel there where we saw 12 Jews children killed. Israel has taken credit for that retaliatory strike yesterday. I'm just curious specifically with regards to Ismail Haniyeh and his assassination in Iran, it's notable that this hasn't happened in Qatar. They clearly have known his whereabouts for a long, long time. What do you make of the timing of his assassination? Again, Israel hasn't taken credit for it, but for all intents and purposes, it is believed to be Israel that is behind this assassination. What do you make of the timing and the fact that it took place in Iran, a guest of Iran's, as we should note as well?",

Now, of course, Iran feels not as close to Hamas as they feel with the Shiites from Lebanon, from Hezbollah. But as my colleague at \"The New York Times,\" Farnaz Fassihi's reporting, the Iranians are feeling that this was done not just against Haniyeh, but also to humiliate them. This one of the reasons that they are saying it was not done from ground operation. It was done by a missile, something coming from the outside. And this why, I think, they believe that such a massive blow to their dignity, something that caused such an embarrassment, show their security apparatus in its weakness point should be addressed with force. And this far from being over. However, I do -- I still believe that all the signs -- except for Hamas, but all the signs and abilities (ph) still are keen not to deteriorate for all-out war. It doesn't seem so, I know, but I think that at the end of the day, the fact that they have been fighting for so long and this did not deteriorate is the fact that I maybe just a wishful thinking, but I believe, I hope that they will shape -- they will stay on the same course and this will not be out of control and deteriorate to further escalation.",

I didn't think that the Israelis would then go and assassinate Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas. The fact that they did it in Tehran actually forces the Iranians hand, right? This puts them in the corner and forces them to conduct some kind of a response probably through their proxies. And if we could see this coming from several members of the Axis of Resistance at once, it could be Lebanese Hezbollah, it could be the Houthis in Yemen, it could be the Hashd al-Sha'bi or the Iraqi Shia militia groups. It could be several of them at one time. And I think this really going to be, you know, obviously cold water on any prospects for a ceasefire, any prospects for a hostage deal, at least in the foreseeable future.

That said, I stillthink, you know, by retweeting it, it's interesting to share these things, to get different perspectives. In fact, I concluded reading the article and thought, you know, I'm really at a kind of 180-degree polar opposite position. And I think the point of these attacks was to sideline the negotiations. I think Netanyahu left the United States fully intent on taking, you know, advantage, if you will, of the attack of the Golan Heights to carry out. Look, these actions were well planned in advance. This wasn't something that was just cooked up overnight to go after the leader of a group like Hamas, to know exactly where this individual is going to be and to kill him with limited collateral damage, that's something that's been planned for in advance. These were plans likely taken off the shelf in response to the Golan Heights, or that was used as the kind of, you know, the sticking point to respond to, but I don't think that we're anywhere close to a ceasefire. And again, I think from Netanyahu and some of his far-right allies and the Israeli government, that's exactly the point, is to put those plans on the sideline. That's going to really -- I think it's not going to land well with the hostage families in Israel, obviously, but it will help them (INAUDIBLE).",

On the flip side of this, as you know, say what you will, or people obviously have their views about what the priorities are of the prime minister. This wasn't a decision that he would be able to make unilaterally, I would imagine, the targeting there of Haniyeh. So, you know very well that many members of his government, especially the military leadership there has been in favor of some sort of ceasefire resolution right now, a deal that would bring these hostages home. So, given that, I'm just wondering what you make of the timing that this isn't something that Benjamin Netanyahu could have ordered on, on his own.

So, the U.S. likely caught off guard. It's not the first time, and it won't be the last. This kind of part of the tensions within the U.S.-Israeli relationship. And now, we have to see, you know, what happens going forward, especially in an election year. This, you know, a pretty precarious situation.

And of course, what happened, you know, this past weekend with Majdal Shams attack, obviously, that upped the ante, but there was an expectation of some sort of response that was going to be forthcoming. Now, at the same time, it's worth noting that Shukr is a very significant figure within Hezbollah. I mean, he's considered to be -- while this weren't the (INAUDIBLE) of the Israeli army, he's considered to be the right-hand man, but others will tell you within Hezbollah that he was actually an important member of the Jihad Council, which is the supreme decision-making council of Hezbollah. And so, he's quite important in the hierarchy of the organization. Is really considered one of its earlier founders and earlier, let's say, organizers. Now, at the same time, in terms of retaliation, it's worth noting that Hezbollah has had high level commanders being assassinated throughout these last 10 months. I mean, we saw one who was killed from the Redwan Special Forces. We've seen two division commanders actually being killed in the last few months. And in all of those cases, there were indeed retaliations, but they were calibrated in the sense that they had struck, you know, various targets within, let's say, Northern Israel, around Haifa, et cetera. Now, at the same time, the difference here is that yesterday's attack, well, it targeted the Dahiya (ph), which is really Hezbollah's main headquarters in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. And in the past, ayatollah (ph) has always said that the intention here is to create equivalence, so that whatever pain Israel inflicts on Hezbollah and Lebanon, the same would be obviously sent back. And in that context, he has said that if the Dahieh was struck, that he would then order the striking of Tel Aviv or Haifa.

Now, at the same time, of course, we are at the same time seeing now an escalation in this tit for tat exchanges.

He talked about the amount of weapons, the type of weapons, the precision of those weapons, the distance that those weapons can go to. He talked about the possibility of attacks in Tel Aviv and Haifa, on Ben Gurion Airport. So, there is definitely a sense of awareness that very soon there could be major disruptions to daily life here. And everybody, I think, also understands that the entire region really now, Bianna, is on a knife edge. Because when you get to this stage of escalation, all it takes is for one miscalculation, one thing to go wrong before you really see a massive all-out regional conflagration. And obviously, that is something that we have been discussing, you and I even on this show many times over the past nearly 10 months. But in this moment, it really feels closer than ever, particularly with this assassination of Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, which, as you mentioned, the Israelis have not publicly claimed responsibility for. And which really is an open question as to how Iran will respond. They have certainly been very clear that they will do. The timing, still something of a question. And the region bracing itself for what comes next, Bianna.",

As you note, theIsraeli army raised its alert levels Tuesday night in possibility for a military retaliation by Hezbollah, but the home front command itself has refrained from advising any further cautionary steps for its citizens. For more on this now and the implications for Israel, I'm joined by Tamir Hayman, who is a former IDF intelligence chief and now head of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. He joins me now live from Tel Aviv. Thank you so much for joining us, Tamir. And you of all people know the implications involved in the planning and the process of green lighting certain operations, specifically these targeted assassinations. Israel has taken credit for the assassination of the top Hezbollah official yesterday in Beirut. We haven't heard any credit taken for the murder assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, but I'm curious from your perspective, the implications now of what you expect to see in terms of a response from Iran or any of its multiple proxies.",

Haj Mohsen, the one that we have assassinated yesterday, was responsible on what they call the strategic capabilities of Hezbollah. He was the one that directly responsible on the slaughter and the -- of the murder of those 12 children in that sports stadium in Saturday. He is the one that responsible of killing 142 American soldiers. He is a very rough and tough terrorist who very professionally accumulated enormous numbers of ammunitions, heavy rockets, accurate missiles that can really disrupt dramatically the routine of Israel. Israel can defend itself, and it would probably retaliate in a manner that will harm Hezbollah dramatically, and maybe even unintentionally the State of Lebanon, because Hezbollah is embedded in the infrastructure of Lebanon as a state.",

Nearly 400 Hezbollahfighters have been killed, a few dozen IDF soldiers have been killed as well. As it relates to the war in Gaza, what are your views on whether or not this destabilizes any potential for a ceasefire deal, for the hostages to come home? We know early on that Yahya Sinwar had been hoping that Hezbollah would play a bigger role in this fight. Thus far, yes, they have been launching missiles into Israel since October 7th, but they haven't increased into a full on open second front with Israel. Do you think this a calculation now that Sinwar will be making as to whether or not he will be willing to accept the deal to see what, in fact, Hezbollah is willing to do?",
