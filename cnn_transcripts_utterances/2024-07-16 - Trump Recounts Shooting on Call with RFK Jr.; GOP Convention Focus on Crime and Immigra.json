So, Jim, I want to start with you as a son of Wisconsin of sorts and someone who has been watching the Republican Party for so much, so long and seeing this transformation that we've seen really take place in the GOP, in the time of Donald Trump. Watch Mitch McConnell, who is once the embodiment, really was the -- has been the embodiment of the establishment Republican Party. Have been the leader longer than any Senate leader in history. What happened yesterday when he was on the floor of the convention hall? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER:  Madam Chairman, the Commonwealth of Kentucky proudly cast 46 votes for the next president, Donald J Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And those were boos, as you can hear. But also, the fact that, you know, McConnell is someone who had sharply criticized Trump after January 6th, barely could say his name in the months and months ahead. Trump had a whole back and forth with him, attacking his wife, and ultimately McConnell endorsed him. But what do you think this moment means for the GOP, for that wing of the party, with J. D. Vance's ascension as the number two, for people like in the Republican establishment like Mitch McConnell?JIM VANDEHEI, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, AXIOS:  Yes. I mean, Manu, we've been at this for a while together covering it. I don't think we've in our lifetime witness any political figure who's been able to take over an entire party, one that he wasn't part of when he came in in 2016 and reinvent it, literally reinvent the party, changed its entire agenda, changed how it talks, how it approaches politics. Add a rougher edge to it that did not exist in the past. And then, systematically, basically dismantle anything that stood in opposition, whether it was Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell, you look at the state parties, you look at who's elected to the House, you look at the Senate, you now look at J. D. Vance, this is Donald Trump's party, and it's going to now last for a generation. Like, there's no going back to Mitch McConnell. There's no going back to Mitt Romney. There's no going back to Paul Ryan. The future of the party is J. D. Vance, because that's where you see all of the activity at the local level, the state level, in the media ecosystems that are being created, and the money that's being generated, the new parties that are being formed, and that's their orbit. And now J. D. Vance has the chance if they were to win. And if he were to run himself, you could have, you know, Republican rule, Trumpian rule well into the 2030s. Again, that requires them to keep winning. No certainty of that.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And, Tyler, what do you -- how do you see the significance of the J. D. Vance pick? I mean, it's not clear what politically this adds to Donald Trump. You know, Donald Trump has the base already. They are firmly with them. J. D. Vance is, in some ways, very much a base pick. He didn't pick Nikki Haley or a Glenn Youngkin, someone who could potentially appeal to someone who are the suburban voters who are not there as with Donald Trump. But how do you see the, this pick impacting the ticket come November?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I think it shows a level of confidence that Donald Trump has and his ability to win and the feeling that he does not need to expand the base or bring in disaffected Republicans or moderates or independents. J. D. Vance is not the person that would do that. And I think it's also a stark contrast to what we saw when he picked Mike Pence in, you know, 2016, where he wanted to shore up support among evangelicals, a more mainstream Republican in Mike Pence. Donald Trump has dispensed with any notion of that wing of the Republican Party, and as you and Jim just talked about, has fully remade the party in his own image and putting his imprint on the future of the party.So, this pick is one in which he, you know, clearly feels most comfortable and has the best relationship with J. D. Vance, and also a sense of confidence in his ability to win and not need to go outside, you know, the base that he is so animated with someone like a Nikki Haley or a Marco Rubio.",

So much of that is playing out. Really remarkable to see Republicans the way they fall in line behind Trump. Democrats not behind the top of their ticket.

We showed you that video just a short while ago. There are still dozens of unanswered questions this morning.We're going to try to spend some time to get some answers with an expert panel. Juliette Kayyem is former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. Andrew McCabe is a former FBI assistant director. Darrin Porcher is a former NYPD lieutenant. And Kevin Chmielewski has decades worth of experience working with campaigns and helping coordinate with the Secret Service. Let me start with you first, Andrew. You're here in the studio with me.

One, I think to some extent we're used to understanding a motive right away from our many experiences with mass shooters, many of whom relieve some sort of writing behind and they leave it somewhere that it can be found quickly. That's obviously not the case here.This this is going to take longer. They have made some progress with the cell phone and with his computer. I understand that none of those are really giving him a very clear indication of what his motive is, but there's always the possibility that we won't know. Of course, the most famous example of that is Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter. After years of investigation, we have really no clear motive as to why he did that.",

And it maybe that we are in a situation where the motivations are mixed. They're not clear. There's no singular narrative that we can understand or that we will ever understand about him.The second is this security breakdown. Look, there's going to be -- there's no way this was a security success. There are going to be lots of reasons for the security failure. The one I'm really focused on is the decision at some stage, a determination that that building was outside the security zone. Looking at it now, it's just awfully close. Other buildings that were as close were more protected. So, we need to figure out why that designation was made because that then -- what unfolds after that is a series of openings, loopholes, vulnerabilities that are taken advantage of by a -- you know, not a terribly sophisticated attacker.",

It's not uncommon for the Secret Service to deploy local law enforcement for certain areas such as the building, but the security or I should say those police officers should have been on the roof.Now, one of the questions was the roof was slope. Therefore, they felt that there was a level of danger. But we're at a stage whereas we can now use drone technology, and that should have been deployed if they felt that there was a security risk to the safety of the officers if they were on that vaulted roof. But bigger than that, the question remains as to when there was an identification made by people on the ground that there was an individual on this roof, why was there not a radio transmission? You had an officer that deployed and attempted to get to that top of that roof. However, there should have been a radio transmission that would have availed both the Secret Service sharpshooters and the other officers to the propensity for danger because you would have had a much quicker interdiction that way as opposed to the officer climbing to the roof.

The Secret Service has to rethink -- is -- how it deploys in light of that.I want to say a third thing to Andrew's point. You know, look, the Secret Service was created in 1865, out of the Treasury secretary -- Treasury Department. It may be time that it focuses only on one mission. It does a lot of financial investigation, cyber, counterfeit, that may need to go somewhere else and that they should focus on protectee services only.

I'm not going to make this political. But what people don't realize is the Secret Service relies heavily on local police departments all over the country, all over the world. And with the defund the police movement, this doesn't help. I can't tell you how many times I've physically been handed from a chief of police, a mayor, a bill for $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 to pay for the police resources for those events.
