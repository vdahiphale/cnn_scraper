Wolf Blitzer's off today. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in \"The Situation Room.\" Our top story tonight, Donald Trump back on the campaign trail and taking aim at the Democratic Blue Wall amid new questions over his upcoming debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. CNN's Kristen Holmes is traveling with the former president in Detroit. So Kristen, what is all the back and forth over these debate rules about? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Alex, these two campaigns seem to have come to an impasse over whether or not they are going to mute or unmute the mics when the other candidate is talking. So just to go back in time here, when the Donald Trump's campaign agreed to the first debate with President Joe Biden on CNN, the rule was both sides agreed to mute the mics while the other person was talking. Now, the Harris campaign in this debate on September 10th on ABC says they don't want those mics muted. Donald Trump's campaign is saying well, that's what we agreed to. And they do seem to be at somewhat of a standstill at this time. Now, interesting point here in all of this is that this is all just a little bit of flexing as they try to figure out who is going to do what on stage, what is going to be best for their candidates. And Donald Trump, after all this with his campaign, seemed to kind of undercut what they were saying. Listen to what he said in Virginia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A reminder of just a few weeks ago when Harris's campaign was sent -- essentially, she rose to the top of the ticket and Donald Trump pulled out of the debate. The Harris campaign saying it's the exact same debate. You have to agree to it. You already did. Now Donald Trump's team is saying well that's what we agreed to was that those rules and the Harris campaign is saying well it's different now because I'm at the top of the ticket.So a little bit of a flip flop on both sides, again, as they're trying to figure out what is best for their candidate. Now the other part of Donald Trump's strategy as you noted, whether or not he appears on the stage. We know he's going to appear in multiple swing states. Today he's in Michigan. Later in the week, he's in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, traveling, really pounding the pavement. They say he's going to have a ramped up campaign schedule. He certainly is this week, but we'll see if this continues. It's something they've been saying for quite some time, but it's happening at a time in which Kamala Harris's ascension to the top of the ticket has really struggled -- the campaign has really struggled with that and trying to find footing. We saw him earlier today in Virginia. He was commemorating the three- year anniversary of the Afghanistan withdrawal. That is something that has become a main talking point for Donald Trump against the current administration. He has now linked Kamala Harris to that. It used to be an argument against President Joe Biden. But whether or not this kind of ramped up campaign continues is something we'll be keeping an eye on.",

All right, well, we're going to fix David Chalian's audio.Shermichael Singleton, let me go to you on that same question. What do you make of Donald Trump at that campaign stop today, essentially contradicting his campaign, which had said that they wanted to stick by those earlier rules of each side muted, but now in fact Trump's saying, well, actually maybe we'll have the mics open? SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Well, I mean, I watched that entire clip and there's a longer part where he continues to say, however, we had already agreed to the rules, why are they attempting to change the rules now? And I think that the Trump campaign is probably accurate. I mean, look, the American people deserve the opportunity to hear from both candidates on the issues, whether it's Trump interjecting against Harris or Harris interjecting against Trump. It's really difficult to do that when candidates are jumping in interrupting the other person when they're trying to answer these questions We're talking about the most consequential job of the country. The rules that any one of these individuals will make if given this job will be consequential for years and decades to come. So keep the microphones muted, everyone benefits.

You know, I've -- there are people who've been -- who've managed the debate on debates and very often what you're claiming you want in one negotiation is only the thing you really give up the next part of the negotiations. So we'll see where they actually come down this.Here's the fundamental point though. Donald Trump should not want to debate Kamala Harris on stage. I think he has spent a lot of time, a lot of legal money that he could raise from his donors. He's used a lot of campaign cash to get lawyers to keep him out of court in a bunch of these cases. And what he would do is put himself on a national stage in the middle of, effectively, the biggest courtroom he's ever seen, to be prosecuted by one of the best prosecutors in the country, by Kamala Harris. Now, the Democrats should keep ourselves in a little bit of check here, too, because, you know, Donald Trump is, frankly, right now, had more debate experience recently than Kamala Harris. He's had two, you know, debates since the last time. She had one. She debated Mike Pence four years ago. It's been a long time. So as much as I think she's a very good prosecutor, she's a very good arguer, you know, Donald Trump has some experience with this. And even the best case scenario, it's not like Donald Trump will be left in the corner crying, you know, yelling out loud, I ordered the code red. You know, he's not going to do that. So, Democrats need to have a little bit of -- a little bit of patience here, a little distance about how they think this debate's going to go. But if I'm Trump, there's no way I would want to face her on a national stage.",

We'll see what, if any of that carries forward into this ABC debate. Obviously, there is danger for Donald Trump if he shows up in sort of a hotheaded kind of way. We saw that didn't work well for him against Biden. It will not work well for him against Harris. Now, that's not how he showed up to the CNN debate in June. And so I would imagine he is likely not to show up in that kind of a manner with Harris, but we have seen him rattled over these last five weeks about how to position himself against Harris and how to frame and define Harris for the American people. So he's got to sort of settle on what that is before he gets on the debate stage with her.",

Now, obviously, we're seeing a couple of extra stops this week. We know he traveled every day last week is sort of a counter-programming message to the Democratic National Convention. Some will argue it was successful. Others will say it wasn't so much. This week he still has two down days and then he's back on the road, back in these swing states, Michigan, again, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.I think what's really interesting is actually that event in Wisconsin. They are clearly trying new things here to get him interacting with voters as they try to find their footing, as David said, with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. On Wednesday in Wisconsin, he's not doing a rally and he's also not doing one of these smaller messaging events. He's doing with their billing as a town hall. Essentially, he's going to speak for 15 minutes and then he's going to take questions from the audience, which are supposed voters, something we actually haven't seen him do. Particularly, we haven't seen him do it in a setting without a media organization kind of running the shots there. So we'll see how that goes with him interacting with voters. But again, really going back to what David was saying, it's been in sort of a scramble for his team trying to figure out what comes next, how exactly they're going to run this campaign. We'll see if they do escalate that, but the all hands on deck, we've already seen it. They brought on his 2016 first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. They brought on a GOP consultant, Alex Bruesewitz. They took over Taylor Budowich, who was at the MAGA Inc, the Super PAC, brought him over as a senior advisor. They are bringing over Trump loyalists, people who have been with Trump for the last several years. They are trying to get people to be part of the campaign. They are trying to get all boots on the ground. We'll see what it looks like in terms of travel and actual execution.",

Maybe you're looking at a couple hundred thousand, maybe a million there compared to Twitter. I think there is a recognition when you look at the Harris campaign, they have been very effective in their messaging, their targeting, posting videos, engaging with content creators on Twitter, on Instagram.I've even seen some very interesting posts on Facebook attempting to target older voters. So it absolutely makes sense for the former president to be able to be in those spaces, giving a message directly to potential voters, particularly low propensity voters. If you look at Twitter today, Alex, compared to Twitter maybe six years ago, I would argue that the shift is more to the right if you look at some of the engagement. And so I think that also is potentially a part of the calculation. If you look at some of Trump's engagement on TikTok, he is absolutely engaging with younger men in particular. So the campaign recognizes that this is not going to be the sort of traditional race that you would run on mainstream outlets, although that is going to be a part of the calculus. You also have to target and engage with some of those individuals on social media who are not watching the news 24/7, who are on X and Instagram and other places engaging over other content, who may see a post by Trump and say, oh, wait a minute here, this is interesting.

But what they're doing is they're doing something bigger too. They're arguing that the structure that the Department of Justice uses to investigate highly sensitive, politicized cases, special counsel appointments, that that should be allowed. What Judge Cannon did in Florida was not just dismissed the Trump case, she said this prosecutor, Jack Smith, he shouldn't be able to bring any case like this. And so that question is, what is going to be before the appeals court? Cannon whenever she said that, she also said that she didn't believe that the Justice Department had constitutional authority to allow the attorney general to give someone like Jack Smith a special counsel, any autonomy or authority or even funding. And so the Justice Department is going really hard to say that is just wrong. One of their quotes, if the attorney general lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office. So they're saying what Cannon is doing here is so dangerous. It could cut out the attorney general's ability to have people like deputy solicitors general, deputy attorney -- assistant attorneys general, and then even allow people like the Secretaries of Defense, Labor, State, the Treasury Department, to appoint other people. So they not just want to revive the Trump case here, they want a full throated endorsement of the special counsel's office and the use of those sorts of appointments from the Appeals Court as this moves forward.

The -- the fundamental case that -- that the special counsel argues controls this issue is, of course, U.S. v. Nixon.It's the case that every court who's ever heard this kind of a challenge has used to valid -- to validate the appointment of special counsels. And Judge Cannon dismissed the whole -- the Supreme Court's holding in Nixon as -- as mere dicta, essentially ignored it. And by doing so, kind of refuted this entire judicial hierarchy in the United States, where lower courts are bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court and other higher courts.

If we look at some of the numbers, they are really big.The Ukrainians are saying that the Russians used about 127 missiles and more than 109 drones to attack Ukrainian territory. And among them are some pretty tough missiles. One of them is one that's actually designed to take out whole aircraft carrier strike groups. Now the Ukrainians say they were able to shoot a lot of these missiles down, but some of them obviously did hit their targets as big power outages, Alex, in Ukraine right now. They say there's going to be rolling power outages going on over the next couple of days. The Russians, for their part, actually confirmed that they conducted these strikes and that they were going after energy infrastructure, they say, to stop the Ukrainians from producing weapons that obviously the Ukrainians are using in defense against the -- the Russian assault on Ukraine. At the same time, we still have the Ukrainians inside the Kursk province of Russia, where they apparently are still making gains. At the same time, the Russians are pushing in Pokrovsk in the east of Ukraine, gaining some territory there.

As you know, a large portion of the north of Israel has been evacuated for 10 months now. More than 60,000 Israelis forced to flee south, same true north of the border, more than 80,000 Lebanese forced to flee north because of that fighting. We went to Northern Israel earlier this week because the school year is approaching here, and that evacuation has forced entire schools to move south. We visited one of them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO (voice-over): On kibbutz Dafna, less than two miles from the Lebanese border, students at the Har VaGai School fled just after October 7th, quickly abandoning their lockers. Those mandatory evacuation orders came almost a year ago now, yet the threat remains more present than ever. Last month, a rocket burst through the roof of the school's gym.
