We are standing by for new information about his condition six days after he was brutally attacked, and I'll talk to a key lawmaker who is raising urgent questions tonight about security for members of Congress.Also ahead for your tonight, dueling rallies between President Biden and former President Trump with the midterm campaign and the final five-day stretch as they work to influence key races in this election. Are they also setting the stage for a rematch in 2024? And another first on CNN, the January 6th committee has now interviewed more Secret Service witnesses, including the head of then- Vice President Mike Pence's detail. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Pamela Brown, and you are in THE SITUATION ROOM. And let's go straight to that breaking news. First, to report that Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker of Nancy Pelosi, has been released from a hospital six days after he suffered a fractured skull and other injuries in a politically motivated attack by a man who was targeting the House speaker. CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel is talking to her sources and broke this news. What are you hearing, Jamie?",

I think it's also important to remember what he went through. He was recovering from surgery to repair a skull fracture and also serious injuries to his right arm and hands. We are told that he returned home. We saw activity outside his home earlier today and that he is resting there now, that his wife, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is there, as well as other members of the family. We expect more details on his condition later this evening. But, look, considering the nature of that attack, and that he was hit in the head, knocked unconscious, the extent of his injuries, I think it is very good news that the doctors felt that he was ready to go home. I can tell you, I spoke to people close to the family. He was pushing to go home, Pamela.",

Sanjay, starting with you now, what does it say that Mr. Pelosi has been released just less than a week after this attack and injuries to his skull, hand and arm? Just to remind our viewers, as well as the fracture to his skull, he was unresponsive for at least three minutes, woke up in a pool of blood. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. I mean, what it sounds, and I think Jamie sort of outlined this very well, is that he had a very significant injury, but, you know, they were able to take care of this, address this injury and he was able to recover. I mean, doctors are notoriously going to be conservative about letting someone go home from the hospital until they really feel like that person is ready. And that means really acting independently, able caring for themselves and not a persistent issue with the skull fracture. We know, we have a better sense of what exactly sort of transpired, obviously, the injury that he had, this hammer to the head, injury happening early hours of Friday morning, operation that took several hours, according to Jamie Gangel, through the day, Friday, on his skull. You know, I just want to show as well, I mean, one of the things that happens when they think about a skull structure is what they're -- doctors are really trying to figure out, did it cause bleeding underneath the skull, that it caused bleeding within the brain? And it appears that it did not. Because even before he went to the operating room, doctors were saying that Mr. Pelosi was expected to make a full recovery. So, serious injury but it sounds like they were optimistic about his recovery almost from the beginning despite how serious an injury it was, and now, six days later, he is leaving the hospital.",

So, simply being able to follow that along and make sure there are no persistent problems, he likely may have sutures that will need to be removed. I don't know the nature, how significant these injuries were to his limbs, to his upper arms but those might be followed as well.But my guess is, again, based on what we are hearing in that report that this will all be done sort of on an outpatient sort of level, monitoring for any infection or any worsening problems. But it looks good, Pamela, I mean, based on what we're hearing. And, again, how optimistic the doctors were from the start? That does not to minimize how significant the injury was. It sounds like he may have been knocked out for a few minutes and there was a lot of bleeding from the scalp. You can have a lot of bleeding from the scalp. At 82-year-old, you can drop your blood pressure drop quickly as a result of that. So, all those things were managed but that's what trauma surgeons. And it sounds like they did a good job in a sense that he is leaving the hospital six days later.",

Think they need an enormous provision (ph) of resources and personnel. Those things don't happen quickly. They also need to think about the procedures and the policies and the standards of security that they are able to provide to different members who face different sort of threat (INAUDIBLE), but they clearly have a lot of work to do.

Hi, Congresswoman. So, you just heard Whitney's report there. We have a lot to discuss. But, first, and I want to say, I know you can't get into specifics, but did these interviews with the Secret Service corroborate some of the key details on Mr. Trump's behavior on January 6th, his attempt to go to the Capitol? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Let me say broadly that the committee more than a million documents finally from the Secret Service and it took a lot of pushing and it took a lot of work to go through those documents. And we are trying to see, what we found, and some of the public statements and some of the testimony don't square up. So, we are trying to get to the bottom of this, both to find out what happened, but also to make suggestions as to how we might have a better situation moving forward. And I'll just give you one example. I mean, in the public hearing, it became clear that the president had an intent to go to the Capitol. It was clear that it was known that there were people with arms, with guns, not going through the magnetometers. And then the president told those people with guns to march to the Capitol. But it's not at all clear that anyone told the vice president's detail about this. So, we have got a lot of unwind here both to find out what happened and also to make recommendations for change.",

We do know -- I think it's important to focus on the protection. But if we are diverted from the cause of this, I think we are making a mistake. I mean, the violent rhetoric that is underway and the lack of condemnation of that rhetoric by the leaders of the Republican Party in Washington, I am not talking the regular voters out here, or normal people, but the leadership of that party in Washington has not condemned that rhetoric, and, therefore, they're creating an environment of permission, which is very dangerous.",

But Oz is surging and Oz is actually trying to win over swing voters and has been pretty successful so far, particularly in the aftermath of that catastrophic debate for John Fetterman. And so I think it's the worst thing in the world for Oz to have Trump in the commonwealth right now. He doesn't need him. He needs these swing marginal voters. So, that's a big problem. But it may not make a difference at the end of the day. I think the die has already been cast in this election. It seems like things are moving pretty hard toward the Republicans in many of these places. Democrats are playing defense everywhere, from Rhode Island to Connecticut to Oregon and to Nevada.

He's out there to amplify the message for the Democratic Party and, as has been said earlier, to try and turn out voters.Now, I think that message in Maricopa County, in Arizona, also has some persuasion elements for swing independent voters and some falling away Republican voters. But in the main, this is the time when you try to get your base out. And for Democrats, this is really important because the reason that incumbent parties generally lose in midterm elections is that their base isn't as motivated as the out-of-office party, which tends to come and vote its grievances. And if Republicans seem to be showing movement here, it's because that is happening. I mean, there is an enthusiasm gap at least in the polls between Republicans and Democrats. So, Obama is out there at a time when it is crucial to try and spur Democratic turnout, Democratic enthusiasm, particularly among the base, particularly among the young, and try and get people out to vote.",

And so it is a different dynamic for Democrats that he brings to some of these battleground races.And the question I have though is, is he energizing people who are already energized or is he bringing out people who are thinking about sitting on the sidelines. For Democrats right now, that is the big question mark. There are some key parts of their base, especially young black voters, young black men in particular, young Latino men in particular, who are considering sitting at only or even voting for Republicans. And I think there is a question about whether even Obama will reach those people. They may not be showing up at these events, but I think they can hope that they are hearing the resonance of this message on social media and on television and it's getting to them. I think that is for Democrats, the bigger question. It's not the people in that room, it's the people who are just considering turning the whole thing off.",

And Americans suffering from their own economic pain and certainly Europeans as well.And there is a tiny bit of wobbliness going on in the international community right now. So, I put that straight to the senator, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, he's the Democrat obviously, Portman is the Republicans. And I asked if the Ukrainian government could count on this full-throated U.S. support. This is what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH):  This is not the time to back off. In fact, it's time for us to redouble our efforts because the Ukrainians have shown through their bravery, their courage on the battlefield, that they are making tremendous progress, have tremendous progress in the last two and a half months, it's because of that over desperation that Vladimir Putin is doing what he is doing behind us here tonight. He can't win on the battlefield. So, instead, he's turning to attacks on the civilian population. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  But I think the overwhelming bipartisan majority of members of Congress respect that the Ukrainians have fought fiercely, have fought bravely. Americans have stood for freedom at home and abroad for decades and decades, and I find it hard to believe that we would abandon the Ukrainian people right now as they are facing in some ways the most challenging test of this war.
