Witnesses say Israeli forces opened fire, sending the crowd into a panic. The Gaza Health Ministry says 112 people were killed. Many were trampled or run over by the fleeing aid trucks. The Israeli military has a different version of events, saying its forces fired warning shots to disperse the crowd, and some soldiers opened fire when they were threatened. The U.N.

And this was in the early hours of Thursday morning local time, just before 5 a.m., that it was swarmed by people desperate to get hold of that aid.And then at some point there was a stampede that in the panic, the trucks tried to escape, that many people were run over or crushed. And also some of those trucks rammed into other trucks, which then caused additional casualties. But for now, there are still conflicting reports as to the exact chronology of events and exactly what provoked this stampede. The Israelis are adamant that they didn't fire on the people directly, but they did fire warning shots to try to disperse the crowd. And as far as the actual firing on one group of Palestinians, the IDF says that it did. It said that because it felt that there was a potential perceived threat. And this is the take, at least, that Peter Lerner, the IDF spokesman, gave us earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LERNER: The reality is one that our forces face a 360 degree threat when they're operating on the ground. Terrorists, they don't wear uniforms. Hamas terrorists, they wear sandals, sneakers and sweatpants. And they come up to our vehicles and they try and place explosive devices on them. So anybody approaching those vehicles, those tanks or the on-personnel carriers that are operating in the Gaza Strip is a perceived threat. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The United Arab Emirates has called for an investigation. The United Nations secretary general has called for an investigation and reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire. The president of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, has, if you like, doubled down on the Brazilian president Lula da Silva's assertion that what Israel is doing in the Gaza Strip is reminiscent of the Holocaust, something that no doubt Israel will respond to as well.

There's no sign of that happening. But we should also be clear that negotiations are not happening out in the open. They are happening behind closed doors. It may well be that things are better or worse than we think they are. And I suppose the Qataris summed it up by saying that they are hopeful, but not necessarily optimistic that this ceasefire can come into place. And I suppose that the new deadline or the overall deadline that people are kind of looking at, rather than the Monday that President Biden said he was hopeful things would fall into place by, but the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts around March the 10th, there will be redoubled efforts to try to ensure that this ceasefire, that this truce can come into place before Ramadan, which is always a time of additional tensions in Israel and particularly in Jerusalem.

And since that time, his family have faced hurdles of all kinds just to be able to get to this moment.We remember we saw his mother Lyudmila Navalnaya up there in that Arctic city trying to get the body back where she wasn't denied being able to even see it. We then heard allegations from her and Navalny's team that there were problems surrounding blackmail, issues about how the body could be transported and even where he would be able to be laid to rest. And then more recently, as they have managed to get the body back, issues surrounding just the funeral service itself. Where can it take place? Who would be able to help? They haven't been able to secure a hall to be able to hold any remembrance services. And we've even learned yesterday that hearse and funeral directors were discouraged from collaborating in any way with the Navalny team. But, but, crucially for the Navalny team and for Alexei Navalny himself, he will now be able to be laid to rest at the Berezovsky Cemetery. The ceremony and processions will start at around 6 a.m. Eastern time. There will be a -- there's almost a 30-minute walk between the church and where he will finally be laid to rest. And it is the numbers, Kim, it's the -- it's the turnout that will be drawing attention here as well, because the Kremlin have done their best to try to dampen and try to assuage people from attending en masse to pay their final respects to Alexei Navalny. But Navalny's team have gone out of their way to ensure that people are able, whether they knew him personally or whether they just knew of Alexei Navalny through his anti-corruption videos and investigations, are able to come and say goodbye to the opposition leader. But it is the one thing that the Kremlin will be aware of. And we have seen at the church this morning and over the past few days increased security measures. And with that, obviously Kim, brings the risk of potential arrests and detentions.",

So we're hearing of a heavy police presence, warnings of pro-government agents, agent provocateurs, I guess. What are you expecting to see unfold in the hours ahead? NIGEL GOULD-DAVIES, SR. FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: Yes, well, as your correspondent was saying just a moment ago, this has in effect been a macabre game of cat-and-mouse ever since Navalny died or was killed a couple of weeks ago. And the authorities in various ways have made it as difficult and as threatening as possible for anyone to express public sympathy for Navalny. So I think we can expect a very strong police presence, intimidation of those who wish to attend. There are reports that potentially only Navalny's relatives might be allowed to attend. We know there have been several hundred arrests in many cities across Russia of those who demonstrated against Navalny's death. So the authorities sort of realize that they cannot entirely deny Navalny a funeral, but they are going to make it as difficult and as threatening as possible for anyone who actually wishes to attend it or express support for it.",

You know, in the context of all of this, of what we're seeing here, is that just symbolic or could that actually help at all, do you think?GOULD-DAVIES: Symbols matter. There is a limit, of course, to what the European Parliament can do in practice in supporting Russia's opposition. Although there are various forms of resources and other means of support that European and other countries can offer to help keep this flame alive in exceptionally dark times. But it is important, even these words are important. It's important for Russians who take a different view from the authorities about so much that's going on at the moment. It's important, I think, for them to understand that there is another way of thinking about everything that's going on in Russia, that they have sympathy and support from others. Again, these are dark times. We've been here before. In Soviet times, we know that the dissident movement took real comfort from the fact that there were supporters abroad that were able and willing in various ways to offer the sympathy and in the limited but real ways that they could to help that. So, no, these things do matter. It's important that they be backed up by concrete measures of support there.",

Now fires are common in the densely populated capital, which has experienced a boom in new construction, often without proper safety measures. The U.S. Congress passed a stopgap spending measure late Thursday that averts a partial government shutdown for now.
