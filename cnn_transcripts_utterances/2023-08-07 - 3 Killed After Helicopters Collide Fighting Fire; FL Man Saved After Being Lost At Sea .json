This is about 12 miles off St. Augustine, Florida.Gregory had been floating in a tiny boat that, by then, as you can see, was half submerged in water. For nearly 2 days out there. He saw sharks, suffered sunburn, jellyfish things as well. His father said Charlie never lost hope. Quote, \"He said he's had more conversations with God in that 30 hours and he's had his whole life.\" CNN's Carlos Suarez joins us now.

And it's really significant because the Red Cross, it's not the first blood center to adopt these new guidelines of the FDA, but it does appear to be the largest.It provides about 40 percent of blood and blood components in the United States, so this is just a huge move. Really, this policy goes back 40 years to 1985 when a lifetime ban was placed on gay male blood donors because of the concerns of the spread of HIV. In 2015, they shortened that to a one-year abstinence requirement, shortened it again during Covid to three months. But only now are they really making these guidelines the same for everybody based on individual risk, not based on sexual orientation. And, Jim, this really brings the U.S. into step with other countries, like the U.K. and Canada, who've done this previously and who the FDA says they look at the data there has not made the blood supply any less safe.

They will turn to municipal authorities for any sort of assistance they can get. The hotel across the street in Manhattan, that's actually where there were dozens of asylum seekers who had to sleep on the sidewalk. Many of them adult single males because the city had run out of space. This was last week. The city was eventually able to place them in at least temporary housing, so we have not seen a repeat of that. However, Eric Adams, the mayor, said it was made clear that, that kind of heartbreaking scene is likely going to repeat itself if the city, once again, runs out of space. Here we are today, the mayor's office announcing it's, once again, going to be erecting these temporary structures in the area known as Randall's Island. You will probably remember that from late last year. They actually set up a shelter facility there last fall, but then quickly closed it back down, citing dwindling asylum seeker numbers. But here we are now in the summer. Those numbers, again over 2,000 asylum seekers that arrived in the city just in the last month alone.",

Colombia got through. So South America doing better. So, you're seeing really a rise globally of the game.

BRIANA SCURRY, WOMEN'S SOCCER OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST &amp; WORLD CUP CHAMPION: I was actually very astonished that we even got to the penalty kick shootout phase because that Sweden goalkeeper was on fire. I mean, she made so many amazing saves. And it was just, in my opinion, fortunate that we went into the pks. And I knew Alyssa was fantastic at pks. And I really felt confident that we would win. And I just -- my heart was broken for her because you could see on her face she couldn't believe it because she felt she had made that save.

I don't think it has anything to do with the amazing achievements that we have done off the pitch. And the way that we have as a group stood up for those who can't speak for themselves. That's something we have done for 30 years and obviously has not been something that has hindered us in winning championships. We will win again, whether it's in the Olympic games or the World Cup in the future. We will. And we are the standard bearers for women all over this world.
