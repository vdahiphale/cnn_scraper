They say it'll, \"Undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated two-state solution\". It is just the latest as Israel's new far-right coalition faces a barrage of criticism including from its staunchest ally, Washington. President Joe Biden took the unprecedented step of questioning any effort to undermine Israel's independent judiciary. Telling \"The New York Times\", the genius of American democracy and Israeli democracy is that they are both built on strong institution, on checks and balances, on an independent judiciary. Building consensus for fundamental change is really important to ensure that the people buy into them so they can be sustained. In a moment, I will be speaking exclusively about this to Israel's former ambassador to France, who has resigned because she feels she could no longer serve this government. But first, we want you to bring you the picture from inside Israel with correspondent Hadas Gold on the policy and protesters who are determined not to let it pass. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  By the tens of thousands, protesters streamed into Jerusalem with drums, flags, signs, chanting and singing songs. One of the largest demonstrations for Jerusalem in years as these protesters skipped work and school to stand against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's sweeping judicial reform plans. Fundamentally, altering the balance of power by allowing parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. GOLD (on camera):  Now, for weeks, tens of thousands of Israelis have been coming out to the streets of Tel Aviv to protest. But on Monday, on the day these judicial reforms were first formally introduced in the Israeli parliament, they decided to come here to Jerusalem, so that the shouts of the tens of thousands could be heard in the halls of the parliament.",

So, I think longer term, I think there are people in Washington who are wondering two things. First, is Israel going to be a democracy or not over the medium of long-term?

I suspect that Assad has two calculations in his mind. Number one, making this gesture. And it is important, let -- if it's implemented, it is important. It may help him normalize relations with some countries. And the second reason I suspect he did it is that he could not really control those two additional border crossings anyway. They're controlled by the Turks, the Turkish side, and Syrian rebel groups on the Syrian side, and already some non-government organizations, some aid organizations were beginning to use them.

And so, there is a whole different, sort of, sections of sanctions. The first is that we've frozen $350 billion of Russian central bank reserves, that's like their war chest, that money is no longer available to them. We've also sanctioned about 40 Russian oligarchs, and there's hundreds of billions of dollars of oligarch money frozen around the world, which in my opinion, that's sort of another war chest to Putin. He can draw on that money. And we've also cut Russians -- Russia's banks, many of them, most of them, off of the SWIFT international banking system. We've sanctioned the oil companies.

The war has done one -- at least a trillion, maybe $1.2 trillion of damage to Ukraine. Russia's done the damage. We have custody of their money. Instead of just having that money frozen, that money should be confiscated and handed over to the Ukrainians, both for their defense and their reconstruction. Putin broke it, he should fix it.

And normally, that would be a reasonable thing and that's how international law has worked for the las, you know, many, many years. Now, Putin has redefined international crime. He has redrawn the borders of Europe. He's invaded a foreign country. He's killed -- he's been a mass murderer. He killed the unimaginable numbers of people. And so, we're sitting there in the situation where he is redefining international crime. And we're sitting there and saying, and your money is still protected. We need to redefine international law to elevate it to the level of his -- the way he is become an international criminal. And what does that mean specifically? That means that laws have to be passed in a number of major developed countries which says that sovereign immunity always applies in every single circumstance, except in the circumstance when a country has invaded a neighboring country and committed an act of aggression, which is how this war is being defined under legal terms. So, that's the one narrow circumstance where sovereign immunity no longer applies. If we did that, if the United States and the European Union and Great Britain and Canada and Japan, we wrote their laws to say that sovereign immunity applies in all circumstances other than those, then we could then confiscate their money.

He doesn't really care about the destruction of his military equipment. In this -- in his mind, what he's thinking is that we're going to lose patience before he loses patience. He's thinking that in these democratic countries where we have elections all the time, where we grow tired and are -- where we have a limited bandwidth that eventually we're going to stop supporting Ukraine. And that's his only way out of this whole thing, is just to outlast us. And so --",

I mean, if you look at the trajectory of the Ukrainians right now, they're really causing just noend of hardship for Putin and his military. And on the current trajectory, he -- the Ukrainians probably would eventually succeed over some long period of time. And so -- but -- the -- we've heard murmurings in the United States and Europe from far-right, from all sorts of strange character saying no more money for Ukraine, no more support for Ukraine. If those murmurings that are, at the moment, very narrow in sections of the political establishment become bigger sections, Putin may very well be right, and that's the fear I have. And the reason why it is so important that we actually finally pony up whatever we have to do to help the Ukrainians win in a shorter period of time.",

And I've seen -- and the battle has escalated to the point where there is international sanctions named after Magnitsky applied to Russia which has led to all sorts of retaliation by the Russian government. And every time the Russians have an opportunity to do the right thing to negotiate, to back down, to be reasonable, instead of doing the right thing, they've double down, tripled down, and escalated. I've never seen a moment when Putin shows any sign of compromise, any negotiation, any reasonableness. In anything I've ever dealt with and anything else, he doesn't have the capacity to do that. And so, here we are with this war in Ukraine and he can't afford to show one tiny sign of negotiation or compromise. And I -- so, from that perspective -- and we've seen it play out. He doesn't -- and he says, I'm ready to -- for a peace negotiation. And that negotiation, the preconditions are Ukraine gives up their territory and that's it. And of course, the Ukrainians aren't going to give up their territory. He invaded, he should be rewarded with their territory, no way.",
