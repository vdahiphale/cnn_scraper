We've now heard that Swedish prosecutors have opened a case against an unnamed individual on the understanding that there are reasonable grounds that that individual could be guilty of rape.What we understand, according to the Swedish press, is that Kylian Mbappe is accused as a result of an evening spent in a Swedish nightclub and hotel in Stockholm last week. His lawyer forcefully pushing back on the allegations and suggesting that they themselves are considering taking legal action to clear his name. MARIE-ALIX CANU-BERNARD, KYLIAN MBAPPE'S LAWYER (through translator): He's very calm because he knows what he didn't do. He's keeping an eye on this media frenzy, but from a distance, even if he's somewhat protected from it. Naturally, it's going to have an impact. As I said, he's 25. An allegation of this nature, even if we don't know if it's aimed at him, it hasn't stopped the media from saying he's the target. From that moment on, it's certainly complicated to live with, even if I'm not in his head.",

The crisis threatens economies and more than 50 percent of global food production, and this isn't the only data raising alarm. Here's CNN's Allison Chinchar.

It's asking for help, and we're ignoring it. CHINCHAR (voice-over): In several parts of the Western Hemisphere, droughts caused river flows to decline in 2023. According to a new U.N. report, the Mississippi and Amazon River basins hit record low water levels last year. These satellite images show the water level changes in the Manacapuru River in Brazil over the past few years.
