      "sentences": "Yes, and Gretchen Whitmer and Andy Beshear and Roy Cooper. I mean, there was a -- there were a plethora of good choices for Kamala Harris to choose from, and she made a solid choice. I think she made the choice that fit best for her. And I think people have to remember that this is a governing choice. And Kamala Harris, uniquely enough, understands the role of vice president better than anybody because she's currently serving as vice president to Joe Biden.And so, I think this was a comfortability pick. I think that one of the things that people see in Governor Walz is that he's genuine, that his concern for working families is palpable. It's not something that feels forced. And one more thing. I mean, this campaign is focused on leaning into the average voter. And there is no left or right to Governor Walz. I mean, he is straight down the middle of America. I think that's the best way to describe him. And he's going to be able to go to those cities that are in between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. He's going to be able to go to the outskirts of Milwaukee. He's going to -- you know, Minnesota, of course, you get a bump there, but in Michigan, he's going to be able to go outside of Detroit and talk to these rural white voters. Talk to hunters. Talk to disenchanted voters, workers, working class voters. And so, it's a good pick. It's a good day for Democrats. Now, let's get to work.",

So, you know, let's talk about not picking Josh Shapiro.I mean, obviously, that might've helped somewhat in locking down Pennsylvania. You have to win Pennsylvania as a Democrat. I mean, Minnesota should be a shoe in. So, Tim Walz doesn't exactly really help there all that much. But I mean, talk about the importance. I suppose it does come down to these blue wall states. And Tim Walz will be effective in those states.",

He's going to have a great future. And you know what? We're going to win Pennsylvania because of Josh Shapiro. And let me also just repeat this notion because I've seen the Erik Eriksons, I've seen the Glenn Becks, I've seen people try to chastise the Democratic Party as being anti-Semitic because you didn't choose Josh Shapiro. And I'm just going to call that utter BS.There's no one who has stood with Israel when they were a member of the House of Representatives like Governor Walz. He backs support for their funding. He called the U.S. -- Israel, excuse me, an American value. He's actually gone to Israel and met with Bibi Netanyahu. And so, look, there is no daylight between the Democratic Party in Israel. And I have to remind people who make these really sad tropes, dangerous remarks about the Democratic Party in Israel and anti- Semitism that Kamala Harris literally sleeps next to a Jewish man every night. And so, I just wanted to put a pin in that and say that this is also -- this was about fit, and people try to make it out to be something else. I believe Kamala Harris was more comfortable with the Governor Walz and, you know, my -- I like Mark Kelly the best, but you know, it's her choice and this is where we are.",

I mean, I didn't think it was something that was as real as it has been. I do know Nancy Pelosi has been someone who has been spending a lot of time in the top of the ticket in the politics of what's happening at the top of the ticket. I'll just characterize it as that. And I do know that she leans in quite heavily around Governor Walz because he's a former member. And they have a great deal of respect, same people like Dean Phillips and Bernie Sanders and people who served with them.There's no doubt, though, that at the end of the day I believe Kamala Harris to be a better candidate than Donald Trump. And I think anybody watching will tell you that Tim Walz is a better candidate. He flipped the Donald Trump plus 15 district. I mean, he won by one point. Donald Trump won that district by 15 points. He did that. He's done these things before and he's just a better candidate than J. D. Vance. Can't wait for that debate.",

Something that I think a lot of Americans can relate to. Kids growing up, been in the -- was in the National Guard for years and years and years. Moves to Minnesota, becomes a teacher and a football coach in high school, ends up in 2006, deciding to run for Congress and was just an incredible blast on the scene and that he was like, so, OK, I'll say it normal.He was so, optimistic and interesting. And he never -- he would speak without a note. He would talk about his military service and what it meant to be an American and what that meant when we were looking at Iraq war and other things at the time. And then, he got elected to Congress. He chose to go on the Agriculture Committee, on Armed Services, on veterans. So, when people get to know Tim Walz, and they get to know his story, and how he came from nothing, and just decided to serve our country first in the military, then in -- as a high school teacher, and then as a member of Congress, and then finally as a governor, I think they're going to see someone that's really not like most politicians. And by the way, I don't think there's been many vice presidents that have stood on a deer stand in 10-degree weather in Minnesota, Tim Walz has done that.",

And Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar is back with me.Senator, I guess one of the things that you pick a running mate for, you've got to be thinking about how they're going to perform in that vice presidential debate. And we, of course, know that he'll be going up against J. D. Vance. How do you think that's going to shake out?",

      "sentences": "Oh, I like that matchup. And let me explain why. Tim Walz has debated people in many, many races. He is not afraid of anything like that. He has debated multiple times in governor's debates. I have seen him on the stage as he came into a race as a member of Congress, having to come from behind. No one even knew who he was then.And he just showed up the district by showing how he believed in the things he believed in. And at that time, it was our policy with Iraq, and he came at that as a veteran and the need to bring our troops home. He came at it with supporting veterans and their health care. Remember, he comes into Congress then with the fiasco with Walter Reed and not having enough of a service for our veterans and was a strong advocate for that. And so, I like the matchup because what Donald Trump did when he picked J. D. Vance is he doubled down on his own views and his own base of support. What Kamala Harris has done in bringing in Tim Walz, a guy who grew up in rural America, in a small town, joined the service of the National Guard when he's 17 and then ends up as a high school teacher, completely humble beginnings, has no money in his family, and ends up in Congress and as a governor, that is going to be -- she is picking someone that actually is adding something. And J. D. Vance also came, as we all know, from humble beginnings. [10:55:00] So, I like the fact that Tim Walz is going to say, OK. You know, we both came from some tough times, but I have some different views on what we need to do for America. I think we need to be on the side of the people, and I don't think we need this divisiveness. His whole career has been uniting Democrats, Republicans, independents, and not cutting other people down. That is Tim Walz.",

Everyone likes Tim. He leads the National Democratic Governors Association. They know him.And so, all of these people would have been qualified to be vice president. It's just Kamala Harris made a decision that for this moment in time, and with his background and what he brings to America, that Tim Walz was her choice. That isn't to say that anyone else wouldn't have been great. And what Tim will bring when it comes to Pennsylvania, as he launches his first rally with Vice President Harris there, is that sense of getting that whole state. Because as you know, Jim, Western Pennsylvania is very much like Michigan and Wisconsin and Minnesota and the states in the Midwest. And that is a really -- when you talk to someone like Bob Casey, who knows how to win in those areas, that -- those kinds of roots that Tim has, farming roots, rural roots, understanding what it's like to have weather destroy a farm, or have to deal with the bank on your back when you've got crops and you've got a problem, Tim gets that, and he stands up for rural America. And I think that's going to help in Pennsylvania.",
