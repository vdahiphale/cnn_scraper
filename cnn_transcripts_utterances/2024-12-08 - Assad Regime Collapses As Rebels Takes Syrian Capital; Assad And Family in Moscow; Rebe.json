      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Alisyn Camerota, along with my colleague Wolf Blitzer.And we begin with the breathtaking news this weekend out of Syria. The long, brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is over. It was a stunning end to a violent regime started by Assad's father more than 50 years ago. A lightning fast assault by a coalition of rebel groups captured the capital of Damascus. A source tells CNN that Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow and are being given asylum there. Many Syrians spent their entire lives under Assad's violent rule. Today, they poured into the streets to celebrate. Syrians who had lived under the fist of Assad's power and corruption could be seen entering the abandoned presidential office. Syrians walking freely through the presidential palace, even into the kitchen of Assad's family, where specific instructions were still posted for the family's menu preferences. The rebels also emptied out some of the regime's prisons, notorious holding cells, where so-called enemies of Assad were detained and frequently tortured. It was just a little more than a week ago when opposition forces met little resistance as they took the key city of Aleppo. Then they swept south before surrounding Damascus and deposing Assad. In the end, Russian fighter jets, which had been striking rebel forces in recent days, were nowhere to be found, and Assad's troops dispersed and fled into the streets. President Biden reacting to these stunning developments earlier today, pledging U.S. support for the Syrian people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It never seemed possible that it would end like this.I want to say that the streets are incredibly calm, incredibly quiet, but you can see just behind me a few cars have been going through the street. There's actually a curfew in place from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. That is a security measure of course. There has been some looting in Damascus earlier on, some chaotic scenes. And so as a precaution, as we saw in Aleppo, they have put this curfew into place. I want to show you, though, Wolf, a clip of the moment that we crossed the border because this is a border that I crossed many times when I used to live in Lebanon, when I used to cover Syria at the very, very beginning of the uprising, and the contrast from what it was and what we experienced tonight is just startling. So take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Very, very quiet and just nothing like we've seen it before.The only real evidence we saw, Wolf, of any struggle to finally take Damascus, to finally ouster Bashar al-Assad was a tank in the road below a torn poster of president or I should say, former president Bashar al-Assad. And Wolf, my cameraman, Scott McWhinnie, just found this on the ground, literally, as we were listening to that clip. This is the old flag of the Syrian regime, which has two green stars. The rebels' flag has three green stars, but this one has now been -- literally we just found it on the floor. I guess a real moment where you see how much things have changed just in the past 24 hours. In terms of the security situation on the streets, I would just add, we anticipated that we might see quite a lot of checkpoints as we came into the city. We didn't. We did see a group of men. They did not appear to be armed, but they asked us what we were doing, where we were going, and now that we are sort of ensconced in our place where we're staying for the night, we have seen a couple of patrols. I saw two men armed and I went up to them and asked them where they were from. They told me they were from Idlib, which is in the northern part of the country. And we saw a man on the street go up and wanted to pose for a photograph of them, which I think sort of speaks to the moment. There is obviously jubilation, elation, but also this sense of you can't compute. It was so fast, so breathtaking. It's astonishing. And I think people are taking some time to try to process the magnitude. Keep in mind, Wolf, we're talking about 53 years of Assad rule, 53 years of a brutal police state. And I can't tell you how many Syrians have said to me, Wolf, that, you know, we understand that there are concerns about the rebels and the makeup of the rebels and the fact that some of them are Islamists, and some of them are even jihadists, or have been affiliated with al Qaeda or a proscribed organizations. But, let us have this moment. Let us celebrate the fact that this brutal dictator who has ruthlessly killed hundreds of thousands of people, who has gassed children with lethal nerve agents, who has locked people in prisons and tortured and beaten them to death, that he is finally gone, and that whatever may come and whatever the anxiety, this is a new chapter for Syria -- Wolf.

The airstrikes follow news that the Assad regime has crumbled and rebel groups are taking control.I'm joined now by retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. He's the former commander of U.S. Army Forces in Europe. General Hodges, thanks so much for being here. What are these U.S. airstrikes about and why today? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, Alisyn, I think that probably U.S. Central Command saw opportunity and targets as a result of what's happened to the Assad regime. But I have to say, it also reflects a hyper focus by the United States on counterterrorism, on destroying ISIS which is not a bad thing to destroy ISIS. But I don't know what our strategy is more broadly for the region. And so this attack is a reminder of that's mostly what we're doing.",

How important it is that other nations trust our intelligence and the ability then to do analysis of what's going on there. So we know who is who.

We just talked about trying to hit ISIS targets there, and it is in the interest of the United States that Russia and Iran do not have any more influence in Syria. It's in our interest that Syria is no longer a conduit for weapons from Iran to Hezbollah.And it's in our interest that the millions of Syrian refugees that left Syria as a result of the civil war, that they are allowed to come back home because that will take pressure off of our Turkish ally and also our European allies. So of course, we have interests, and of course we should have a stake in how this plays out. Now I think all of us that are trying to make predictions right now, we're all going to be wrong.

The 10s of thousands who were detained. And what it really means. I mean, if we just stop and think about it for a minute. After decadesof rule of the Assad dynasty, but especially after the last 13, 14 years, we're at a moment in time where, across Syria, you can pretty much say Syria is free. And you can say that without fear. And that, in and of itself -- and no one knows how long that's going to last. But that, in and of itself, is such a seismic moment. I mean, think about the families that are going to be able to be reunited. So many people are flocking to the prisons trying to find word of those who they loved who disappeared. We're seeing extraordinarily heartfelt moments of people being freed, of families being reunited. The sense of, sort of, you know, optimism of, oh, after all this time, are we actually going to be able to go home, that we're hearing from so many of those who are internally displaced.

But there's also a certain level of sort of pragmatism and maturity that we're seeing, in terms of not just, you know, military strategies that brought Syria to this point, but also in the political space as well. Now, that being said, it could very much be lip service. And it really is one of those scenarios of, you know, who really knows what's going to happen? I don't think anyone can predicted what just took place, nor do I think that anyone can really predict what is going to happen. Because there are so many different factors. And I think, you know, when you kind of extrapolate and look at the region as a whole, Syria, Lebanon, you know, Gaza and everything that's happening, there is a sense that things cannot stabilize until everything stabilizes. But, at the same time, you know, the region is changing, whether it wants to or not. And some of these changes are being forced upon it. And some of these changes are being driven by the people themselves. And I think there's this great sense, especially as someone who has basically been covering this region for more than 20 years now, of is this the point where the people of the region are actually given the agency to be able to decide their own future, without any of these outside meddling forces?",
