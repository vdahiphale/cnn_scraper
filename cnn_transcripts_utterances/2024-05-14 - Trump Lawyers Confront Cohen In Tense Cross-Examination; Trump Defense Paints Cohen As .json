Ones like Donald Trump belonged in a cage, not very nice.The questions probe Cohen's inability to stay away from social media, including, by the way, his podcast schedule. How his memory about Trump calls is perfect but less so when it comes to his interaction with maybe a Manhattan prosecutor, how his obsession with winning Trump's approval spiraled into what they say is a revenge plot.

I mean, I think jokes aside, Mike Johnson is the speaker of the House. There was something even in this day and age where we have seen things really fall apart, including the fact that the former president of United States is on trial for paying off an adult film star. There's something about that that was particularly unfortunate. He actually managed to make Kevin McCarthy's visit to Mar-a-Lago in 2017 look dignified in the sense that it's one thing to make pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago. It's another thing to go out in the steps of the Capitol and say that Donald Trump is being mistreated or persecuted to go to New York, to go to this trial.
