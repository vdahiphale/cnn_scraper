      "sentences": "Right now on EARLY START, senators unveil a sweeping border deal and foreign aid package for Ukraine and Israel. But it's far from clear that the measure can pass either chamber.The U.S. carrying out strikes on Iranian-backed groups in Syria and Iraq as the White House warns it's just the beginning. And California facing the threat of historic flooding and deadly mudslides from a risky and very rare weather event. This is a live look at LAX. Delays and cancellations already piling up. Check your flights, stay off the freeways. We'll have much more. Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's Monday, February 5th, it is 5:00 a.m. here in Washington. And we now know the details of the long-awaited border deal and foreign aid package that senators have been negotiating for months. The $118 billion package would give the president powers to significantly restrict illegal migrant crossings and severely curb asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, and that would break with decades- long protocols. The deal includes more than $20 billion for border security, roughly $60 billion for Ukraine and more than $14 billion for Israel. But the legislation is at real risk of failing in a high-stakes Senate vote this week as Republicans face down defying former President Trump if they're going to vote to advance the measure. And even if it does pass in the Senate, the House Speaker Mike Johnson says it is already dead on arrival in his chamber. Now Majority leader Chuck Schumer is urging lawmakers to put aside political differences and pass the deal that just like he did with Minority leader Mitch McConnell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  We cannot let politics get in the way of passing this legislation. The senators have to drown out the noise of politics and politicians who tell them not to vote for this bill for political purposes. I am proud leader McConnell and I who disagree on many issues, have never worked so closely together on legislation as we did on this, because we both realize the gravity of the situation.

I think that this deal is on extremely shaky grounds, not just in the house, but even in the Senate, because remember, you're going to have to have all of these Republican lawmakers in the Senate defy Donald Trump, who has said repeatedly that we don't need this deal, and that unless it is perfect, that people should vote no for it.And so, already, passing it through the Senate is going to be a challenge. And then of course, as you just heard in the House, it is as Speaker Johnson said, dead on arrival. So I think that this face is an extremely uphill battle in the coming days and weeks.",

It is -- it goes farther than certainly many Democrats had been previously willing to go. There are going to be activist groups on the left that are going to be upset about this.I mean, you used the word perfect, and that's what Republicans are arguing or what Donald Trump is saying they need.

I feel like in some ways, it goes beyond how we often hear that, right, like, oh, we don't want to let him get something across the finish line, that he can tell in a press release or in an event where he goes somewhere.In this case, there are Republicans who kind of are openly saying, oh, we don't want him to actually be able to solve the problem. We want the problem to remain so that it's something we can use to run against him in an election year. I have to say, it's more nakedly cynical than -- I mean, I've been covering this town for a while. That used to be something that people would kind of not wink and nod about behind the scenes, and now it's just out in the open.",

There's going to be people on both sides of the aisle who are going to be frustrated with some of the changes made for different reasons.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to the region this week. And Max Foster joins us from London. Max, good morning. We have spent not -- a considerable amount of time talking about this theme, this idea that, you know, we've talked about it in the context of Benjamin Netanyahu seeming to have preferred Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Now, Ben Gvir kind of saying this openly, obviously, the politics of this very complicated for the Prime Minister because he needs to keep this fragile coalition that he has together. How do these comments -- how are they resonating in Israel, and what's Netanyahu's reaction been? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it really does show how much he's juggling with, doesn't it? And then he goes into these talks with Blinken. For example, he's got a lot of politics to deal with, as you say. I mean, Ben Gvir, an extreme voice, certainly doesn't represent, you know, the broader view, but certainly, he is a very prominent voice. Without mentioning Ben Gvir, Netanyahu did speak about this during a cabinet meeting, saying I'm not in need of any assistance in navigating our relations with the U.S. and the international community. He can probably see how damaging this could be because as a, you know, view that Israel is going too far, obviously, with this military campaign, and this is pressure on Netanyahu to go even harder on that. And it's a challenge because there are those -- there's just widespread views about how all of this should be handled. But you know, the Israelis need America. And if this undermines the Biden administration, it undermines negotiations that the Israeli government are trying to have with them.",

Four of the five biggest international commercial shipping lines are now diverting, they're now going around Africa as well as British petroleum. And it is important to keep in mind that the Houthis have lots of experience dealing with better-armed foes. They were fighting from 2015 to 2022 against a Saudi-led coalition that was largely armed by the United States, but they emerged from that war stronger than ever. And I was reading in the \"New York Times\" today, they were quoting an analyst who said they taking on the Houthis is like fighting fog. Kasie?",
