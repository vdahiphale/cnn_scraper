      "sentences": "Terrorists turned TikTok influencer. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.Against the backdrop of virulent antisemitism running rampant online and off, Osama bin Laden was trending this week more than 12 years after he was killed by SEAL Team Six. Dozens of young Americans have posted videos on TikTok expressing sympathy with bin Laden, the terrorist who orchestrated the September 11 attacks after they discovered a two decades old letter that he wrote critiquing the United States, including its support of Israel. Among many heinous quotes, quote, \"Your law is law of the rich and the wealthy people who hold sway in their political parties and fund their election campaigns with their gifts. Behind them stand the Jews who control your policies, media and economy.\" There's a lot more to it. It's about 4000 words but you get the gist. It began to recirculate this week on TikTok where videos on the topic garnered at least 14 million views by Thursday. Now, according to TikTok, that doesn't represent trending according to their metrics. The platform said that videos promoting the letter violate its rules against supporting any form of terrorism, but that the number of videos promoting the letter were, quote, \"quite small,\" and reports of it trending are inaccurate. Here's what you get now if you search TikTok for letter to America, \"This phrase may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines.\" Why is this also concerning? Well, new data from the Pew Research Center out just this week shows TikTok rapidly becoming a place where more and more young Americans get their news. Pew found that nearly a third of Americans aged 18 to 29 regularly get news from TikTok and the share of U.S. adults who say they regularly get their news from TikTok has more than quadrupled from 3 percent of 2020 to 14 percent in 2023. All of this came as the \"New York Times\" reported that actors Sacha Baron Cohen, Debra Messing, and Amy Schumer, were among more than a dozen Jewish celebrities and TikTok creators who had a private meeting with TikTok executives on Wednesday night urging them to do more to address the surge of antisemitism and harassment. Sacha Baron Cohen who does not appear to have an official TikTok account, said early in the call, quote, \"What is happening at TikTok is that it is creating the biggest antisemitic movements since the Nazis.\" He criticized violent imagery and disinformation on the platform claiming the TikTok could flip a switch and fix antisemitism. And over on X, CEO Elon Musk agreed with an antisemitic posts that claim Jews push hatred against white people. In response to this, several companies including Apple, IBM, Comcast, Disney and CNN's parent, Warner Brothers Discovery have paused their advertising on the platform. So, about that bin Laden letter, it had originally been posted in Arabic on a Saudi Arabian website and was then translated into English and published in 2002 by Britain's Guardian newspaper. On the Guardians website, there's now a statement that reads as follows, \"This page previously displayed a document containing in translation the full text of bin Laden's letter to the American people. The transcript published on our website had been widely shared on social media without the full context. Therefore, we decided to take it down and direct readers instead to a news article that originally contextualized it.\" And therein lies the issue. Should it be published or should it be censored? Should it be removed? A professor at the City University of London, Marco Bastos, told \"The Washington Post\" that the editors of the Guardian faced a no win scenario once interest in Bin Laden's letter began to grow, quote, \"If they don't take down the content, the content will be leveraged, and it will be discussed, potentially shared and is going to go viral, if not out of context, then certainly outside the scope of the original piece. If they take it down, they're going to be accused, as they are right now, of censorship.\" Personally me, I think it's got to be left up. You can't hide it. The horses left the barn. Nothing was posted online is really ever gone. And if you take it down, there's even more room for misinformation. I found one version online that was about five pages into reading it when it made reference to an open letter to President Biden and Vice President Harris. Wait a minute, I said, bin Laden was dead long before Biden was president. I was looking at a fake. And if you remove the real one there is even more room for that kind of trouble. Additionally, if you remove it you create more curiosity and buzz about it. Better I say to leave the original version, contextualize it, discuss it, and educate a whole generation of young Americans who weren't even born when bin Laden was responsible for killing 3,000 Americans. I say publish, don't censor. [09:05:22] And apparently I'm not alone. Yesterday on my website, on this question, 18,643 voted 62.32 percent of us said publish, 39.68 percent said censor. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen joins me now. He's the host of the podcast, \"In the Room with Peter Bergen.\" You'll remember he produced the first television interview that bin Laden ever did. It was in 1997 for CNN. He was also the only outside observer who got into Bin Laden's about a bad compound in 2012 after SEAL Team Six killed Bin Laden, and before the Pakistanis raised the building. He's also the author of several books, including \"The Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.\" And he just published this piece at cnn.com, \"Osama bin Laden was a mass murderer, not a TikTok influencer.\" Peter, it's great to see you. You find all of this baffling, how come? PETER BERGEN, AUTHOR, \"THE RISE &amp; FALL OF OSAMA BIN LADEN\": Well, Michael, thanks for having me on the show. Well, first of all, you know, when you look at the people who are posting on TikTok, I mean, they're clearly people in their 20s. They were either not alive on 9/11 or they were, you know, very young children. They are sort of divorced from the history of this. And it's not just as you say, 3,000 Americans who were killed by al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda was responsible for 10s of 1000s, of deaths of other people around the world. I mean, al- Qaeda in Iraq helped sparked the Civil War there in which 10s of 1000s of Iraqis died. You know, this guy is not a hero. He's not some serious thinker. And the other thing, I mean, Michael, the letter itself, I'm not really sure was written by bin Laden. Or if it was written by him, he had other people helping him because it'll also focus on some other issues that bin Laden typically didn't focus on. He talks about American tolerance of homosexuality, the drug culture in the west, you know, global warming, that U.S. is supposedly responsible, et cetera, et cetera. And these were really not issues that bin Laden really cared about. At the end of the day, he did care about the Palestinian issue and that's how the letter begins. And in other statements, he emphasized that and it was kind of call (ph) to his -- the reason that he was attacking United States, that is true.",

His father, who ran a major construction company renovated the three holiest sites in Islam, including the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is in territory that was taken by the Israeli army during the 1967 War.\"It's true to say, Peter, right, this was his driving issue. I mean, post September 11, we were told, they hate us for our lattes, they hate us for our genes, they hate us for our lap dances, they hate us for our freedoms, but it was really about foreign policy, and largely on what they described, al-Qaeda, the so-called Arabian Peninsula.",

And for him, the Palestinian issue was (inaudible). The interesting thing is it sort of receded for a jihadist group of late.I mean, think about ISIS, ISIS was very focused on killing shear. And for them, the Palestinian issue was kind of marginal. Now it's come back front and center, including for groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda since October 7 and the attack on Israel.

For them, that's an event that entered into history, not an event that's in memory.And I think it's very important for us to understand what happened on 9/11. And, you know, I mean, of course, you know, the United States made some mistakes after 9/11, President Joe Biden has said that himself publicly, when he's, you know, talking about what Israel should do in the Gaza Strip. But the fact is, is that, you know, bin Laden attacked us on 9/11 without warning, and, you know, killed a lot of our citizens. And he changed history in a way that I think he was surprised by ultimately, because he believed his own narrative that the United States was a paper tiger and that we would sort of pull out of the Middle East.

I always taught that with terrorism, you're fighting two battles simultaneously.One was the battle against the terrorists, and the other was the battle for public opinion, and both matter.

What that probably means is we had signals intelligence, that they -- there were people there in the facility who were Hamas and who were communicating from there.Look, I have no doubt that Hamas had people in the hospital, and that those people had weapons, I have no doubt that there's a shaft that leads to the tunnel system, but you could do that in almost any building in Gaza. Find Hamas people with weapons and find a shaft lean into a tunnel system. So, the Israelis have to provide a lot more proof if they're going to win this part of the public diplomacy, the public opinion battle. Why does the public opinion battle matter? Well, because there are people in the United States and in Western Europe, and even in the Arab world, who wants to support Israel, but may not support it enough if the Israeli action is seen to be abhorrent and it seemed to be violations of international law. It is against international law to attack a hospital unless that hospital has been changed entirely into being a military facility. This was clearly a hospital. Bibi Netanyahu said yesterday on NPR that it wasn't still the hospital when the Israelis attacked. Sure it was, and the Israelis knew it was because they went in with doctors and incubators, to try to keep the babies alive once they took control of the building. The other reason, Michael, that public opinion matters here is the next generation of Arabs are watching this. And the hatred for Israel, which had subsided somewhat in the Arab world is growing to incredible proportions. That means 10, 15 years from now, though, there are people whose opinions are being formed now as young men who will be terrorists and who will hate Israel for the rest of their lives.

We can have, you know, all sorts of resentment and stuff, if we choose, but those things are far too heavy burdens to move forward in our lives. And I'm moving forward not just for myself, but for the American people. Because there is no representation for the American people in Congress. That's why I'm running on single bill voting.
