But that is complete fiction, according to local and federal law enforcement, and the official FBI complaint says according to the attacker himself, the FBI says in that document that the attacker himself told police in a recorded interview that he broke into the Pelosi home by breaking a glass door using a hammer, that he surprised Mr. Pelosi, told Mr. Pelosi to wake up. The complaint says Pelosi told 911 and later a police officer he didn't know the man.

People have been saying there may have been two hammers, they both had hammers going at each other. I don't know. The FBI complaint says the attacker told police he brought a hammer, he used a hammer.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader on the Senate side, was quick to condemn the attack at the Pelosi household, calling it horrifying. But others likened it to other political attacks, other violent attacks against Republicans. Then you have seen some push those baseless conspiracy theories with no fallout whatsoever.This all comes as Nancy Pelosi, of course, has been absolutely demonized by Republicans for the better part of the past two decades in the Republicans' quest to battle over the House and certainly the fight right now to take back power in the House. But the other big fallout and the big question here among the members themselves and the question that they're confronting is the security situation that they face on the campaign trail and also out in public as we know that only the leadership is the one who will receive the security detail that Nancy Pelosi had, but it does not extend to rank and file members, and it certainly does not extend to family members themselves. So as we look at how the political landscape may be affected by this, members themselves are assessing their own personal safety. And right now, there is a review among law enforcement agencies within the United States Senate and the House to determine exactly whether to change the security protocol for these members as we are seeing these threats of violence escalate.",

And the political rhetoric, as we know, over the past few years has just been really escalating. Lines have been crossed. New lines have been drawn, inappropriately. And it's scary. It's a very scary thing at a very scary time. So obviously this isn't an isolated incident, unfortunately. We had the shooting of Steve Scalise. We had Gabby Giffords, we had the assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh. These lines are moving on both sides. This isn't just one party or the other.

Treating people harshly and his language around violence, and then an attack on the Capitol, the assault on the Capitol, and then encouraging people toward violence.So, listen, you can say, it is the sort of both sides, but really Republicans aren't speaking out for the most part in a vehement way. You have -- you've got Senator Mitch McConnell, you have Kevin McCarthy who spoke out, but for the most part, silence, very muted from Republicans about what is happening with violence.

It's the most powerful rocket currently in operation today.What is being kept secret, and what is the mystery here is the classified payloads. The things that are inside this rocket. Those are coming from the U.S. military, the U.S. Space Force, this rocket, the Falcon Heavy is going to be launching it into an orbit called geosynchronous orbit, which is much further than low Earth orbit where most satellites are placed. And so, this is a big deal because yes, it's a secret mission for the U.S. Space Force. But it's also just really cool to watch because, guys, this rocket has not launched in since 2019. It's only launched three times before. This will be its fourth launch. And if you are anywhere near the Kennedy Space Center at 9:41 a.m. Eastern time this morning, this is one of those launches that you want to just go outside and look up in the sky because there is nothing else like this flying today. With that said, NASA is trying to launch an even more powerful rocket, a little bit later this month. But what you're going to get with the Falcon Heavy landing, guys, it's not just a rocket launch, you're also going to get two rockets landing. They're going to try to bring two of the boosters back and land them almost simultaneously at Cape Canaveral. So you get a launch, you get two rocket landings and two sonic booms that come with that. The Space Force putting out warnings up and down the Florida coast that if you hear two big booms, don't worry. It's just the (INAUDIBLE). So it's a good launch. You go see if you can.",

This relentless drought not just across Minnesota, across so much of the heartland pushing the Mississippi River to some of its lowest water levels on record and creating a shipping crisis that's going to affect how much you pay for groceries. Our Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): To navigate this river in the old self, a man would stand on the prowl of a steamship and bounce a lead weight on a knotted string off the bottom. If it was a safe 12 feet deep, he'd shout Mark Twain. Samuel Clemens made that his pen name of course. But if you wrote about this river today, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn would spend a lot of time walking on the beach because in too many places, the not so mighty Mississippi is a fraction of a Twain.",
