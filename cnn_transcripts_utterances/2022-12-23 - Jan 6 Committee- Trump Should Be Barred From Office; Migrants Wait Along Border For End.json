This document is based on more than 1,000 interviews, emails, text messages, and year-and-a-half long investigation, and this is what they found. They found \"That evidence has led to an overriding and straightforward conclusionSo, let's bring in now former Trump White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews. Sarah, - by the way, she said Sarah resigned on January 6 and testified before the January 6 Committee. Sarah, good morning to you. Thank you for joining us. This is an extensive report, no doubt. The Committee places the blame right at the feet of the former President Trump for this insurrection, and they conclude that he should be barred from office. Do you believe that this report is the next step in accountability for the former president, and do you agree that he should be barred from office? SARAH MATTHEWS, FORMER DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY UNDER PRES. TRUMP: I do agree with that assessment. I think that the report shows that this was a very orchestrated effort by Trump and his co- conspirators to try to overturn the election, and that on January 6, it played out exactly how Donald Trump wanted it to. He sat by and watched, as the riot unfolded, and never once picked up the phone to try to call for help, even when his own VP was under attack. And so, I do think that he shouldn't hold office ever again. And, I hope that this report now, that DoJ will have all of the evidence that the Committee has collected, will go forth and hopefully do something with it.",

And so, now, seeing everything that the Committee has uncovered, and truly seeing just how much Trump didn't care, and didn't - it wasn't even that he didn't want to act or it was that he didn't even want to act, he didn't care about the riot unfolding. And, it was indefensible, his behavior that day. And, I think even more so his behavior since then.

The two met while serving in the Venezuelan Military. In October, they started their trek north, fleeing political turmoil, hiking through jungles, rafting murky waters, riding a train from on top, so close to their final destination until policy and this halt their journey.Before Sunrise, Tuesday, we watched as Texas law enforcement mobilize, sealing off this popular access point to American soil, one of the state's efforts to stop the flow of migrants. But, it only reroutes them a short distance down the river, creating a new bottleneck for illegal crossings and a tense standoff. The setting sun ushers in freezing temperatures. By nightfall, migrants settle in on the U.S. side of the river, building campfires to keep warm. Hours later, some rush another border entry point about a mile away. Under Title 42, they can still be immediately expelled on the grounds of COVID prevention, Lucy and Ulexi determined to enter legally. She wants to do it the right way, she tells me, and knows exactly where she wants to go. Far from their Big Apple dreams, unable to return home, stuck in international purgatory. I'm here with my partner, she says, discriminated against, they say, because they're migrants, they're women, and there were a couple. To be safe, they avoid public displays of affection, and traveling groups. Another reason they want to get to the other side? When we're there, we're going to help all of our family, she says. The very mention of family triggers emotions Lucy has carried since leaving Venezuela. Lucy missing her mom and siblings, Ulexi, her 10-year-old daughter. We hurry across traffic about a half mile from where we first met the couple and arrive at this local shelter. With nowhere else to go, families line up, hoping to escape the freezing cold, Lucy and Ulexi among the fortunate. This is home at least for now.
