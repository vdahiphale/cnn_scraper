He and Ginny put in between $50,000 and $70,000 into his mother's home before the sale. When the sale occurred, his share was only $44,000. So he figured that since there was a loss for him, it didn't have to go into the investment section of these financial disclosure forms. My source said that Thomas himself fills out these forms with the help of some aids.But it is clear from the forms that you do have to list a transaction irrespective of whether or not there was a profit. Crow told us last week that he did this because he wants to one day build a museum for Clarence Thomas. And we did also learn this one new detail, and that is, is that when the deal went into effect, Clarence Thomas's mother was able to continue to live rent free. She lives there now.

It's the problem of the donor stepping away, but it is really the problem of the donor telling everyone, they are stepping away because it really speaks to a signaling shift on the candidacy of Ron DeSantis.There was real excitement. There was real energy coming out of the Midterms when he was seen as the permanent other than Donald Trump in this race, but over the last couple of months, as Donald Trump's hold on the Republican base has continued, as we haven't seen the indictments drop off Donald Trump's support, and as DeSantis has been challenged by other candidates in the race, and had some stances that really caused some blowback, thinking about his position on Ukraine initially, and particularly this abortion ban, six-week abortion ban that they just pushed through the Florida State Legislature. He has been squeezed by the pressure to appease Donald Trump's base and for a donor class that is looking ahead to a General Election and saying, we thought you were not like the MAGA type. We thought that you are going to represent a different style of Republicans, and he has chosen to really mold himself in the fashion of someone more like a Ted Cruz or a Tom Cotton style rather than being someone who was going to represent a full rejection of Trumpism. And I think for some of those donors, that's what they were looking for Ron DeSantis to be maybe a year ago.",

If you have a six-week abortion ban hanging over you in the General Election, those donors are looking around and saying, is that proposition still true? Are you still molding yourself as the type of person who can win a General Election because that distinction has kind of fallen away for him as he has tried to really appeal more to the Trump side, the primary side of the equation.",
