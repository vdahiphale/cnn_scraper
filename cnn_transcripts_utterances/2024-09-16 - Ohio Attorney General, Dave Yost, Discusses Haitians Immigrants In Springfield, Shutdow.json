Wittenberg University said, among the threats were two emails targeting Haitians. The city canceled its annual Arts and Culture Festival. Bomb threats last week also forced the closure of city hall, locked down some hospitals, a few schools, at one point, evacuated. And Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick, J.D. Vance, Ohio's junior Senator, is defending, repeating the rumor, even though it's false. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH) &amp; VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to -- if I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The issue is there were 150 kids in that school last year that didn't speak English that required an ESL teacher, required additional translation, to this year, there are more than well over 500.

We all must work hard to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence.\" But listen, this is a difficult issue for any campaign to navigate because they will have to make a forceful case against the former president. They will have to continue to do so. And even though he says, without proof, that it is the rhetoric that is coming from Democrats that is leading to these assassination attempts, they, of course, will still continue to make this robust argument. We saw after the first assassination attempt, Democrats maintained that the former president continues to be a threat to democracy as evidenced by January 6th.
