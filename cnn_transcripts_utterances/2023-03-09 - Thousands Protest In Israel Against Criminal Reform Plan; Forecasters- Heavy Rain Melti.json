National Weather Service warning people to avoid mountain travel, to be prepared for chain controls, major delays because they could get two to eight feet of snow in the Southern Cascades and Sierras. Another concern is flooding in the foothills as well as snow loading where snow that's gathered from previous storms on structures and rooftops.Well, that's getting heavy. And as that absorbs the incoming rain, that can melt and then cause structural collapse. So, officials are telling people to please try and clear as much snow as possible off of structures out of storm drains while it is still dry right now. There are Monterey County residents being told to stock up on essentials for two weeks. And all of this, as you said, reeling from previous storms where there are still people like those in San Bernardino Mountains still trapped without food. Deputies going door to door making sure people are OK, Kate.",

And now, Gavin Newsom saying he doesn't want the state money to go to Walgreens.Here's a tweet that he put out. He said California won't be doing business with Walgreens or any company that cowers to the extremist and puts women's lives at risk. We are done. This, as you mentioned comes after 21 Republican-dominated states threatened legal action because of this whole drama over a specific pill, mifepristone, and they say that this is illegal because mailing this drug would be against the law. Now, Walgreens saying that they wouldn't distribute the abortion medication to these 21 states and responding by saying this. We are deeply disappointed by the decision by the State of California to not renew our long-standing contract due to false and misleading information. Then, they went on to say we will dispense the medication consistent with federal and state laws. Now, Gavin Newsom, though saying that the money is going to matter a lot when it comes to California and not doing business with Walgreens, Kate.",

Let's start with Walgreens as Camilla was just laying out some of the details of it. Is the position of the state -- is this about punishing Walgreens or is it trying to get them to change policy?LT. GOV. ELENI KOUNALAKIS, (D-CA): Well, let's just be clear at that. They came out the gate saying that they were not going to be selling mifepristone in 21 states in the United States. And it was not because it was not legal, but because they were under pressure from Attorney Generals. And so, the governor responded very clearly and said, look, if that's the position you're going to take in those 21 states, California is the size of 21 states combined with almost 40 million people, and we're just not interested in doing business with the companies that will bow to that kind of pressure and put women's lives at risk.",

Axios obtained letters from Walgreens to Kansas saying even though the people of Kansas just voted in the last election to keep bodily autonomy in their constitution, and abortion is legal there, they wrote a letter saying that they would not sell it. But here's the thing. What we're seeing is Walgreens speaking out of both sides of their mouth. And if they want to clear it up and they want to make sure that in places where it is absolutely legal to sell this very important therapy to women who need it, I think that that conversation can continue.But for right now, if you saw the LA Times editorial, it's clear that they are bowing to pressure. And California is not going to do business with companies that bow to pressure in this very heated national debate. We are at the forefront of protecting women and being a sanctuary state for women around the country who need abortion care and access like this.",

Because as we know, this started with 20-plus Republican state leaders threatening Walgreens over for -- if they were going to distribute it.You totally disagree with the position that Walgreens is taken.

The Dobbs decision took that right away from us. And yes, I think you're right. It is leading to these chaotic kinds of situations. But we need companies like Walgreens that specialize in providing life-saving care to step up and ensure that their customers are able to access that care to the full extent of the law. And we do not see them doing that right now. Maybe they will more than change their tune and they will make sure that they do provide this care where it is clearly legal.And that is more than -- that does not include the 21 states that they sent a letter saying that they would not sell this therapy. So, we have work to do but California is very clear about where we are. And let me just say that in the last election here in our state, we amended our state constitution with almost 70 percent of the vote to enshrine a woman's right to choose and a woman's right to access abortion here in our state.",

And I think that your guest just a few moments ago really clarified what's going on here which is we have had an enormous amount of snow in a very short period of time and other weather front that is coming in is warmer. And so, at lower elevations, we're looking at snowpack at 5000 feet and less being drenched with rain and overwhelming the ability to capture the rain or the runoff. And we're looking at about half of the population of our state now being under flood watch.So, we are asking people to watch their news, stay informed, have a full tank of gas in case they need to evacuate, get the snow off of their roof if they can if it's safe, and just be very vigilant and prepared because we are in the era of extreme weather.
