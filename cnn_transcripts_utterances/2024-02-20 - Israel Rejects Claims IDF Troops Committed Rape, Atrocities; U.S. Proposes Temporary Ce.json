And you have Donald Trump who has come out, injected himself into the debate and urging Republicans to vote against any form of foreign funding for Ukraine and other allies. And some of those members have also threatened Mike Johnson's job if he were to put the Senate passed bill on the House floor. But on the other hand, there is a healthy contingent of House Republicans who do support additional funding for Ukraine.

Three times as much in just the next 10 years. WEIR (voice-over):  While they're a long way from flying garbage trucks, Astroscale just launched a second test mission and funded only by private investment, recently proved that they can use magnets to catch and potentially extend the lives of dying satellites. In 2018, a team from the U.K. proved that space junk can be snared with a net, which helps with traffic control up there but does nothing to stop dead satellites from burning into countless pieces of metal, throwing off remnants that can stay in our skies for years.",

And something we've been talking about is adding a lot of material to the stratosphere that was never there before. All of the sort of the massive material that we put into space doesn't all just stay there. And when it's deorbited, it basically acts in the same way that a meteorite does. WEIR (voice-over):  With special high flying jets, a team from NOAA recently discovered that 10 percent of the particles in the stratosphere contain bits of rocket and satellite metal. And in the next few decades, it could be 50 percent, matching the amount created naturally by meteorites. Scientists worry that this could eventually alter Earth's climate. So this summer, Japan and NASA aim to launch the world's first biodegradable satellite made mostly from wood.",
