Ukraine is seeinganother barrage of Russian missiles as more civilians cope with the frigid weather without heat or electricity. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says dozens of missiles were aimed at power plants that help keep people warm. Officials in Dnipro, Kharkiv and Odessa say infrastructure in the areas where hit. Another strike in Zaporizhzhia reportedly leaving four people dead well, officials with the United Nations say the relentless attacks are pushing Ukraine towards a major energy crisis. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Ukrainian team will join international investigators at the missile site blast in Poland. Now that blast on Tuesday killing two people. A Polish security official says all the evidence collected suggests that it was indeed a Ukrainian air defense missile. Well, more now from CNN Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley.

Was that Russian missile flying intentionally close to the border to try to essentially create or precipitate the possibility of this sort of accidental overspill?

As we have seen over the past month, Russia is doubling down on trying to cripple Ukrainians resolve, if you will targeting the electricity infrastructure, according to one of the power generating companies here. They estimate about an average of 40 percent of the people of Ukraine without electricity at the moment, that's a very serious and significant number given that the temperatures have just fallen official say because the temperatures are falling, people will be turning to heating devices and trying to turn those on to stay warm. And that creates further imbalance in the system. And I think one of the significant things about the dozens of strikes a day that killed four people in Zaporizhzhia injured 14 in Dnipro, including a 15 year old girl took out vital services in Odessa failed to take out anything that they targeted in and around Kyiv also managed to target in Kharkiv as well.

The prominent Democrat is set to make an announcement about her political future next hour. She will relinquish her position as House Speaker when the Republican Party takes control of the House in January. CNN projects that Republicans now have won the 218 seats needed a razor thin majority and fall short of the predicted red wave. And as Republicans look to the future, they also must deal with the distraction of Donald Trump's third presidential bid for an election that is two years away. CNN's Jeff Zeleny reports from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Republicans winning control of the House after a midterm election that will change the balance of power in Washington. But far less change than they envisioned with turmoil inside the GOP dampening the party's mood and complicating its future. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I'm not going anywhere. ZELENY (voice over): Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is surviving a threat from Florida Senator Rick Scott, with 37 Republicans voting to keep McConnell at the helm and 10 voting for Scott amid deep infighting over the GOP's failure to win a Senate Majority. At the center of broader recriminations among Republicans is Former President Donald Trump. DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better and frankly, much of this blame is correct.

OK, people just need to chill out a little bit on some of this stuff. I mean, seriously, we just ran an election.

MARK ESPER, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP: A new generation of Republican leaders who maybe are more in line with what I consider myself a Reagan Republican who can do so without the baggage and the personal attacks and the self-centeredness of Donald Trump.

MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I think we'll have better choices in the future.

So I'm sure a lot of people are looking at these images looking at that those 229 numbers that you can see in that image of that crushed drone and comparing it to some of the drones that have been used in Russia. Now this oil tanker was attacked on Tuesday evening. Its Liberian flagged owned by a Singapore company, but does ultimately have Israeli affiliation with its ultimate owner. However, when I spoke with an Israeli official, they didn't think that this was an attack on this oil tanker specifically because it is an Israeli affiliated ship. Instead, they saw it as a provocation. They said by Iran in the Gulf trying to destabilize stability, and specifically actually connecting it to the World Cup which is expected to start within the next couple of days. We are also hearing from American officials from the White House who are also pointing the finger at Iran saying that it fits the pattern, as there have been several attacks that had been blamed on Iran on oil tankers at sea by these drones. And actually, the White House U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that they condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms. And he added that there's no justification for this attack, saying that it's a pattern that are abroad or destabilizing activities.

I'm sure they're taking - officials are taking the drone apart and taking a look at it. We know that a British ship was made itself available to the tanker in case it needed help that ultimately was not needed. The company that owns the ships said that although there was damage to the hole, there were no injuries and there was no damage or spillage to its cargo. Keep in mind that in July, there was an attack on the Mercer cargo ship that actually resulted in the deaths of two crew members. So thankfully, there were no injuries in this case.
