In an exclusive statement to CNN, Kelly says about Trump, \"What can I add that has not already been said,\" calling President Trump, quote, \"A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about.\" For the first time ever, Kelly sets the record straight with on-the- record confirmation of a number of damning details about Donald Trump from background sources, including from a 2020 Atlantic story reported with unnamed sources by editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, including the stunning detail that Trump turned to Kelly on Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery in 2017 and asked, \"I don't get it. What was in it for them?\" This is Kelly confirming on the record stories of Trump insulting Sen. John McCain and former President George H.W. Bush because in Vietnam and in World War II, respectively, the former aviators were shot down. Kelly describes Trump as, quote, \"A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all 'suckers' because 'there is nothing in it for them.'\" \"A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because 'it doesn't look good for me.'\" \"A person that demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family -- for all Gold Star families -- on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are 'losers' and wouldn't visit their graves in France.\" Kelly confirming on the record a story reported in the book \"The Divider\" where Trump tells Kelly he wants a military parade, like one he saw for Bastille Day in France, except he does not want any wounded veterans. Kelly confirming that Trump, in 2018, in France, refused to visit graves of Americans killed in World War I. To CNN, Kelly calls Trump a hypocrite, saying he is, quote, \"Not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on Evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women.\" And he concludes Trump is, quote, \"A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.\" He concludes, \"There is nothing more that can be said.

He's really been very upset about what Trump has been saying. Trumphas -- you know, the disparaging of Gold Star families and the disparaging of wounded veterans. The disparaging of soldiers who gave their lives in World War I has been very upsetting for him for years and years and years. But I think -- I think the comments about Mark Milley, who served his country honorably for 40 years -- the threatening to execute him. And then, in Kelly's view, he thinks that Trump saying that publicly is basically a call to arms. A hope that one of Trump's followers will then take action against Gen. Milley. And I think that probably is what pushed him over the edge to finally come forward and give this blistering commentary about what he thinks about Trump. And when you read the comments -- I mean, these are the comments of a patriot, of a soldier, of a Marine -- the comments of a conservative Republican. This is not him outflanking Trump on the left.

I would not disparage the military, and went on the record with that. I really applaud Gen. Kelly for coming forward and saying this so definitively now. I think something that -- something myself and others deal with is what's the timing that people choose to come forward. I am someone who is guilty of could I have spoken out and said things sooner? Could I have made that more clear? But what matters is this. General Milley, who I worked for at the Department of Defense, Gen. John Kelly, and General Mattis have all spoken to the unfitness of Donald Trump, and that has to break through.

Now, there's been -- there's been problems in the past with the rollout to be fair, but I think that's part of this. You don't have sort of a national strategy here. It's more of a patchwork strategy. Also, another thing. When the public health emergency ended in May several things ended alongside that, including the ability for pharmacies to give these shots to people as young as three years old. That was part of the public health emergency. Otherwise, pharmacies can't typically do it until children are at least six years old. So it makes it more challenging. You've got to go to the pediatrician's office and make those appointments. Sometimes they don't have the shots as you -- as you pointed out, Poppy. There also seems to be an increased demand. I mean, in the past, there hasn't been a huge uptick for these shots, especially in young children. But take a look at what's happened between June and September. There's been about a five-fold increase overall in hospitalizations. About half of those have been in children between the ages of zero and four. So really young children are the ones that seem to be getting hit hardest by this. And I should point out as you look at those numbers, for most children under the age of five who are hospitalized, they did not have an underlying medical condition, OK? So that's another reason that pediatricians are saying everyone needs to get vaccinated, not just people who you consider at high risk because of some underlying problem.",
