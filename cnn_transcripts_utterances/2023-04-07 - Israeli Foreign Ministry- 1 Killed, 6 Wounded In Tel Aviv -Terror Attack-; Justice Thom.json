New details and images just coming in as CNN learns of a new terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, as Israel strikes after a barrage of rockets hit along its borders. Plus, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas tries to explain after a bombshell report revealed his many family trips on a yacht, in a private jet, all paid for by a billionaire Republican megadonor. And Thomas never disclosed almost any of it. Plus, Vice President Kamala Harris dispatched to Tennessee one day after state house Republicans expelled two Democrats, two Black men, who were protesting on the floor. But they did not expel the other Democrat on the floor with them, a White woman. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. We have some breaking tragic news from Israel. You're looking at live pictures from Tel Aviv after one person was killed and six wounded from a, quote, terror attack in a popular thoroughfare in the city. Israel says all of the victims, the one dead and the six wounded, were tourists, as fears of further escalation mounts going into the weekend with Passover, Ramadan and Easter all converging. This has all been set off this recent round of violence by a barrage between Israelis and Palestinians. It started with back to back Israeli police raids on a mosque in Jerusalem on Wednesday because of protests in the mosque. That then triggered rocket fire from Lebanon into Israel on Thursday, then came retaliatory strikes by Israel's military into Gaza and Lebanon overnight. Now, Israeli officials say in a separate attack. Two British Israeli citizens were shot and killed by Palestinian terrorists on the West Bank today. Those British Israeli citizens have been identified as 16 and 20-year-old sisters. Now the Palestinian group Hamas, which the U.S. State Department deems a terrorist organization, welcomed the brutal attack on the 16 and 20- year-old sisters. They described it as a quote, heroic operation. Israel's defense forces spokesperson tells CNN that the goal right now in the region is de escalation. But the spokesman admits, quote, we are in very volatile times. We're going to cover this from Jerusalem and from the Israel-Lebanon border. Let's start with CNN's Hadas Gold, who is near the Israel-Lebanon border. Hadas, what new are we learning about this attack in Tel Aviv?",

There has been a serious uptick, a serious escalation in violence in the region one unseen in years.And that really bears the hallmarks of potentially a wider conflict. I knew you played those pictures earlier of the catalyst, really, the moment that launched this wider escalation beginning with that raid, the Israeli police raid on Al Aqsa mosque on Wednesday, Israeli police saying that they entered the mosque after rioters barricaded themselves inside. But for the wider Muslim community that was seen as a provocation. A pouring of condemnation came in and so did rockets from two different locations, Jake. Southern -- southern Lebanon, a barrage of rockets coming from there, the largest seen since the conflict in 2006, more than 30 rockets, as well as the barrage of rockets coming from Gaza. They were retaliatory strikes by the Israel by the Israeli military. And it appeared that this was a very measured a tit for tat, if you will. But the last 24 hours, really a very serious uptick as you heard from my colleague Hadas there. This is the second terror attack, Israeli police say occurring today, the first on the West Bank. There's two sisters killed in a shooting attack and now in Tel Aviv, again, a place considered relatively safe. And all of this, coinciding with three different religious holidays coming at one period in time, the Muslim month of -- the holy Muslim month of Ramadan is underway. Passover is underway. Easter is taking place as well. So serious concerns now, especially with these latest statements from Prime Minister Netanyahu, with the increased rocket attacks, that this just becomes further and further -- this escalation just grows further and further, Jake.",

They worked at a motel in Oklahoma City.But it was another employee, Justin Sneed, who admitted to killing Van Treese. Sneed who is serving a life sentence was spared the death penalty in exchange for testifying that Glossip offered to pay him for the killing. The Oklahoma attorney general says Sneed is a compromised witness, though, and independent investigation found that prosecutors destroyed and withheld evidence from Glossip's defense attorneys. There's also evidence that Sneed regretted his testimony. In letters, he writes: Do I have the choice of recanting my testimony?

By historical standards, however, still strong, right, what we like to see.Also encouraging here, Jake, we saw almost half a million people come off the sidelines and actually joined the workforce, right? Labor force participation that increased slightly. So that has to be good news for the Fed getting some help on the supply side of things, the unemployment rate, which you're looking at here that declined as well slightly to 3.5. That is very low, also very low making news today, the unemployment rate for Black Americans also falling to a record low, higher than the national average, but falling to 5 percent. Jake, that is the lowest level since the BLS sort tracking this data in 1972 and take a look at that the unemployment rate for black women also falling to 4.2 percent. That is also a record low. So bottom line here: is this a calling? Yes. Is this a gradual cooling? Yes. Is it welcome news for the Fed? I would argue, yes.",
