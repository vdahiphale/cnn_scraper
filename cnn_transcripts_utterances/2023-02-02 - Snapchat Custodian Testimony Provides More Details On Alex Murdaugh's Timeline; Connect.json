I want to ask you about something that happened outside of the earshot of the jury.So, the CFO from his law firm basically was, we found out, had confronted Alex Murdaugh about some missing -- basically $800,000 from the law firm on the day of the murders. And the prosecutors are basically alleging he knew he was in financial trouble and there were all these other financial crimes and that was his motivation to kill his family members. It would distract from that. It would make seen the victim. The judge is now deciding if that's admissible. Why wouldn't that be admissible if that's the motive?",

So, he's facing charges for those counts for those appearance. In terms of why the judge doesn't want to take a chance of presenting it to the jury, allowing it to come in, because it goes to propensity.So, it's possible that a jury can base their decision -- be like, wait, if you can steal from your firm, $100 or $1000, almost $800,000 and that's just on one occasion because we heard he stole more than $2 million, than you're capable of killing your family, killing your wife, killing your son. But the problem is that the prosecutor has yet to make a link. What is the nexus between the financial crimes and killing his wife and his son? I mean, the prosecutor is saying, look, he didn't want to be discovered. He wanted to take the light away from him. And it actually worked. Because they didn't approach him again until months later -- I believe in September -- where at that time he tried to kill himself. He staged it.",

Because what the defense is doing is saying, why would a man that loves his family, was hanging out with his family that same day wants to off them.And that's why the prosecution is trying to give them the why, trying to give them the motive. Even though motive is not an element of the crime in order to prove murder. And again, the prosecution has strong evidence. They have completely destroyed his alibi. Alex Murdaugh was saying he was sleeping. But yet we have you on this Snapchat video. We have his voice in the background, that has been authenticated, and you're hanging out at the dog kennels. Which by the way, that's where your wife and son was killed. But you denied it and then tie you time into this set.",

I want to clarify that there are six sponsors on the bill. Rep. Rosario, Rep. Gonzalez, Rep. Candelaria, Rep. Sanchez and Rep. Santiago and myself are all Puerto Rican Latino elected officials here in the state of Connecticut all find the term offensive. And it's a term that we believe is unnecessary because the Spanish language which is 1,500 plus years old already identifies male, female and neutrality. So, we don't believe it's necessary.

But I will beg to differ him on that particular segment, whether it's -- in my term, by my thinking, it is offensive. And I'll give you an example. So, I've had the opportunity to travel across these great United States to speak with many Latino legislators.And the majority of the legislators in the United States of America that are of Latino descent are Mexican. And most of the Mexican- American legislators find the term very offensive. And we've had this discussion with legislators from Texas, California, , Arizona, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and obviously Connecticut. So, my point here is that the majority, the high 96-97 percent of Latinos that speak Spanish find it offensive. There is a small percentage of people that -- again, this is not to be divisive in any way and this is not to put off anybody. This is simply a term that we don't want to see in the government and in higher education. It's not a ban of the word. It's a ban the word and using it as it's related to government official business.",

Because we can only want the input of the public, number one.Number two, it comes out of committee and it goes to screening and it has to pass screening both in the majority and the speaker's screening process on both aisles of the majority and the minority parties. Then when it passes that hurdle, then it goes to either -- it's a House bill. It it'll go to the House of Representatives floor first. If it passes there, then it goes to the Senate. If it passes there, then governor can sign or veto it. So, that's the process. All right, Rep. Geraldo Reyes, thanks for explaining your perspective. Great to talk to you.",

S.A.P., Hasbro, IBM, PayPal, all in the last 10 days those companies have announced thousands of job cuts. In January, job cuts are quintupled from the year before.And yet, jobless claims, which are a proxy for layoffs, they keep going down, down to the lowest level since April. And this suggests that even though some tech and media companies are clearly cutting jobs, a lot of other companies, they are hoarding talent. Like they don't want to let go of the workers they have because there's a shortage of workers. I mean, just yesterday, there was a report out that showed that the number of job openings in the United States went up to 11 million. That means that there are almost two available jobs for every one person looking. And that is despite all this pressure from the Federal Reserve, which is trying to slow the economy down. So. speaking of the Fed and borrowing costs. A new number is out on mortgage rates today showed that mortgage rates, they came in at 6.1 percent, so, the bad news is it's still twice as high, almost twice as high as a year ago. But the good news is, they are inching lower for the fourth week in a row. They are well below that almost 20-year high that was set last fall of 7 percent. And hopefully the fact that they're settling in here just above 6 percent gives buyers and sellers some certainty.",
