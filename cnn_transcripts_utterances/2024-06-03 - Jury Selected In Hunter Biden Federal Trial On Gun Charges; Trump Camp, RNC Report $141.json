The Trump camp reporting it raised a combined total of $141 million along with the Republican National Committee last month in a huge boost in fundraising.

When you talk about firearms possession cases based on a prohibition, what you have here is did the individual possess the firearm and were they addicted to or using drugs at the time?As far as prosecutions go, that's very straightforward. There're two elements of it. You have to prove that the firearm was possessed and then you have to prove the addiction either before or after. On account of things that Hunter Biden has written in the public record and acknowledged his use and, frankly, his struggles with addiction in addition to the possession, that's really not that hard to prove if you're a prosecutor. Now, on also the purchase, same thing, that's largely based on documents. So, look, hard to say. Everything depends on what the jury believes, how credible they find the witnesses and the testimony and the evidence that they get.

White House officials acknowledged that it was quite unusual for President Biden to be the first to publicly unveil the details of an Israeli ceasefire proposal that we are told that U.S. officials did give a heads-up to their Israeli counterparts about this speech that he gave back last Friday. That speech, of course, was aimed at trying to get all of the parties that are involved to finally agree to ceasefire agreement that has been so elusive for a number of months now. But today at the White House, we saw White House officials sort oftrying to downplay this idea that there is daylight between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. I asked White House spokesman John Kirby to explain the fact that President Biden said in his speech last week that Hamas has been degraded to such a point that it could no longer a perpetrate another October 7 like attack, but then we saw the prime minister immediately after that speech from the president saying that the destruction of Hamas still needs to happen before Israel would agree to a ceasefire. And what Kirby's response to that was to basically sat sidestepped the question should and say that the U.S. agrees that Hamas and their ability to conduct that kind of attack, again must be prevented. Now, just the backdrop here, of course, is that the prime minister is expected at some point to come to Washington to address Congress, here across town, but we don't know exactly right now when that date would be and just keep in mind the president, of course, has a very busy couple of weeks coming up with two foreign trips, and then, of course, the first presidential debate at the end of June as well. For the time being, he is trying to put a lot of pressure and various regional leaders to convince Hamas to accept this latest proposal from Israel. Just today, for example, he did speak with the emir of Qatar the White House readout says that the president said Israel is ready to move forward with a proposal that's not exactly what the prime minister is indicating publicly, of course, Wolf.",
