The House Ethics Committee's investigation to Matt Gaetz took years and now, even though he's no longer a congressman, that report detailing alleged sexual, criminal and ethical wrongdoing is out.Also tonight, the alleged CEO killer in court answering to first degree murder charges. And the breaking news, former President Bill Clinton hospitalized, tonight. Details on his condition. Good evening, I'm Erica Hill in for Anderson tonight. The man who might have been the country's top law enforcement official tonight is also a man whose former colleagues today, in a stunning break with tradition, chose to publicly accuse him of having sex with a minor, of regularly paying women for sex, using or possessing illegal drugs, accepting improper gifts and other acts, including obstructing the investigation into those allegations. And honestly, those are just the bullet points from the introduction to the House Ethics Committee's report. A document the committee acknowledged it would not ordinarily release given that Gaetz resigned from Congress the day he was nominated for AG and then, of course, withdrew from consideration. Again, that happened just eight days later. Quoting from the report now, \"The Committee does not do so lightly, saying in this instance, although several committee members objected, a majority of the members of the committee agreed that the committee's findings should be released to the public.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT GAETZ (R) FORMER CONGRESSMAN: It is a horrible allegation and it is a lie.

The House put it out there and his lawsuit was dismissed pretty quickly from court today. But what the House found, not only in the broad brush of what they say were violations of their standards of conduct, substantial evidence of things like prostitution or him engaging in paying women for commercial sex, statutory rape, illicit drug use.They also get into the details in this House Ethics Committee report weaving together not just the trace of payments that they were able to assemble, showing Venmo payments of hundreds of dollars to women from various accounts used or affiliated with Gaetz, but also the testimony of women themselves, including a victim, a 17-year-old girl at the time in July 2017 who was having sex with Matt Gaetz at a party. The committee writes about that victim. The committee received testimony, that Victim A and Representative Gaetz had sex twice during the party, including at least once in the presence of other party attendees. Victim A recalled receiving $400.00 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex. At the time, she had just completed her junior year of high school. The federal government, the federal Justice Department, did investigate him for federal sex trafficking violations and other possible crimes, did not charge him with anything. So, the House Ethics Committee picked up its investigation, and they found not just this situation with this then underage girl, but they say that many women that Gaetz was having sex with were receiving money for drugs or for the sex to the tune of hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. And then on top of that, this violation of standards of conduct in the House, it includes him doing drugs. Another quote from the report, another woman said that she brought cocaine to at least one event with Representative Gaetz, and that she witnessed him taking cocaine or ecstasy on at least five occasions. Mr. Greenberg, that's a witness, told the committee that he would typically provide drugs, such as ecstasy, for events he attended, and Representative Gaetz would pay him back in cash. Several other women observed Representative Gaetz to be under the influence of drugs. Now, Matt Gaetz, he obviously didn't want that report out there today, but he also has said repeatedly to the committee directly and then in public that these allegations against him are false.",

And another Democrat on that bipartisan committee.But I think what's really interesting here is that this is a committee of Matt Gaetz's peers, former peers, and potentially future peers that voted to release that. They said that it was for transparency's sake, making the case that the American public deserved to know what a sitting member of Congress was accused of. Now, of course, Matt Gaetz has denied all of these allegations. And in fact, kind of accused this committee of weaponizing this information that he again denies as false against him. But still, this was a group of his peers, really pushing this information out into the public zeitgeist, not into the court of law, but of course, the court of public opinion in a really stunning example, because of course, we know that Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress.",

So there, I think Donald Trump knows what he got with Matt Gaetz.Donald Trump pulled him back after he was clear he was not going to get the votes in the Senate, and he didn't have a problem with three or four votes. He had a problem of 23 or 24 votes in the Senate that he was not going to get from Republicans. I also think you have to look at the makeup of this Ethics Committee. You know, Michael Guest, who's the chairman, is a former prosecutor. You have another former prosecutor on there and a former sheriff on there just on the Republican side, they are serious people who look into these things with all due process, and they're charged with not only upholding the rules of the House, but also the reputation of the House. And they find in the report, if you read the details of the report, there are several indications that perhaps Matt Gaetz was guilty of accepting favors and gifts that violate the House gift panel. Well, that's exactly the kind of thing that the Ethics Committee is charged with enforcing. And so, I think he knew he was going to have a problem with the Ethics Committee. That's why he skated out of Congress. That's why he resigned from the next Congress when he didn't even have to. He could have gone in the next Congress and waited out his nomination chances for attorney general, but instead he resigned from both Congresses. I think that tells you a lot. We also know Matt Gaetz didn't sit for an interview. They asked him back in July to come sit for a voluntary interview or respond to a Senate subpoena for the Ethics Committee. He chose not to do that. Those things tell us things about where he stands regarding the charges.",

But I think the question on a lot of people's minds in and around Mar-a-Lago and certainly here in DC, is whether or not Trump is going to publicly come out and kind of bless this.I think what we've seen in the reality, getting to Van's first point is that some of these Republicans live in different realities, which is that if you are a Trump loyalist, you kind of have a different playbook and a report like this may not be as damaging as somebody who is not within Trump's favor. Now, one thing that I heard from somebody is that if he does bless Matt Gaetz, right, put his hand over him. That will take a lot of political capital for the president-elect. So maybe there's a chance that if he doesn't go to OAN network and that he doesn't go back to Congress, that he becomes a member of the administration in a seat that doesn't need to be confirmed. But there is a major question of if Trump is kind of getting all of these different guidance and reports from his advisers, which way he will go, and I think that's kind of a largely a major question here.",
