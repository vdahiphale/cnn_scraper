But the idea of the underlying crime, we have not seen a theory for this jury that it's based on extra marital affairs. It's based on whether there was a campaign contribution or a tax related crime. And so, neither of which requires there to have been truth of an actual sexual encounter.What they're trying to do here is paint Donald Trump as a victim -- as a victim of extortion. That this poor man, as a married man, as a candidate, as a wealthy man, is somebody who routinely has to confront people who are trying to undermine him that he has to pay off these different stories. And so, by painting him as an extortion victim, they're trying to suggest that all he was doing was completely not nefarious, that it was benign and not illegal. The problem is for the defense that during the course of the testimony, they have gotten information about the fallout from Access Hollywood from his own -- from the witnesses, that he was aware of that there'd be some reimbursement that'd be paid, not aware of money being stolen from him. But the fact that he would have been aware of it and the timing of it. And of course, Blanche --Blanche now apparently raising his voice pacing in circles, raising his arms as he appears exasperated before the jury. Well, that in a dollar, that's all you got, we'll get you a dollar. You have to have actually a defense. And so, if he's just doing it -- that's not going to be enough. At the end of the day, they should be going at the prosecution about what will be before this jury. 34 counts of falsified business records.

So, he's showing his cards last night.But as it relates to what Laura is saying, you know, I think Todd Blanche did a good job defending President Trump. But it's just not enough. The evidence is overwhelming that the law was broken. And so, what's at issue here? Are there 12 jurists that believe that? And the last point I'll make is that the judge has to be -- held try not to be, but he has to be furious at the fact that he put a gag order on the president. The president keeps breaching the gag order. And on the night before the closing arguments, he puts another nail in the judge.

Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that sort of thing. It doesn't matter whether you're running for office, doesn't matter whether you're running the apprentice, doesn't matter whether you're a normal everyday person in the city. And Anthony, Blanche is also noting that Westerhof out who was a Trump aide, made clear that President Trump didn't freak out. You also notice that Hope Hicks believed there would be a story for the next several days. Interesting that Todd Blanche is painting Donald Trump kind of as a victim when it comes to the leak of the Access Hollywood tape. Is that how he saw it?

There's no way that Michael Cohen did that without Mr. Trump's knowledge. He's just not.And so, you know, the facts are what they are. And I'm happy to call balls and strikes on the situation, even telling you that he may have been on nerve that night, but he wasn't overly unnerved. But if you're saying, did he know about the payment. If you know anything about the personalities involved with this thing, you'd have to draw the conclusion that he knew about the payment. And he also knew about the contrived nature of that payment and the way it was going to go through the system, creating that business fraud. And so, yes, I get it. I understand the specious argument that the defense is making, but it's not congruent with the facts of the case. You know, and this is the most interesting thing about Donald Trump. There's always fragments of truth in the argument. His supporters will hang on that. There is other people that will hang on that.

That's way too long for this case. It doesn't -- it doesn't need to -- (CROSSTALK) COOPERL I'm sorry. Todd Blanche again saying, you're hearing everything from Michael Cohen. Blanche says, they showed the phone records. Then they showed him calls. But we all know how that ended that it didn't get to see the other one. But essentially saying to the jurors, all this information is coming from Michael Cohen. And he was repeatedly lying. I'm sorry, go ahead, Adam.",

No, just I -- you know, I think what we haven't heard from the defense is what people have been saying, which is sort of a thematic, consistent going over the big picture and really focusing on the fact that this case dies with Michael Cohen's credibility. The comments on the witnesses who weren't called Weisselberg and Schiller. Cohen was very effective.But way too much time I think on Stormy Daniels, I mean that could have been discarded with whether he slept with her or not, doesn't matter, irrelevant.

He's a liar. That's not going to be a surprise. So, you know, we don't know how that's going to play for the jury.

And Michael Cohen essentially stuck by his story saying, oh, well, I both spoke to Keith Schiller about this 14-year-old. And I also spoke to Trump.Is there the same absolute proof of laws for every single thing that man told you? No, there's not. For that we have what's called an oath, Blanche says. Just reminding viewers that that Michael Cohen has lied under oath, repeatedly. And obviously, it's the same oath that he has taken on the witness stand in this case. Judge, in terms of what happens next. If once he -- once Todd Blanche close -- finishes his closing statement.

And you know, they could be talking themselves either out of an acquittal or out of a conviction, depending on how the jury goes. But I think the best thing to do is let the parties finish up today.
