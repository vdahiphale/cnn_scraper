How and when all of this unfolded as you point out, Josh.Dianne Gallagher, I know you're still with us. As I understand it, there is expected to be a briefing later in the afternoon. Has there been any indication, at this point, of who will be speaking at that briefing of what we're expected to learn? DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So, I am still looking through this, at this point, on how we're expecting this to come. But we do anticipate we'll hear from the governor there in Mexico so we can, perhaps, get some additional details. Again, he is the one who broke that information, even though it was during a press conference with the president. It was through that governor, sort of breaking that information to the president about the fact that two of the Americans had been found, and that two of them were dead. We anticipate within, at least, the next hour or so learning additional information from the authorities down there. And I do think it is important to emphasize as we have here that at this point, investigators do believe that this is a case of very unfortunate mistaken identity. That these were a group of four friends who were down there for a medical procedure. And the belief is that investigators maybe mistook them for Haitian smugglers, something like that. But that is not the case in this situation. That the families all here in South Carolina have said that this was just a friends' trip, it was a medical procedure. They were down there not anticipating this to, of course, go anything like this, but they were there to support their friend who was having a procedure at this point. This is not believed -- they have nothing involved with anything. This was just a very, very unfortunate and tragic case of mistaken identity according to authorities so far.",

You'll remember several years ago there was a conflict between warring Cartel factions at a casino and they simply locked the doors and set the casino on fire, killing a host of civilians along with the folks they were looking for.Those sorts of things happen in Mexico, that's why the warns about travel to certain parts of the country. I think on any given case, there is the opportunity for success and productive collaboration between the U.S. and Mexican colleagues. But to look back at the entirety of all the business and the interactions that we have on law enforcement and intelligence matters and, kind of, grade them as better or worse is -- can be very challenging at any moment, because there are so many things going on and there are so many opportunities for success or failure.",

You run the risk of -- then when you have Americans in trouble or kidnapped or detained in Mexico, losing those contacts to be able to work with them in moments like this to get the citizens back. So, all of those broad diplomatic brushes can really impact how business is done on the ground.

And that is a big deal because, of course, it means higher borrowing costs for everyone, right? Mortgages, credit cards, car loans, all of those loans have gotten more expensive.But the more the Fed has to do here, the greater the risk that they do too much and they slow the economy right into recession.
