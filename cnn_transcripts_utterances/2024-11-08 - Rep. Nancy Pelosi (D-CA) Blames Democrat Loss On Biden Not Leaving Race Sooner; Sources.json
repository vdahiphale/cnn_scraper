      "sentences": "Happening now, breaking news, the Democratic blame game is reaching new heights after Donald Trump's stunning victory. The former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, pointing the finger at President Biden for not dropping out of the race sooner and and thereby he would have allowed for a competitive primary.Meanwhile, sources telling CNN, critical White House positions could be announced as soon as today, as Trump races to fill out his next administration. One person likely to play a major, if unofficial, role, Elon Musk, who joined a post-election phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. Also tonight, another Iranian plot against Donald Trump's life thwarted by U.S. authorities. The U.S. Justice Department just unveiled charges in an alleged scheme to kill Trump in the weeks before the election. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin tonight with new finger pointing inside the Democratic Party, and it's ugly, including from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who helped orchestrate President Biden's removal from the top of the ticket. Our Senior White House Correspondent M.J. Lee is joining us right now with the latest. M.J., it sounds like Pelosi had enough blame to go around. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there has been a lot of finger pointing going around inside the Democratic Party, certainly a lot of second guessing of various points of the Harris campaign's actual strategy. But based on all of our reporting this week, more than even the vice president, the nominee herself, the person that is getting most of the blame from various Democrats is probably President Joe Biden. And it is specifically his decision to seek a second term after having promised to be a transition president, a bridge president and basically denying the party an opportunity to have a full and robust primary process that is making Democrats incredibly angry right now as they were looking back on the last few years. And former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is adding her voice to all of this. This is what she told The New York Times. She said, had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race. The anticipation was that if the president were to step aside that there would be an open primary. Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward, but we don't know that. That didn't happen. We live with what happened. And as you'll recall, over the summer, Pelosi was somebody who made clear her real reservations about the president continuing to seek a second term. And we actually reported at the time that in a private conversation she had actually bluntly told the president that she did not believe that he could win. So, this is just one more addition that gives us a clearer picture of how strong those reservations had been. We also know, of course, that this has been a tough week for the Kamala Harris campaign. We know that there was a campaign call even last night where senior leaders actually told other campaign officials to please stop criticizing the campaign to members of the press that they do not believe that this is a constructive thing to do.

But I think it's also worth noting that it was really the crucial period was in the fall of 2022, right around the time of the midterm elections, that's what historians are going to be looking back at. Because going into those elections, there was an assumption among a lot of Democrats that they would have a conversation afterward, assuming Democrats wouldn't do well, they would figure out who would come next, perhaps have that open process.But when Democrats perform better than they expected, they took the wrong political lesson from it. They came away saying, okay, we can talk about democracy. We can talk about the overturning of Roe v. Wade. And perhaps Joe Biden has, as people said at the time, earned the chance to run again. And one of the people at the time who was saying that publicly was Nancy Pelosi in November of 2022. So, I think now there are a lot of Democrats who say this process should have happened at the time. Perhaps he should have clearly stepped out and avoided the catastrophe that followed. But they weren't saying it publicly at the time.",

I actually think Democrats don't have anybody to blame but themselves, and not just in the near term thinking about this but the charade that was Joe Biden running for a second term at all, ever. I mean, the idea that we were all supposed to go along with this idea that he was up to the job or up to running for a second term until that debate in June. Remember, Pelosi, Harris, every single major Democrat in this country sat on this network and every other network and in front of T.V. cameras and said, oh, he's vigorous, he's great, he's going to do well, until it wasn't politically viable anymore.So, I have very little sympathy for all this. I'm kind of, you know, watching it with my popcorn box, like the rest of the Republicans, but they have no one to blame but themselves for constructing a charade around Joe Biden that he was up to this. He never was. The American people found out about it, and that's part of why I think Harris lost.",

We have historically been the party that understands organically and authentically and connects with the issues and the struggles and everything that the working class and the middle class go through in this country. And that's what we need to get back to.I think it was not so much an issue of policies, and this is where I think the Democrats need that vice president Harris did well, and perhaps the timing issue was the issue, but I also think organization and the ways that we communicate it, the Republican Party ran circles around us in terms of the infrastructure that they put together from the moment that Joe Biden became president in terms of the grassroots, in terms of the far right wing media, the podcast, the social influencers that they invested in, invested millions in them, gave them money, gave them content, gave them platforms that all resonated and that all grew right under our nose. And we had no idea until it happened that we were so far behind in terms of how to communicate with key demographics in this country that did include working class voters. So, I think all of that has got to be part of our postmortem, part of our analysis to figure out messaging, yes, how do we better message what I believe is our true values and our policies that are the ones that reflect and connect with the working class. We just need to do it in a way where that actually communicates where they are and how they are and listens to them as opposed to making them listen to us.",

And this election was really about the working class in this country how crushed they have felt through COVID, through inflation, how they felt ignored, and, frankly, how they have felt insulted and condescended too.And so, you know, those are values and policy problems with the Democratic Party that has nothing to do with comms and everything to do with, what do we actually believe, what do we actually stand for. So, I'm not usually the business, Wolf, of giving advice to Democrats, but I don't think this is a comms or a tactics issue. It's not a podcast issue. It is, who are we? What do we represent? What are our values? And they have gotten way, way off track from the Democratic Party that my grandfather and my father were in for years when I was growing up.",

And I think the last battle that he can fight is to help this party begin to figure out its next chapter, to begin to sort out some of these big questions about how do you reclaim some of that populist energy, the kinds of things Bernie Sanders is so good at tapping into, while also recognizing there may be cultural issues that do not resonate with the public.So, he has 70-some days, as he said yesterday in the Rose Garden to finish his term.

So, what were they talking about? You know, you could imagine that they were talking about a scenario where they were, you know, putting the screws on Zelenskyy or putting, putting forward a scenario, a possible scenario that they would talk about after he takes office, where he's saying, look, you're going to need to give up some percentage of your country or else. And the fact that we can all imagine that that's a possibility is really concerning. I hope that's not the case. I hope that Donald Trump actually focuses on, you know, not just uniting the country, but uniting the free world.

He gives the orders, they follow them, and so I don't like the idea, candidly, Wolf, of non- elected government people, at any level, having meetings with each other about how to thwart the duly elected president of the United States.So, I'm really hoping that when Donald Trump names his nominee for the Pentagon and then they take office, and you have your National Security Council in place, that we have a much better working relationship between the White House and the Pentagon than what I'm reading tonight, which is one part of the federal government already having some kinds of meetings about what it would look like to thwart the president.

You've already got the government and the bureaucracy, you know, plotting against you or thinking the worst of you. So, look, to me, the best thing that could happen here is for them to talk to each other, meaning the Pentagon people and the president and his team. That that's what really ought to happen.

According to the information filed in federal court in Manhattan on October 7th, Farhad Shakeri, 51 years old, he lives in Tehran, said that he was tasked by the IRGC to try to find a way to carry out an attack in short-term against Donald Trump, the idea being that they thought he might lose and they wanted to try to get it done before the U.S. election.Now, this is just one of multiple plots that, according to the FBI and according to the prosecutors in Manhattan, Shakeri Shaqiri was involved in. The biggest one was one where he was trying to coordinate the surveillance and an assassination o of a prominent critic of the Iranian regime, somebody -- her name is Mahsi Alinejad, and she has been the subject of plots by the Iranian regime over the number of years. Now, according to these documents, he reached out to a couple of people that he knew from serving time in prison in the United States. He was deported back a number of years ago. And they, over a period of months, followed Alinejad as she went to do speeches in Connecticut, as she came and went from her home. They have pictures of her -- the front door of her home in Brooklyn. No attack actually ever happened, but it gives you a sense of the level of planning that went into this. Now, according to these documents, Wolf, these plots went beyond Trump and Alinejad. They also were seeking to carry out an assassination against a couple of U.S. Jewish businessmen in New York, as well as trying to coordinate attacks on Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. That led to a number of warnings. Now, Wolf, this is obviously not the first time that Iran has been trying to carry out attacks against Trump or dissidents here in the United States. Of course, just this summer, there was a Pakistani man who was arrested for trying to find people who were going to be tasked with carrying out attacks on Trump and other officials, political figures here in the United States.

And then when it comes to America's national security, protecting our presidents, our former presidents, our candidates, we all as Americans speak with one voice and any nation that makes threats on them or tries this is going to face extraordinary repercussions.

We know parts of it, and I think what we know also, from what Speaker Pelosi is saying, is that these facts are going to come up, and we are going to learn an awful lot about lot about how the president of the United States was to a large extent, able to determine that Kamala Harris would be his chosen successor, as the candidate for president of the United States. It was not possible for there to be a real open convention, as Speaker Pelosi and others had hoped. At the same time, I think we need to focus right now on Donald Trump, because here we have someone who has been an enemy of democracy, in his first term as president of the United States, has become the ultimate beneficiary of democracy, in a free and fair election, in which there were no complaints from his people about interference at the polls or anything at this sort once the night went on and he told us how he is planning to govern, with instruments that are anti- democratic, the idea of rounding up millions of people from mass deportation, using the military to arrest and put on court-martial, his former chief of staff, his head of the joint chiefs of staff. He wants to see them court-martialed. He also wants to see the press, members of the press prosecuted, treason charges, brought against Speaker Pelosi, treason charges brought against Congressman Adam Schiff. If he really goes through with this, here we have one of the greatest coalitions that a president-elect has ever put together, and he has the chance to use that coalition for the good of the people of this country. He has a record in which he has never put the good of the people of this country ahead of his own interest. But he's got an opportunity to do it now and I think that's what we ought to be looking at. And Trump, indeed, was one of the first two -- you know, he understood this cover-up that was occurring about Joe Biden's condition, and it also helped him win.",
