So, this could be an opportunity for him to go face to face, address some of these issues that they believe are important to voters, things like abortion rights, things like issues relating to democracy.And really, what they are trying to do is create these scenarios where they can present a very vivid split screen with the former president as they continue to try to warn that he poses a direct to American democracy -- a direct threat to American democracy and American's freedoms.",

And, Arlette, I'm just looking at some new reporting coming in from our Kristen Holmes and MJ Lee saying that the president's announcement comes after informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates in recent weeks that largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission. This is according to three sources familiar with these discussions.So, it sounds as though we know that Former President Donald Trump, he's aired his grievances and his problems with the commission in the past. I mean, this has come up several times before. And I remember being at those debates. I was out there with you, Arlette, at a number of those back in 2020. He's no fan of the Presidential Debate Commission. Interesting that we're hearing the same, or sort of the same, from President Biden and his camp.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is. And there is a very detailed letter where Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, detailed to the Presidential Commission exact -- or the Commission on Presidential Debates exactly why the Biden campaign would not participate in the debates that they had set forth.One of the arguments is that they think that voters need to hear from both candidates much earlier in the process. Some of those debates that had been scheduled by the commission were set to take place when early voting has already started in the fall. But then, also, in that letter, O'Malley Dillon talks about the fact that some of these debates turned into entertainment spectacles with jeering and moments where the crowd would applaud or interject. And so, they're hoping that they might be able to narrow this down to just having the two candidates face off in front of a moderator, hoping that they can get into the issues that will be debated. Now, I think one thing that's also interesting to point out is that the Biden campaign has proposed that these debates should be hosted by a broadcast organization. One that hosted a GOP primary debate back in 2016 and another that also had hosted a debate between -- in the Democratic Primary in 2020. So, ensuring trying to basically make this argument that these broadcast organizations should not be up for debate with the candidates if they want how to debate with them in the past. So, we will see. That's a much more narrow list than is typical. So, we will see how exactly that turns out. But it's clear from Biden's campaign this morning is that so far, they have accepted an invitation from CNN for a June 27th debate. Now, the ball is in Trump's court and we'll see what the campaign has to say.",

Jeff, I want to go to you and ask you about this. This is all breaking in the last several minutes. What do you make of this? The president putting out there on social media that he's accepted this debate invitation from CNN. Throwing down the gauntlet, issuing this challenge to Donald Trump.

The conviction or acquittal, we do not know what the jury is going to do, but clearly the Biden campaign wants to have this debate right in the aftermath of this trial.But the former president, he has been leading the charge, saying any time, any place. He travels around to every rally he has, and he's not had that many, but a few, with a podium saying any time, any place. So, the Biden campaign is calling them on that. But the timing, absolutely, is interesting. And you wonder how many people will be actually focused and tuning into this presidential race in late June. It's a summertime, a busy time. But clearly, the Biden campaign is eager to have this side-by- side matchup here to ultimately make the case that they believe that they benefit from making this a referendum on Donald Trump not on the Biden policies here. So, a lot of strategy at play here. But the bottom line, it looks like there will be debates and there will be early debates before the vote begins.",

You know what, people need to see the contrast. And I'm afraid that, you know, not enough folks have really, you know, dialed into this election just yet. And the contrast could not be more sharp. You have one person who's going to bring character, that's President Biden, and one person who's going to bring corruption. You've got one person that's going to bring competence, that's President Biden, and you've got one person that's going to bring chaos, and that's President Trump. So, let's do it in June.

Sure, you may not like that Joe Biden is 81 years old, but there's a number that's a little bit higher than that, and that's the nearly 90 felony counts that Donald Trump faces in four different jurisdictions.

Of course, they debated two times back in 2020.But we're still waiting to learn some of the other details about what exactly this campaign will look like. I will say my colleague MJ Lee and I have heard from two Biden campaign sources who said that they had accepted an invitation for a debate that will take place in the studio at CNN's Atlanta offices. But we will see what else the details of this debate will look like. A bit earlier today, Former President Trump, for instance, told Fox News in a radio interview that he would be interested in a two -hour debates that involved podiums. The Biden campaign has also set out very specific details about what they want to see. For instance, the microphones can only be on when each candidate is expected to speak, potentially eliminating some of that very intense back and forth that we saw in the very first debate between Biden and Trump back in 2020. But then there's also questions about what the debates will look like going forward. So, the two men so far appear to have agreed to a debate on June 27th, just six weeks away. The Biden campaign had also proposed a debate in early September. That is something that the Trump campaign has said that they would also do. But we will see. What else we learn, obviously, there's very fast developments throughout the day on this front, but it's clear that these two men will be debating much earlier than it's typical in the process with that first debate appearing to be here on CNN in just six weeks.",
