That was something that House Republicans included in their debt ceiling bill that they passed in the House. And Speaker Kevin McCarthy said, it is a red line for him that it absolutely must be included in any deal that is negotiated with the White House. But Democrats say that's a nonstarter for them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Evan data point shows that and it helps people move forward. So the public wants it. Both parties want it. The idea that they want to put us into a default because they will not work with on that is ludicrous to me. SEN.

Of course, the White House wants a longer hike, Republicans pushing for a shorter. So all that to say, Jim, the two sides are so very far apart.

During a House hearing today, Michael Barr, the top banking regulator at the Federal Reserve, he admitted that bank supervisors, they failed to escalate problems that they identified at Silicon Valley Bank quickly enough or forcefully enough.And Barr said that he takes full responsibility for these failures at the Fed. But he declined to say whether anyone at the Fed would actually lose their jobs over this. Now, during the separate Senate hearing today, bank executives, they apologize for the harm caused by their bank failures. But they also tried to kind of shift some of the blame elsewhere, including on the Federal Reserve's war on inflation. Because remember, these bank failures, they happen after the Fed spiked interest rates. And as rates went up, the value of the bonds that banks were sitting on went down. And that caused massive losses, especially at Silicon Valley Bank. Lawmakers, they blasted Silicon Valley Bank for failing to hedge against this risk and minimize losses.

Silicon Valley Bank's CEO, he said that customers yanked $42 billion from that bank in the span of just 10 hours. He noted that amounted to a million dollars every second, just a staggering figure there that I think really puts an exclamation point here on just how fast these bank runs can happen in today's age of social media-fueled rumors and how easy it is to move money around on mobile banks and, of course, when the banks themselves are mismanaging the situation.

It won't comment on what it will do to replace this or if it can operate in part or what else it will bring in. And what we know is that Kyiv has been a hugely important target for Russia to hit with its missile systems, whatever they are, whether it's the drones or the cruise missiles or the Kinzhals that it fired there last night, the hypersonic missiles. And so it's been a huge priority target and therefore a huge priority place for the Ukrainians to defend, which they've done effectively. They did it before the Patriot system came in. They moved their systems around the country, depending on where the biggest threat is to troops and what their military operations are going to be.

Every now and then, like today, Lindsey Graham sounded typically Luddite-ish in his questions about trying to - and Sam was trying very hard to differentiate. But there's always one of those senators who does that.But in general, I have found lots and lots of senators and Congress people, whether it's Ken Buck from Colorado or Mark Warner or all kinds of senators, Sen. Bennett from Colorado, Sen. Klobuchar, there's all kinds of people who really do know what they're talking about and are capable of making the legislation. And then you hire people just like - that regulate - I mean, there's people in the FDA, there's people in the SEC and, again, not perfect, but they're there to protect consumers. And that should be, of course, the first order of business is protecting Americans of the possibilities, just like they do on other things.",

Wisdom would dictate that the Speaker of the House, he's not going to call for a vote if he doesn't believe that he's got the numbers here. So this call for a vote that didn't need to happen today could be a sign of confidence that they've got those numbers. However, having said all that, all eyes are definitely on two House Republican members who have remained silent up until now about which way they're going to vote. You mentioned Rep. Tricia Cotham. She did vote for Senate Bill 20, but she also has a lengthy history of here of advocating and campaigning for abortion access. She's the one that switched up until recently here from a Democrat over to Republican, gaining all those national headlines. Then we've also got Rep. Ted Davis, who was absent and was the only House Republican who did not vote for Senate Bill 20. Now we've pulled up some abortion numbers from the CDC, 94 percent of abortions in the state of North Carolina happened before 13 weeks of pregnancy. But the pushback here, Jim, on the bill goes beyond that. It goes to all of the paperwork and extra barriers that opponents say women and clinics will now be facing if this bill survives.",
