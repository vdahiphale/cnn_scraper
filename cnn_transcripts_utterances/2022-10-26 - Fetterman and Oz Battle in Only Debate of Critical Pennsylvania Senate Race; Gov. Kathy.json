And there are going to be voters who are trying to figure out some of what they saw last night. What can you share with us?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, certainly, I think it's very unusual for people to watch somebody recovering from a stroke in public. And for some people, it may be uncomfortable. And I think the reality is we have to understand, as I spoke to a stroke neurologist yesterday who put it very well and said that this is a road, not a destination when you're talking about recovery. And so he's about five months into his recovery at this point. We usually do see recovery in some cases up to 18 months. And, you know, what it appears that we're seeing is something called aphasia, which is trouble understanding language or speaking language, and that has to do with what part of the brain was affected by the stroke. And I think what we need to also be clear about is that the blood vessel that supplies the certain area of the brain that's associated with language, in many cases, that's that area of the brain. It's not affecting the motor function. It's not affecting cognitive function. And so I think we need to separate out these two thins. So, while somebody may have difficulty understanding or speaking, that does not necessarily translate into their ability to make decisions or to, you know, their intelligence level or anything having to do with their cognition. So, those are two separate things. In addition, I think there is a recurrent risk of stroke that we do need to be clear and honest about. We know that patients who had strokes can have strokes again. That's actually a risk factor. If their risk factors are definitely well controlled, that risk of recurrent stroke drops to less than 10 percent. If it's not, it can be in the teens. And, certainly, he also has atrial fibrillation, which is a condition -- a cardiac condition and arrhythmia that can lead to stroke, and it did, in his case, because he was not on blood thinners at the time, which can be protective. And patients who are on those blood thinners, again, you drop the risk of recurrent stroke by about a little over 50 percent. In addition, we learned from his cardiologist he has something called the cardiomyopathy, which is a weakened heart muscle and actually had a defibrillator placed while he was hospitalized. So, there are underlying health conditions, but I think at this point, if people are really assessing cognition, then that should be apparent in the way he is understanding and able to answer questions regardless of how the speech is happening.",

I've been an isolated loaner my entire life. This was the perfect storm for a mass shooter. That 19-year-old was among the three killed inside of this school on Monday.

I don't know how much firepower it would take to stop that person. You saw the police response, it was massive. It was overwhelming.

I didn't think that was right because she saw what we all saw last night from Jumpstreet. He had difficulty with every single one of his responses. I don't know if it was only in communicating. It may also have been in his thought process because he seemed confused. I mean, at the outset he wished everybody a good night. Now, the issue is, many people just want Senate control either for the Rs or for the Ds. So, they're willing to overlook Herschel Walker's dimwittedness in Georgia, those Republicans, who are nevertheless willing to vote for him because they want control. And in Pennsylvania, you may have Democrats who feel the same way about John Fetterman. Half of those who received a mail ballot in Pennsylvania have already voted, which is a shame. There should have been more debates. John Fetterman didn't want there to be debates. Now we see why he didn't want there to be debates. As a Pennsylvanian life long, I feel let down because I'm accustomed to there being two, maybe three debates and carried by major outlets, which last night wasn't.

But at the same time, Michael, one of the things that strikes me is this was the first time where we all really got to see for ourselves how John Fetterman is doing, right? There have been moments where he's had these interviews but they have been tightly controlled. We've seen the letter from his -- I think it's his G.P., who's talked to his other specialists, but the letter is not from his specialist, we have not seen the medical records.I guess my point is just we didn't know what we were really going to get until last night and I think it was different than what some people were expecting.",

I think that had John Fetterman been more forthcoming from the get-go, A, about the timing of the stroke, because there was a 48 or so hour time period, it was the final weekend of the primary where he didn't let us know he had a stroke, the underlying cardiomyopathy and the need for a defibrillator not revealed, the medical records have not been produced. I mean, I could go on and on and on. He's not been transparent. He's been opaque. His answer last night was to say, well, take look at me. Okay. Well, we took a look and our heart breaks for you but we're not comfortable, I think, is going to be the consensus.",

I mean, where do you think voters -- and, look, voters aren't a monolith, right, but a lot of people have experience with people in their lives recovering from strokes. I mean, where do you think the patient's level is going to be with voters thinking, yes, he might be in a better place in a couple months, maybe this isn't a cognitive thing and it really is just expressive?",
