You know, I -- whatever Biden did or didn't do, Trump has made clear that in all sorts of ways he intends to barrel through historic constraints on the arbitrary exercise of presidential power and that the vast majority of Republicans in Congress, virtually all of them, are going to be willing to go along for the ride. I, you know the idea that Biden pardoning his son in some ways changes the calculus of what Republicans will do is as nonsensical as the idea that Merrick Garland by waiting two years and the January 6 committee to begin investigating Trump's role in the insurrection somehow shamed Republicans into upholding norms. We are in a downward spiral here in this country. And one that I think reflects an important underlying reality, one party alone can't uphold the norms of democracy. You know, Joe Biden had reason to believe that if he didn't pardon his son, that the Trump Justice Department would find yet more reasons to go, you know, to pursue him. Did that justify the pardon?

I mean, the incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox last year, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the investigators will be investigated.I mean, Trump has been very clear about his determination to use the Justice Department to settle scores. And if anything, now that Biden has kind of thrown this rock through the window, now that the window is broken, should he go further and protect the public servants who, I think by all evidence, have tried to follow the facts in investigating Trump's behavior and now face the risk of selective prosecution once he takes office?
