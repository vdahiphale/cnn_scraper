VAUSEthe Gaza based political leader of Hamas who was assassinated early Wednesday on what appears to be an Israeli targeted killing. According to a spokesman for Hamas, Haniyeh was killed in a direct airstrike on his room inside a government guesthouse in Iran's capital. He was there for the inauguration of Iran's new president. And while Israel has not claimed responsibility, \"The New York Times\" quoting Iranian sources reports Iran's supreme leader has ordered a direct strike on Israel in retaliation. Haniyeh's assassination appears to be a stunning security failure by Iran and has triggered fears of greater turmoil across the region. In the hours after his death, huge crowds marched in protests in the West Bank, Istanbul, Tunis and other cities, and his assassination could also derail efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza. Haniyeh was a key player in those talks led by Qatar and Egypt. Qatar's prime minister asked the question, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention Haniyeh on Wednesday during a nationally televised address. He talked about Israel delivering a crushing blow to its enemies and said he won't give in to calls to end the war in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Citizens of Israel, challenging days lie ahead. Since the strike in Beirut, there are threats sounding from all directions. We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined against any threat.

And we've seen what a retaliation could look like when Israel or when Iran's territorial integrity as perceived by Iran as being -- as having been infringed upon by Israel.So there's the template going back to the April 13th strikes where Iran launched a massive attack using hundreds of UAVs and missiles at once against Israel. So we could very well see a repeat of that. Now if that happens, then Iran runs two risks. One being the risk of failure and losing face if that attack is widely perceived as being ineffective. Or the risk of catastrophic success, which is penetrating Israel. The air defenses landing too many the casualties and incurring a wider counter-retaliation, counter-escalation by Israel. Ultimately Iran is always having to walk this fine line of retaliating and responding because if it doesn't, not only does it lose its credibility and risk further emboldening additional Israeli action on its soil but if it retaliates too forcefully then obviously it risks prompting an all-out escalation and dragging the U.S. into the conflict, which is something Iran does not want.",

Ultimately, I think Israeli leaders are doing what they can at the moment with the knowledge that ultimately the United States will come to their defense.And so this creates a real moral hazard where the United States I think is really incapable or unwilling to hold the U.S. -- hold Israel, pardon, to account and since Israeli leaders know this and they know that ultimately the U.S. would come to their aid, I think they feel very comfortable taking large risks such as the assassination of the Hamas top political leader in Tehran, knowing very well, by the way, that this would certainly quash the chances of reaching a ceasefire deal, something that the U.S. has been pushing for because essentially there is no clearer way of rejecting a ceasefire negotiation than killing the chief negotiator of the party you're supposedly negotiating with.",

His death is likely to embolden the hardline faction of Hamas, which rules out of Gaza and which may be even less likely to make concessions that could be conducive to this deal.And I think it also sends a signal about Israel's intentions and is likely to convey the message to Hamas that Israel is not really serious about a ceasefire negotiated solution with the group and so I think that the killing of Haniyeh is unlikely for certain to have a positive impact.

Even then he slipped in a very misleading statement about Harris failing her law exam, and yes, the vice president did fail her bar exam on the first attempt, which is not only a common, she later passed, but this is what Trump does. He's unlike other presidential candidates. Whenever he talks, it's a fire hydrant gushing forth with lies, half-truths, and misleading statements.And really, as you found out, I guess, fact-checking in real time is impossible. So just that fact alone, was it mistake to invite him to appear in the first place?",

I got him on the record about taking the cognitive test, you know, in the future if he won the presidency and some other questions, most of them he did dodge, but we did get him on the record for some.

Live to Tehran now, where memorial services are underway for Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, assassinated while in the Iranian capital in the early hours of Wednesday morning.Iran's supreme leader is expected to lead prayers, that's according to state media. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says it's Iran's duty to avenge Haniyeh's death because he was killed on Iranian soil. Haniyeh is expected to be buried in Doha, Qatar on Friday. This targeted strike on Haniyeh has caused tremendous outrage across the region, raising fears of greater turmoil with protests already on the West Bank, in Iraq, as well as Pakistan. A spokesperson for Hamas says Haniyeh was hit directly by a single rocket which targeted his room in the government guesthouse where he was staying in Tehran. Hamas felt Israel would pay the price, calling it a heinous crime. Israel, though, has not directly claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu certainly alluded to it during a national televised address Wednesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Since the beginning of the war, I have made clear that we are in a fight against Iran's axis of evil. This is a war of existence against the stranglehold of terrorist armies and missiles that Iran wants to tighten around our necks. In the last few days, we have dealt crushing blows to each of them.
