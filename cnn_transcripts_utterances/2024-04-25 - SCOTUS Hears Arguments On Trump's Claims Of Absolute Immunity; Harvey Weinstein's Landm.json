Several justices even seeming open to some level of immunity, while others, not so much.

Well, today, David Pecker testified about a deal made with Playboy playmate, Karen McDougal, to kill her story of an affair that she alleges that she had with Donald Trump. He also outlined the involvement of Donald Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, along with Trump.Question, when Michael Cohen said, the boss will take care of it, what did you understand that to mean? That he -- that I would be either reimbursed by the Trump Organization or by Donald Trump. Pecker also said he assumed Trump was worried about stories impacting his campaign, not his family. Question, now, did he ever say anything that made you think that his concern about these stories getting out was for his family, rather than for his campaign? Pecker's answer, I thought it was for the campaign. We have a lot to talk about with CNN legal commentator and former Trump White House lawyer Jim Schultz, former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi, former January 6th Committee investigative counsel Marcus Childress, former assistant U.S. attorney and the author of the forthcoming book, \"Pardon Power,\" Kim Wehle, and former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh. So glad to have all of you, guys, here. All right, I want to ask you first about what took place in terms of the cross-examination here, Marcus, because there was a lot. I mean, this is not the Michael Cohen witness where everyone knows you're going to go after his credibility, the fact that he has different guilty pleas for false statements and beyond. This is David Pecker, a longtime friend who has immunity, who has a non-prosecution agreement. How did they do? MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL: Look, you're trying to chip away at this point on cross-examination. You're not going for a knockout blow. I mean, we've heard you talk about the jigsaw puzzle for the prosecution. On defense, you're just trying to chip away whether it will be putting more weight on Michael Cohen's testimony. So, saying, hey, if the president is going through Cohen to talk to you each time, if that's the case, now we're really relying on Michael Cohen's word of what Donald Trump was telling him. So, I think, here, you're not going to get a win, you're not going to get a knockout. You're just trying to chip away at the edges of what the prosecution is trying to prove that you can argue it in your closing argument.",

He says, I am not purchasing this story, I am not going to be involved with a porn star, as if suddenly this is a line he's going to draw. I am not a bank. And he says about Michael Cohen, Michael Cohen was really upset. He said that the boss would be furious at me and that I should go forward with purchasing it.

This started off as a Trump Justice Department U.S. attorney case. They had four brilliant prosecutors. I met with them with my client. So, it started in an SDNY. It's not a brag case.But I want to go to Hope Hicks. After the Access Hollywood tape, there was a flurry of communication between my client, Michael Cohen, and indirectly Hope Hicks, who was on the plane with Trump. And in those three weeks, Hope Hicks was conveying information from then-candidate Trump to Cohen. And you can guarantee it was all focused on how do we shut her up because it's going to affect the election. And that gets to what you said at the beginning, keep it simple, stupid. The false invoices are driven, and they are the seed and the result of affecting the election. The false invoices would not be made but for that deal.",

While some of his legal team spent the entire day in the courtroom in lower Manhattan, other lawyers were arguing before justices at the Supreme Court on Trump's claim of what he calls absolute immunity.Now, they were signaling today that they could very well send this case back to a lower court which, of course, would delay the special counsel's 2020 election subversion case. That was supposed to start back in March. It's almost May. But they also sounded skeptical about Trump's blanket immunity defense. Trump lawyer, John Sauer, argued that Trump's actions were official acts of the office. But in one exchange, the Trump appointed- justice, Amy Coney Barrett, questioned what exactly was an official act and what was a private act to benefit Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMY CONEY BARRETT, U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE (voice-over): Petitioner turned to a private attorney was willing to spread knowingly false claims of election fraud to spearhead his challenges to the election results. Private? SAUER (voice-over):  As alleged, I think we dispute the allegation but that sounds private to me. BARRETT (voice-over):  Sounds private. Petitioner conspired with another private attorney who caused the filing in court of a verification signed by petitioner that contained false allegations to support a challenge? SAUER (voice-over):  That also sounds private. BARRETT (voice-over):  Three private actors, two attorneys, including those mentioned above, and a political consultant helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding and petitioner and a co-conspirator attorney directed that effort. SAUER (voice-over): You read it quickly. I believe that's private. BARRETT (voice-over):  Yeah. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
