And yet, at the same time, he was trying to pull back saying that he had the First Amendment right to make those falsehoods.So, the damages calculation is going to go to two things. First, whether there's really all - the out of pocket kind of damages, the real reputation was being hard, they suffered problems, security maybe, even emotional distress that requires counselling. And then there's going to be the aspect of punitive damages. And that's where the really heavy hit could come for Giuliani, meant to deter his bad conduct. And the problem for him at the moment is, he's not really arguing like it was an honest mistake or anything like that. He's saying he had a right - basically he's admitting he lied and he's saying, I had a right to lie. So, I think the damages could be pretty bad for him.",

There have been firemen on the scene trying to save people in the early hours and then recover bodies. Bodies strewn on the streets in bags with forensic teams trying to identify them.

      "sentences": "Boris, because it's been an issue of utmost important, not just for New York City Mayor Erica Adams, but also for New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, who time and time again have made clear their main strategy to all of this, to bring some relief amid this migrant crisis, which is the sooner that some of these asylum seekers have the ability to legally work in the United States, then the sooner they will have a source of steady wages that can potentially allow them to pay their way out of shelters and into more long term, permanent housing.You mentioned that key number just now, nearly 60,000 of these -- well over 100,000 asylum seekers are still in the city's care. And that is what's straining those resources. So, I think what we hear today here downtown will be Mayor Adams basically repeating much of that call. But perhaps even increasing a sense of urgency. In fact, the location of this rally alone is certainly noteworthy downtown. Just across the street from the federal building that typically processes many of these asylum applications. So, a source close to the planning telling me that this is quite intentional. They hope to bring that message directly to the federal government to further amplify what they're saying. And, Boris, this is important. You know, aside from what we've heard from many of the politicians involved in this, I have heard from these asylum seekers, as myself and my colleagues have been covering this for the last 18 months, that work authorization (INAUDIBLE) and keeping those asylum seekers from supporting themselves. So, you hear over and over again from officials at the local and state level that this would bring an incredible amount of relief. Now we should mention what we've heard from the federal government as early - recent as earlier this week. The head of the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, responding to that call about work authorizations and, to a certain extent, recognizing that this is an issue that could potentially help, but essentially saying that they are doing the best they can. Nonetheless, the secretary recognizing that they will likely do more in terms of increasing man power and technology resources at the federal level to try to expedite those asylum applications as soon as possible, Boris, because I'll leave you with this. You know, I've been in touch with one particular asylum seeker out of - out of many, following his case, and he just now had an opportunity to petition for asylum and he is still waiting for that work authorization application that already has kept him waiting for well over a month.

The PCE Index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, revealed that prices increasing 3.3 percent on an annual basis, 0.2 percent on a monthly basis. Also, first time jobless claims ticked down last week to 228,000. That's according to the latest weekly report from the Labor Department. The mayor of Uvalde, Texas, is calling for District Attorney Christina Mitchell to resign. He also filed a lawsuit accusing her of repeatedly blocking the city's investigation into the Robb Elementary School massacre last year. Mitchell is leading the criminal investigation into the shooting and says that she plans to present evidence by the end of the year. But the mayor, Don McLaughlin, claims that she refuses to share evidence with the city's investigator. And classes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are expected to resume today. That's after Monday's shooting left a faculty member dead. Students held a candlelight vigil Wednesday to mourn beloved science professor Zijie Yan, Dr. Zijie Yan, who was shot and killed on campus by a graduate student. That suspect has been charged with first-degree murder and having a gun on campus. He has not entered a plea and is being held without bond. Boris.",
