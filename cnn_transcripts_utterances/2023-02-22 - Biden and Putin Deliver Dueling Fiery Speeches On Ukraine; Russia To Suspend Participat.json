The announcement came Tuesday during his delayed State of the Nation Address in Moscow. Just hours later though, Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement saying the decision is reversible. Still, there are concerns the era of formal arms control may be coming to an end.During his speech, which was scheduled for December but postponed because of Russian losses in Ukraine. Putin repeated many of his unfounded false claims about Ukraine, including an accusation, the West is to blame for escalating the conflict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSINA PRESIDENT (through translator): They're responsible for the escalation of the situation in Ukraine for the huge numbers of casualties. And of course, the Kyiv regime is essentially alien to the people of Ukraine. They are not protecting their own interests, but those of their minder countries. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This obviously continues. The theme that we're seeing from Russia, President Putin announcing in December that money was no object. When it comes to the military, they can have everything they asked for he said, and not the first time we've seen Russia test an ICBM of ballistic missile.Since the start of the war in Ukraine, they carried out a successful test of the same type of missile, the Sarmat known in the West as the Satan 2 which is capable of delivering nuclear warheads. They carried that out in April, and it was successful. They are, you know, trying to show off amid the defeats on the battlefield and the struggles on the battlefield in Ukraine. The strength of their armed forces and nuclear saber rattling has really become one of the talking points President Putin has many speeches, including the hour and 45 minutes that he spent delivering his State of the Nation on Tuesday. So I think it can be viewed in that context. Obviously, the suspension of the New START treaty is concerning to the west, but does of course continue with basically the status quo because Russia was not allowing inspections to happen anyway. And the Russian foreign ministry has said that that decision could be irreversible. So they continue to dangle this but without really any sort of concrete steps beyond what we've already seen.",

I think for many years, access to digital payments has been something that has been really exclusive to the few, particularly larger businesses.But with technology like Yoco's technology, anyone can get access to the basics of digital payment. And this gives small businesses a digital footprints for the first time and allows them to really grow. Hi. My name is Matt Brownell. I'm the VP of commercial of Yoco. Yoco is an African technology company, what we really do is we make access to digital payments simple for small businesses throughout South Africa. The concept of Yoco really began more than ten years ago when our founder and CEO Katlego Maphai was on holiday in the United States and came across a little hole in the wall eatery, that when he went to pay for his hamburger was really surprised that they could offer a card payment service. This was done through a little plug-in on a mobile phone and he looked at that and having had a lot of experience in the software and market in the African continent, just ask the simple question of why does this not exist in Africa and in South Africa? I think the biggest achievement is simply moving from position of completely brand-new product, brand-new category, to a position now where we really are the market leader within the space and we provide services literally every single day to hundreds of thousands of small business owners. 80 percent of them had never utilized card services before they came across Yoco. We believe that small business owners should really just be able to get on with what they love, the passion of their businesses and grow their businesses and not let the basics of technology get in the way of that. So for us, we are really in the process of developing a full ecosystem of products and therefore we can look forward to a consistent release of products that solve those problems for small business owners. We do also look for the first time to expand beyond the South African borders and are looking at a number of countries on the African continent that we believe are ready for services like Yoco.

Not as strong as it made landfall at Madagascar, but still strong enough to do some damage once again. So the winds will stay fairly strong as it hits the coastline, it will once again weaken. But the heavier rains are going to be one of the bigger concerns once again. So you will see the yellows and the red starting to fire up as it pushes on to the coastline of Mozambique. These areas can pick up roughly 100 to hundred and 50 millimeters of rain over the next three days time. Now isolated higher amounts are possible as it moves towards South Africa, but again this is an uncommon situation for Madagascar to be dealing with. On average they get one tropical cyclone. Take a look over the last year. 2022, they had six named storms. So quite an uneasy situation for them, John.",
