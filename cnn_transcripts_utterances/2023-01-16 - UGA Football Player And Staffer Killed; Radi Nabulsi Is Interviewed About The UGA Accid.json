And then take a look at all (INAUDIBLE) the trees and continuing down this slope, down this small hill and the car coming to a rest and striking this edge of this apartment complex. Willock and LeCroy, they died from their injuries. And this crash happening -- making this even worse, John, happening just hours before that crash the team was out in Athens, happy, celebrating, cheering on with fans, with students, celebrating their massive national championship victory, making all of this just even worse. New this morning, I have confirmed with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department the identity of that fourth and final person inside of the car. Her name is Victoria Bowles.

It's been a devastating thing because you go from the highest to the highs. Georgia had not had a national title celebration in 41 years until last year. Then they had a back to back celebration that all day Saturday the entire community. And you would think that maybe after having won one previously that the excitement for a second one would be lesser. It was actually greater. The streets were filled with people. And just the absolute high that everybody was feeling, guys declaring for the NFL, everyone cheering, everyone very excited about next year's team just as well. And then to have this - when we broke the news first thing in the morning about Tory and Chandler and Willock. Devin Willock is one of the most beloved players on the entire team, you know. There's players from other schools who were recruited by Georgia, who were talking about Chandler LeCroy and Tory Bowles and Warren McClendon was also one of those beloved players on the team. So, it's just an absolute gut punch to this community.",

But Devin Willock, I mean, this was a guy who was letting little kids try on his national championship ring 12 hours before his untimely demise. And this is a - think about his poor mother. She lost her -- an older son the same way, at the same age, in a car crash. So, she's been doubly afflicted by this. But when you talk to people in the community - and it's not to say that you wish it would happen to anybody else, but almost everyone says, why Devin.

We got over it, right? They did finally raise the debt ceiling. I they - I think they learned from it because they kept raising the debt ceiling without too much trouble after that. 2013, there was another little hiccup there. You could shut the government down easily by not raising the debt ceiling. Again, these are all self-inflicted wounds at a time when there are a lot of very, you know, very troublesome signals and cross currents in the global economy.

But the CDC scientists had this huge task in front of them. They looked at deaths in the United States and said, how many are attributable to excess alcohol consumption. So, everything from drunk driving accidents, where, obviously, being drunk plays a huge role, or alcohol plays a huge role, to things like cancer and heart disease, where they play a role but less so. So, they tabulated all of that up and here's what they came up with. They said, when you look at deaths of people ages 20 to 49, one in five deaths could be attributed to excess alcohol consumption. When you look at ages 20 through 64, one in eight deaths could be attributed to alcohol consumption. Now, the CDC is not saying that you shouldn't drink, they're just pointing out that there's something called drinking in moderation. So, let's take a look at what the CDC defined as drinking in moderation. For men that's no more than two glasses of alcohol a day, like a beer or a glass of wine, et cetera. For women it is no more than one a day. And, by the way, I want to note that you can't, you know, sort of add those up. You can't abstain all week and then have seven drinks on a Saturday night. That's called binge drinking. And that's bad for all sorts of other reasons. John. BERMAN: Yes, that moderate list there is actually reasonably generous, two drinks a day.",

One, if you don't want to drink, that's terrific. If you don't drink now, don't start thinking somehow it might be healthy for you. No, just keep not drinking.
