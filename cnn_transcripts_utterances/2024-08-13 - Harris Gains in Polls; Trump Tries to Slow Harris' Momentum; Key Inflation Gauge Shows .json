I showed you the Ipsos polling. All of which that showed Kamala Harris with clear momentum, enthusiasm potentially on her side.But I just want to take a step back and sort of point out, we've kind of been here before. So, August 13th, how far were the polls off in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And this is in 2016 and 2020. Trump was estimated both times around and by significant margins. Take a look here, in 2016, the average poll in those states that I mentioned, those Great Lake battleground states, Trump was underestimated by nine points on average at this point in 2016. How about 2020? It wasn't a one-off. Look at this, he was underestimated by five points on average. And, of course, Kamala Harris' advantage in those \"New York Times,\" Sienna College polls were four points in each of these key battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The bottom line is this. If you have any idea, if you're a Kamala Harris fan and you want to rip open the champagne bottle, pop that cork, do not do it. Donald Trump is very much in this race. If we have a polling shift, like we've seen in prior years from now until the final result, Donald Trump would actually win. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I am saying that he is very much in this ballgame based upon where he is right now. And compare that to where he was in prior years.",

So, combined, you're getting close to $200 million over the next three weeks in an effort to define Vice President Harris, in an effort to define her running mate, Governor Walz. Early voting will start in September. You just saw with Harry Enten how close the poll numbers are despite the fact that Vice President Harris does have a national lead.If you take into account the numbers from 2016 and 2020 where Donald Trump appeared to be further behind than he actually was. If you take into the 9 points from 2016 to 5 points from 2020, then you actually see a race that's either dead even or at least with Trump a point ahead.

People are not accepting Dobbs, especially the women of America. And, by the way, there are many guys who like women and who do also want to restore Roe versus Wade.This is a huge issue for Kamala Harris and the Democrats. And so, yes, it's going to - it's going to move voters in Arizona. It's going to move voters - because, listen to what Kamala Harris is saying. She's got a new ad out too and she says, I want the same abortion rights in every state. I want the - she wants to go back to Roe versus Wade, where every state had to have the same essential abortion laws. That is a really powerful driver because the problem over abortion for democrats is, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania all had Democratic governors who have pledged to veto any restrictions on abortion. So, when Kamala Harris says, Trump and Project 2025 wants to eliminate abortion rights in all states. I want to enshrine them in all states. Now, you're giving voters, not only in Arizona where it's on the ballot, but in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, where it's not, you're giving them a reason to go and vote pro-choice.",

It's why you've seen the former president attempting to moderate his stance and what a state should vote on the issue.

During a meeting with his top officials, Putin vowed a strong response to the Ukrainian ground operation into Russia's Kursk region.There's new video also out this morning of what is happening there and what's happened. A warning, the video you're about to see is graphic. It's video from a Russian soldier's body camera. And as he's walking, showing a trail of dead bodies near the Kursk border with Ukraine. Joining me now is CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Army Major General Spider Marks. It's good to see you, Spider. Thanks for being here. So, two years into this stalemate. This is a new tactic for Ukraine. Ukraine's own forces marching miles across the border in this surprise operation. And it's been going on for a week now. What do you think of this as a tactic, and what - and what do you think they've accomplished? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Kate, what I - what you're really seeing right now is a capability that Ukrainians have demonstrated in the past but on Ukrainian soil. They - they did some significant flanking operations and tactical engagements in the vicinity of Kharkiv and have made that battle where the Russians have just again fallen on their face, a great success for Ukraine. So, what Ukraine now is doing is taking a page from that experience and linking it into a greater operation into Russia. Now, the difficulty with that is that if those operations, both in Kharkiv by the Ukrainians and now this Ukrainian flanking operation in the vicinity of Kursk, are not connected in some way. If there's a gap, that's a gap that can be exploited by the Russians. But let's be frank, the Russians have demonstrated zero capacity to detect those kinds of openings, and then to exploit them. They haven't been able to do that. So, I would say what we're seeing right now, tremendous success on the part of the Ukrainians. What remains to be seen is whether they intend to remain, to build up, to pour more forces in if they think they can take forces from elsewhere and reinforced this success, or if this is simply an opportunity to demonstrate the vulnerability and the inability of the Russian forces.",

There has to be - there have to have been a calculation that this operation will do more than just simply bolster the morale of the Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian people, which it certainly is. But there has to be a connection between this operation and success elsewhere. You don't want to put yourself at increased risk where you're engaged with Russian forces.And again, Kate, the Russians have been able to poor young men into this fight with a level of certainty that they're not going to do well, but the law of large numbers gives them that advantage. So, if the Russians continue to do that and revert back to the way of Russian war, which is just to continue to lob artillery at infrastructure irrespective of the tactical conditions on the ground, that's going to be very difficult for Ukraine to sustain this operation and make sure it's tied in. I mean that's - that's what we're seeing right now. I would imagine that the Ukrainians are going to take advantage of this. Watch the Russian try - Russian forces try to reinforce in some way, which, as I've said, have - up to date have not been able to do that. And if they can start to build, Russian forces can begin to threaten that flank of the Ukrainian forces, then they can do a retreat back into Ukraine. I would expect that that might happen because Ukraine is going to reach a culminating point. All operations like this culminate you run out of drones, you run out of fuel, you run out of ammunition, those kinds of legitimate considerations have to be brought to the surface. (INAUDIBLE).",
