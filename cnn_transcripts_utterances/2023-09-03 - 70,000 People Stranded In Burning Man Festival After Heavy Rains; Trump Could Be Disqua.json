What is an insurrection or rebellion? What is giving aid or comfort? So, all of that has really never been answered before and it's never been answered by the courts.

There's a decision about who gets on the primary ballot that will be made this fall in most states, that there'll no be a secondary decision point if indeed this candidate is nominated by the Republican Party next summer. And so, we also, you know, are seeing this unveil or evolve at the same time these court proceedings are also evolving. So, all of it is, has lots of variables, lots of moving pieces, but it requires us to take a serious -- put serious attention into it, and that's what we're doing.

If a court were to rule someone ineligible, how does that impact the printing of the ballots and all these other details we have to consider. So, it's a tight timeline, and that's why we really need the courts to engage and resolve this for all of us sooner rather than later. And so, I think you can anticipate you'll see a lot of things happen over the next several months on this, with all of us recognizing that we may go through this a second time as court cases play out, as perhaps convictions get handled down, and perhaps is there a primary nomination process next summer through the conventions that we have to have an eye on as well.",

So, to answer your question, will this affect the military itself? I don't think so in terms of the fighting forces. I had a conversation with a group of soldiers in 2016 that had just come back from the Donbas and they told me that was their biggest concern, that their generals and their colonels were corrupt. I don't think we see that anymore in the Ukrainian military. They are fighting hard.

Democrats closed last summer investing in domestic manufacturing, empowering Medicare, negotiate drug prices, passing the biggest, boldest climate change in clean energy legislation in history. Fast forward one year, Republicans are threatening to shut down the government, really just to protect Donald Trump from accountability. It's shameful.
