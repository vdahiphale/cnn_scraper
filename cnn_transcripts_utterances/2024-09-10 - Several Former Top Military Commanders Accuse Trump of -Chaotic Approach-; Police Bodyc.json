Donald Trump is a draft dodger who has attacked Gold Star families and POWs, who has called the war dead losers and suckers. This is an individual who does not understand national security, which is why his former vice president, former defense secretary, former national security adviser, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs have all said he should not be commander-in-chief. And he owns the failure of -- he is the one who has a failed Afghanistan policy. He is the one. Because he was out negotiated by the Taliban in Doha.

Osama bin Laden is dead. But then it morphed under four different presidents into a counterinsurgency operation in Afghanistan. That was really a nation building exercise. And Joe Biden was the first U.S. president to have the moral courage to tell the American people, we have to focus on strategic priorities elsewhere. We cannot construct an Afghan nation without the support of Afghan leadership in Kabul, and he deserves credit for that decision.",

She will absolutely neutralize any terrorist target in Afghanistan if necessary to keep the American people safe.Contrast that with Donald Trump. Donald Trump would have tens of thousands of American troops right now fighting in Afghanistan. I want to be very clear about this, Jim. They're claiming that somehow, they would have had a couple of thousands of American troops in Bagram Air Force Base. No, that's not true. The Taliban were coming one way or the other in 2021, and a U.S. president would have had to make the decision, do we pack up and say that the counterinsurgency mission cannot succeed absent political partnership, or do we surge more American troops and duke it out with the Taliban?
