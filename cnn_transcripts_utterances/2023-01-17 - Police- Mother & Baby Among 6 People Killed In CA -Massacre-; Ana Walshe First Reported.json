According to police logs just obtained by CNN, it was Ana Walshe's employer and not her husband who reported her missing. CNN's Jason Carroll has been digging on this. And he joins us now from Cohasset, Massachusetts. Another piece of evidence here that doesn't look so good, right? Brian Walshe has, at this point, still been charged with misleading statement, nothing in connection with anything that may have happened to Ana Walshe?",

Which is basically that what happened is her place where she worked, where she was employed in Washington, D.C., the real estate firm, the head of security was the one who called the Cohasset police and said that she was missing, not her husband. And so that's just another question in a case where there have been so many questions about his behavior and some of the things he's been accused of doing. These, of course, will be part of the prosecution's case as they move forward. The question now being, what's the prosecution going to do next? And there are really two options. They could, one, file a formal complaint with the district court on various charges if they have the evidence that they need. Or, two, they could wait for the grand jury to indict. So we're still waiting to see what the prosecution's next move is going to be. Also waiting for test results, waiting to see if we're going to hear about those. As you know, they have put out some tests on the hacksaw that was recovered from that trash facility. Also on the bloodstains in the basement of the home. So waiting for test results. Also waiting to hear what the prosecution's move will be next -- Erica?",

China's population shrank last year, the first time this has happened in more than 60 years, a decline of about 850,000 people.Let's break this down and look at some of the reasons why. First, priorities are changing. We're getting married later and some young people are not having children at all. In addition, Beijing held a controversial one-child position until 2015. But it was relaxed because of concerns about the population. In 2021, three children were then allowed and a plan was released to strengthen maternity leave and offer tax deductions. In addition to all of this, the cost of living in China is high. So is education. And then there's just general economic uncertainty. That can all impact decision-making. So what are the takeaways from this? The United Nations is predicting India will surpass China to become the most populated country this year. And then there are the economic implications. This means an aging workforce without a pipeline into the future. That could impact productivity and, in turn, economic success. Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has raised these demographic challenges, saying boosting birth rates and addressing the cost of raising a child will be part of future policy.

And so for anyone who is still weighing the risk and benefits, this is really a lot of data to support, again, the value of getting vaccinated at any point during the pregnancy.Actually the CDC, the ACOG, American College of Ob/Gyns, the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine are all groups that really are pushing for women to get vaccinated, if they're pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, to treat women for COVID if they develop it during pregnancy. And also important to note, pregnant women pass on antibodies to the baby, babies who cannot get vaccinated until six months. So providing protection as well during that early period of life. And there's about zero countries, a little more than 80 now that don't push recommendations or have that for a vaccination for pregnant women. So this is really eye-opening and important to get that out. And in this country, about 72 percent of women who are pregnant have gotten that first series of vaccination, only 19 percent who got the updated booster.",

That deadline was looming for over a year.The two communities may share the same zip code but Rio Verde are not Scottsdale residents. Rio Verde is an unincorporated community on the outskirts of Scottsdale. So that means residents don't pay city taxes or get city services like water. Many used to see it as a plus, less government interference. But that was until the wells began to dry up. A lot of the homeowners have been relying on hauled water, which, until January 1, was purchased from Scottsdale. When drought conditions forced the federal government to declare a shortage in the Colorado River, reducing how much water Arizona and other states could use, Scottsdale decided to cut off water deliveries to outside communities to meet its own residents' needs. So Rio Verde residents did have more than a year to come up with a solution but neighbors and politicians could not agree on one.",

I mean, how much is all of this coming into play in some of these decisions to allow different areas to go forward with development? SARAH PORTER, DIRECTOR, KYLE CENTER FOR WATER POLICY, ARIZONA STATE'S MORRISON INSTITUTE: Well, fortunately, places like Las Vegas and other places that rely on the Colorado River water, have rules that require long-term water supplies before new housing development cans be built. The problems that we're seeing with Rio Verde is that this is a community that slipped in through a loophole in the rules. There's no question that we're seeing bigger and bigger challenges with the Colorado River water supply, and that is going to have an impact.
