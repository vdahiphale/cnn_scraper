You got to get serious about putting in measures that are going to secure that border so that you funnel people to legal points of entry. And that you're able to vet them. Were able to check them out, so we understand who's coming into our front door to this country. And if you don't do that -- and you really need to do that first and foremost.

White House officials maintaining the president is going to continue to hold the position that there will be no negotiations over raising or suspending the debt ceiling. There'll be no conditions. There'll be no spending cuts attached to it. It must be clean. And Republicans have already passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling that includes dramatic spending cuts. Saying to some degree, that's the floor of a negotiation that at some point is nonexistent. The president did make one move. Called all four congressional leaders, invited them to the White House on May 9. Making it clear that this is what they are going to discuss. But up through lenses that Republicans have said works for them. The president will once again hammer home the reality that he is not willing to negotiate the debt ceiling. More than happy to have a longer-term discussion about fiscal and spending priorities. How to actually address a debt that's above $31 trillion.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad saying that they -- said that confrontation has ended. The Israeli military not necessarily calling it a ceasefire because they say they will have no cease-fire with militants in Gaza. Then said messages have been exchanged.And there is an understanding that this latest rather intense round of fighting is over at least for now. But what we know overnight is that at least 100 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. The Israeli military responding with at least two rounds of airstrikes where they say both military jets and helicopters were used. The Israeli military saying that they targeted 16 sites that they said belong to Hamas. They say they used everything from weapons manufacturing sites to underground tunnels. Now in terms of casualties, we did just learn in the last couple of hours that one Palestinian man in his 50s was killed in one of those airstrikes and at least five others were injured. That's according to the health ministry in Gaza. In Israel yesterday at least three people were injured by rocket shrapnel, one of them a man in his 20s suffered serious injuries as a result of this shrapnel. It goes to show you how intense -- it was short but it was rather intense round of fighting between the militants in Gaza and Israel. One interesting thing to note though, is it does seem as though while Hamas was involved and while Hamas was the main target from the Israeli military, this was really being led by Islamic Jihad. And that's because of course, Khader Adnan, as you know was a leader in Islamic Jihad. He died yesterday as a result of a more than 86-day long hunger strike while he was being held in an Israeli prison. Khader Adnan may not be well known around the world but here in this region he became really the face of Palestinian resistance and of Palestinian prisoners. He had been imprisoned by Israel at least ten times since the early 2000s. And this was not his sixth hunger strike. It was actually his sixth hunger strike. But he was found dead in his cell yesterday morning. The Israeli prison authorities saying that he had been refusing medical care.

He is traveling with a high-level delegation. They will be meeting as well as with President Bashir al-Assad, with other Syrian officials. And as well taking time during the two-day visit to meet with Iranian and Syrian businessmen currently in Syria as well as visiting some religious sites in the country. And of course, the backdrop of all this is very interesting. This is happening as Syria essentially moves out of what has been a prolonged state of isolation from its regional neighbors, the Arab state gradually building -- rebuilding those relations with the Syrian government. We've also seen Iran, of course, strengthening its relations with its Arab neighbors. Just in March we saw a significant deal between struct between Saudi Arabia and Iran, reestablishing those relations there. So, this is a hugely significant development and it is the first time that we have seen an Iranian president visiting the country in over a decade.",
