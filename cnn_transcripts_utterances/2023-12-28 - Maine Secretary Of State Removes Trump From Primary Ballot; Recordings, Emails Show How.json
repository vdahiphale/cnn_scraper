      "sentences": "And tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.Donald Trump has just been disqualified, from the primary ballot, in the State of Maine, making it the second state, to remove him, because of his role, on January 6th. Also, CNN obtaining exclusive new recordings that show just how frantic, that effort, to carry out the fake electors' scheme really was, just days before that Capitol attack, almost chartering a private jet, to fly copies of bogus ballots that were stuck in the mail. Also, Nikki Haley now says, of course slavery caused the Civil War. That was not her answer, last night. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. History has been made, once again tonight, not the kind that Donald Trump wants, as he has now been disqualified, from the primary ballot, in Maine. A decision that comes nine days, after Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is ineligible to be on that state's ballot, because of his role in the January 6th insurrection, therefore barring him, under the 14th Amendment, of the Constitution. Here it is, in black and white, from Maine's Democratic Secretary of State, Shenna Bellows, who said that he was, quote, \"Not qualified to hold the Office of the President.\" This is a ruling from the state's top election official, not a court, I should note. She has already paused her decision, for 20 days, in case there is an appeal, which the Trump legal team says tonight that there will be, in the coming days. They had tried to get Bellows removed, actually, from making this decision, earlier this week, citing her social media posts. But she says she didn't make this decision lightly. Quote, \"I am mindful that no Secretary of State has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section Three of the 14th Amendment. I am also mindful, however, that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in insurrection.\" Moments ago, she explained her decision, here on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHENNA BELLOWS, (D) MAINE SECRETARY OF STATE: The oath I swore, uphold the Constitution, comes first and foremost. The weight of the evidence brought forward, under Maine law, in the Section 336 challenge that was brought made it clear that Mr. Trump was aware of the tinder he laid, in a multi-month efforts, to challenge the legitimacy of the 2020 election. And then, in an unprecedented and tragic series of events, chose to light a match. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why we're seeing this variation, with Colorado, and now Maine, on one side, and other states disagreeing. It's about the power. That's unique to the states. But her second major holding is not. And it has national implications. That is that the 14th Amendment bars a presidential candidate, who engaged in insurrection. I think that's correct. And the majority of commentators agree with that reading, including extremely conservative commentators. The third question is a factual one. And the most explosive of them all. She finds that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection, under the 14th Amendment. And she relies on the January 6 committee hearings. And there is a powerful factual basis for that as well. It's a historic opinion by Secretary Bellows.",

But this is not a question, for Norm Eisen, or Elliot Williams, to be sorting out here. This is teed up, right now, for the Supreme Court, because there are really open very serious legal questions, to be answered here, that frankly, the Framers of the country, a couple hundred years ago, just left open, and didn't answer. Number one, who decides what an insurrection is, or even what the definition of insurrection is? And so, again, this is powerfully written prose, in this opinion. But she's largely relying on the opinion of a law professor, to lay out what the definition of insurrection is, number one. Number two, do you need to be committed of the crime of insurrection, in order to be barred from the ballot? Now, again, I would say no, based on what I've read my understanding of it. But that's for the United States Supreme Court to decide. And then number three, what do you do, when different states now have vastly different notions, of what is defined, under the definition or under an umbrella of insurrection? So, all of these very complex constitutional questions still have to be sorted out. And this is, as we know well, not the final word on it. And it just it's sort of Supreme Court, are you listening?

The first is that the extraordinary moment that we're in, that the leading candidate, of one of the major political parties, has been found, by the January 6 committee, by the Colorado courts, including the Colorado Supreme Court, now by the Maine's Secretary of State, to have participated, in an insurrection, against our government. That's extraordinary. And there's a lot of detail, this section of the opinion, is 10 pages long, a lot of detail on why.

One common theme we often saw, in talking to, especially high-level Trump campaign folks, this idea that there were the crazies and the normies, short for like normal. And that was repeated again and again. And this refrain that Chesebro talks about, this idea that the normies backed off, and Giuliani and others, the crazies, came in and took over? That was a repeated theme that we were told. And I think what's interesting about the emails today is that it really counters that. Matt Morgan, who's puts himself out there, at least with the committee, he is traditional lawyer, one of the normies. But here, these emails are saying, right up until the eve of January 6, he was still taking actions, and getting involved, and ensuring that these fake electors were able to get themselves, the certificates to D.C., which was essential for this plan.

Because within the Republican Party, looking backward at slavery, and so on, has become an issue. And she didn't want to offend the base, by engaging in that discussion. So, she took this sort of circumlocution around it. But what it does is it raises questions, about her principles, and how fixed she is, in her principles. And it kind of exposes her as a shapeshifting politician. I think this is -- gaffes only hurt you, when they expose something that is real. The Hillary Clinton gaffe, about \"Basket of deplorables\" said to the people, in rural America, and small-town America that she disdains. So, when Mitt Romney said that his \"47 percent\" thing, back in 2012, it said to people, who were struggling that he didn't really care about them. And so, this has the potential to really hurt her, especially at a time, when she is trying to rally the anti-Trump base.
