      "sentences": "This is ISA SOARES TONIGHT, I am Richard Quest in for Isa, and you're most welcome. The suspect gunman inthe apparent assassination attempt on former President Trump has now been charged with two gun counts. I'll have the details of that. Donald Trump is blaming the incident on Vice President Harris and the President, saying they're fueling political violence. Meanwhile, President Biden says the Secret Service needs more help to ensure safety, and has said, there's no place for political violence in America. TikTok, TikTok is TikToking. The social media giant is now head-to-head with the U.S. government, as part of their appeal in federal appeals court. The app on what's likely to happen. We'll discuss that in the course of this program. Let's start though with new information about the suspected targeting of Donald Trump on Sunday in Florida. I want to show you the body-cam footage -- here you are from the arrest of Ryan Routh as you can see him there. Now, according to officials, a Secret Service agent spotted Routh with a rifle a few 100 feet from where the former President was playing golf at his golf course. In the criminal complaint that's now been laid, the agents later found a loaded rifle, a variant of an AK-47, and we're going to get a press conference from the Secret Service in a couple of hours, which we'll have more details. In court, Routh was charged with two federal gun counts, he will remain in custody for now, and he'll make a further appearance in court next week. A few moments ago, President Biden gave his assessment and spoke about the incident when he also said there's no place for political violence in America. We seem to have a momentary problem there. That was the President, and the President also said no place for political violence, he made it clear that was an absolute -- and there was no question. And then he did say that we will look at the question of Secret Service and whether they have the necessary resources to protect the former President. Donald Trump is now blaming President Biden and Vice President Harris for the events in the attempted assassination, saying it was their rhetoric to help fuel political violence directed towards him. Trump has called the President and Vice President the real threat when he was giving an interview to \"Fox News\". The former President accused them of using highly inflammatory language, something that he claims he doesn't do. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach. Kristen is with me now, gosh, it is very difficult to sort all this out, isn't it? I mean, on the one hand, you have the actual events of the day yesterday, and now you have the President -- no, the former President claiming it's actually Biden-Harris that are the ones that are being inflammatory. Please, sort it out.",

I mean, one of the things to keep in mind here is that yes, there was an advanced team on theground that saw this rifle and was able to stop a potential attack. Again this appearance of another assassination attempt, and yes, they are celebrating the fact that Secret Service engaged. Remember, one of the biggest things that we saw in Butler was they were angry Secret Service didn't engage with the gunman before shots were fired. That was not the case here. But as you noted, there are a lot of complications with the fact that he is not a sitting President, he doesn't have the built-in apparatus. For example, we know that there are golf courses like it's in -- excuse me, Andrews Air Force Base outside of D.C., that are completely locked down. Donald Trump doesn't go to those golf courses, he goes to his own courses. He is not a sitting President, he doesn't likely have access to those various courses. So, how exactly does that work? Does he change his entire life? Does he change his hobbies? Does he only operate in areas that are quote, \"hard areas\" like Mar-a-Lago that are completely secure, locked down, or is he still able to travel? Now, again, the campaign says it's business as usual. He's going to be an all of his events this week in both Michigan and Washington D.C. as well as in Uniondale, New York. But the Secret Service might have other plans or other at least conversations that they need to have to figure out if they're able to keep him safe.",

Again, it was not on his public schedule, in fact, we're told he decided to come golfing here on Sunday like late in the day. And so, authorities still have to answer for the fact that this man, it appears, spent nearly 12 hours out here. You know, if you look at that photo from the criminal complaint, it seems pretty clear that he had food with him, he had a camera with him, he had this rifle with him.

I heard they had a drone up, but I don't know why a drone would have flown that fence line and seen those plates hanging there from the inside of the course. So, I think that they'll apply more technology, more manpower. They will push out that security perimeter a little bit more. But look, we're in a very tight race. These people -- these candidates want to be out among the people, that's our system, they're shaking hands and kissing babies, and they want to be out there pressing the flesh as it were, and trying to get votes from the common people in America, from the working people.

And again, fully formed opinions are there, and that's what both campaigns are kind of working up against as they try to appeal to this independently minded voter in some six or seven states. Now, what that voter really wants is a priority of their problems, and for most folks, that's economic. So, this moment, unfortunately, that should be really momentous and should change the course of this election will stay along being forgotten because we have these pressing problems that folks understand nobody is addressing. We have this duopoly here that could be shattered, and yet, we don't have the leaders who have the political will to do it. We need more open prairies (ph) and yet, we don't see them. That's how we end up with extremist voices in office. That's how the GOP ended up with Donald Trump as the nominee. Again, this moment is reprehensible, it's awful, but unfortunately, will be forgotten within a matter of days. We are in this last final part of this election, where priorities and trust dictate everything.",

TikTok and the U.S. government are going head-to-head in a federal appeals court. The social media site is trying to stop the ban that threatens its very existence in the U.S. The fate of the case could see the popular video showing up disappear from phones as soon as January. If it doesn't want to be banned, then the parent company, ByteDance, has to sell it off. U.S. fears TikTok's ties to China could allow Beijing access to data of 170 million users, including videos they've watched, liked, shared, and searched for. ByteDance argues that the ban violates the First Amendment, U.S. social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are banned in China. Clare Duffy is following the hearing. They only got 15 minutes to present an oral argument, but that doesn't really matter in a sense that there are, you know, reams of files and volumes.

But the judges did push back and say, ownership by a foreign entity is very different from ownership by a foreign adversary. I do think we left this hearing today pretty unclear about how judges are going to rule here, but we're expecting a decision in the next few weeks because whoever loses this case, one way or the other, we're expecting an appeal and they're going to want this to go to the Supreme Court before that January 19th deadline by which TikTok either has to sell off from its Chinese parent company or face a ban.",

In some citiesthey're dealing with at least a month's worth of rain in short order. The floods are some of the worst they've seen in decades. CNN's Max Foster reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Mud and misery everywhere. Shell-shocked residents in Romania say the floods came quickly, knocking down walls, upending furniture and drowning livestock that couldn't escape the rushing waters. DUMITREL SOTROCAN, ROMANIAN RESIDENT (through translator):  Total damage. Dead chickens, all the geese everything, everything. FOSTER (voice-over):  In parts of rain-soaked Romania, residents are assessing the damage from Storm Boris which unleashed a month's worth of rain in a span of a few days over central and eastern Europe. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  We don't have food, water. Look over there, clothes. Look, the neighbor gave me a dress. FOSTER (voice-over):  And while cleanup is underway in some areas, it's still impossible in others where the waters not only haven't receded but they're rising. Swift currents race through streets in one Polish town after a nearby river overflowed its banks making it too dangerous for some residents to leave their houses. Firefighters tried to pump out water from a local hospital to keep it operational, but it may be a losing battle. MARCIN REISCH, GLUCHOLAZY HOSPITAL NURSE (through translator):  Everything is flooded, mainly the cellars where the surgical clinic in warehouses are. Everyone is now trying to save what they can. FOSTER (voice-over):  In Austria, the Wien River is gushing with excess rain. And there's more expected for portions of Austria, Germany, and the Czech Republic in the next few days, which could mean more work for the Czech armed forces, which have been using helicopters to evacuate people from flood zones. So far, emergency services say thousands of stranded people have had to be evacuated and significant flooding is expected to continue. Some Czech residents use the break in the weather to try to count their losses. But with many of their homes, shops, and neighborhoods still engulfed in water, it's feared the damage they can already see could be even worse when the water subsides. Max Foster, CNN.
