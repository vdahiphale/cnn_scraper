From Russia with love, North Korea welcoming Vladimir Putin this week, his first visit in more than 20 years. Panda persuasion, China's fluffy gift to Australia, as visiting Chinese Premier Li Qiang says relations are \"back on track.\" Social media scrutiny. The U.S. surgeon general pushes Congress to demand a warning label on social networks in a similar approach to both alcohol and cigarettes. And puppy protection. The founder of a sanctuary in Thailand who's made rescuing neglected and injured dogs his life's work. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first to a partnership in Pyongyang. In the coming hours, Russian President Vladimir Putin will arrive in North Korea for a two-day visit. As I mentioned, his first trip there in more than two decades. Moscow says the pair will sign a new strategic partnership. Both South Korea and the United States have accused Pyongyang of supplying weaponry to Moscow in exchange for help with a military satellite program. Both nations have denied North Korean arms exports. Will Ripley has reported extensively in North Korea and joins us now. Will, great to have you with us on this story. You can correct me if I'm wrong, I think it was 2000, the year 2000 when Putin was last there. Kim Jong Un was a teenager and his father was still alive. Just give us perspective on the importance of this relationship now, actually, for both sides.",

And as you said, it was July of 2000. So, next month, it'll be 24 years. And at that time, Kim Jong Il and also his predecessor, North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung, they really felt like when they met with Putin, when they would meet with Russian leaders, they were an accessory, they were an afterthought. It's very different today. Putin went to Kim Jong Un, and then, of course, you know, Kim sees the opportunity to travel to Russia because he needed Kim's help to supply weapons for the war in Ukraine, not just, you know, things like artillery, if I can speak this morning, but also ballistic missiles that are made, by the way, with American parts. And so, what North Korea has been doing is they've been sending this steady stream of weapons, including ballistic missiles, that are being fired, according to Think Tanks in the U.K. that have actually analyzed debris and they're killing people, including civilians in Ukraine. And what North Korea gets in exchange might be perhaps the most valuable to Kim. Not only do they get paid for these weapons, but they also, according to the U.S. and South Korea, are getting this valuable intelligence that could perfect Kim's military satellite and ballistic missile program. And that is why the White House is saying that they are extremely troubled by this growing alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (voice-over): The North Korean capitol Pyongyang, preparing a super- sized socialist welcome for Russian President Vladimir Putin, a pariah in the free world, and Kim Jong Un's world, an invincible comrade in arms. Korean propaganda praising Putin's first Pyongyang trip in 24 years. He met Kim's father in 2000, months after becoming president. Kim Jong Un was still a teenager. Moscow-Pyongyang ties today, the strongest since the Cold War, a grave and growing threat say Seoul and Washington. They accuse Kim of supplying weapons to Putin's army in Ukraine in exchange for advanced military technology. Possibly boosting Kim's ballistic missile and spy satellite programs, which could make Kim's growing nuclear arsenal more accurate, experts warn. For years, North Korea has been threatening to use nukes against the U.S. in the event of war. In April, Kim was quoted in state media, now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before.",

Satellite images of Pyongyang in recent days show possible preparations for a massive celebration. The Kremlin, unfazed by western warnings, claiming it has every right to create closer kinship with neighbors. The stakes are high. The symbolism powerful. Observers say Putin and Kim's dangerous alliance is bigger than politics. A defiant message from two leaders determined to take down the U.S. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera): And this crossed just a few minutes ago, Julia, Vladimir Putin wrote this glowing article that was published in North Korean state media. He talked about their historical bond, their joint struggles, their diplomatic milestones. And then, he gets to the crucial part where he thanked North Korea for supporting Russia's, in his words, special military operations in Ukraine, and he talked about how they together will trade more, how they're going to basically form this partnership in defiance of the western bloc that they feel -- both of them feel has been trying to suppress their country's growth. And they're going to be signing this new strategic partnership agreement that will replace the previous documents signed 1961, 2000, 2001. We probably won't see the specific wording in that agreement that has the United States and Seoul and other U.S. allies the most worried, of course, which is what's going to be happening on the military cooperation side, but they're also going to be sending more Russian tour groups into Pyongyang and we're going to see a lot more interaction for the time being between Russia and North Korea. Now, of course, experts say that if, all of a sudden, there's a ceasefire in Ukraine, then Kim becomes less valuable to Putin and all of that -- all of this kinship that they're touting right now could fade away. So, we really don't know what the future will hold. But at least for right now the clear message on the Kim side and the Putin side is the U.S. be damned. They're going into this headfirst. And we'll see what happens. Should be a huge spectacle. You know, Russia can do socialist pomp and circumstance and pageantry very well, but North Korea will give them a run for their money, that's for sure. They can get hundreds of thousands of people out in the streets who will be dancing and cheering and make Vladimir Putin feel like a king as he's rolling through town with Kim Jong Un.",

Now, there are new questions today, too, over who Israel's prime minister will consult about the war in Gaza after Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the nation's war cabinet. That six-member cabinet was formed just days after the Hamas terror attacks and included centrist Benny Gantz. The decision coming after Gantz left the government last week.

And in Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike has killed a key operative in Hezbollah's rocket and missile department, according to the IDF.

Approximately 60,000 people have been evacuated from the north to hotels across the country. According to Israel, Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets and drones since the start of the war. Israel has carried out strikes against Hezbollah targets and commanders amid fear of a simmering conflict boiling over into a war. We are approaching the point where a decision will have to be made, says Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, and the IDF is prepared and very ready for this decision.

It's the first visit to Australia by a Chinese premier in seven years after relations deteriorated during the coronavirus pandemic and led to a host of restrictions on products ranging from timber to Australian wine. Now, in a sign of warming ties, Li Qiang said Beijing would send a new pair of giant pandas to Adelaide Zoo after its current return to China later this year. It's a new day in Canberra where we join Charles Croucher, the chief political editor for 9News Australia. Charles, fantastic to have you with us. The impact of the deterioration in relations over the past few years hit whole swathes of the Australian economy and certainly small businesses. What are ordinary people saying today about this visit and the hopes for improved relations going forward? CHARLES CROUCHER, POLITICAL EDITOR, 9NEWS AUSTRALIA: Morning, Julia. Ordinary Australians are apprehensive when it comes to China. Certainly, they've seen the impact of that deep freeze that existed for the past four years. As you mentioned, everything from timber to crayfish, Australian beef, and then our wine industry. This was targeted by Beijing to have a great impact on Australia. And there are industries and jobs and livelihoods that have been impacted by that over these past few years. What we are seeing now in this visit, that is seven years in the making, is a turning of the tide and a step in the right direction. However, there is apprehension. Australia know the importance of China as a trading partner and an economic lifeboat to Australia over the past decades when it comes to mineral sales as well as products. But also, they know that China is a new China for the one that Australia was dealing with decades ago. This is a Beijing that is looking to expand, particularly into our region using some of our nearest neighbors and expand its influence all over Australia, increases in cyber-attacks, increases in foreign coercion here in Australia and then effectively saber-rattling in the South China Sea that has impacted not just Australian troops and Australian naval vessels, but also vessels from our allies, from the U.S., from Japan, from the Philippines and some of Europe. So, whilst this is a welcome visit and any talk is good talk, there is that apprehension that still exists, that knows that tap can be turned off once again, and if Beijing's mood changes, it will impact all of our region, the stability of the globe, and certainly, it will impact Australia. President Biden advised Australia to trust but verify when it comes to China. I think trust begins with talk, and the good news is those talks are now underway.",

We'll bring you any further headlines on that when we get them. In the meantime, when Europe imposed sizable new tariffs against Chinese electric vehicle imports last week, many worried how Beijing might retaliate. Well, the answer may have come Monday on news that Beijing has begun an anti-dumping probe into E.U. pork exports to China. At issue is whether the E.U. is exporting pork at below market prices, hurting Chinese domestic producers. Sound familiar? Beijing has already launched a similar investigation into E.U. brandy exports to China. Hanako Montgomery joins us now on this story. So, this investigation, I believe, could take up to a year, but it's going to really hurt farmers in Europe, in Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France included in that, Hanako, and it's politically a very sensitive time.

Now, in terms of what parents can do, this is something that can happen immediately. Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta has talked with a surgeon general about this, and together, they put out sort of some guidelines. The first one is talk to your kids. Make sure you're having that conversation. Another is to create tech free zones around really important times, like bedtime or dinner time, times when you're socializing. And then, the third is to get together with other families in your community so that your kids don't think you're the only one doing this.

It'sbasically -- yes, it's what everybody should do. But we've actually sterilized 12,000 now, which means we've stopped probably 100,000 puppies coming into the world. And my whole mission is, I started off thinking feeding the dogs was really important, and we still do that, but actually, to stop the suffering, you need to kind of turn the tap off, which is the new baby's, big puppies being born into the world because they have no chance and we can't keep up with fixing all the broken ones when there's millions of dogs. So, our big push is sterilizing. There's 500 million street dogs around the world, which is an insane stat, but I'm pretty determined to fix the problem globally. That's my mission.",

It was the largest convoy to visit the island in years, and it's unclear now where the convoy is headed. Thailand's upper house is expected to pass a bill legalizing same sex marriage on Tuesday. It passed the lower house in March. If approved, it would go to the king for endorsement and then become law. Thailand would then join Taiwan and Nepal as the only places in Asia to allow for marriage equality. Now, it's been an eventful day at the European Football Championship in Germany. France kicked off their tournament with a 1-nil win against Austria. Kylian Mbappe missed a chance to double France's lead in the 55th minute. That wasn't the only trouble for the French superstar.
