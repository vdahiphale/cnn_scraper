And, you know, he, the president began really very clearly with democracy, with values, with the attack on democracy by Vladimir Putin and the need to defend Ukraine. And then he pivoted to the assault on democracy in the United States and the importance of defending democracy, the values really were clear throughout. And he ends on them, too, saying that we haven't always lived up to our idea that Americans are equal, that equality is essential, but we've never given up on the idea. And that contrast, again, you know, we've talked about the use of the word predecessor. He talked about the alternative set of values, revenge and retribution, and really, you know, draws that very clear line in the sand. And then, of course, you know, as we anticipated, a very significant part of that speech being about the value, the delivery, the focus on working class Americans, on middle class Americans, on protecting them from further tax increases. But, and here again, another real line in the sand with Donald Trump, that he will raise taxes on wealthy Americans and on corporate America.

This happened on the sidelines of the National People's Congress in Beijing, as reported here on CNN. Foreign Minister Wang Yi, he criticized the United States for what he called a bewildering level of trade curbs.And Wang also said this -- I'm going to bring up his words for you. He said: If the U.S. is obsessed with suppressing China, it will eventually harm itself. Now, some background here. The Biden administration has been limiting China's ability to access sensitive technology, high-end technology like chips and semiconductors over the fear that such technology could be used to bolster the Chinese military. And the U.S. has also used sanctions against China, against a number of Chinese actors over a full slate of issues, from allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, to the illicit fentanyl trade, to support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And Wang did say yesterday that there were some improvements in the relationship, especially since that meeting between Biden and Xi in San Francisco in APEC in November. And we have seen improvement in the tone of this relationship. High- level military communications have resumed. A working group has been set up to stop the flow of fentanyl and fentanyl precursor chemicals into the United States. But last month, it was Wang Yi who called on the U.S. to lift sanctions. That is a sore point in this relationship. So that, along with the tough language that we heard this week in Beijing, as well as in Washington just a few hours ago, all of this coming together to remind us of just the diplomatic challenges that remain in this very, very critical relationship.

Between getting Muslim voters on board in terms of the U.S.'s push to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and to remind Israel constantly about the need to, you know, take extra care when it comes to civilian casualties.And at the same time wanting to obviously appeal to Jewish voters to make sure to show them, look -- and he said this in his speech -- that he's the first U.S. president to go to Israel during wartime, that he's, you know, that they've showed their support for Israel and its objective to defend itself, to destroy Hamas, and to free those hostages. And he even said, look, he said that the onus, it's in Hamas' hands right now, and he said that Hamas could end this law tomorrow if it were to free the 100 or so hostages that Israel believes are still alive and held in captivity in Israel, lay down its weapons, and hand over those responsible for the October 7 terrorist attacks. Now, that's obviously a nonstarter as far as Hamas is concerned, but I think, as I say, Biden is trying to tread this line. Where the paths obviously diverge is, of course, his reiteration of U.S. support for a two-state solution, something that the current Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is dead set against. And we had that plan for the day after from Netanyahu just the other week, talking effectively about Israel maintaining a presence and freedom of operation in the Gaza Strip for as long as is necessary.",

And that's not the first time that, you know, I've sat here and we've said this during these talks which have been going on for weeks now, and the hope that President Biden expressed when he was in that ice cream shop in Michigan, I think it was, that a deal was going to be done by last Monday.

First of all, Israel has said that if a deal wasn't done in time for Ramadan that it would start a ground operation in Rafah, which it sees as the last stronghold of Hamas with those four battalions.And just yesterday, in fact, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing troops saying that we will continue to operate where we need to and that includes Rafah. A deal not being done, that I don't think necessarily means that, OK, as soon as Ramadan starts, you know, Israeli tanks are going to start rolling into Rafah, but Israel says it will go in. So that's one issue. The other issue, of course, is that Ramadan, the holy month of Ramadan, is always a time of increased tensions, certainly in Israel, and there's every possibility that tensions could spill over into violence, particularly around the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Haram al- Sharif, which is the third holiest site in Islam, known to Israelis as Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. That's always a potential site for violence during Ramadan. And I suppose the concern is that in the absence of any kind of deal now that those tensions could boil over and could lead to escalations, whether it's on the northern border with the Iranian back to Hezbollah or elsewhere in the region.

And they say that this stampede was caused by about 12,000 Palestinians they say were swarming around these aid trucks, which is, you know, further evidence of the desperation of these Palestinians to get much- needed aid, especially in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.
