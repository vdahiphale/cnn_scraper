I'm Alex Marquardt, in today for Fredricka Whitfield.Millions of Americans are heading home from Thanksgiving holidays this weekend, now facing some significant storms that could slow down travel both in the air and on the roads. Today the southern part of the country is getting hit by heavy rain and the Midwest and Northeast expected to get their share tomorrow. Airports are preparing for a surge of passengers this weekend. There are already more than 900 flights that have been delayed so far today. That number only expected to rise. Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is in the CNN Weather Center for us. Allison, where are you seeing the worst weather out there on this holiday weekend?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, the key thing is going to be where is it now compared to where is it tomorrow because this big system here in the central portion of the country is going to spread out. So really much of the entire country is going to be dealing with some type of inclement weather either today or tomorrow.The main focus today is really going to be in the center portion of the country where we have that heavy rain and even the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast. We also have some snow showers pushing into the intermountain west likely to cause some issues and delays there. The main focus for delays today in the air are going to be Kansas City, Memphis, Atlanta, New Orleans, as well as out to the west, places like Seattle and Salt Lake City also looking at potential delays today. The heavy rain is really focused on this system mainly down by the Gulf Coast. So you've got some rain moving through Dallas, Oklahoma City making its way through Shreveport, headed towards New Orleans as well as Little Rock. Now, the thing is this is not a very fast moving system. It also has a lot of moisture in it. So the potential for flooding does exist essentially from Houston all the way over to Pensacola. Now, the key thing here is going to be the slow nature of these so it may not be the first thunderstorm that triggers the flooding but it's the subsequent ones, the training of these storms that's going to end up triggering that flooding. We also have the potential for severe thunderstorms including damaging winds and the potential for an isolated tornado or two. The main focus here is Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Mobile, Biloxi stretching over into Panama City. But this system I going to begin to push into the Midwest by the time we get to tonight. Also into other areas like Atlanta and Charlotte. The concern, Alex, tomorrow is going to be all the big east cities -- New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., that's where you are likely going to see some delays on Sunday.",

So let's back up. This was supposed to be a great cruise to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with family for this man. But his sister says she last saw him on Wednesday about 11:00 leaving a bar inside the cruise ship and then she didn't hear from him, didn't see him. She reported him missing to the cruise ship authorities noon on Thanksgiving Day. But it wasn't until a couple of hours later that the Coast Guard was alerted that this man possibly went overboard. They next spent the next several hours trying to find him in the water, searching for him by airplane, by helicopter, by boat. Finally spotting him and pulling him out of the water via helicopter. He was able to talk to them and say I'm the man you have been looking for. Yes, I went overboard on a cruise ship and they were able to take him to an area hospital there in the New Orleans area where the cruise first left from that port. And I want you to hear from the member of the U.S. Coast Guard who spoke with us who says in his 17-year career he has never been a part of something like this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. SETH GROSS, SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION COORDINATOR, U.S. COAST GUARD: We were out there doing what we practice, what we joined the Coast Guard to do, and the fact that he was able to keep himself afloat and above the surface of the water for such an extended period of time is just something you can't take for granted and certainly something that will stick with me forever.

They played in the first ever World Cup back in 1930. And there's some added spice today because the Mexican boss is actually Argentinian, Captain (ph) Martino. He represented Argentina, he coached them for a couple of years, he coached Lionel Messi when Messi was at Barcelona. He said he could have never anticipated that this match would have held this amount of significance. He said he has got to do the impossible, and that is to try and lead Mexico to a victory.

First off, as we just noted, it's been almost two weeks. Are you surprised that there seems to be such little progress in identifying a suspect? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, DIRECTOR OF FORENSIC SCIENCE PROGRAM, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY: I'm surprised that not a lot of information has been forthcoming. But it does appear that this will be a forensic case, which means after they do the analysis of all of the evidence that has been supplied to the Idaho state lab, they should be able to get information that will take them to a suspect simply because the suspect, while he was stealthful getting into the house, he left a very messy crime scene.

So the way that they -- it comes in, the leads will come in and then they will be prioritized and then investigators will go out and conduct interviews or do follow-up with each one of those people. And it could be one of those leads, those phone calls into the command center, that can lead to something, which is why it's so important that the public continues to be encouraged to provide their information because they may have the one answer that the investigators are looking for because this offender has gone back into the community or some community, and he is not bringing a lot of attention to himself.

And how does that impact the work of the investigators?O'TOOLE: I do. I really do think that the fear in the community is going to grow, and not just because of the rumors. This case is so -- it's so dreadful and it's so concerning that people really are frightened and people all over the state are frightened, and this, frankly, is the kind of offender who very likely could re-offend. You don't see this kind of behavior inside of a home where there are four people murdered in the middle of the night and then the offender gets away, he escapes, and he never does it again.

What do women in Georgia who are facing the need for an abortion need to know right now?I mean it's one of those things where I don't think you know you are going to need an abortion until you do. I mean this is a very complicated health issue and decisions are made between the health care provider and a woman. What I can say is that if you are a woman, period. You need to be aware of the fact that basically some of the most basic, the ability to basically control your body and to make decisions about your life has been taken away from you. Not only that but that your doctor could be criminally prosecuted, have his or her license taken away, that you could be criminally prosecuted under this law. And so I think women really need to understand just how incredibly serious this is and how negative the impact is absolutely going to be if this law is able to stand.",

The problem is, is that because there was such a short period of time that it was in effect, basically from September to November, and Republicans refused to talk about it, absolutely refused to talk about the abortion ban, I don't think that most people in the state have any clue exactly what that law does and just how bad it is for the state, and particularly for women and girls.",
