But just 12 hours ago, Boris, this was the area that was lined with hundreds of people in a chaotic late-night kind of pre-Fourth of July celebration. There were cars spinning out in the roadway, people setting off fireworks. And as all of that was happening, one witness told us things started to change a little bit.

When you're talking about someone who has a bulletproof vest, multiple weapons, multiple rounds of ammunition on that person and a police scanner -- I mean, think about that. The suspect is trying to listen in real time as he begins opening fire to where the police are moving towards, so that he can apparently continue that shooting. Again, that shows a considerable amount -- a considerable amount of planning. One thing that's interesting in this case is that he was taken into custody alive. In so many of these attacks, we have seen either the shooter killed by police, the shooter take their own lives. The reason that's important, obviously, is because now police were able to interview that person to try to -- if he's willing to cooperate and talk with them, to try to determine what that motive was. Of course, none of that will give any comfort to the families of those who are now once again mourning, as you mentioned, over 345 mass shootings in this country, the latest in Philadelphia.

I was there interviewing the police right after that shooting. They described it as a \"sniper's nest\" -- quote, unquote -- where he was firing down on this innocent group of people that were out for a holiday parade, again, that very gathering of people providing a lucrative target for those who are intent on causing harm. And that's why we see police having to ramp up security around these events. It's interesting, as we talk about guns in this country, obviously, on the scene in Gun in America -- Guns in America beat, we talk about this all the time. When people start talking about policies, well, how do we stop these things, a lot, particularly Republicans, will say, well, we got to harden the targets, whether it's a school, whether it's a office building, a place of worship. Think about what this is this. These are people who are out gathering together at these types of festivities. So that kind of policy prescription obviously isn't going to help here. And then, beyond the actual holiday gatherings, we have seen a lot more people in this country determined to settle confrontations with firearms in a way we haven't seen throughout the history of this country, where you have a heated confrontation between people, people go to their guns, and quite often, in so many of these cases, we see innocent people, bystanders who are shot as a result.

They're gathering with members of the community. But you have to maintain that degree of situational awareness. Be on the lookout for, is there someone in this crowd that maybe something seems off? We often, in the security profession, tell people to know where your exits are, to understand what type of security might be in that location, where police officers are, where places of ingress and egress, where you can get out of a situation if you need to. That is heartbreaking to say. Again, it's Independence Day. We're supposed to celebrate. We're supposed to have fun.

Now, there are no tanks yet, but there are bulldozers, there are military vehicles. As we speak, there are still military vehicles in there. There's still a very active military operation, and the Israeli military saying that they are trying to dismantle what they call a safe haven for militants there.

They say that everybody that had died was fighting in some sort of way. But they have acknowledged that, amongst the more than 100 injuries, there are civilians.
