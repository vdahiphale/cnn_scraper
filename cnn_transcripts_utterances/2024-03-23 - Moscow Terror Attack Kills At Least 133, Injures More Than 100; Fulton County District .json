The Russians so far not going in that direction yet. They say that they've apprehended 11 people so far. They say four ofthem are the attackers who went inside that shopping center and events center near Moscow on Friday night and shot that place up. The investigation of that of course still ongoing. At the same time you still actually have firefighters and rescue crews on the scene there as the blaze isn't fully out. Here's what we're learning.

I also think that there will be questions asked about the lack of response time but, you know, the U.S. had warned that there might be some sort of attack, at the same time the FSB had foiled a planned ISIS attack it said against a synagogue.

That said, especially the way the two nations are at odds right now, that means that, yes, the U.S. probably shared as much as it felt it could. But you really only trust intelligence when you can see a lot of the sources and methods the way that intelligence analysts came to their judgment, that this is something that might be coming to pass.And the U.S. might have been very limited on how much of that detail it could share because it didn't want to reveal what it had penetrated in terms of networks, et cetera to Russian intelligence services. So perhaps the warning was fairly generic and it wasn't enough for the Russians to track down on their side of things. JIMENEZ: Yes. And look, while it appears at this point that this attack was perpetrated by ISIS, Russia, of course, is in the middle of its war with Ukraine and the Kremlin has pointed out, saying these suspects were arrested trying to cross into Ukraine, according to state media outlets, while a Ukrainian defense official says it's false and just absurd for Putin to claim that Ukraine was involved in this attack at all. And I'm just curious from your perspective, do you expect Putin to keep up that line of at the very least, allegations as he tries to rally Russians to support this ongoing war?",

I mean, ISIS has attacked the Russian embassy in Afghanistan and there have been several plots that the FSB, the Russian security services, have talked about disrupting over the past several weeks and months so the threat is real.He doesn't want to be left holding the bag and he needs to gin up more support as you say from his own people for this continuing war in Ukraine. So he's putting enough chaff out there to muddy this picture and make people look over the border at Ukrainians. I'll be interested to see if the U.S. decides to declassify some more of its own intelligence to say no, this wasn't Kyiv. This was ISIS all by itself.",

A lot of mystery around that and a lot of questions about how the palace was acting. And then that extraordinary video came out from the princess explaining why she hadn't revealed more detail sooner.And that was because there was a long process of dealing with major surgery as we now know, and then getting the diagnosis, going into the treatment for that. So chemo starting in late February, I've been told, and then really dealing with the kids and how they can, you know, process this and not be at school at the same time. So they broke up from school yesterday. So that was an opportunity for the rest of the world to be informed and Kate and William to really sort of huddle down with the kids. And it's been made very clear by Kate and William that they now really want some privacy and they're really appealing to the media and the public to get that privacy because she needs to recover. They need to protect the kids. And, you know, when you speak to people in London throughout the day, a very different tone today, not the questions I've been asked endlessly about where is she. Much more about, you know, I hope she's OK or, you know, how should we act now. People want to talk about it still but they've stepped back from the debate. A lot more on the conversation online has really calmed down as well. Few questions still about the medical condition, people are genuinely concerned about her. So we're joined by Dr. Tiffany Troso- Sandoval, who is an expert in this area of medicine. Thank you so much for joining us, Doctor. I mean, we have been asked to respect the princess' privacy. They're not going to tell us what type of cancer this is, but just take us through, you know, the mindset of a patient in this position and how important privacy is in the recovery process. DR. TIFFANY TROSO-SANDOVAL, EXPERT MEDICAL ONCOLOGIST: Yes, absolutely. And thank you so much for having me here. And let me just take one moment to express how deeply sorry I am for the princess and her family to have to endure this cancer journey, and that my heart does go out to them. As for her mindset, this is one of the difficult parts of being a young woman, married, children, or any person that's undergoing cancer therapy. There's a lot of overwhelm and fear, especially lack of understanding of what's going on. There's a lot for her to deal with emotionally, not to mention physically.",

How can people respond to that themselves? How can they be sure that they don't have cancer?I know it sounds like a ridiculous question, but that's what a lot of people are asking today. TROSO-SANDOVAL: There are course. You know, the other thing to know is that we don't know a lot of the other details. I don't know if there's a family history of cancer in Kate's family. I don't know what other risk factors she may have medically to predispose her to cancer and I certainly wouldn't want all of our 40-year-old women walking around to think that they are walking time bombs waiting to have cancer because they're not. It's extremely rare. And most of the time as long as you know your body, you will notice that there's something abnormal and you have to bring it to your doctor's, you know, attention and make sure that you advocate for yourself. Especially if you don't go -- you're getting the answers that you would. I would suspect that they knew something was wrong, obviously, because Kate went for -- they called it advance surgical procedure. And so this was -- there was something wrong and she knew it.

The fact is -- in fact, I just read an article from \"The Houston Chronicle.\" They talked about the fact that you had Texas state troopers that were saying one thing to migrants, and it was completely false. And granted, I don't know if they knew that at the time or if they were just confused because, as you stated, the Supreme Court did one thing and then, the next thing you know, the Fifth Circuit did another thing. And so what's happening is if you know anything about United States immigration law, it says that you can present yourself at any port of entry for asylum. That doesn't necessarily mean just the Texas border, even though that's all we ever talk about. You can present yourself anywhere within the United States and say, hey, I'm here seeking asylum. And so now you have migrants that may be afraid of Texas law enforcement telling them the wrong things, doing the wrong things, or the fact that there's going to arrest them.",

Clarity is what I think a lot of folks are looking for before we even get to the wider debate.I want to turn to another issue, the GOP-led impeachment inquiry into President Biden. All right, now Republicans continued to allege, with no real proof that this point, that the president was complicit in his son Hunter's business dealings. And a really big talked-about moment from this week's hearing, you called into question the credibility of one of the witnesses, Hunter's former business partner, Tony Bobulinski. Here's a clip from that exchange. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
