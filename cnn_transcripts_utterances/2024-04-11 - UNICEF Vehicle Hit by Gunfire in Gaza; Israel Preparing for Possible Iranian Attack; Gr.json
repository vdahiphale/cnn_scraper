I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. We'll be covering all angles of the Israel-Gaza war as Netanyahu and Biden make statements of intent while Iran threatens to become involved. First up, your headlines this hour. Progress on slowing U.S. inflation is stalling. New data on wholesale prices showing they rose faster in March, especially critical coming off yesterday's report on consumer prices. A few hours from now, President Biden will host the first-ever leaders' summit between the U.S., Japan and the Philippines. The region grappling with more proactive China and continued provocations from the North, from North Korea. And it's the biggest week on the annual golfing calendar. They are teeing off today in Augusta but the start is delayed by bad weather. We will hear from Tiger Woods on his hunger for a sixth Masters success. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

Israel carried out new operations in central Gaza following Wednesday's strike that killed three sons of Hamas' political leader. Ismail Haniyeh says it won't change the group's stand on a cease-fire. And the charity UNICEF says, one of its vehicles was struck by gunfire at a checkpoint in northern Gaza. No one, thankfully, was hurt. Let's do a deep dive on this, we're covering this region and beyond.

We've heard where the Israel perspective stands at present. I just spoke to Tamir Hayman, the former head of Israeli intelligence, about what an Iranian attack on Israel or Israeli assets might look like. Take a listen (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. TAMIR HAYMAN (RET.), FORMER HEAD OF ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE:  We are anticipating a range of munition, starting from long range UAV, like the one we saw attacking in Ukraine. That's Iranian long- range UAVs, the Shahed 136. And I assume that's suitable for that kind of an attack. We can see maybe some cruise missiles and maybe -- and just maybe, because they have the potential capability to use ballistics rockets. But ballistic rockets have assent (ph) over full-scale war. So I'm not sure that it will be approved. But along their blood from the range spectrum of capabilities, they have all three. It will be very interesting to see whether he will choose, the supreme leader, to use ballistic rockets. By the way, the Israeli defense capabilities can handle all of the above. But it's a matter of volume. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Even as we have seen very real differences emerging between the president and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the way Netanyahu has conducted his military campaign in Gaza. Now officials here at the White House throughout the week and U.S. government throughout the week have really been on high alert and preparing for that possible retaliatory strike from Iran on both Israel and potentially U.S. assets as well. They -- one official had said over the weekend that they view a retaliatory attack as really being inevitable, pinpointing this coming week as a potential timeline to see some type of action from Iran. So far the administration has not offered any intelligence supporting this or -- and they're also not getting into the operational details of how they are preparing. But we do know that this was a key conversation point between President Biden and Netanyahu when they spoke last week. The president spoke to that in his Rose Garden press conference yesterday, where he said that America's commitment to Israel is ironclad. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad. Let me say it again, ironclad.

Of course, there are concerns about what this could mean for U.S. assets in the region if Iran were to target the U.S. as well. But then there is the broader concern about this spreading into a wider regional conflict. Officials over at the State Department told CNN yesterday that the U.S. has continued to exchange private messages with Iran. The Iranians' messages to the U.S. have been to stop providing support to Israel. And in turn, the U.S. has said not to plan any further or plan any attacks against Israel at this time. Now there's also been some interesting conversations happening, relating to a lot of attention that we're seeing in the Middle East. The Iranian foreign minister today spoke with his counterparts in Qatar, the UAE, Iraq and it comes on the heels of a report that said that one of the president's top Middle East coordinators here at the White House, had asked allies in the region to try to help defuse the situation. So we will see whether that will actually help defusing the tensions that are currently there. But the U.S. is incredibly concerned about the potential of Iranian attack and what it could mean for a possible wider regional conflict",

      "sentences": "Becky, I agree. I liked that framing because for the longest time we talked about whether or notthere'll be a soft landing in the economy or a hard landing. With a hard landing meaning recession, of course the other risk all along was no landing at all, meaning that the economy would just stay hot despite the Feds' best efforts to cool it off and we are seeing some signs of that. I mean, we've had this blockbuster jobs market, another really strong jobs report out for March. And then we've had three street consumer price reports that were hotter-than-expected. Now today's producer price index measures wholesale inflation. And this was actually cooler than expected, showed that prices went up but not at the pace that some people had feared. When you look at the trend and the annual rate, 2.1 percent, we can see, one, that this metric has improved a lot from 2022, right? This was at almost 12 percent annual inflation. We're miles away from that but some of the improvement has started to level out. And that is the concern here. We are increasingly hearing from some economists calling inflation stubborn, right? Even comparing it to a toddler that just won't leave the park. And I think that that is apropos because, right now, despite everything the Fed is trying to do to coax inflation lower, it just hasn't happened to the degree that it needs to, at least not yet. And so now the question, Becky, is what happens with borrowing costs? Because those hopes for an interest rate cut in June, those hopes appear to have been dashed by these latest economic numbers. And there is even some talk that maybe the Fed is going to actually have to do more here, that maybe the Fed could even have to start increasing interest rates again. Becky, one other point here is, since we last spoke, U.S. markets have really turned around. The initial reaction to today's report was positive. We saw stock futures go up, wipe out early gains. But look at this, we now see the Dow down 200 points. This is after a loss of more than 400 yesterday. The Nasdaq was up and now it's flat; S&amp;P moving slightly lower, so markets have bounced around. But it is interesting to see that initial enthusiasm for this report sort of go away and we're back to this concern around inflation.",

That's what's going to be important as we approach this November election. The Biden administration can talk about what they've done for this economy and what they've done sort of on the macro level until they're blue in the face. But if the your is more expensive, if your food is more expensive, if your loans are more expensive, if your house is costing you more, ultimately, that's the sort of stuff that really means something to people, isn't it? And many of those stocks, for example, in the Dow Jones industrial average, are stocks of companies that need people to get out there and spend some money. It's always good to have you, Matt.

It is not just a measure of assurance between the U.S. and its allies. It's also a message to adversaries like China who are very much aware of those B-52 missions, especially the long-range ones. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held a meeting on Wednesday in which they said there would be increased defense security cooperation, more integration on things like command and control between the militaries and making sure these militaries can continue to move together. Biden said it is the most significant upgrade to the alliance since it began -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Today on our series, \"Call to Earth,\" we head to the island of Tasmania, where researchers are using advanced AI-powered technology to regrow and restore these underwater forests. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) STOUT (voice-over):  Sunlight streaks through the kelp canopy on Australia's Great Southern Reef, an over 8,000 kilometer long temperate ecosystem that wraps around the country's southern coastline. It's a quiet and private world, far from its famous cousin to the north, the Great Barrier Reef. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  Just have immense diversity that we just don't find anywhere; 70 to 80 percent of spaces that we find on our reef are unique to the Great Southern Reef. They're not found anywhere else. STOUT (voice-over):  The giant kelp anchor this environment, building a nourishing and underwater forest. And it's all but disappeared in Tasmanian waters, an issue that has scientists concerned. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  In Tasmania, we've lost around 95 percent of our giant kelp forests over the last five decades. Feeling squarely because of climate change. STOUT (voice-over):  in the capital city of Hobart, marine ecologist Scott Bennett (ph) sets out to the mouth of the steel gray dormant river, searching for a healthy canopy and a chance for the species to survive. SCOTT BENNETT (PH), MARINE ECOLOGIST (voice-over):  We've had that strong selecting pressure from marine heat waves and warming over the past five decades. So there's 5 percent that remain have been through a lot already. And its our hope that the resilience in that remaining 5 percent that hold the key. STOUT (voice-over):  Back on shore, scientists are taking a closer look at the hardy survivors, hoping to unlock their secrets.",

And then we will take those individuals and in the lab we will breed new kelp that carry that trait of thermal tolerance. STOUT (voice-over):  At Australia's state science agency, the CSIRO, Underseal (ph) Willis and her team have identified the genetic markers that may make them more resilient to climate change. Through selective breeding, the scientists are able to maximize the effectiveness of that trait in the kelp that will eventually be introduced back into the ocean. But the sheer size of the Great Southern Reef makes it difficult to determine exactly where the strengthened kelp is most needed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  We don't have a baseline and you cannot protect what you can't measure. So we can't put in place conservation programs until we have that baseline. STOUT (voice-over):  Google Australia is now working alongside the CSIRO, The Nature Conservancy, the University of Tasmania and the Great Southern Reef Foundation, tooling up the scientists with new tech. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  For this project, we are analyzing 7,000 square kilometers of satellite imagery, which just would have been incredibly difficult to do with traditional computers. STOUT (voice-over):  Google's geospatial technology is creating the first- ever map of Australia's giant kelp forest. Researchers will then use the company's AI tools to analyze the kelp that is survived. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  There is no natural regeneration anymore unless there's human intervention into the restoration, it will be lost. STOUT (voice-over):  Augmenting that human intervention with AI gives these scientists a better chance of saving the giant kelp and, with it, the Great Southern Reef. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
