Max is on royal duties today.It's Tuesday, February 6th, 9 a.m. here in London. But we begin in Washington, where Republican senators are signaling that a newly unveiled border deal may already be dead before a key vote tomorrow. And Republican leaders in the House are calling it too weak, saying in a statement. Any consideration of the Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time. It is dead on arrival in the House. We encourage the U.S. Senate to reject it. The one hundred and eighteen billion dollar bipartisan package was negotiated by Democrat Chris Murphy, independent Kyrsten Sinema and Republican James Langford. It would include the first major change to U.S. immigration law in decades. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: The sixty four thousand dollar question now is whether or not senators can drown out the outside noise, drown out people like Donald Trump who want chaos and do the right thing for America. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): Well, my biggest apprehension is that given the fact that President Biden has not used the current laws that are in effect, I worry what he will do with this new set of proposals and whether it will actually make any difference in this humanitarian crisis that we're seeing. I'm haven't made my way all through this bill. Earlier, there were some comments made that this makes incrementally a better situation for Texas and for the country. That's something I think I should consider. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It looks like it's probably not even going to pass the Senate where this deal was negotiated by this bipartisan group of lawmakers.Senate Republicans, they had this meeting. They huddled behind closed doors. It was about a little bit over an hour. We're told it was a very animated, robust discussion. But afterwards, those Republicans came out signaling that they don't think this deal is going to have the support it needs to advance through a procedural vote on Wednesday. Even James Langford, he was the lead Republican negotiator, is expressing doubt that this is going to have the votes. So just a remarkable blow and a huge embarrassment, really, for the Republicans who had initially demanded border security policy changes in exchange for Ukraine aid. And a huge reason for that, it's Donald Trump. He has really changed the politics inside the GOP. And in some cases, they're saying the quiet part out loud, which is they don't want to give Joe Biden and the Democrats a win. I do think it's important to tick through what was in this bill because it is the most conservative immigration proposal that's been debated on Capitol Hill probably in decades. So a centerpiece of the bill is this new authority to shut down the border. That would become available once average daily migrant crossings reach 4,000 in a one-week span. It would only become mandatory, though, once that average daily migrant crossing reaches 5,000. So Republicans had some issues with that. It's not an absolute authority. Biden also has the power to temporarily suspend that authority if he determines it's necessary. Asylum, that was another big point of contention. But they ultimately agreed to raise the threshold for those seeking asylum. They're also going to speed up that process from right now could take a few years down to a few months. So that was a big concession there from Democrats. It also would restrict presidential parole authority. It would also limit catch and release, again, two big things that Republicans would push for. And then on the Democratic side, something they were pushing for. This would authorize 250,000 new visas over five years for families. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Republican leaders believe it will pass a full House vote today. If so, it would make him just the second U.S. cabinet secretary in history to be impeached. The White House issued a statement strongly opposing the House resolution, calling an impeachment of Mayorkas, quote, unprecedented and unconstitutional. Wishes for a speedy recovery are pouring in from around the world for Britain's King Charles III, after Buckingham Palace announced he's been diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer. It was detected during treatment last month for an enlarged prostate, but a source tells CNN it is not prostate cancer. The palace says the 75-year-old monarch will step back from his public-facing duties while he undergoes treatment, but he will continue with state business and official paperwork. Meanwhile, the people of London are offering their support to the king. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's fascination at this stage as to what type of cancer this is, how serious it is, what stage it's at, what the treatment process will be. And we have limited information. So the palace statement at the end said that they were telling us about the diagnosis so that it would put an end to any speculation. And of course, in many ways, it's fueled even more speculation. I don't expect we're going to get a running commentary. The palace have given guidance so that there won't be cameras positioned outside the hospital where King Charles will be an outpatient going to and from. So at this stage, all we know is he's taking treatment seriously. It's happening very quickly, but he hopes for a good outcome.",

Well, at this stage, clearly it doesn't mean very much at all because the king is going to continue with his constitutional duties, essentially working from home. He won't be doing public facing engagements.Now, there is, of course, an allowance, though, if the king were to take a turn for the worse. If you wanted people to take on some of those duties, you can appoint two or more of the councilors of state. That includes his wife, the four members in the line of succession over the age of 21. And actually, he's actually added Princess Anne and Prince Edward to the mix as well. So there are a number of people that can help him at that stage. We're not there yet.

So it was interesting in that meeting, you could see that the head of Egyptian intelligence services was there in attendance as well, and this has been key in the previous cessation of hostilities we saw back in November, which did secure the release of some of the Israeli hostages that Hamas took on October 7th.So this will really be one of the key things he will be talking to the Egyptian president about. We know just after this meeting as well he'll be heading to Qatar, another country that really is key in trying to secure the release of more hostages. So that's one of the key things that he will be talking about. But he's also in the region once again, and that was underlined yesterday by the fact he was in Saudi Arabia, in trying to talk about what happens after this conflict has ended, what happens in Gaza, who will be in control. A number of issues to talk about, potentially the normalization of relations with some of these Arab nations in return for some concrete steps towards a Palestinian state. It's something that Secretary Blinken had mentioned the last time he was in the region, just last month, really hammering home to the Israeli side that without concrete steps towards that two-state solution, then there would be no normalization, there would be no security for Israel in the region. So that would have been something that we know he did talk to the Saudi Crown Prince about yesterday. Also, the governance of Gaza, the reform of the Palestinian Authority, who is going to help reconstruct and secure the Gaza Strip once this conflict is over. So there really are multifaceted talks ongoing at this point. The immediate need for humanitarian aid, the immediate need for hostages to be released, and of course a cessation of hostilities, and then what happens the day after the conflict ends -- Bianca.",
