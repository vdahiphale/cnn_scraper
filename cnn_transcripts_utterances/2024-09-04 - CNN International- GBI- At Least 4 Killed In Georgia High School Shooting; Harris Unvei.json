It's about an hour east of Atlanta. The Barrow County sheriff says there are multiple injuries as well. A law enforcement source says the suspect is believed to be a 14-year- old male. That suspect is alive and now in custody. For now, those are the details. We know the sheriff has said he will brief reporters again in an hour. We should note Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to address the shooting just moments from now, as she campaigns in New Hampshire. We're going to bring you Harris's remarks as soon as they begin, until then CNN is on the ground hearing from students at the school, their accounts just difficult to listen to.

This 14-year-old -- you know, we were asking all along whether this person was a member of the faculty or students, or perhaps didn't have any association at all.But it really does strike you to hear that were talking about a 14 year old. Of course, for that age of a person to have a firearm would be unlawful. And so, a major question for police will be how did this individual get access to a firearm? And of course, if we've seen in other cases, there are potential penalties at stake here for whoever that firearm owner was. We've seen that happen in other school shootings as well. Still don't have information yet from authorities about the motive. That remains under investigation at this hour. We do know from state police in Georgia that the suspect was taken into custody and is alive. And so, if they're able to actually interview this individual, that can then provide some information to perhaps glean some type of motive. But we're talking about a juvenile, so there are policies and laws in place for how authorities can actually interact with someone of that age. And so that's what law enforcement is trying to get to. We also expect that there will be search warrants executed at the residence of this young individual as well as any online social media footprint, again, try to get to the why just such a trial tragedy here, striking get another American community, Jim.",

(CHEERING) HARRIS:  And to help achieve this, we will lower the cost of starting a new business. So, here's the thing. On average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business in America. That is a great financial barrier for a lot of folks, and it can hold entrepreneurs back and the current tax deduction for a startup is just $5,000, okay?

By Election Day, this will settle down into what it might not have been had Biden stayed in, a normal election, normal in the sense of the Trump era. This is going to be pretty much more or less what we saw in 2016 or 2020. Whichever one of them wins, we're going to see the same kinds of patterns.

And so, we're waiting for details about the victims and, you know, about the suspect as well. We do know based on our reporting, this was a 14-year-old boy, but again, we have to all ask the question, what would be the motive here, which is what law enforcement will be looking at as well. If the suspect did provide information during an interview with law enforcement, obviously, that would help them potentially glean the motive. I would guess based on how these have gotten in the past, the fact that they would want to prosecute this person, authorities who would probably be keeping close to the vest, any statements said the shooter makes about the motive. But again, this is certainly the big question that we all have. And then, of course, another question is about the firearm itself. How a 14 got act access to a firearm. You and I, Jim, were talking earlier. You mentioned spot on the case of the Oxford high school shooter and how that case his parents were actually prosecuted for allowing him to get access to that weapon. So that will be a big question here. Who gave this boy or allowed this boy access to a weapon? Whose gun was it? Will authorities be trying to prosecute that person?",

Nearly every single instance, there's some type of what they call leakage, some type of warning signs. People who used to be outgoing that are now reclusive, people who are maybe talking about violence and so many incidents. People who expressed some outward sign that was just not reported.
