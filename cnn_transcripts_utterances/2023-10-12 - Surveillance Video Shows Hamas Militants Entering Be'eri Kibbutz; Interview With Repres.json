You're seeing the aftermath of a strike on the Al-Shati refugee camp killing what a Palestinian minister of health said was a large number of people.Now U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Israel to show support said earlier that the U.S. is working to find safety for women, children, and civilians in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We did discuss ways to address the humanitarian needs of people living in Gaza, to protect them from harm while Israel conducts its legitimate security operations to defend itself from terrorism and to try to ensure that this never happens again. We also talked about possibilities for safe passage for civilians who want to leave or get out of the way in Gaza. And that's a conversation and a discussion that we will pursue in the coming days, including some of the countries that we'll be visiting. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: That may be very difficult, though, to arrange. Days after the massacre in Be'eri Kibbutz near the Gaza border, Israel is now allowing journalists to see the horrors there firsthand. Not only the images difficult to see, the stories of survivors are tough. Very disturbing. Our Clarissa Ward was among the many few journalists allowed to enter Be'eri. Here's what she witnessed yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was 7:11 a.m. on Saturday morning when the militants arrived at Be'eri Kibbutz. Surveillance footage shows them lying in wait until a car arrives. They shoot the driver and enter the compound. More poured in on motorcycles, eerily at ease and in no apparent hurry. Thomas Hand heard the gunshots, and immediately thought of his 8-year- old daughter Emily who was staying with a neighbor. THOMAS HAND, KIBBUTZ BE'ERI RESIDENT: She doesn't do it very often but unfortunately that night, that particular night, that Friday night, she went to sleep at her friend's house.",

The bodies of more than 100 residents have been recovered, but the army says that many more are still missing. (On-camera): You can see the amount of blood. This was a massacre. (Voice-over): And full scale of the horrors that transpired here are just starting to come to light. (On-camera): Pictures, family photographs on the wall.

He's currently in a meeting behind closed doors trying to sway Republicans that are holding out because several members of the Republican conference have spoken out about why they are not fully sold on giving him the gavel.Let's speak to someone who is just in that room. Florida Congressman Mike Waltz joins us now. He's a member of the House Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. What did it seem like the mood was in the room? REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Well, I appreciated Majority Leader, Speaker- designate now Scalise having this forum. We needed to, and I certainly encourage everybody who has a concern, let's hear it, let's have it out, give Speaker-designate Scalise a chance to address it. Some announced a switch in their votes. I don't want to get ahead of who that was, but I think at the end of the day, you still have a couple of groups, Boris. You have some that are saying, look, I for one supported Jim Jordan, but Scalise won the majority of the vote. And we need to get behind him. We've got to move forward as a country. Others are still upset about what happened with Kevin McCarthy. And others are saying I'm not seeing or hearing transformative change yet. Let's keep talking. From my perspective, this war in the Middle East has changed things. We have men and women in uniform that are literally depending on us to get our act together, move the country forward, because I think this administration is going to have to be pushed to go after the real culprit here, and that's Iran. Iran is behind all of this. They always have been. They have funded Hamas. They have resourced Hamas. They are pulling the strings. And Hamas and Hezbollah would not dare to so much shoot a squirt gun in the Middle East without Iran giving the green light. And it's only Republicans in the House that are going to push this administration to truly take on the head of the snake. And that means we need a speaker. And we've got to move forward.",

You said you didn't want to get out ahead of anyone, but can you give us numbers? There are razor-thin margins for Scalise to get to 217. How many switched their vote, would you say?",

There are others who've said we still need to talk more. I haven't heard, and I was elected to bring true change to this swamp, to Washington, and to how Congress has worked. And, you know, let's talk about that some more. And like I said, there are others who are very upset at why we're here in the first place.They feel like moving forward rewards chaotic behavior. So those are things that I think those are the conversations that are happening right now as we speak. But again, I applaud Scalise for having that forum to do so. And yes, I know you want to talk about this and then talk about the war in the Middle East, but in my mind, this is now in that context. And there are no differences that I heard in that room, any differences that we're talking about pale in comparison to what we're talking about with radical Islamic extremists that are literally trying to destroy our greatest ally in the Middle East, as we speak.

You posted a list on social media showing how the United States should assist Israel and it included blocking Iranian oil exports in the Strait of Hormuz.

That was an escalation to deescalate.I'll take you back to 1988 when Iran was harassing international shipping and President Reagan launched Operation Praying Mantis, sank several ships, and Iran was deterred. and the harassment and the malign activity stopped. Iran will push until it meets steel. And right now, it smells weakness. It knows it can get away with it. It knows its proxies can get away with it and Iran will trade Hamas casualties for dead Americans and Israelis all day long.

There's still a handful of American hostages, and the Biden administration says that their condition at this state remains unknown.There are also thousands of Americans who have registered their interest to be evacuated from Israel, and that's led the State Department to charter flights beginning tomorrow to destinations across Europe, which is a departure from the White House's original plan to direct travelers to find commercially available options. But the White House remains adamant about one thing, and that is that there will be no U.S. boots on the ground in this war. They say that's Israel's preference, as well. And it all underscores this challenge that President Biden and his team are facing. Trying to craft a calibrated response, one that doesn't draw other rogue actors into this conflict but also channels the widespread outrage toward the atrocities that Hamas has committed. And to that end yesterday, President Biden raised some eyebrows with some comments that he made about having seen and confirmed images of children who had been beheaded, but the White House later had to clarify and say that he was referencing unconfirmed media reports and comments by Israeli officials. And when asked today about the importance of accuracy and the plethora of misinformation around this war, Admiral John Kirby of the National Security Council said they're going to focus on the bigger picture.
