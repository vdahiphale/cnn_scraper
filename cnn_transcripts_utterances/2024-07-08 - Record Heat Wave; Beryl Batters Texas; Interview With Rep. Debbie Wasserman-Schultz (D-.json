LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Boris, he is clearly trying to flood the zone right now, which I have to say is pretty different from what we saw initially after that disastrous debate, where he wasn't seen very much. We didn't hear very much from him in the immediate days after the debate. In the last 24 hours, if you take a look, he has called into MSNBC. He is supposed to be calling into a donors call that the campaign is having. And he wrote this letter that you mentioned to Democratic lawmakers, and the objective here overall appears to be to project defiance and confidence and send the message loud and clear that:  I am not going anywhere. This is a little more sound from when he called into \"Morning Joe\" earlier this morning and how the president specifically defended the questions about his health. Take a listen.

The mood inside the building is one of real unease, according to sources I have spoken to, and that shouldn't be surprising. They are still sort of processing what it is they saw on June 27. And we know that senior officials in the White House have gone to real lengths to try to offer any kind of reassurance that they can, having conversations and meetings with their direct reports and trying to basically tell them, look, this was hard, but keep your heads down and continue doing the work of the Biden administration. We know that there have been a lot of group text chains going on discussing every little headline, a gossip. And just one example from this weekend, there was a \"New York Times\" article that cited anonymously a senior White House official that said they believe the president should step aside. There's been a lot of discussion about that, to try to determine who the identity of that person is. So that just gives you a little window into, again, the sense of real unease and the nervousness that is going on inside the White House right now.",

Lauren, we're learning that several top Democrats, privately, on a call this weekend said that Biden should step aside, and many of those lawmakers are also coming out publicly now too.",

In fact, we are waiting to see whether or not those numbers actually grow in the hours and days ahead. This is a critical week for Joe Biden. This is a critical week for Democrats on Capitol Hill to decide whether or not they are going to stick with the president or whether or not they are going to try to urge him to step aside. Now, they ultimately don't have power. Only Joe Biden can make that decision, but you can imagine that, if the dam starts to break here, it puts additional pressure on Biden, additional pressure on the White House to potentially make another decision about the president's future in this race. There's a couple key data points that we're going to be watching for in the hours and days ahead. First, the Senate and House come back to session tonight. We expect that we will be able to talk to members then. We also will see House Democrats meeting in a caucus-wide gathering over at the Democratic Congressional Committee headquarters tomorrow morning. That is part of a normally scheduled Democratic Caucus meeting. But as you can expect, this is the first time the entire Democratic Caucus is going to meet after this debate performance just 10 days ago. We also expect that Senate Democrats are going to have a conversation during their lunch tomorrow. Now, I'm standing right now outside of Mark Warner's office. He, of course, is someone we're keeping close tabs on. As CNN reported last week, he was potentially looking to have a meeting with other Democrats to try to talk about the president's path ahead. That meeting has been scrapped. But I would just point out that every single Democratic voice matters right now. And you can especially note the fact that many Democrats don't want to get out ahead of their colleagues. If they're going to say that the president shouldn't be in the race, many of them want to do it with a united front -- Boris.",

Yes, I am pushing to make sure that we can focus on what the dangerlurking down the road, is that, if we don't make sure that we rally and focus on Donald Trump and the extremists, good versus evil, existential threat that he represents to our democracy, then we're going to end up back there again.

So I think we really have to make sure that we're separating the sort of upper crust of donors and press and the more elite, as I have said before, and what the rank-and-file average voter in each congressional district cares about. We also need to make sure that we're focusing on taking the House back, because we're doing important things in Congress here in the -- on the House side, like making sure that we can pass a bill to protect refrigerators and dishwashers, as opposed to making sure that we can really hone in on helping people have affordable roofs over their head or continuing to address climate change. In my home state, Jessica, global warming is a right now thing. We have sunny day flooding. We have people at risk of not being able to live in their homes.

I can tell you it was significantly higher just a short time ago, the water now getting to the bottom of the vehicles. But it was up at the top of the wheel well just maybe 40 minutes, an hour ago, these vehicles stalling out early this morning. We even saw a short time ago, a fire truck, a ladder truck having to be pulled out as well. So, a lot of water, a lot of issues. And talking with those, even some of those who were in these vehicles this morning, they say it all happened so fast. It was so dark and, next thing you know, they were in this water. It was starting to come in the sides of the vehicles. Their engines were stalling out and flooding out. So, not great. That's why we have been hearing throughout the morning, throughout the time leading up to this as Beryl approached officials asking people to not be out on the roadways. That's something, again, the Houston mayor spoke about just a short time ago.

We have seen the water start to recede in some areas, but then rise up again in others. And as we're dealing with all this water, I can tell you too, if we look right here by the maintenance facility, you can see the winds still picking up as well, the flags whipping right there, so obviously a lot of conditions, still dealing with the effects of Beryl and something we will be keeping an eye on, obviously, throughout the rest of the day in the coming days as well -- Boris.",

This is the longest stretch of hot weather like that they have ever had. You mentioned Death Valley, where a motorcyclist died from heat exposure, another person hospitalized, and others treated on scene. Authorities there said that, due to the high temperatures, the emergency medical flight helicopters couldn't even fly to help them because they typically don't fly when it's above 120 degrees. Then you have Portland, Oregon, at 100 degrees, so places that are not used to seeing these triple-digit temperatures definitely hitting those records.
