That story coming up. Plus, a sneak peek at CNN special New Year's Eve coverage. We'll bring in 2024 with some laugh as I sit down with the stars of Broadway's \"Gutenberg! The Musical!\" Well, Ukraine's president is praising his military's attack on a Russian warship, vowing there will be no peaceful place for the occupiers. The Ukrainian Air Force shared this video on social media, saying an airstrike had destroyed a Russian landing ship in a Crimean port. Russia confirms one of its ships was damaged, and a Russian appointed head of Crimea says one person was killed. Ukraine says drones from that ship were used to carry out attacks on Ukrainian cities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YURII IHNAT, SPOKESMAN, UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE COMMAND (through translator): This is such a powerful event for us. In fact, we destroyed both the ship and the occupiers through well-coordinated actions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This follows the downing of Russian war planes and Russian fighter jets, according to Ukrainian military officials. But this has certainly been welcomed as the first line of progress in the Ukrainian counteroffensive against the Russian armed forces.Now, according to Ukrainian commanders, this vessel was carrying Iranian-made Shahed attack drones when it was struck by this missile attack overnight. Now, these attack drones have been heavily relied upon by the Russian armed forces throughout the war in Ukraine. Of course, this has been seen as a welcome sign of progress for the Ukrainian armed forces. This vessel would typically carry a crew of about 87, according to the US military, and can transport more than 200 troops. It's unclear how many were aboard at the time of the strike. And as you heard there, this has been welcomed by both Ukrainian military officials, but also, of course, President Zelenskyy, who congratulated his military and his troops for the striking of this vessel. We've seen that dramatic video showing plumes of smoke emerging from this Crimean port. The Kremlin itself has released a statement acknowledging this attack. They said early this morning in a statement that Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke to President Putin, had reported this incident to Putin, describing the attacks having taken place overnight, saying that the Ukrainian armed forces had launched guided missiles at the vessel. But he did say that the vessel had been damaged, not going so far as to say it had been destroyed as the Ukrainian military has. But, of course, again, the Ukrainian military pushing forward with that counteroffensive. This is, of course, a huge moment of hope for the Ukrainian military given the setbacks they have experienced over the last few weeks and months over the course of their counteroffensive. President Zelenskyy vowing to keep pushing forward with that counteroffensive and to continue targeting Russian positions.",

And so, theoretically, he will be pretty much out of communication.I'm not surprised that it took a long time to find him, because as supporters of his were telling me just even two weeks ago, people are transported usually by trains. And so, he is now 2,000 miles east and north of Moscow. So that could take a very long time. But where he is, is significant. That's about, you know, locking him away as far from the action as they can get. And the action, as you mentioned, is really the upcoming election in March of 2024 when Vladimir Putin will be trying again for another term. There's very little question, of course, that he will win that. But Navalny has a way of getting attention. We've seen it, you know, in the past couple of weeks. And he's actually even now, as we speak, tweeting about this, joking about being Santa Claus, et cetera. So it's very interesting the way this is all turning out. But I think the Kremlin perceives him as a threat, and so they want him away from attention as much as possible. And that's the bottom line. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One of those servicemembers suffered critical injuries and remains, at this point, in critical condition.US President Joe Biden was briefed on the attack and given options for how to respond. The US response, we saw that carried out several hours later against Kata'ib Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy, which had claimed responsibility for that one-way drone attack that injured three US servicemembers. The US carried out airstrikes against three targets of Kata'ib Hezbollah, targeting specifically their drone capabilities and the drone capabilities of affiliated groups. You see some of the video there the results of those strikes, at least one of which was carried out south of Baghdad in the US response there. US Central Command says a number of militants belonging to Kata'ib Hezbollah were likely killed in the US response, but they say US -- or rather civilians were not affected by the strikes. But that contradicts directly, or conflicts directly, with what the Iraqi government says occurred in the strikes. They responded quite angrily, saying that this was a hostile act that should not have been carried out and that, in fact, there were a number of civilians that were attacked in this attack.",

Though none of the crew onboard the ship were injured in the attack, this gets to the broader concern the US has had about a potential regional conflict.

So this is a key meeting with senior US officials here at the White House. And Israel has previously assured the US that they plan to move toward that lower-intensity war a more precise strategy and targeted toward Hamas leadership, but they have not provided a timeline as to when that would be. US officials have previously said that they expected those localized operations to happen by January. But again, it's not clear what exactly this next phase looks like and when it will begin to unfold. And the US has wanted the results from Israel showing that they are trying to contain the deaths of innocent civilians.

And so, as it moves deeper into healthcare, you know, this is really a black eye for the company, less of a financial hit. But as it moves deeper, you know, it could run into more problems. And it's not a great PR. You know, it's not great for PR to have a patent infringement, especially when there's so much antitrust scrutiny on Apple.
