His allies are said to be jockeying for key positions in the administration.Sources also say Trump has prepared a raft of executive orders and regulation reversals for day one in the White House. Trump also has to make decisions about roles for billionaire Elon Musk and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Top cabinet positions could go to Senator Tom Cotton, Congressman Mike Waltz, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has called Trump to offer her congratulations. She told supporters in Washington that while she concedes the election, she does not concede the fight that fueled her campaign. Harris and President Joe Biden have both promised a peaceful transition of power. Mr. Biden will address the nation from the Rose Garden later today, and he's already invited President-elect Trump to the White House. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more on the next steps for Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President-elect Donald Trump's transition is already well underway. Even before the election actually took place, the heads of that transition team were already trying to vet potential candidates for high-level administration posts. Now, I am told that all day today, Donald Trump was fielding calls from allies, donors, as well as advisors, all people trying to get in his ear, either to pitch themselves for administration posts or to pitch people that they knew. It is now turning into an all-out knife fight between Trump's orbit as they try to prove who has been the most loyal to him and who deserves a spot on his cabinet or within his administration. Now, one place to look as they fill these administration posts is Project 2025. Obviously, as we know Donald Trump has sought to distance himself from Project 2025 this campaign cycle particularly the policy but even though they want to separate from the policy they also had Project 2025, a smaller lesser known about personnel filing system run by Johnny McEntee who is still a close Trump ally. They essentially vetted thousands of people for these potential administration posts. These were people that they deemed loyal to Donald Trump. They are expected to provide recommendations to the transition to fill the thousands of posts that are going to be available when Donald Trump takes office. Now, it really is a rush here. There are a lot of big-time positions that people want, and we are told that Donald Trump's team wants to fill those positions as quickly as possible, that he could even name some of these people as early as this week. Think about positions like chief of staff, attorney general, these are the things that really matter to Donald Trump and really matter in any administration and all of that is currently happening the wheels in motion as we start heading towards that Trump presidency.

I mean, you're speaking from Europe as am I and we've seen some gushing notes of congratulation to President Trump because they know a lot of his foreign policy in the past has been based on personal relationships. VINJAMURIand recognize a newly-elected U.S. president. So in that sense, it's not out of keeping with what we would expect. And clearly of America's allies. I mean, we're sitting in the United Kingdom, we have a new government here. This new government has been very highly attuned to the fact that Donald Trump could have become and now will become the next U.S. president. We've seen meetings before the election across with members of Congress, with the president, a real concern, as you say, that not only that he might be president, but that he will wish to see people reaching out and demonstrating their willingness to work with the president and to a degree their loyalty, I think we're also seeing a very real pragmatism. And I might just frame it that way more than fealty, which is that there is a knowledge that the issues that Europe faces simply cannot be addressed or contended with absent working around the United States in the short term. There are many people who would like to Trump-proof Europe, to urge Europeans to work more together, to invest more in their collective security and defense, to make their economies stronger. Those are all extremely important, now necessary and valuable goals, but they're medium-term goals. You can't get there fast enough for the needs of Europe. And so there's a high level of pragmatism knowing that working with this U.S. president to keep America in Europe at a time of great need is really important. We've seen this also across Asia, where the concern amongst America's allies, Japan, South Korea in particular, is very real, and the desire to work with this president effectively couldn't be more felt. And they do feel like they've got a basis of knowledge for this. This is not a first-term Trump presidency. And as much as we expect Donald Trump to be different in the second term, we're not going to see a world leaders still feel like they have a knowledge, a history, an experience of working with an admittedly extremely unpredictable president, but one with some very clear views on his expectations for America's allies in particular.",

Let's bring in CNN's Paula Hancocks, who is following the story from Abu Dhabi and a similar view presumably is the one from here in Europe that we don't know quite what's going to happen and what's unsettling about Donald Trump for much of the world is that he's unpredictable.",

It is the result that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted. He said in his statement that it is history's greatest comeback.Now, the reason for that is the first Trump term was beneficial to Israel and to Netanyahu himself. There was the decision, for example, in 2017. The U.S. decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, something which had been expected to be negotiated between the Israelis and the Palestinians in a final peace deal. He also recognized the sovereignty of Israel over the occupied Golan Heights. This is territory which Israel took from Syria during the 1967 war. So certainly from an Israeli point of view, there will be hope that there could be more pro-Israel policies in the next U.S. presidency. It also shows potentially that there will be very little happening until Donald Trump takes control, which could mean that the war in Gaza, the war in Lebanon, could continue. Now, we haven't had clarity from Donald Trump as to what he would do when it comes to the war in Gaza. He did mention back in April that Israel needs to finish what they started, get it over with fast and that they are losing the P.R. war. But there is certainly concern among Palestinians when you consider the first Trump term and how it benefited the Israelis. So we are hearing that being vocalized among Palestinian lawmakers. Now elsewhere in the region, we also heard that King Salman in Saudi Arabia congratulated Trump, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman phoned him, and they spoke of the importance of U.S.-Saudi relations. Remember, when Trump first took power as president, he decided to go to Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip. So certainly, there is expected to be a strong relationship there as well. Max?",

Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement during his last term in office and could now roll back environment protection measures, making it hard to sustain a long-term international effort.

But when we're talking about specifically South Korea and security, you know, we want to talk about the prospect that Trump could demand more from South Korea in terms of payment to have U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula and also the prospects of another summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump. So when we're talking about these troop levels, Max, right now there are 28,500 U.S. service members who are scattered throughout South Korea and South Korea right now pays about a billion dollars annually, its share of stationing those troops throughout the country. A couple days ago, Max, in Chicago, Trump said he wants a 900-percent increase up to ten billion dollars South Korea paying the United States to house those troops throughout South Korea paying in Trump's word South Korea's fair share of this relationship. There was an agreement reached on Monday between Seoul and Washington D.C. for a much smaller increase not 900 percent by any stretch of the imagination, more like 8 percent.

As investor's desire certainty of the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all reached new highs. The Dow surged more than 1,500 points or more than 3.5 percent, the S&amp;P climbed by 2.5 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed nearly 3 percent higher.The record day on Wall Street comes despite economist warnings that many of Trump's policies could increase inflation and America's budget deficit. Trump himself grew richer in Wednesday's surge in stock shares of his social media company, Truth Social, jumped 35 percent at the opening bell before settling. Trump briefly gained more than a billion dollars in value for his stake in the company. Of course, those are only paper gains. In practice, it would be difficult for Trump to cash in and sell many of his shares without tanking the price. The president-elect is the dominant shareholder in the company, which makes very little revenue and is actually losing money. Trump has said he will impose a tariff on all goods coming into the U.S., as well as higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. He claims that tariffs will boost American manufacturing and bring in billions of dollars to help pay for tax cuts and other policy initiatives. But it's unlikely the revenue from new tariffs would fully cover his proposals and tariffs would likely raise prices for the average American. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
