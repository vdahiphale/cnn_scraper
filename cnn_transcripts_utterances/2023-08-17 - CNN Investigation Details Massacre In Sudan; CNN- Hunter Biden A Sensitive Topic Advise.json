But the most recent one is the one investigating Hunter Biden, President Biden's son. And new CNN reporting highlights just how sensitive that topic is inside the White House. Sources say President Biden is frustrated by his son's legal troubles and that White House advisers are treading lightly when it comes to broaching the subject with the president.CNN anchor, Jake Tapper, will be digging into that shortly on \"THE LEAD.\" He's here with a preview now. Jake, do you get the sense that this goes beyond a political headache for the White House and that there's real concern this could impact voters heading into campaign season?",

It saysBiden's adviser concede the topic of Hunter Biden and his various issues is mostly verboten with the president, raising the prospect of a political blind spot heading into a bruising campaign where nothing will be off limits with their Republican rivals. Hunter Biden is not a topic of discussions in campaign meetings, a senior aide said. It's just not addressed. That is a recipe for disaster, I think. Because a president needs to have people around him who can tell him everything so he could be fully prepared.",

Donald Trump says, once you became vice president, he made a fortune in Ukraine and China and Moscow, various other places. Biden says that's not true. Now Glen Kessler, who is the nonpartisan fact checker at \"The Washington Post,\" earlier this month, took a look at that because there's new court testimony from Hunter Biden in July. And Glen Kessler pointed out, he said Biden, during the debate, denied his son had made money in China. In court last week in July, his son said he earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from Chinese business deals. So presumably, let's just give the president the benefit of the doubt, he didn't know. That means Hunter Biden is not telling him everything. That puts him in a position where he goes before the American people and says something that's not true.",

But we are learning more based just based on the family's attorney now talking to the press. Answering some of those questions that people had had, particularly about the conservatorship that now, again, as known by Michael Oher. He says he found out about it back in February. But the family challenged that through their attorney.Essentially saying, well, he knew about it before then, because he signed paperwork in December 2004. And then they said and pointed out, that he wrote about the conservatorship in his memoir which was published in 2011. They also say that they never had any control over Michael Oher's decision making when it came to his NFL contracts, which agents he used to sign those contracts. They said he hired and fired and hired and fired, you know, agents all on his own. And they also point to the fact that that they all made the same amount of money, estimating about $100,000 each off \"The Blind Side\" movie, which is one of those points of contentions for Michael Oher in that recent filing from earlier this week. But another thing they addressed is the discord that you just mentioned, Jim. The fact that the family is clearly not getting along. It has been souring. I want you to hear from the attorneys about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
