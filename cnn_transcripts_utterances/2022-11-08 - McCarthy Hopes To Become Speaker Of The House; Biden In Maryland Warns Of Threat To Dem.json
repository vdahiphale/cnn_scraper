Getting a lot of attention. Those Senate races in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania considered toss ups. Wisconsin tilting republican Arizona, tilting democrat.Let's start in Pennsylvania where Democrat John Fetterman is holding the slightest lead over Republican Mehmet Oz. CNN's Athena Jones is live in Bethlehem. What are we expecting on this Election Day, Athena? ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Erica. We are in a swing state in a swing county and we're expecting to see a higher than normal turnout. That is what a local election official told us in this -- one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. It's also the most expensive as you mentioned, John Fetterman has a slight lead polls show over Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate. But of course it's all going to come down to who turns out on Election Day. And on these last several weeks in terms of getting their voters to the polls. Mehmet Oz in his final pitch with Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor hitting Fetterman and Democrats on things like the economy, inflation, the border. And also once again, urging his Republican supporters to go beyond their Republican friends to talk to conservative. Democrats and independents to try to get them to realize that they might be Oz supporters as well. And to get them to the polls. John Fetterman making his final pitch at a union hall in Pittsburgh, urging his supporters to come out and vote and hitting Oz for, you know, accusing him a really being from New Jersey and trying to buy this senate seat. But when it comes down to turnout, one thing that's interesting here in Pennsylvania is that we've already seen more than a million early votes cast. That is more than 20 percent of the total number of votes cast in 2018. That is one reason we're hearing from election officials that they expect to see a good turnout because you're already seeing good turnout. We spoke with Lamont McClure. He is the county executive here in Northampton County. Here's what he had to say about being ready to begin counting those early ballots. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAMONT MCCLURE JR., COUNTY EXECUTIVE, NORTHAMPTON COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA: Our county council has invested heavily in the millions of dollars in helping us prepare to meet the new burdens in Pennsylvania of mail-in voting balloting. And so we've bought a high speed letter opener. We have several high-speed scanners. So we've really made investments in our election infrastructure to make sure that we can not only be accurate but fast. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Monday was a very active day for both candidates as they hit the campaign trail to deliver their closing remarks to a rally of supporters. And was earlier on Monday night in Columbus, Georgia, where Raphael Warnock addressed his supporters saying that this vote is not so much a choice between a democrat and a republican.As much as it is a moral choice between right and wrong. He sounded confident but at the same time did express some concern for the possibility of a runoff in the state of Georgia if neither candidate gets 50 percent, a runoff is automatically triggered that would happen on December 6. Meanwhile, Republican challenger Herschel Walker seem to scoff at the idea of a runoff telling a crowd of supporters boldly predicting really that he will be the rightful winner when everything is said and done on Tuesday night. During his rally. He's blasted Warnock as a woke candidate saying that Georgians here are tired of Warnock choosing Biden over the needs of local Georgians here. What Tuesday is going to be a true test of though is whether or not Georgia really is a battleground state after what happened here in 2020 democrats would certainly like to believe so but the polls are really close. 17 days of early voting bloc brought more than 2.2 million votes cast with polls expected to open here at 7:00 a.m. Nick Valencia, CNN, Atlanta.",

Nice to see you both. Let's pick up where Nick just left off in Atlanta. Did Raphael Warnock make the wrong choice? Did he miss an opportunity in not raising more questions about Walker's character? We saw him just in that -- in that bite right there talking with my colleague Eva McKend.Didn't raise them either during the debate in the way that he could have. Was that a missed opportunity? MO KELLY, HOST, THE MO'KELLY SHOW: I think it was a missed opportunity. And although it may seem that Herschel Walker's candidacy may be unsinkable regardless of any scandal, it didn't seem like he lost any traction. The Democratic Party writ large needed to go on offense more, including Raphael Warnock highlighting the -- I would say the character deficiencies and the dishonesty of Herschel Walker and he did not do that. Would that have swung the election in his favor? I don't know. But it seemed like he was playing it safe almost like a prevent defense in football, as opposed to driving the ball down the field to use a Herschel Walker football metaphor and tried to score that touchdown and win the game.",

It's not because of policy. It has nothing -- we're not having policy discussions.The Republican Party didn't even have a platform coming out of 2020. So I think it's disingenuous to suggest that if the Democrats talk to more about kitchen table issues, or more about the economy, that that somehow would have swayed the vote. People are so hyper partisan right now. It doesn't really matter as far as the character of the candidate writ large.

And I do think there are plenty of checks and balances up and down the aisle.I think the election deniers were wrong. And even if they get into power, I'm not as concerned with those on the Senate and House level. But some of the state level officers that are election deniers where they do have the opportunity to potentially try and sway things. I'm confident there are next enough checks and balances at the state level. And people will call them out. I've worked in the secretary of state's office. They won't tolerate anyone trying to put their finger on the scale at the state level. And as we know, these elections are run state by state. So, I am confident that while that might have been a talking point to win their base over to get them elected, once they get in office, they're going to do their best to make sure that people have confidence in the election process.

So, I don't believe that there was and it would be helpful if Republicans and Democrats on both sides would have more faith in the system and reiterate that with the voters.And make sure that they understand that when they do go to the ballot box or when they do mail in their ballot is going to be counted and will be counted fairly, because that's the most important thing that we can do. I do want to push back briefly on one thing that Mo said about republicans not having an agenda. We do know that McCarthy set out the commitment to America which I think was really a good start on what he will do if nominated leader in the House if the house takes over. And so, big focus on doing everything we can to fight inflation, fight crime, and also work on securing the border. So that's a good blueprint for a start if the Republicans take over.",

And though democrats control Washington that both parties have tried to stoke fears about what happened to the economy if they didn't win the midterms. It was a tough message for President Biden, the democrats to push in addition to that unstable economy. The stock market has been in a bit of turmoil. The S&amp;P 500 up just over 13 percent since Biden took office. It's actually the worst performance at this point of a presidency, second only to Jimmy Carter.Overall, it's been a tough year for Wall Street since the -- it's been a tough year for Wall Street. Republicans are confident all of these factors, though, are actually going to give them a nice boost at the ballot box today. Are they right? For more on this, let's bring in Ryan Patel from Los Angeles. Senior fellow at the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University. Nice to see you. So let's look at -- I think one of the most confusing factors for a lot of people is that we have, you know, inflation rising, inflation is high, you go to the grocery store, you feel like gas prices have mostly stabilized. That's a good thing. There's still concern, though, about what could happen. But then unemployment remains low.

And so part of the confidence -- consumer confidence going into this election is where are we at right now.And it is clear that we're not in the recovery mode that I think most people want to be in. You mentioned the gas prices that the consumers in the U.S. citizens are pretty -- the Americans are pretty resilient, that's a high gas price and they're still going out and spending but like you said, the food and restaurant prices are starting to go up, supply chain and inventory.

Coming to 19 minutes to the top of the hour.And in the past week, the Russian military appears to have suffered some of its biggest losses since starting the war in Ukraine. Notably, an elite Russian marine unit reports as many as 300 troops killed, wounded, or missing after a failed offensive to secure supply lines south of the Donetsk region. Elsewhere, it seems many new recruits are among the dead, part of a Russian mobilization of more than 300,000 conscripts which so far has not resulted in Russia getting any new territory. The frontlines have not moved. But the Russian frontline losses in Donetsk have been so insignificant there are now multiple reports of Russian soldiers or their families speaking out and criticizing unit commanders. At least one instance, a Russian soldier says they're being treated like cannon fodder. All of this, not lost on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during his nightly address. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The Donetsk region remains the epicenter of the greatest madness of the occupiers. Hundred die daily.

They have accused Russian forces of essentially trying to create a full sense of security to lure them into a trap by sending out these reports that they might retreat from the city, that Russian forces might pull back from the city of Kherson.But Ukrainian officials think that's absolutely not true. In fact, they're actually preparing for a street to street battles. We have these reports coming from Ukrainian officials that many Russian soldiers are now wearing civilian clothes. They've been forcibly evicting people from their homes, thousands of them. Now, Russian- backed officials call these evacuations. They say they're taking place ahead of the battle. But Ukraine has been clear, they think this is a human rights violation, essentially. And they say these Russian soldiers are taking these homes, turning them into bases, again, preparing for running street battles. And on your note about Russian troops and the loss of life that Russia has seen on the battlefield, some eyewitnesses reporting that the Russian soldiers now in Kherson are younger and younger, as young as 18 years old being put on that battlefield. There are also reporting that there are less checkpoints in the city. The city itself is quiet but there is a curfew at night. So, people are not leaving their homes. So, really, both sides digging in, preparing for potentially a very big battle. And again, President Zelenskyy has vowed to win back these lands for Ukraine. One final note, John, just on the role of Iran in this, President Zelenskyy has repeatedly accused Iran of sending missiles, his allies agree. So, that could bolster Russia's weapons, arsenal right there on the front lines. John.",

Yet the poorest are often left to bear the brunt of climate change and pay a steep price. Pakistan's biblical flooding has reignited the question of loss and damage to compensate developing countries for climate disasters. While a little late, the E.U. in the U.S. say they now support discussions on financial compensation. A sign that the tone may shift at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt. JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY:  Simply put, with respect to finance, we, developed countries, need to make good on the finance goals that we have set. So, Sharm El Sheikh is another milestone for measurement, for accountability, and for focus. ANDERSON (voiceover):  And here is why that matters, without adequate financial investment, developing countries cannot pivot away from fossil fuels. But there has been some progress. Take the United States and the United Arab Emirates, for example who recently signed a partnership aimed at investing billions of dollars in clean energy industries, particularly in emerging economies. The White House said, \"To help bridge the gap, the two countries intend to work together to prioritize commercial projects in developing and low-income countries, as well as provide them technical and financial assistance.\" Poorer countries will want to see similar pledges being made in Sharm El Sheikh, where organizers have vowed to make climate financing a key focus. MAHMOUD MOHIELDIN, U.N. SPECIAL ENVOY ON FINANCING 2030 AGENDA: Climate finances is insufficient. I would say as well unfair and inefficient. The reduction approach that misled us all as a global community, that climate change and sustainability means only decarbonization and dealing with the emissions had been misleading. But we cannot ignore the impact of the decades and actually centuries of a mismanagement of the nature imbalance, harm to climate, and the planet. If we are not addressing these problems, we're going to be seeing more instability around the world. What we need really to see this time that we need to shift from the weather and when questions into the how. And the how is all about finance. ANDERSON (voiceover):  Finance, that is so important for countries like Pakistan, which emits less than one percent to the world's planet-warming gases, but is now faced with a $40 billion bill.
