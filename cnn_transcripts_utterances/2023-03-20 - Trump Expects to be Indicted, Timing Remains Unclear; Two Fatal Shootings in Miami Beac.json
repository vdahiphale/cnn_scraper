As you know, he's facing the possibility of criminal charges over that hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. A source close to the Trump legal team tells CNN, if Trump is actually indicted, they do not expect an arrest before next week. And the prosecutors say they have not made a final decision. So, tonight, we will dive into all of this. Should Donald Trump be indicted? Are prosecutors considering the national security implications? And if any of us were accused of the same thing, would we be indicted? Our panel of experts are here to answer those question. Plus, chaos in Miami Beach during spring break, two people were shot to death on the streets over the weekend, huge unruly crowds. One local official calls it a criminal takeover. I will speak to him in just a moment. And Ted Lasso took over the White House press room today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They say prosecutors use their discretion every day not to bring charges for any number of reasons. Mr. Bragg came into office vowing not to charge numerous nonviolent crimes, against public order. A wise prosecutor must consider the potential harm to confidence in the rule of law and bringing a prosecution that at least half the country will deem political.

Unemployment was usually over six percent. Employers could make whatever it was they wanted, and they always had employees available to hire. The last few years have not been like that at all. And so, companies as they are desperate to hire are trying to figure out, well, can we be a little more creative about who can we employ in more positions. You can't do that with a plumber. Some of these positions, these skilled trade jobs you really have to spend years learning a skill. And that's been a problem especially because, you know, sort of another hangover of that old economy that we had where there was always slack in the economy is we decided we needed a really big infrastructure bill that probably would have been really great for the economy circa 2012 when we finally got around to enacting it, we did it at exactly at the time the labor market was at its tightest. It's gotten really expensive to hire anyone to do anything. And now you have the government competing against private companies, trying to hire people who can build things, has driven up the price of everything.
