If you care about hard working people. Just give him a fair shot. Everyone in America deserves a fair shot. No, Gary, a fair shot. If you care about the dignity of work, and I mean, it matters, the dignity of work, the way you're treated, the decency. I remember when my great grandfather was one of the -- only the second Catholic elected statewide to the State Senate here in Pennsylvania. And I remember they talked about when he -- when they're running against him in 1906. They said, guess what? They said, he's a Molly McGuires. You know what a Molly McGuire was? Well, those of you who don't, a Molly McGuires, back in the old days, when we Irish and the Catholic came and then the Poles and others that were Catholic, when they came to the United States of America in the beginning, the 1840s -- late 1840s, they made their way down into Pennsylvania. A lot of them. And there's a tear in this -- in the coal mines. Those guys who got there last ended up being the last people in the coal mines. A lot of the English-owned the coal mines. And what they did was, they'd really beat the hell out of the mostly Catholic population that was in the mines. Not a joke. Not a joke. But there was a group that called the Molly Maguires. And the Molly Maguires, if they'd find out the foreman who was taking advantage of an individual, and they'd literally kill him. Not a joke. And they bring him body up and put him on the doorstep of his family. Kind of crude. But I got to admit, they accused my great grandfather being a model where he wasn't. But we're so damn disappointed. You know, that's a joke. That's a joke. Look, it's about the dignity of work. It's about how you're treated. And when I met with the IBEW and I started off this last campaign first, I said, there's two things they're asking of me. And I said, two things I'm asking of you. One, you've got to open up your units to more women. Not a joke. And two, to more minorities. You've done both that. And guess what? Instead of having support of 30 percent of the American leaders, now we're 65 percent of the America support the American Union movement. It really is all about the dignity of work. And there's only -- if you care about the dignity of work, there's only one person you have a rational choice with this time, and that's Kamala Harris. Not a joke.",

After that, the Israeli prime minister emerging, doubling down on what has become the key sticking point in these negotiations, that is Israeli troops remaining on that Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border.

It'll still be, of course, called a typhoon. Right now, only 64 kilometers per hour. But here's what it can do even as a tropical storm. Almost eight inches of rainfall in Manila still have this Signal 2 to the north up in northern parts of Luzon. That's a wind event, but it's the rain that's been falling with this storm. Almost 300 millimeters in places. And look what happened to Manila Bay, with the wind blowing in from the west, all that water came right into the bay. It's not supposed to be there, but those kids are. And those kids probably shouldn't be there either. But here's your power poles that came down in Manila. So, there was some wind and it will get stronger. This is very warm water. Clearly, climate changing water here. We're about two to three degrees centigrade Celsius warmer than we should be and we will see an additional 200 millimeters of rain in Manila just in the next 24 hours. But here's where we go, 204 KPH, and still getting stronger at that point and making landfall probably close to Hainan. Now, remember what happened to the Storm Shanshan, it was supposed to go due north and hit northern parts of Japan. It didn't do that. Models were not doing a very good job. We'll have to see what the models do now because Hong Kong, you are almost in the cone. And then it could miss Hainan altogether and go to the south and stay in warm water. Big threat right now is the rain, but as the days go on, as 72 hours from right now, we get a storm that's 130 or 135 miles per hour, that will do some damage. There are so many people in the way, whether it goes left or goes right. Zain.",

But building a business or a career can be challenging in the best of times. Inflation, unemployment and a tough job market are just some of the headwinds facing workers. So, what exactly can you do? My next guest helps her clients with the right mindset in terms of becoming an entrepreneur. Marisa Peer has coached CEOs and Olympic athletes. She joins us live now from London, Marisa, good to see. When you think about what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur, obviously, you need a fantastic business idea, you need demand, you need the right sort of entrepreneurial environment, the right sort of macroeconomic environment as well. But talk to us about how important mindset is when it comes to becoming a successful entrepreneur.",

You have to have what I call the bounce back factor. You have to be incredibly self-directed and self-motivated in a world where so many of us work for ourselves and we don't have anyone to build us up and praise us. You really got to have the skills of doing that. It isn't enough just to have skills of speaking in a boardroom or understanding business, you have to have mindset skills of phenomenal self- belief, tremendous self-direction, incredible self-motivation -- a denial is a delay and to keep coming back, and you have to be prepared to do what you really, really dislike. And that's a challenge for so many millennials who think, well, I don't have to do, I don't like to do. I just want to do the bits I like. And you've got to be prepared to really, really work hard. I think we've kind of lost the bit of incredible application because we're so into manifesting and meditating and using vision boards and we forgot that actually you got to work incredibly hard as well, a lot, all the time.",

I mean, you think about, you know, actors, forexample, obviously being on stage or on set with a film crew is incredibly glamorous. But it does take spending months learning lines, which is very unglamorous. And to be a successful actor, of course, you have to be able to do both. I do want to talk to you about rejection, right? Because for a lot of entrepreneurs, rejection is a really tough pill to swallow. Some entrepreneurs might get rejected once and then decide to throw in the towel. Other people -- and this is what I'm really interested in, other people decide, well, you know what? It doesn't matter if I get rejected 50, 60, 70 times, I'm going to keep going. I'm going to keep pitching my idea, and those are the ones that often end up more likely to make it. Where does that sort of resilient mindset come from, Marisa?",

We've seen people rejected off \"Shark Tank,\" humiliated and kicked off \"Shark Tank\" who have come back with an amazingidea and become millionaires, billionaires from it. So, it's -- you have to have an I'll show you attitude to see a rejection as like, not today, not right now, not exactly as it is, or not for us, but for someone else. So, when you hear a no, people who come back having to hear, well, no for us or no at the moment or no in the current state. And so, they go back and think, well, no, it just needs tweaking. It needs change. It needs to go to someone else. So, it's that ability to not hear a no, but to hear a no at this current moment, in that current state. But if you change your product, someone else will like it. And we know, we -- so many success stories have come out of no's, because you have to have the, I'll show you, and also to not hear they're not rejecting you, they may be rejecting a product you've created, or a part of a product, but they're not actually rejecting, not simply they're going, we don't like you, they're just rejecting something you're offering them that isn't quite right for them. It's the ability to always reframe a note, to always reframe that we don't like your product, or reframe we don't like you, when you can reframe it, you'll come back again and again because you have that bounce back factor.

So, for somepeople, the only risk is not to take the risk. You have to think, do I want this so much? Am I prepared to bet everything on it? And in life, we have to take risks. We've never gotten a plane if we wouldn't take risks. So, you can't be risk averse and be successful. You have to be willing to fail. You have to be willing to be rejected. You have to be willing to make a product that someone doesn't like. And you have to be willing to risk your money, because if you can't do that, you're not really cut out to be an entrepreneur because they are willing to have such vision and such self-belief that they will put their house on their line because they have that phenomenal self-belief. I mean, if you can't invest in yourself, why would you expect someone else to invest in your product? If you're not willing to invest in it too. And for investors, when you're willing to put your own money in, you're more interesting now because it shows again, that phenomenal self-belief.",
