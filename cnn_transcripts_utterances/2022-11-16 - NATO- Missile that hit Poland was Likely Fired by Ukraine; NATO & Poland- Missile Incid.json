It struck a village near the border with Ukraine on Tuesday and two people lost their lives. The Ukrainian Air Force is saying it will do everything it can to assist with the investigation. Russia denies all responsibility but NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the blame lies entirely with Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL: Our preliminary analysis suggests that the incident was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks. But let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility, as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is really the position now being struck by the Ukrainianauthorities are saying that they're going to cooperate fully, as you might imagine, they would with the investigations being conducted by the Polish and other NATO allies. They also say that they are using what they know words, obsolete Soviet era anti-aircraft missiles, notably, the S300, which is a pretty primitive. Originally 1970s type missile with a pretty big warhead capable of hitting things over long range, but also, nothing as sophisticated as the modern equivalents would be. Now they haven't drawn the link directly. But it's implicit in there essentially saying, look, if you give us a better kit, these kinds of accidents wouldn't happen. They're also stressing that the City of Lviv came under at least 13 cruise missile attacks from Russia. Russia has and that is a city as you know, Julia on pretty much on the border with Poland. The Russian position is that they were not conducting military operations near anywhere near the Polish border. So that is a flat out untruth, we know that three of those missiles in Lviv did get through the air defenses. But it could be around that area the Ukrainians are now accepting that they fired an anti-aircraft missile that either hit or then collapsed into hit an incoming Russian missile. And then the debris collapsed into Poland or perhaps it missed entirely. That is a kind of detail that they'll be working out. But they're not saying any more that it wasn't as much less what President Zelenskyy said yesterday, which was that they were Russian missiles. So clarity is now forming. And I think in the future, what this will actually result in is more understanding of the scale of the storm of missiles that keeps hitting Ukraine targeted at civilian infrastructure, as Secretary Austin pointed out. And again, as he pointed out the need for more sophisticated 21st century counters batteries to take them on, Julia.",

So if conceivably, there had been an attempt to strike at one of these locations deliberately by Russia that would be a massive escalation. Russia has not hinted at any stage that it might do that.

I mean, you know, I spoke to a number of the residents here, who were affected by this, they obviously heard the light explosion, it shook the windows of their houses. And they knew, of course, the two men, the two farmers who were killed in this sort of landing of this missile, in terms of the investigation is still ongoing. We're not permitted to go any closer than this point here. So it's a one street town, and the Police have blocked off that street. So we can't actually get to the place where this incident took place. But there are experts on the ground were told specialists trying to forensically piece together exactly what happened. So they can say with a high degree of certainty, where the missile came from. But already, according to the Polish Prime Minister's office and they released a statement about this. They're saying the materials they've gathered there from the scene indicates that this was a Ukrainian Air Defense interceptor missile, that successfully struck a Russian missile at the time, of course when, yesterday when Ukraine was under ferocious bombardment by dozens of Russian missiles at any given moment. And so you can see within that context, how, you know, it's still very tragic, still very a lot of anxiety here because of that. But we've stepped back from that point where the world was on edge, when it was a possibility that the Kremlin could have ordered a strike of some kind on a NATO country that does not now seem to be what's being considered.",

GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Right, but I think well, first of all, of course, everyone has enormous sympathy for Poland, and especially for the families of those two men who were killed. But this is just what happens in conflict. Some missiles will go astray, the Ukrainians are doing everything they can to protect themselves, they do have a lot of older equipment. We don't know exactly why the missile went astray at this point. We don't know if it actually had physical contact was a Russian cruise missile and was deflected, whether the electronics were bad, whether there was jamming in it. We just don't know. I'm sure the Ukrainians are going to work with NATO and try to resolve these issues. But the point is, as long as that conflict goes on, there's always the possibility of accidents. It's also the possibility that at some point, Mr. Putin will decide to escalate. And what he should have learned from this incident, even though it was an accident, and it wasn't a Russian missile. Is it NATO is on alert. NATO is resolute. NATO can come together instantly. And he or not mess with NATO.",

So this is an area in which the alliances are relatively deficient. So these assets have to be produced, they have to be organized; they have to be pushed forward. And that's been one of the most difficult challenges for Secretary Austin and the other people who are doing this during this period.

And already you're seeing this have an effect you had President elect, Villa da Silva of Brazil, having a meeting with both the U.S. and Chinese Climate Envoy today.

Of course, this would not have happened, but you're quite right. Those preliminary investigations suggested this was a Ukrainian air defense missile that was aimed at trying to intercept one of the Russian cruise missiles that had been launched against Western Ukraine on Tuesday night. Now, it was a very swift preliminary result that was given because of course of all that is at stake. Poland making it clear from last night that they were thinking of invoking Article IV which obliges NATO members to come around for discussions with the fear that that could have led on to Article V, the very quick escalation that that would have represented of course, is what is behind not just Jen Stoltenberg, very quick announcement of that preliminary conclusion, but also his very calm and measured words? And that was what was needed right now. He said, the NATO allies function together and remain calm. But of course, Julia, this also does expose some of those divisions inside of NATO that we've seen since this war began, with those closest to the borders of Ukraine and Russia calling once again, for the sort of defense system as sort of no fly zone over Ukraine that they've been calling for, for many months.

There is very little more that NATO wants to do as a block, there is always this fear of escalating antagonizing further, and it's been very cautious about that from the start. But what we have heard and we heard this from Lloyd Austin earlier on in his preliminary remarks that virtual meeting of the Ukraine contract group was that it was important to help Ukraine now bolster its air defenses. And if anything, the last 24 hours in the attacks of last night had been a reminder of just how desperately Ukraine needs those defense systems. Lloyd Austin explaining that since the last time the contact group had met, several countries have come forward and said they were hoping and had decided to do just that give Ukraine more air defense systems, and that he hoped that more would follow suit. So I think once it is NATO can't really go very much further than it has. It does focus the minds and encourage perhaps those who hadn't so far chosen to go as far as to deliver those sophisticated weapon systems were enough of them to Ukraine to go that big further. It was certainly a reminder of just how high the stakes are Julia and how close Europe is to all this?

What's interesting thing that no one wants to talk about this isbetween 150 to 200 billion every year is going to click farms fraud, et cetera. No one's talking about that. And the problem is brands are pouring this money in. And it's really not converting very well for them. Introduced now, Apple, Cookieless, Tracking et cetera and that's getting even more difficult for brands to convert sales. So brands really want to pay for successful sales. And this is what we're doing at Zilch. We're going to brands and saying, hey, guys, you know, we've got this huge, massive audience. It's swelling, it's growing, and it's doubling every six months. Do you want access to this audience? And we can actually bring you real sales, forget this click fraud, forget this cost per 1000 impressions in CPC. This is real sales we are bringing you and we circumvent that we solve that problem for brands. And so customers, what do they get out of it? What our customers get? They actually get the fact that we will take that ad revenue and use it to cover the cost of the credit for the customer. So customers getting free credit, or they're getting cash backs and deals.",

What happens if they don't pay the money back in the six weeks because it relies on you having customersthat have good enough credit that they want to perhaps spread the cost over a pay day or a monthly payday if that's the case or weekly, which also is quite beneficial. But they have to pay the money back at the end of the six weeks. What happens if they don't? Philip does it cost you? Tell me about delinquencies? What kind of delinquencies you already have, particularly as we head into a slower economic environment?",

So we're pretty proud of that. But the real trick is how we are managing to do that? So traditional lenders and credit card companies, as you'll know, I mean, you've been covering this space for some time, you've seen all of this happen. And really what they do is they squeeze the top of the funnel. In other words, they look at your FICO score, or they look at your credit experience score, and they take a standing still view of what you can afford, which, you know, we find to be pretty bizarre. That's like looking at a company and saying what you did today in sales and revenue? OK, that's how we'll judge you forever. What we do though, is we actually link open banking, we do an affordability check. But we also look at open banking. And so we look into your account, and we understand the trajectory that you're on. Are you on an upward trajectory or downward trajectory? Have you just lost your job, but you actually had a good FICO, you had a bad FICO, but you just got a new job. And we take all of that into consideration, not just one time when you apply for our product, but each and every time you use the product. So we pride ourselves on how accurate we are at predicting whether or not you can repay that really is down to us. And so actually, if we see our customers struggling to repay, we almost take that personally, we consider this to be our fault. And so we really give customers a huge variety of optionality in how they could cure their position? They can snooze for free. They could time shift all of the installments for free to align with paydays. And it's really down to us getting that affordability right not just once, but each and every time. And that's what we are discovering to be the secret here. That's why we seeing customers return and use us as much as they are at such a low default rate.",

Inthe UK, as an example, we'll give customers 90 days past the point that they owe the money back. And they'll have a variety of optionality in that. So they of course, could complain to the ombudsman. They could reach out to us and tell us they're in financial distress, we will actually provide them services to help them with this. They could set up payment plans. So they have 90 days to cure themselves in their position. If they do so then they lose access to the product. So right now, we don't pass this over to a debt collection agency. We don't do any of that. We actually just say, you know, you had this product, it's the most empowering way to pay, you're getting value each and every time you use us and you've lost the right to use the product. And that really is what happens after the 90 day period. So customers really do have a tremendous amount of time to cure themselves or change the position or get in touch and reschedule payments if that's what they need.",
