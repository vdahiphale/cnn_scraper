The IDF says that they've carried out at least 320 aerial strikes coupled with raids as they enter the, quote/unquote, \"Next phase of this war to take out Hamas.\" Here is some of the video this morning of the aftermath of some of the strikes in Gaza. Now, throughout Gaza, the humanitarian crisis, as we know, is dire. Some help is on the way with aid trucks coming in from Egypt. This morning, our crews spotted a third convoy headed to Gaza carrying food, water and medical supplies.",

It comes as Israel vows to ramp up bombardments ahead of that possible ground incursion, which could be coming quite soon.I want to let you know what has been happening here. Things have been relatively quiet in Jerusalem in the past. But in the West Bank, there has been some definite unrest. Over the weekend, there were protests. We also have been hearing of many, many raids that have been going on and dozens of arrests by the Israeli Defense Forces, arresting Palestinians. There have also been, since October 7th, about 90 Palestinians who have been killed by the Israeli military or settlers in the West Bank. So, things are not quiet across this part of Israel and the Palestinian territories. I do want to mention what is going on in Gaza, as you touched upon. It really is a humanitarian catastrophe. And we know that there are about 34 trucks that did finally get in to Gaza over the weekend. And that is just simply about 3 to 4 percent of what normally comes in when there is no war going on, but the blockade is still in place. One of the things that really strikes you is, of course, the number of people who have been killed. The Palestinian Health Ministry saying about 5,000-plus people have now been killed in Gaza, but also those who are caring for those who have been injured, which is in past 10,000 people, the doctors, the nurses, who are in these hospitals, some of which have been operating without any power. I want to let you hear from a Palestinian Red Crescent director general, who talked to us about just what those doctors and nurses are going through as they have to live in this humanitarian crisis and do their work without much help.

He says, really, it is now a humanitarian catastrophe, and there has got to be a humanitarian corridor that is allowed, as Israel continues its bombardment on Gaza.I want to get now to CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson. He is on the border with Gaza in Sderot, in Israel. You have been watching just an incredible amount of bombardments that have been happening over the last 24 hours, and you've been seeing a huge mass of Israeli military who have come to the border.

There has been an occasional incoming rocket from Gaza into this location here, and an occasional Israeli missile strike going into Gaza as well. There was a plume of smoke rising up behind me a short time ago.And though that troop buildup along the border there, multiple pressures on the Israeli prime minister and the military as they figure out what to do next, pressure from international partners who say pause to allow humanitarian aid in. Of course, that's a concern for Prime Minister Netanyahu. He feels that that will help support Hamas on the ground. That's something that they're trying to stop, obviously, and a pressure from within Israel, from Israelis who want to see Hamas set back because they are very concerned about those horrendous attacks just over two weeks ago. But when you talk to troops along the frontline, you hear from them, well, we've been told to be ready, we've been told to stand down, we've been told to be ready. But it does seem when you look at all those troops along close to the border with Gaza, then an incursion is coming precisely when we don't know. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over):  Bristling with battle-ready troops farmers' fields north of Gaza churn with the controlled fury of a nation readying for an incursion to strike Hamas, yet they are waiting with no explanation why. It feels like the early rush for battle readiness has passed. The troops are deployed standing by. The question is how long can they be kept out here.

Can they be resolved this week or will it go into the next week?And so many huge issues are waiting in action. Nothing can get done in the House until Republicans can resolve this leadership crisis that they have been battling about internally for now weeks. Now, these nine candidates will take their case behind closed doors to Republicans tonight. It's 6:30 P.M. Eastern. They'll make their case, give a pitch, and they'll answer some questions. Then tomorrow will be the vote, the leadership election. That will be actually a nominating contest. It requires just half of the House Republican conference. Whoever gets a majority of that vote will become the nominee for speaker. But a majority of the 221 Republican Conference is not 217 votes on the House floor, which is what this person, the ultimate nominee, will need. Meaning they cannot lose more than four Republicans on the floor. So how this ends is anyone's guess. There's some expectation that Tom Emmer, the Republican whip, maybe be the favor heading into tomorrow. But it is a secret ballot election, so it's hard to handicap.
