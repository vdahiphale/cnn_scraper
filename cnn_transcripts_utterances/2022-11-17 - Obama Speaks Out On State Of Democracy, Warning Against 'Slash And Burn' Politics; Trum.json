It felt, finally, someone's fighting for me. And so the problem is, can you find a candidate on the Republican side that can bring someone like her back while still turning out? Some of these voters that were really disconnected from politics, but for whatever reason, came into the fold when Donald Trump ran. And Mike Pence is a tough messenger for this too, because if you're someone like her, you're saying, look, you served this guy for four years. You said nothing but good things about him for four years, while he loved these insults, et cetera. So he's not going to have that kind of I'm done with the GOP group, come back to him.

Always fun to talk to my fellow lawyers about these issues, in particular. Because, look, first of all, he may have announced, Norm, but it doesn't mean anything actually stopped in terms of the outside investigations, the questions that were still circulating. And we just -- we showed that graphic of all the different things that were out there still, you and I have talked about this. I want to begin here because, look, I'm always wondering about the money. Who's paying for these legal bills? Who is footing the money here?",

And it was that moment everyone was talking about, about whether Trump reached for a steering wheel in anger for not being able to go down to the Capitol. Here's that moment. Remember? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CASSIDY HUTCHINSON, FORMER AIDE TO FORMER W.H. CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS: The President reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel. Mr. Engel grabbed his arm, said, sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel. We're going back to the West Wing. We're not going to the Capitol. Mr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel. And when Mr. Ornato had recounted the story to me, he had motion towards his clavicles. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

My sense is that the committee is sort of in cleanup mode, because like you said, there was a factual dispute over whether this altercation took place.Now, Cassidy Hutchinson gave that testimony, but there was some comments in the press that didn't happen. What they're doing, I think, by bringing him in, again, is just clearing it up and seeing what they can put in a report that corroborates whether this altercation happened. Now, look, even if it didn't, this is not the piece of evidence or information that's going to make or break the January 6 committee's work. What is not in dispute is that number one, the former president was not happy with the election result and to challenge it by going around the country, you know, with slates of fake electors. We know that for certain, whether he grabbed the guy's neck or shoulder or did not doesn't change the underlying sort of heft of what might come in the report and certainly doesn't change the question of whether anybody is going to be charged with a crime following -- based on the report that they put out.",

EISEN: Laura, I think we're going to see likely a one two punch. Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis charging for the fake electoral slates and the solicitation of election fraud, the election denial, alleged crimes of the 2020 election, followed by today had a big report out prosecution memo, with just security at NYU, the Mar-a-Lago document mishandling issues. Big federal exposure there, if anybody else in the country, it taken even one of those classified national security information documents with them from the White House, they would be subject to prosecution.

He could make the argument that so for instance, you know, as we've heard before that he's immune from certain kinds of suit based on having been president of the United States or that he had First Amendment issues or so on. Now, look, we can dispute and disagree with this until we're blue in the face as we're talking here, but those have to be resolved by our court. And that will certainly cause some delay in time.
