Strong words from President Biden this weekend when he announced a full pardon for his son, Hunter. We will discuss the political fallout from this. Plus, a reignited conflict in Syria as Moscow and Damascus have stepped up their strikes on rebels. And in Lebanon, we take you to Southern Lebanon as residents discover what's left of their homes. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. Presidential pardons usually come with a bit of controversy just by their own nature. And Joe Biden's latest is no exception. Over the weekend, he granted his son, Hunter, a pardon, something he previously vowed he would not do.

And no matter what you think aboutthis, whether it was great, whether it was terrible, this will be a big part of Joe Biden's legacy, one of the most consequential actions of clemency power that we've seen, frankly, in a long time. So look, everyone knew this would be highly controversial. And that's why President Biden released a lengthy statement yesterday explaining his decision to pardon his son. And I want to read for you a little bit of what he said, because he really wanted, the president, the American people, to listen to his explanation, to see, try to convince them that he did the right thing. So the president said, quote, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making. And I kept my word, even as I have watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted. All right, Bianna, two things in there. Number one, yes, Joe Biden did keep his word that he would not interfere with this investigation. As president, he technically had the power on his first day in office to fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son.He could have shut down the probe. He could have ordered the Justice Department to dismiss the charges, but he did not. He saddled the sidelines and let the process play out. But in the second part of that statement where he says that Joe -- that his son, Hunter, was selectively prosecuted because he was a Biden, I got to tell you, Hunter raised that exact argument with both of the judges in his cases and they rejected it out of hand. So Joe Biden arguing that Hunter Biden was treated unfairly, even though the judges in those cases said nothing improper had happened. And that was the justification that the president used to issue this highly consequential pardon. So what this means, Bianna, that Hunter will not be sentenced for the 12 crimes that he committed, six of them felonies. The sentencing hearing scheduled for later this month will be canceled and the cases are over.",

Rebels now in control of the whole of Idlib province, of the central part of Aleppo city, which is the center of commerce for Syria. They are pushing into the Aleppo countryside and even now on the outskirts of the central city of Hama. So this has been territorial gains that we really haven't seen, Bianna, in eight years. And the reason we haven't seen them is because in 2015 Bashar al-Assad, with the support of Russia and its air power, was able to effectively quash the rebellion. So what we see now is a vacuum. Russia distracted, obviously, with the war in Ukraine. The other sort of helpers of Bashar al-Assad in the form of Iran and Hezbollah also facing serious battle with Israel and Iran, also with its own economic crises. And that kind of left a vacuum, if you will, that the rebels appear now to be trying to exploit and seize the momentum. We are seeing after a few days where those regime forces just seem to slip away and disappear now a renewed effort by the regime and Russia's air force to try to take back some of that territory and to stop the rebels in their tracks. There have been a number of airstrikes in Aleppo, but also in Idlib, according to the White Helmets, which is the civil defense group that became so well-known during the worst of the Syrian civil war. At least 25 people have been killed in the last few days. Among the women and children, we know that in Idlib a hospital was hit. And so all around, there is now a sort of sense of unease. On the one hand, Bashar al-Assad, for all the war crimes he has committed, does not have many proponents. But on the other hand, there is a sense that further instability and violence in Syria could really only bring about more anxiety, more unrest in a region that is already so fraught and so deeply immersed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Bianna.",

But eventually, when Al-Nusra was pushed up into the north by Assad's forces and Russia with Russian help, it had to deal with Turkey and the rest of the world, and it began to shed. And its Al-Qaeda elements that wanted to have a universal caliphate and so forth, it shed them and it has become a nationalist revolutionary group now. An analog might be the Taliban or Hamas. It wants to take over Syria, and it has said that it will deal with everybody. And as you say, Al-Julani has reached out to Aleppo's Christians, which are very important in an effort to assure them that he will not persecute them as happened in the past, and that they will be safe. And that's what he's saying. Of course, many Christians are terrified that he, you know, the liquor stores are being smashed and Christmas trees taken down, but Christians have not been attacked.

In other statements like this, you know, the Israeli military has typically said that it was because new intelligence had surfaced or something else. But in this case, they simply stated that they found out that he had been killed on October 7th, confirming his death and statements from the family and the hostage family forum, as well as political leaders here in Israel and in the United States, then quickly followed. So it's not clear exactly what the new information was that led to this knowledge. But President Biden, in his statement, alongside the First Lady Jill Biden, saying that they were devastated and outraged to learn of Omer Neutra's death. They noted that as a tank commander on the Israel-Gaza border, he was among the first to respond to Hamas' attack on October 7th. But, of course, the most devastating aspect of this is for Omer Neutra's family itself. You know, his parents, less than a month ago, were at the White House meeting with President Biden, advocating for what they hoped would be their sons safe return. For more than a year now, they have held out hope that Omer Neutra might indeed still be alive and might return home alive as part of a hostage deal. Unfortunately, according to the Israeli military, Neutra was killed on October 7th and his body is still being held hostage to this day by Hamas. We know that there are some 101 hostages who are being held hostage by Hamas. The Israeli government has assessed that perhaps as many as half of them are still alive. And the clock is obviously ticking for those who are indeed still alive. As we see the humanitarian conditions in Gaza worsening, no doubt also impacting the hostages themselves. What we have seen in the wake of this ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has certainly been some renewed optimism from both American and Israeli officials that perhaps a ceasefire and hostage deal can be reached in the wake of that ceasefire with Hezbollah because they believe that Hamas is increasingly isolated, that that regional war that they had perhaps hoped to spark with Iran entering the fray has not yet materialized and doesn't appear to be materializing anytime soon. And so perhaps now Hamas increasingly isolated would give in to some of these negotiating demands that the Israelis have made. It does appear that these negotiations are quietly resuming whether or not they can actually achieve a deal, as the Israeli Prime Minister says he wants a ceasefire, but will still not end the war that remains to be seen.

Kristen Holmes, thanks so much.And now returning to one of our top stories this hour, U.S. President Joe Biden has pardoned his son, Hunter, who faced sentencing this month for federal tax and gun convictions. The pardon spares the president's son from a potential prison sentence, and it's wide-ranging going back 10 years. Sunday's controversial move comes after President Biden repeatedly insisted that his son would not receive a pardon or special treatment in his criminal cases. The president explained in a statement, quote, no reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's case or cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son and that it and that it -- and that is wrong. Time now for The Exchange. Let's talk more about Hunter Biden's pardon. Joining me for this discussion is CNN political commentator, Paul Begala. And also with me is Asa Hutchinson, a resident fellow at Harvard Institute of Politics and the former governor of Arkansas. Good to have you both with me. Thank you so much for taking the time. Let's start with you, Paul, and going back to more of President Biden's lengthy statement in explaining his decision. He also said, I have watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted. I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. The same words we hear now from President Trump. And \"The New York Times\" Peter Baker, says that President Biden and President-elect Donald J. Trump now seem to agree on one thing, that the Biden Justice Department has been politicized.

You may like his policies, you may not like his policies. He's a surprisingly good dad. And he's only got one surviving son. And that son is a recovering addict. And all of us know people who have struggled with addiction. That said, the argument that the president made only feeds Mr. Trump's false, I think, narrative, that the Justice Department is somehow unfair or political. Our Justice Department is the standard of the world. And it's not unfair and it's not political. It does make mistakes, but it's not the kind of corrupt hellhole that Mr. Trump tries to pretend it is. And it's really unfortunate when Joe Biden feeds that narrative. He could have just said, look, my son paid all the taxes back and penalties and interest years before any charges were brought. And he only had that gun for 11 days. And yet, he checked a box that said he wasn't an addict when in fact that he was. But those cases are never brought unless there's another crime, like an assault or a gun for a bit of murder or armed robbery. So you could make the case on the merits that this was a good case for a pardon. But when you say the Justice Department became political, that you're just feeding Mr. Trump's false narrative.",

And he's going to have hands off and not touch it and not do a part of it. And so he undermines the rule of law, first of all, by reversing what he said. And then sadly, by making it clear that there's going to be double standards in our system of justice. And he's going to undermine it with this pardon. And he had a lot of options here. And I think this is important to note. Hunter Biden had -- was found guilty and he pled guilty to serious felony offenses. And then he's waiting sentencing. So President Biden could have waited and then commuted the sentences so that he didn't have to serve time in prison, but he recognizes the wrongdoing. So there are a lot of options there to make sure that justice was served in a fair way. And he took it too far. And I think that will be really a tarnish on his legacy.",

So, clearly, Donald Trump, based upon what he said during the campaign and what he continues to say, will pardon a vast majority of the January 6 defendants. I think the question is, is whether he's going to do it carte blanche or whether he's going to look at it individually and say, no, this was too great of an act of violence.
