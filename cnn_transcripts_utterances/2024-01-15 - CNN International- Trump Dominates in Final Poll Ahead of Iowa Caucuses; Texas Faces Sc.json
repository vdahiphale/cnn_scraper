We don't know if other countries will step up commitments and things like that. But it is big. The exercise is big. NATO has called it the biggest collective defense deployment since the end of the Cold War. Obviously, the point of this is that the war in Ukraine is ongoing and the warnings have been stepping up that if Ukraine cannot fend off Putin, that Putin might go further. This is what Grant Shapps says in his statement, that this will provide vital reassurance against the Putin menace. But look, the U.K. is facing multiple challenges now to its military on multiple fronts, not just the sort of defense industry challenge of providing more and more equipment to Ukraine. We just saw that two and a half billion pounds, some $3 billion commitment last week for the next couple of years. But now, of course, with the Red Sea and the U.K. taking part in those attacks on targets in Yemen with the U.S. and we're set to hear from Rishi Sunak later on today, he will have to face the Commons on that issue.
