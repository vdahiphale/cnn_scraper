So, that is a big discussion here. The second discussion that's happening, frankly, is what happens exactly a week from today. That's Janet Yellen's earliest date. At that point, she said yesterday to the CNBC CEO Council, there's not enough money to pay all the obligations. I think you assume they pay the interest on our debt and they pay any principal payments to investors, but that means Social Security checks will likely not be cut. That means government contractors could not see payments. We don't know exactly what that's look like. The Treasury Department hasn't said how they'll pick and choose which bills to pay. But right now, we are sitting in front of only bad choices. That's what we're looking at right now, only a bunch of really bad choices here, unless by some miracle they were to raise this debt ceiling and continue talking.

COLLINS:  Also this morning, the chief of Russia's Wagner mercenary group says his fighters are beginning to withdraw from Bakhmut. Of course, he said this before, but he now says they are going to start handing over the city to the Russian army and complete their exit by June 1st.

The Ukrainians fighting hard for it, obviously, the Russians poured immense resources into this as well, specifically this Wagner private military company.And this morning, there was a video that was released by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner private military company, going through essentially the ruins of that town. It's been completely annihilated and telling his fighters to go and pack up their things because they are leaving. He says that they are going to go to the rear echelon. They are going to rest and regroup there and wait for new orders, as they put it. Let's listen to some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Some of the most valuable pieces include hundreds of bronze and silver coins, archaeological coins and also jewelry.
