I don't know that they got close to solutions. But that was a really key moment because I think it highlights the core of the problem. Moving forward, TikTok is saying they're going to fix this by housing the data here in the United States, but they can't really say that in the past or even right now that data is not vulnerable. So I think that is at the heart of the issue here and it's why that hearing got so contentious. But when I talked to -- I mean, we had some TikTok influencers on last night but we also had a lot of experts on who say that this is not just TikTok's problem.",

It appears to show the aftermath of a U.S. airstrike in eastern Syria against facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran. Now, the strike comes after an Iranian-made drone attacked a coalition base in northeast Syria killing one U.S. contractor and injuring five U.S. service members and another American. In response, the U.S. carried out this precision airstrike in eastern Syria. That is according to the Pentagon.So joining us right now Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill. She's on the Armed Services Committee and is a former Navy helicopter pilot, and we're so happy to have her this morning. Good morning to you. Thank you very much. First of all, what is your reaction to these airstrikes? REP. MIKIE SHERRILL (D-NJ):  Well, I sit on, as you said, the House Armed Services Committee and we just heard testimony yesterday from CENTCOM about the Iranian threat. So to see these drone strikes was really concerning given what we've seen Iran doing with their drones across the world, not just in Syria but certainly supplying Russia in the Ukraine war. And so, I think what we saw with the response by the United States as promised from the president and the secretary of Defense -- it was measured. It was not meant to be escalatory. But certainly, you cannot attack U.S. service members and have -- and U.S. contractors and have that go unmet with equal force.",
