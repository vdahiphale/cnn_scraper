Former tabloid boss David Pecker telling a New York court how he buried true and false stories that could hurt Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. Deepening divides. Pro-Palestinian protesters arrested amid escalating tensions on U.S. college campuses. Cartoon controversy, questions over whether U.S. studios unknowingly used animations created in North Korea. And Voyager revitalized. NASA's deep space probe finally phones home from 15 billion miles away. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, gripping scenes in a New York courtroom today at Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial, David Pecker, a former tabloid publisher who's known Trump for years, testified for nearly two hours. He admitted to catching and killing stories that may have been damaging to candidate Trump during his first run for the White House. The day began with a contentious hearing on whether Trump had violated a gag order. He's banned from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors. Trump slammed the gag order while speaking to reporters outside the courtroom. Paula Reid has a look at the second day of testimony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker back on the witness stand today where he shared details of his decade's long friendship with Donald Trump and how he eventually used his position to help Trump in the 2016 election. Under questioning from prosecutors, Pecker described a meeting he had with Trump and his former attorney, Michael Cohen, in 2015, where they asked, what can I do, and what my magazine could do to help the campaign? Pecker testified that he responded saying, what I would do is I would run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump, and I would publish negative stories about his opponents. I said, I would be your eyes and ears. He told the jury he saw the agreement as mutually beneficial. It would help his campaign and it would also help me. Pecker said he began meeting with Cohen a minimum of every week, and if there was an issue, could be daily. He said would go directly to Cohen when confronted with a negative story about Trump. The prosecution questioned Pecker in detail about a doorman who tried to sell a story about Trump allegedly fathering a child with another woman as Trump sat in court and shook his head. Packer said he directed the editor of the Enquirer to negotiate a number, a price to buy the story and take it off the market. The doorman was paid $30,000 for the story, even though it later proved to be false. Pecker told the court, if the story got out to another publication or another media outlet, it would have been very embarrassing to the campaign. Pecker claimed if the story were true, it would probably be the biggest sale of the National Enquirer since the death of Elvis Presley. But then admitted if it were true, he wouldn't have published the story until after the election. But before Pecker even took the stand, the proceedings began with a heated hearing on the gag order imposed on Trump in this case. The prosecution asked the judge to order Trump to remove specific posts they allege violate the gag order and fine him $1,000 for each of the alleged violations. And remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary? The defense attorney, Todd Blanche, argued that Trump did not willfully violate the gag order and claimed Trump believes reposting others assertions or content is not a violation. But the hearing became heated at one point with the judge telling Blanche, you're losing all credibility with the court. Paula Reid, CNN New York. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In August of 2015, there was a meeting among Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, and David Pecker, and atthat meeting in the Trump Tower, they hatched a three-legged stool called The Scheme to do three things. One, to publish stories that help Trump. Two, to publish stories that trash Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. But the third leg of that school was to catch and kill stories that would be damaging to Donald Trump.

Here at Emerson, we're seeing this large crowd of just over 20 tents set up here in this alleyway leading up to the college signage. Food, water. This is a very organized demonstration happening here. Over at MIT, we saw just over 20 tents in front of the chapel in solidarity with the students at Columbia University, but they were quiet. Listen, a lot of these students were on their laptops. Frankly, it appears just doing homework. They had the signs up. They were welcoming people to conversations and discussions, and there have been no reports of any arrest there or here at Emerson College. But we did get a sense on campus of the differences of opinions. There was a student organization, MIT Israel Alliance, that actually wrote to school leadership saying that they felt unsafe on campus. Claiming that a lot of the students had actually left their dorms ahead of Passover and are staying with relatives just because they felt so unsafe on campus. Claiming also that the encampment was anti-Jewish. Then there's a different Jewish group called the MIT Jews for a Ceasefire. And I asked them specifically about that. Here was their response.

Let's broaden this out,because this, obviously, was part of -- and is a part of a broader package of House approved aid so far for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan, of course, and others in the Indo-Pacific. One senior senator, Bernie Sanders, came out today and called on the Senate to vote to strip offensive military aid to Israel as a result. And if we look across the country, there are voters, Democrats in particular, that are very conscious and aware of what's taking place in Gaza. And I think perhaps would have some sympathy for this. Fine, you can have aid. You don't get weaponry. Congressman, where do you stand on that?",

The restrictions that will be on this aid and any other arms transfers to Israel or any other country, they have to comply with humanitarian law. So, in other words, there can't be blockage of massive humanitarian aid now or into the future. And after the World Food Kitchen incident, we have to absolutely make sure of that. The other thing is it has to comply with the rules of war. And so, we are waiting for those certifications, of course, from the White House by May 8th. But in the meantime, you know, we have to make sure Iron Dome, Arrow -- the Arrow system, Iron Beam, and the other defensive systems are fully replenished.
