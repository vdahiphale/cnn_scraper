      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Kristin Fisher. Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.This massive winter storm system is barreling towards the East Coast this hour and its Arctic chill is straining the nation's power grids, closing airports from coast to coast and causing deadly road conditions on one of the busiest travel days of the year. Look at this video that we just got in from Hamburg, New York snowing and flooding on the coast at the same time. Deep floodwaters across New England are a huge concern heading into the weekend as temperatures continue to drop. In nearby Buffalo, officials have closed the airport and canceled all flights, you can see why. And over 70 million Americans are experiencing below freezing temperatures and that includes the entire State of Texas. And even if you're not freezing, it's bad news if you're waiting on any last minute Christmas gifts to arrive; Amazon, the U.S. Post Office, the UPS, FedEx all warning that the storm has hit major shipping hubs nationwide and deliveries will be delayed. So we have CNN's Polo Sandoval really in the center of it all live in Buffalo, New York. Polo, last time I saw you, you were walking out of the blizzard. We could barely even see you. This time, you're still standing right in the thick of it. How is it - how has it been over the last hours since we spoke?",

      "sentences": "Kristin, I'm glad you showed our viewers that triple threat that folks here have been facing. You have the flooding, you have the wind, you have the flash freezing, that is why this is an extraordinary storm that's hitting Buffalo. It snows in Buffalo, right, that's hardly news, but a level - a storm of this level, many locals have told me it makes sense that it would be once in a generation, right?Now, in terms of what we're seeing on the ground here, you could see - well, you cannot see really much because of the whiteout conditions and it makes sense that the airport is closed. And also we have seen people largely staying at home occasionally a passerby, very few vehicles, actually the last car I saw drive by here was about an hour ago, so that certainly is good to know. But at the same time, we also heard from the Erie County executive, Mark Poloncarz, who said that they're still getting reports of people violating what is a driving ban that's in place here in Erie County even have had to go out and rescue some stranded drivers because it is, in some cases, impossible to see beyond the hood of your car and that's why the big warning right now for officials is to simply stay home, right? Power outages, however, that is something that is certainly going to be a big issue for many residents around here. They have received many reports of power outages with category one hurricane level winds that comes with the possibility of downed power lines and that means power outages. So even at one of the warming centers here in Buffalo, they've had to relocate some of the residents there to another facility because they experienced a power outage, so nobody is being spared the fury of this wicked winter storm and it is going to be far from over too, Kristin, as we go into tonight, possibly into tomorrow. New York governor, Kathy Hochul, saying people should resist the urge to head out and try to meet with family this Christmas in or around the Buffalo area. FISHER: Yes. For folks that were wishing for a white Christmas up there, they sure got it. Polo Sandoval, thank you so much. So the South is also getting hit hard by these bone chilling temperatures. You've got power grids in places like Memphis under tremendous strain. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam live in Atlanta. Derek, what are you seeing and feeling?",

Doug, you just heard Derek say that it's about 12 degrees there, the Mayor asking everybody to conserve energy. But did you anticipate the possibility of having to implement these rolling blackouts that we saw across Memphis earlier today? DOUG MCGOWAN, PRESIDENT, MEMPHIS LIGHT, GAS &amp; WATER: Good afternoon, Kristin. I know we did not. This is an unusual phenomenon across the Tennessee Valley. What happened this morning was that the TVA lost a substantial generation capacity largely due to the cold weather. And for about two hours, we were on an emergency load curtailment with very little notice. That is an unusual circumstance for us that we have never had to implement. Thankfully, we were only under that notice for about two hours, power has since been restored. The issue here is that once you turn power off, sometimes it's difficult to get it to come back on. We're thankful that just under 5 percent of our 40 - 431,000 customers were affected, and we're doing all we can to get their power restored as quickly as we can.",

We'll turn it off for 30 minutes and then we'll de-energize another set of circuits and re- energize the original one so that no one is without power longer than 30 minutes.We realize it's an inconvenience, but here in Memphis, that would have been about twice a day that people would have experienced that.

The first legislative response to the Capitol attack. The January 6 Committee investigating the insurrection is out with its long-awaited final report and it places the blame for the attack on the Capitol squarely on the former president saying this in part and I quote, \"The central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.\" The Committee recommends that he never be allowed to hold office again and CNN's Jessica Schneider joins me now.

So they published these eight chapters where they expanded on what we saw over the summer at the public hearings and they did detail how they say that Trump singularly laid the groundwork for that breach of the Capitol on January 6th.The Committee though also made nearly a dozen recommendations and the big one was that they recommend barring Trump from ever holding office again. The Committee pointed out the 14th Amendment of the Constitution section three, it clearly states that anyone who is engaged in an insurrection can be disqualified from holding office. So the Committee is saying here that that constitutional provision should be enforced when it comes to Trump. Of course, earlier this week, the Committee also officially made criminal referrals against Trump to the DOJ on for criminal charges. Of course DOJ does not have to take that, that is just a recommendation. And the Committee is also urging Congress to overhaul the Electoral Count Act to make clear that vice presidents do not have the power to overturn elections, of course, as Trump wanted Mike Pence to. The House and Senate have already made steps passing legislation in that direction. So Kristin, a lot to unwind here and a lot to go through, but those big recommendations from the Committee, of course, at the same time, the criminal investigation both at the state level and from the Special Counsel on the federal level still ongoing and potentially could wrap up in the - or ramp up, I should say, in the coming months ahead.",

He continued to try and challenge this certification of the elections and he spurred his supporters to storm the Capitol. And what we're seeing here more and more, his base still stands by him. But there are more and more rational Republicans who are understanding that it's time to turn the page from Donald Trump. He was wrong about election fraud.

That is probably what many people would say who are partisans like myself.However, the reason I say that you have to hold off it really waits until this primary cycle. If there are 10, 12 individuals who run for president of the United States, under the banner of the Republican Party, Donald Trump has a great opportunities to win that nomination again. And then as much as we sit here and say that it's time to turn the page, we've seen what Republicans do when they know the truth about Donald Trump. They show up and vote for him anyway.
