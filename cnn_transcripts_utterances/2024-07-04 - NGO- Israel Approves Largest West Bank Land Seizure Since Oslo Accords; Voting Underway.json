Joe Biden tells an interviewer he screwed up during the CNN debate. But he's vowing to stay in the presidential race. And Hurricane Beryl continues to barrel through the Caribbean heading for Mexico, will bring you a live report. Israeli authorities have approved the largest land seizure in the West Bank since the Oslo Accords were signed back in 1993. A declaration by the Israeli military's Civil Administration Department said an area of more than 3000 acres in the West Bank was now state owned land, according to Israeli NGO peace now. Rights groups criticized the move, saying it would make it even harder to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. It comes as Israel's conflict with Hezbollah on its northern border heats up. Israel said it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday. The IDF says Hezbollah launched around 200 rockets and 20 drones towards Israel. The IDF responded by attacking targets in Southern Lebanon.

If you could say that, because this is really whatwe've been seeing over recent months that tensions rise for a few days. And then they simmer down to this low intensity fighting that we have really seen on that border since the Hamas attacks of October 7. Now this started on Wednesday, this latest sporadic escalation when a senior commander was killed in Southern Lebanon by Israel. Now that was responded to by Lebanon by around 200 missile and rocket launchers. We understand at this point that we haven't heard from Israel, how many were intercepted, or how many hit their mark. But we do know that there were a number of fires that had been started in Northern Israel by this barrage. And we also know that the Israeli military says that they have targeted a number of what they call Hezbollah, sites, that infrastructure in Southern Lebanon as well. So we have been seeing this increase in tensions every so often, doesn't necessarily mean it is the escalation that everybody fears at this point. And certainly we've seen, there have been visitors to the region, the U.S. envoy, for example, that Amos Hochstein just in the past week or so in the region to try and lower tensions and try and come up with some kind of deal between the two sides to make sure that this isn't a second front that is opening up.

U.S. President Joe Biden telling concern Democratic governors, he's in it to win it. President Biden met with some two dozen governors at the White House on Wednesday night trying to calm growing calls for him, to exit the presidential race after his halting debate performance. That was in Atlanta, of course on CNN last week. After the meeting, several governors publicly reaffirmed their support for the President. But privately, there's deep worry amongst Democrats that Mr. Biden will not only lose to Donald Trump in November, but drag down congressional Democrats in the process, too. Now, some Democrats are already gaming out potential ways to replace President Biden as the party's nominee. CNN's Brian Todd has that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If President Biden leaves the race analysts say it would almost certainly have to be his decision to bow out voluntarily. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES: It's unlikely that if Joe Biden does not step down voluntarily, that there would be a different nominee at the top of the ticket. TODD (voice-over): If he doesn't voluntarily leave, someone in the Democratic Party could try to replace him by introducing an open nomination process at the Democratic National Convention in August. But that scenario is unlikely. Still, even if the president decides on his own to quit the race, the process for replacing him is uncertain, and somewhat messy.",

All of you delegates that signed on for me have to now support this other candidate. That's not how it works. Those delegates would essentially be free to move in the way they want. TODD (voice-over): Like the days of old backroom deals and lobbying could prevail at the convention, as potential nominees tried to convince the delegates to get behind them.

They would often say, look, he does all of this international travel. He travels around the world meets with foreign leaders that are a sign of his strength and stamina. And now it's a little puzzling that they are saying, well, part of the reason that he did not do so well on the debate stage last night was due to the jet lag, and the travel that he had to endure at the start of June, even though he had nearly a week and a half back in the U.S. and a week spending time at Camp David with his campaign team preparing for this debate. But it all comes as so many questions continue to swirl around President Biden's standing in this race. He is trying to reassure allies publicly and privately that he intends to remain in this race. But he is facing significant headwinds as there are Democrats who are publicly coming out saying that he should step aside at least two House Democrats have done so. And we were told that in a meeting with top party leadership in the House last night that some top Democrats said that they do believe it's time for Biden to step aside, while others expressed worry about what it would mean and the frenzy it might cause if Biden were to leave the race and then leave a vacuum at the top of the Democratic ticket. Now yesterday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted that the President is not going anywhere that he will remain in this race till the end. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They've had gusts upwards of 55 miles per hour in the Cayman Islands this morning gusts right now we're over 40 miles per hour. The Cayman Islands getting the brunt of this right now, here are some of these ingredients but that was talking about the wind shear upstairs in the atmosphere that is allowing the intensity to come down some especially as it heads towards Mexico. But it will maintain that hurricane strength as it heads towards the Yucatan Peninsula. You're looking at it making landfall somewhere maybe near Cancun, Cozumel or anywhere down towards Belize, and we're looking at storm surge up to four to six feet, that's two meters of storm surge, plus all of that heavy rain. And then it will head back into the Gulf of Mexico where these waters here very warm and it could maybe briefly intensify again, rain totals, again, across the Yucatan Peninsula, we're looking at some four to six inches, maybe even up to 10 inches and some high elevations that could cause some flash flooding, as we go through the day tomorrow. And maintains hurricane strength, that's where we have hurricane warnings in effect for parts of Mexico there, then this is what I was talking about gets back into the Gulf of Mexico and might be able to intensify into a hurricane again before it sets its eyes on somewhere between the Mexico and Texas border there in the U.S. where it can make that additional landfall. So something that we'll have to watch very closely when it comes to rain, rip currents and storm surge right there along the coast of Mexico and Texas.
