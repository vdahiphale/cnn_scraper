The humanitarian relief that has been piling up across the border in Egypt and dozens of trucks that we have seen, we are told that the first delivery is scheduled to be 20 or so trucks of that aid but that is just a small drop in the bucket compared to the 100 trucks a day that the United Nations has Gazans need.

And they're about to explode because they heard President Biden's speech last night and they are not -- they don't believe the words, they believe the facts and the deeds.And what they heard is $14 billion in military aid to the Israelis without conditionality, which is, for them, was an important paramount. The Egyptians and the Jordanians were asking the president to put on the table some kind of pressure on Israel for humanitarian aid for Gaza, but above all to basically end the military occupation of the West Bank and to freeze the settlements. And President Biden, my understanding from talking to a diplomat in the region, he did not do it or he basically took time, said, you know, it's not the moment, let's delay, there's something else. But they've been telling him, without that, we cannot control the public opinion. We cannot control our people who've been flooding the streets. I mean, today in the Tahrir Square, the place where the Arab Spring took place, hundreds of thousand people went to that square. And what did they say? What did they chant? Freedom, bread and social justice. These were the slogans of the Arab Spring. Sisi doesn't like Hamas. He hates them. He loathes them.

And it was interesting to see the Saudis and other Arab leaders said, this is what -- this is the equation annexation and settlements. That means you will have Hamas. In some form you will have radicalization. So, you have to decide go back to the '67 borders, give Palestinians sovereignty, give Palestinians freedom. And when President Biden talked about this, it was interesting because he was not heard. What they heard is we will give you a charity, which is $100 million, food and whatever, which is okay for now. But, ultimately, Arab leaders want a solution on the table. They want freedom for Palestinians and end of the occupation. [22:10:01] KAYYEM:  Yes, I think that's right. I mean, what's interesting is it's not being heard. But, you know, when Biden says he supports Israel, the second part of that paragraph is, and I'm meeting or I'm talking to Arab leaders about Palestinian self-rule, essentially. And we've both been around a while. I have not heard a U.S. president talk about the Palestinians in a very long time, let alone other Arab countries. The Arab rulers have not been great to the Palestinians either.

There was just a $5 billion bridge Blackstone and others had committed to build this high-speed railway connecting the Palestinian Authority, connecting the West Bank to Hamas, but Hamas to that -- to Gaza. But we have to -- that has to be replaced. And Dennis Ross had a very good suggestion on some sort of an interim authority, some sort of a Gaza interim authority until the Palestinian authorities ready to come and take control. But Hamas has to be eradicated. There's not a single Arab leader that wants Hamas to stay there despite whomever is chanting on the street. And they have oil money to use to take Iran's influence out of the equation here. And also, there's a lot of U.S. support. We have 160 major U.S. CEOs in the last few days -- have come around and said they're fully behind, very full-throated support of Israel and quite condemning of the atrocities of Hamas.",

And this time, it is the person who is at the heart of the fake elector's plot. Pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro pleading guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Now, prosecutors are recommending that he serve five years ofprobation, and he's also agreed to testify in future court proceedings. I want to bring in now Kenneth Chesebro's Attorney, Scott Grubman. Scott, thank you for being here. Look, today your client has now implicated Trump in this criminal conspiracy. If he is called upon to testify in this Georgia case, is he willing to implicate Trump on a witness stand, which seems to be required in this plea deal that he just struck? SCOTT GRUBMAN, KENNETH CHESEBRO'S ATTORNEY:  So, Abby, first of all, thank you so much for having me. Second of all, I am going to respectfully disagree with you on one thing. I don't think he implicated anyone but himself. And I just want to point out two important facts that I think will get exactly to your question. Not only did he avoid jail time, but this is the most important. He did not plead guilty to the RICO charge. Mr. Chesbro pled guilty and I printed it out to make sure I had the exact words. conspiracy to commit filing of false documents. The RICO charge was dismissed. And listen, Mr. Chesebro accepted the responsibility for count 15 of the indictment. And he agreed that if he were called by the state, he would come testify truthfully. And he is a man of his word and he will do that. Whether his testimony is going to be helpful to the state, that's going to be for the state to decide. I personally do not see his testimony being helpful for the state, but if the state wants to call him, he absolutely can come and tell the truth. And if they think that's helpful for them, and they think they could convince a jury that his testimony is helpful for them, then so be it.",

They discussed the filing of some legal litigation in an effort to fight the election results.So, one of the emails says, reportedly, \"I particularly agree that getting this on file gives more ammo to the justices fighting for the court to intervene. I think the odds of action before January 6th will become more favorable if the justices start to fear that there will be, quote, wild chaos on January 6th unless they rule by then either way.\" That was notably just a couple of days after Trump sent that tweet, \"will be wild on January 6th\".

I had never made that connection. The state never made that connection. I've never seen any evidence to suggest that. The same word was used, yes, and that is very unfortunate.

He would simply talk about the facts. And of course, the jury would have to decide whether that's supportive of one side or the other. But let me say this, Mr. Chesbro would will absolutely go testify if called. But he'll also go testify if called by the defendant.
