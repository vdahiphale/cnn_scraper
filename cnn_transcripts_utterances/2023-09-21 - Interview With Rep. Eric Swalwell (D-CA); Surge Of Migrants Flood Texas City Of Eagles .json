The words of a frustrated House Speaker Kevin McCarthy describing members of his own party, as government funding and his own job are on the line.Also a CNN exclusive, more evidence of the Coast Guard failing to act on allegations of sexual misconduct, this time involving a captain turned college president. And later the outgoing chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley unloads on the former president. So when the going gets tough, Congress goes home. Tonight, there are signs that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is losing or has lost control of Republicans in the House. The consequence for him might be his job is in jeopardy, for America, a functioning open government is in jeopardy. A shutdown is in just days away, and in the face of that reality, McCarthy sent the House home for a long weekend, mostly because he could not get his Republican members to agree to anything else. I'm John Berman in for Anderson and the scene today on Capitol Hill was one for the history books. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine was in Washington working around the clock and around the world to save his country from the Russian invasion, shaking hands and shaking the bipartisan trees for crucial aid. So with freedom on the line in Ukraine, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy decided to send Congress home, but only after a spectacular miscalculation and failure. It is arcane procedural stuff, but the bottom line is, McCarthy thought he had the votes to pass the Defense spending bill. There was the proverbial optimism in the morning. It turns out, he was wrong, way wrong. He did not even have the votes to get it on the floor. That doesn't happen in DC. And now what has happened to McCarthy twice in just days, the speaker was visibly frustrated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):        It's frustrating the sense that I don't understand why anybody votes against bringing the idea and having the debate, and then you've got all the amendments if you don't like that. This is a whole new concept of individuals that just want to burn the whole place down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In his roughly eight months as speaker he has failed to pass the simple procedural votes known as rules three times.John Boehner and Paul Ryan, the two previous Republican speakers never lost these simple votes, neither did Democrat Nancy Pelosi when she was speaker. Dennis Hastert only lost two in eight years. It says something that only eight months in and Kevin McCarthy is no Dennis Hastert. But this breakdown is not just about one military spending bill, there are 11 spending bills out of 12 that Republicans can't agree on with a deadline looming nine days before the government shuts down, but this really is not even about those 12 spending bills in general, it is about who is driving this, who was in charge, who can make things happen? Firebrand Florida Congressman Matt Gates, who has been a constant thorn in McCarthy 's side seems to think it might be him. He is issuing a threat to any Republicans looking for a temporary fix, who might be willing to work with Democrats to, you know, actually keep the government functioning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): There will not be sufficient Republican votes for a continuing resolution. Now, if we've got some of these moderate Republicans who want to go and join up with the Democrats, they will be signing their own political death warrant, and they will be handing it to their executioner. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: McCarthy might not be able to keep his job if he works with Democrats, even if some Republicans want to, like this one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL LAWLER (R-NY): I am not going to be party to a shutdown. It does not serve a purpose. By the way you save no money, you're going to end up costing the American people more money with the shutdown, so it's really illogical. At the end of the day, any final bill is going to be bipartisan, and if somebody doesn't realize that, they're truly clueless. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so they do a lot of things because they're afraid of losing their jobs.So again, why don't he show the same honor that, you know, Mitt Romney has shown throughout the years in choosing what's right over his job. And I promise you, once he figures that out, he'll see that the Democrats will work with him as we did to pay America's bills and lift the debt ceiling, we'll do that on the shutdown, we'll do that to fund the Ukraine. And they don't even have a Plan B, and the second, he realizes that these chaos agents don't have a Plan B, and they don't even want to Plan B, he will be a stronger speaker and the country will be better off.",

He knows how to interfere in our elections, and so he will probably turn the dial up on doing that.But John, I have too long given Republicans the benefit of the doubt that they're serious when they say that they're going to stand up for Taiwan if China invades it. And now, I think we all have to question whether that's really the case, because they're flinching and they're backing away from Ukraine. And if they back away from Ukraine, one, we're not going to have any help in the world to go against China if they invade Taiwan, and two, I don't think Taiwan should even believe that Republicans are up for a fight that would defend freedom. So there's a lot more at stake than just Ukraine's freedom. It's Taiwan's freedom and both of those are linked to our freedom here in America.",

It is very costly as Congressman Lawler said and Swalwell.But look, this is -- John, this is not a hard problem to solve. Lawler and Swalwell are right. There will be a bipartisan solution. The way this will end, in all likelihood, is the Senate will pass a bill with over 70 votes that will fund the government, provide for some disaster assistance, and also provide for some Ukraine funding, and then they'll send it over to the US House. And then that's when the speaker has to make a decision. If he puts that bill on the floor, it will pass with a strong bipartisan majority, and of course, that would then, the hardliners who are torturing him right now, will then move to vacate. But that's the answer and it's not hard to do this. I mean, right now, the House cannot pass any appropriations bills, they couldn't pass a Defense spending bill, couldn't even bring it up. I mean, three times it failed over the last few days. So I mean, this is complete and utter dysfunction. So the bottom line, we don't have to be in this predicament. This is a circular firing squad of their own making and they can simply get out of it just by McCarthy can go to Hakeem Jeffries right now and say, hey, I need some help on the rule vote. I need some vote on the final vote. And you know, I bet they get the votes. But then again, he would have that hard flank just wanting to take him down faster.",
