The prosecution's third witness will return to the stand this morning. House Speaker Gary Farrow, he's expected to outline how Michael Cohen used a home equity line of credit on his own property to pay adult film star Stormy Daniels that $130,000 to cover up an alleged affair with Donald Trump ahead of the 2016 election. And of course, this is all related to those 34 felony counts of falsifying business records of the former president is charged with. He has denied all those charges. Both Daniels and Michael Cohen are expected to testify later on in this trial, when will the prosecution is keeping their witness list and that planning very close to the -- but we will have much more from here in downtown Manhattan a little bit later in the hour, Becky.",

And what we're saying is that there's a genocide going on in Gaza being funded by our government that our university is profiting off of. And I think that if they can use some tactic to portray us all as some sort of hateful mob, then they can go on with ignoring our message. And so that's why I think it's important for me and all of my fellow Jewish students to come forward and say that we've been part of this from the beginning. And there's no room for hate.

So you know, here at this fountain you see behind me, it's a popular place for graduates here to take their senior year pictures.

Additionally, the university says it will commit to supporting Palestinian students and staff including fully funding the cost of attendance for five Palestinian students, the school also construct community space for Middle Eastern and North African Muslim students. So what we're getting here is quite a different atmosphere and response depending on where it is that you are. At University in the States, or what we are reporting on. We'll hear from a Jewish American student about why he's joining the protests at the University of Texas in Austin later this hour. Let me bring in Polo Sandoval now, who is in Columbia, outside Columbia University. Interesting positioning by Northwestern there, it is taking a position -- in supporting space, funding -- and funding for an Arab students and staff.

Blinken was in Riyadh just yesterday where I was. And it was absolutely clear as I listened to him making that speech that he you know he genuinely believes this is an offer, which is not only extraordinarily generous.

We had that day off yesterday, but now we're back for the beginning of the third week. Interestingly, it's also coming at the same time the New York Times is reporting that Trump has actually been complaining about his Lead Attorney Todd Blanche. Apparently part of the complaint here is that in Trump's view, Blanche just hasn't been following Trump's instructions closely enough. He hasn't been aggressive enough. Of course, this is a pattern we've seen from the former president, he tends to really churn through his lawyers, he's just never satisfied. So we'll see really how Trump and Blanche interact in court today. You know, as for what we'll see, so this is the prosecution's third witness, they'll continue the testimony from Friday. Gary Farrow, Michael Cohen's Former Banker, he arranged that home equity line of credit for $130,000. Cohen then uses that to pay Stormy Daniels the hush money. And of course, this is the payment that's at the center of this case and the basis for all of these charges. We last saw Farrow for brief direct examination of Friday that will continue today. But as you mentioned, Erica, it's unclear who comes next on the witness stand. We're expecting at some point in this trial, Hope Hicks, Stormy Daniels, but really, prosecutors have been very secretive on the witness list the order of that list, they're saying that they just can't release too much information because of Trump's penchant for making public comments, which of course, we see day after day. And as you mentioned, Erica, we're also still waiting on Judge Merchan to rule on those alleged gag order violations that Trump's been accused of by prosecutors. He has already had a hearing on 10 of these alleged violations. That was last Tuesday. So really a ruling could come at any time. But there's also this hearing that's scheduled for Thursday on four more alleged violations. So it's really possible the judge could wait to rule until he's heard arguments on all 14 of these alleged violations of the gag order. So, Erica, there could be a lot happening in court this week on the gag order also testimony. And we'll wait and see what comes for the prosecution's witness list that we don't know what comes after Farrow's testimony, potentially finishing up today, Erica.",

So to be honest, I think this cross examination is going to be short, because in the end, his only purpose and getting Mr. Farrow in is to say that $130,000, a home equity loan was taken out by Michael Cohen, that money went into one account, and then it was taken out of that account and sent to another account.

And he has in fact fined Trump $1,000 for nine of the violations. And he said not only that, but Trump must take down the social media posts that violated this gag order by 2:15 this afternoon. So there is some immediate work that Trump needs to do in taking down those posts and he also needs to pay $1,000 for those nine violations. So that's $9,000. And then this is what it said it said at the end of this order, it said defendant Donald Trump is hereby warned that the court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders, and that if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratetory punishment. The judge saying Trump if you continue to violate this gag order, as I have found you've done nine times already you could go to jail. And that is definitely a stern warning from the judge. That is a warning Erica that prosecutors wanted this judge to issue. They wanted the judge to be sterner in telling Donald Trump, look, this is serious. You cannot post things that potentially threaten or harm any potential witnesses in this case, the family members of staff members of the court stepped -- the family members of the attorneys or the judge. So this is a serious warning from the judge and it's something that prosecutors were looking for. So now Donald Trump not only has to pay $9,000, but he's been warned if he continues to violate this gag order he could go to jail Erica.",

Joining me my colleague CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider as well as Attorney Bernardo Villalona, Criminal Defense Attorney and Former New York Prosecutor good to have you both with me so let's -- as we look at this, there are those nine violations, nine of the 10 are fines but is this warning at the end here where the judge Bernardo warns of look, if you don't get your act together. Obviously, I'm paraphrasing here. Next time, you could go to jail. What would that look like in this instance, given the court that we're dealing with given the gag order itself, when we when he warns of incarceration? How long would that be for?",

Now, let's just beclear, it's not going to happen next week when he has an additional hearing on those four other violations. Because I think it's anything starting from today onward any new violations, so it's not going to be retroactive. But in terms of what it looks like, it can be anywhere from a few hours to the court day to a few days at Rikers Island jail, or up to a maximum of 30 days. We'll also keep in mind that Judge Merchan wants to keep this trial going. So by incarcerating Donald Trump, it will slow down to trial. And also it will take a lot of attention. Let's be real, a lot of attention away from the trial itself. And everything that people are going to be focusing on is that Donald Trump is in custody, and that will leak to the jury because the jury is not supposed to know whether a defendant is in custody or not.",

As you point out, there are additional violations for which the prosecution has said they believeviolated this gag order, just because some of those happened in an interview a TV interview, where the former president was specifically referencing Michael Cohen, as we know who's one of the witnesses here. When it comes to those violations it's Thursday I believe that the hearing is for those. These are a little bit different, though, because we are talking about comments made on camera.",
