      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, two new rulings to fix the three decisions, two more sweeping changes to American life. The Supreme Court tilts the scales to the right on speech versus gay rights and on the signature Biden policy to zero out student debt.Plus, the ruling spark theory in Congress and celebration on the GOP campaign trail. Republicans say, the justices will correctly, Democrats say they are controlled by the MAGA right. And justice versus justice. The final day of the term sees another pair of on the bench trading jabs over law and life. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, it is a new world, defined by new math, six-three. The Supreme Court ends its session with two more decisions and two more clear reminders that elections have consequences. Donald Trump put three justices on the bench, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. They have all ruled in the last two days to push the country right in ways that many of you will see and feel every single day. We want to start our coverage with CNN's Jessica Schneider, at the court. So, Jessica, let's start with the student loans decision. Walk us through that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. The Supreme Court telling the Biden administration that they cannot enact their student loan debt forgiveness program, as they had planned, as they had tried to put in fact, back in 2022. The justices here saying that the federal law that the Biden administration had acted under the Heroes Act just wasn't broad enough, wasn't intended to cancel this massive amount of debt amounting to $400 plus billion.Now, this was a six-three decision, split along those conservative and liberal lines. The Chief Justice John Roberts, he wrote this opinion and in it, he invoked the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi writing this. As then speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi explained, people think that the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress. Now Justice Elena Kagan read her dissent from the bench, something that is relatively rare, but that we've seen repeatedly throughout the past few days, yesterday with affirmative action, and today in the two cases. Justice Kagan shot back saying, the result here is that the court substitutes itself for Congress and the executive branch in making national policy about student loan forgiveness. So, the takeaway here is that the 40 million plus student loan borrowers who are maybe waiting and excited about the prospect of getting this student loan cancelled up to $20,000. In some cases, they are out of luck, at least for now. And Dana, interestingly, student loan payments have been on pause, but they will resume starting October 1. Dana?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. This is a ruling that could really up end public accommodations laws all across the country, when it comes to creative or expressive businesses. Because the court in this case, again, along those six-three lines written by Justice Gorsuch, saying that a Colorado law that prohibits discrimination against same sex couples by businesses, violates the free speech clause of the constitution saying, that this really compelled speech and that's just not proper under the constitution.So, Justice Gorsuch, writing this, saying Colorado does not seek to ensure the sale of goods or services on equal terms. It seeks to use its law to compel an individual to create speech she does not believe. So, ruling in favor of this website designer who sought a ruling saying, that she wanted to preemptively even before starting her business, get a ruling that said she did not have to service those couples, of same sex couples who she didn't agree with. And once again, we saw a fiery dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor that she read on the bench just like she did yesterday. This time she said this, today, the court for the first time in its history, grants a business open to the public a constitutional right to refuse to serve his members of a protected class. And Justice Sotomayor even went further saying, this raises questions about businesses that are creative or expressive, whether they could refuse service to other people, including interracial couples. Now, Dana, I will mention that Justice Gorsuch in a footnote shot that idea down. He said that this decision does not concern or endorse anything like a straight couples only sign that he said the dissent conjured out of thin air. So, a lot of tension on the bench today, when we saw the justices reading from the opinion, and then obviously a lot of tension in this six-three split. Dana?",

At first, let's just start with Justice Sotomayor more of her dissenting opinion. The decision threatens to balkanize the market and to allow the exclusion of other groups from many services. A web designer could equally refuse to create a wedding website for an interracial couple. This is what you're referring to, Joan.Then Neil Gorsuch, the dissent refuses to acknowledge where its reasoning leads. In a world that as Chief Judge Tymkovich highlighted, governments could force an unwilling Muslim movie director to make a film with a Zionist message, they could compel an atheist muralist to accept a commission celebrating evangelical zeal, and they could require a gay website designer to create websites for a group advocating against same sex marriage. So, long as these speakers would accept commissions from the public with different messages.",

      "sentences": "This really is the battle of the slippery slopes, isn't it, which one has the more persuasive argument as to what could ultimately be the end result of what they've now ruled? A real plain way of speaking about this ruling is, we normally think of if you're open to the public, that means you're open to the public, not your hours, what you'd normally expect to have constrained in some way.But this essentially says, you can be open, but open except. You're talking about expressive ideas or your creative endeavors, and particularly what they're focusing on here. You cannot be compelled to do something for the greater public and be fully inclusive if you've got some sort of religious or faith-based reason why you do not want to do so. And that does create some bit of a Pandora's box opening. Because you could have actually foresee someone saying, well hold on a second, maybe I'm a barista. And the way that I do the foam on top of the cappuccino is very artsy. I don't want, whatever you're kind in here to actually partake of my artistry. Well, what is the day-to-day enforcement mechanism to show that's not the case? Is it going up the Supreme Court again? Is it having redress from the court, I mean, or the state in Colorado, who now says Supreme Court inside our hands? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, and this court is demonstrating that it is taking a very expansive and robust view of the First Amendment. And it wasn't just this particular case that the justice who issued the opinion in this case, wrapped himself in the First Amendment, and presented the entire argument not as one of public accommodation as Jessica Schneider was recording, but really of First Amendment protections. There was a case actually earlier in the week countermine, where the court also based on First Amendment rights up to overturn a conviction of an individual who was making threatening Facebook messages to a performer. And the Supreme Court throughout that conviction, and again, weighing the First Amendment rights of that individual more strongly than the threatening conduct that the individual was engaged in, which really was affecting a particular performers ability to live her life and engage in her work. So, this court is staking out a very broad view of First Amendment rights in particular.",

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are applauding the decision to block President Biden's student led debt forgiveness program. We should note neither GOP leader has weighed in on the other big ruling of the day, which allows a website designer to refuse to make wedding websites for gay clients.Let's discuss this with CNN political director David Chalian, CNN anchor and host of the assignment podcast Audie Cornish, and CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond. Before I get you all to open up your giant brains and spill it all out for everybody to see your analysis. Let's look at two, I think very telling reactions that we've gotten over the last hour or two. Mike Pence candidate for president of course Republican, we must elect leaders who will appoint judges who support religious freedom. I'm honored to have played a role in appointing three of the justices that ensured today's welcomed decision. Reminding everybody that it was the Trump Pence administration who got three of them on the bench. Then the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Today's ruling by the MAGA right wing activist -- MAGA right activist wing of the Supreme Court is a giant step backward.

And then the question inside Democratic circles now is enthusiasm. And how you get the various parts of whatever the Biden coalition is this time around to actually be energized to get out and vote. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTRepublican state attorneys general across the country supported by Republicans in Congress prevented me from doing this. And the next step will be that we need to do this through legislation. And therefore, you need to not only reelect me, but you need to elect Democrats to Congress. I think there is a question, though, of you know, this could cut the other way as well, right? I mean, you look at young voters who are going to look at the president say, hey, you promised us this during the 2020 campaign and you didn't deliver. You know, perhaps he overhyped expectations. You know, there are some questions about as this majority opinion rules that saying that he didn't have the legal authority to do this using the statute that he used.

I'm sure you remember, Jeremy, but they kept kicking, kicking the can down the road on this decision because Joe Biden is also attuned a bit to that kind of messaging that you're hearing there.So, yes, he'll fight against this decision, and no doubt uses an opportunity to rally everyone around. But we saw in very public display, how he was not 100 percent sure of where he was going to land on this issue for quite some time. CORNISH: You know, it's interesting with all of these rulings, I think that the conservative movement is having these victories. And what happens after you have that victory, especially if so much of your messaging, prior to that point, has been about victimization or grievance. We see this with Roe v. Wade, in terms of how that is actually policed. And what happens to women who are actually charged with pregnancy related crimes? Those kinds of things can have an effect going forward. And that the voter will now see how your world, how your vision of the world actually plays out and has an effect on them. The student loan debt thing is just like that, the LGBT issue is just like that, and affirmative action is just like that, where people are now going to live in the world that has been theorized for a very long time, for two years going right up into the next election.",
