It's left him no good options.It's harsh criticism of President Biden's handling of this crisis that is driving a wedge between the mayor of the nation's largest city and a president who is trying to combat the crisis at the border. Joining us now, Democrat and former New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson. You have a perspective on this, which is essentially just that the mayor doesn't have a ton of good options here and that you -- you are actually on board with his plan to do this? COREY JOHNSON (D), FORMER NYC COUNCIL SPEAKER: Well, I mean, clearly the situation has shown is that we're in an emergency and New York City is sort of out of space. I mean 62,000 migrants in the last year, over 120 hotels opened up, 4,200 migrants in the last week. And the clip you just showed of parents being upset, it never sure reached this point. The mayor has called for a decompression strategy, trying to figure out ways to kind of spread migrants out, sending people to the suburbs where you've seen county executives and people outside of New York City fighting against that. And what all of this shows is really a failure of the federal level, a lack of coordination, not enough support for localities and cities that are dealing with this surge. So, understandably, the mayor is saying, I need some help here. There was a $350 million pot of FEMA money that cities could apply for. New York City has already incurred well over $1 billion in cost to house 62,000 migrants and has only been awarded $30 million from FEMA. The cost associated with this is going to bloom out to $4.2 billion over the next year. So, it is an untenable situation. And we're a city of immigrants. And we're a city that welcomes all people. But clearly this has become a toxic situation without much help from the federal government. HARLOW: So here's the other side of that argument. Republicans who point out, look, you made, Mr. Mayor, and voters in New York, New York a sanctuary city. And so this was going to happen and you said you're welcoming and here you go. This is what Representative Mike Lawler, who's a Republican, who flipped one of those districts in New York, said about Orange County, for example, which has now blocked Mayor Adams from moving migrants there. Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): New York City chose to be a sanctuary city back in 2016. When southern state governors who were overwhelmed then inundated over the last two years chose to send migrants up to New York City, Eric Adams called it morally bankrupt that they were doing that without coordination and cooperation with city officials. He's now doing the very thing he decried. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Police report an eight-year-old was mushroom hunting in her backyard in rural Alpena, Michigan, when a man came out of the woods behind their house, put his hand over her mouth, and attempted to pull her back into the woods. Her brother was watching from inside. He grabbed his slingshot and hit the attempted kidnapper twice before scaring him off. Police were able to track down the suspect, whose injuries were consistent with a slingshot strike, and arrested him on attempted kidnapping and assault charges. So, let's bring in 13-year-old Owen Burns and his slingshot. You can show it to everyone, Owen. He saved his sister's life. Also his parents, Margaret and Andrew. Good morning, guys.",
