His push comes less than two months before Iowa's all-important caucus kicks off the race for the Republican presidential nomination. CNN's Alayna Treene is in Fort Dodge, Iowa where Trump is currently speaking. Alayna, what is Trump saying?",

And even though he's polling far beyond his Republican rivals in the state, his team recognizes that he can't get complacent in this final stretch. And he wants to ensure he doesn't cede any ground to some of his rivals in the next eight weeks.But listen, so far, his speech has focused heavily on attacking President Joe Biden and specifically his record on foreign policy. At one point, Donald Trump was referring to the president's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier in the week and started to escalate his criticism calling Joe Biden a quote, \"stupid person\", and suggesting that he may be on medication.

And So I think this is one thing that I know a lot of people are paying attention to during his remarks in Iowa today. Now, just real quickly, Paula, I just want to point you to one other thing I found really interesting in his remarks. At the top of his speech, he took a victory lap when discussing the ruling yesterday from a Colorado judge who decided to keep Donald Trump on the ballot. Donald Trump said it was a quote \"gigantic victory\". And also, you know, took shots at the media for saying they had a meltdown when it came out. And so, you know, a lot more happening right now behind me but we'll keep you posted on what we hear, Paula.",

REID: Karen, I want to get your thoughts on something else that Alayna has covered, which was this decision in Colorado. We know that other states are also contemplating trying to make this legal argument for why he shouldn't be on the ballot. It hasn't worked in two other states. Colorado also late last night showed it wasn't going to work there. Should other states try this too, or just focus on 2024?",

It is more fodder for that argument.So I'm a little reluctant to continue to feed that on cases where we're not talking about violations of national security. We're not talking about overturning the 2020 election. Obviously, I know part of the argument in Colorado was to say that that effort should have made him ineligible for the ballot. But I think it's a hard legal argument to make. Better to stay focused on just beating him in 2024 outright.",

There have been mounting calls here domestically and abroad for that to happen and the reasoning according to the president is this. Quote, \"As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a ceasefire is not peace.\" He goes on to say to Hamas' members, \"Every ceasefire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters, and restart the killing by attacking innocents again,\" end quote there. Now, what the administration has pushed for is humanitarian pauses, saying that would be a way to allow for the release of hostages held by Hamas as well as getting aid into Gaza. [17:29:54] ALVAREZ: But in addition to that, and notably, the president warns of issuing visa bans against extremists attacking civilians in the West Bank. This has been a key area of concern for the administration and would mark an escalation if they are to take this step. And the president saying that they're preparing to do so if this violence does not end. Then, of course, it goes on to stress a lot of what we've heard from the president before, that Israel needs to respect humanitarian law, protect innocent civilians. He also stressed a two-state solution. That, the president says, is the only solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict. And again, to take the 30,000 quote here, the president has asked Congress for a supplemental. That is billions of additional funding for the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. And this is yet another call for Americans shoring up support to make sure they understand that it is important to support these conflicts because, otherwise, they're ceding ground to Putin and Hamas.

So, access to life support equipment is impossible when you don't have electricity. And when it's destroyed by forces entering the hospital. Access to water, access to medicines that we've been warning have run out and continue to run out of every type over the last several weeks. And of course, access to safe spaces to operate within. We have health care staff at these hospitals that describe being killed through the windows as they pass down the corridors trying to do their duty to care for patients. I'm sure you hear my frustration, but I -- I share, as a doctor who has worked in these hospitals and other humanitarian crisis, and as a doctor who has committed the Hippocratic Oath to care for my patients, I share the rage, the fear, the desperation, the immense sadness of medical professionals there. And it's utterly indefensible to attack facilities and health care providers and patients. I'm talking on a health care level. But then there's just -- you know, we can speak for hours about the impact and the impunity at which health care facilities and health care workers have been targeted over the last six -- where are we now, six weeks. But there's also, you know, entire civilian congregations. Today, two United Nations schools were hit. There are reports of thousands of people, a couple hundred people at least being killed. Mostly women and children. This is, you know, utterly indefensible. There have been so many violations of international law and these are crimes against humanity. And I -- I am struggling to process how, as an international community, we allow this to happen with all of the systems and checks that we have in place to prevent these kinds of crimes against humanity. And the fact we've been warning about them every single day for the last six weeks, I am struggling to process how are still living this reality.",

Now, he is well within his ability to actually do that, well, within his right to do that. That's at least according to city code. But he would certainly have to act well within restrictions and requirements. I want to list a couple of those. For example, according to city code, he would not be able to at least not receive any individual donations exceeding $5,000. He would have to disclose all of those legal expenses. Also, he cannot receive any donations from subordinates anyone doing business with the city and also can't receive funding from any companies or corporations. So there's certainly some guardrails in place here that are dictating who can give to the mayor's fund, but not exactly how much. Again, at this point in time, he can do this as his investigation presses forward -- Paula?",
