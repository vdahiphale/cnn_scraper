And about last night, someone, who will be on that stage, Vivek Ramaswamy said his comments, on 9/11 were misquoted. Well, we now have the tape. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Good evening. We start with breaking news, on Rudy Giuliani, and when he plans to surrender, in Georgia. It has been basically a revolving door of lawyers, and defendants, at the Fulton County Jail, today, in one of the most closely-watched cases, in the nation. Two of Trump's co-defendants, in the efforts, to overturn the election, in Georgia, surrendered today. Several more agreed to bond deals, bringing the deal there to about a dozen. One of them is a bail bondsman. Yes. A bail bondsman, Scott Hall, he turned himself in today, along with Trump ally, and lawyer, John Eastman, who as you may remember, pleaded the Fifth, to the January 6 congressional committee. But he said this, outside the jail, today, standing next to his own attorney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This may not come as a surprise to you, if you've been following our exclusive reporting, that we brought you here, on THE SOURCE, last week, regarding how Giuliani went to Mar-a-Lago, on what appeared to be a fruitless mission, a few months ago, to ask Trump, to help pay for his legal bills, something that didn't work out. We have even more news, on Giuliani, tonight. For that, I want to go to CNN's Paula Reid, who is live, outside the Fulton County Jail. Paula, you have this breaking news, on Rudy Giuliani.

Now, he's of course the former New York Police Commissioner. He is not a lawyer. He is also an unindicted co-conspirator, in this case. But he's a longtime friend of Rudy Giuliani's. And he's been helping him try to find a lawyer, something that has proven challenging, given Giuliani's seven-figure legal bills that remain unpaid. It does appear that at this point, they have been able to find an attorney, with a Georgia license, who is at least willing, and expected to help him, tomorrow, with the bond part of this procedure. And it's unclear though this individual will be representing Giuliani, throughout this case. Now, I am also told that Giuliani would like to negotiate his bond, and then do his surrender, all before former President Trump shows up here, in Georgia, on Thursday. As you and I reported, Kaitlan, Giuliani went to the former President pleading for help, with his legal bills. And as of now, he's only received a small portion of what he owes. And that, of course, wasn't from the former President, but from a Political Action Committee, affiliated with the former President.",

So, while that is all pending, he says he should not be subject, to this requirement, to turn himself in, and then to surrender. Now, it's unclear, Kaitlan, if he is going to be successful. We know that former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, is also making an attempt, to this exact same thing. And, at this point, it's just unclear.

But we all are already seeing some of the very distinct game plans that are taking shape, in terms of the defendants' legal strategies, and what those could look like. Let's put this in football terms. Mark Meadows that Paula just mentioned there, and Jeffrey Clark, are trying to run what is known as an \"End around,\" by basically wanting to move their cases, to a federal court, an out-of-state court. That's in hopes of ultimately getting it dismissed. John Eastman, meanwhile, that you just heard from there, outside the courthouse, is calling, basically, for a fair catch, by waving this off, as just performing his ethical duty, as an attorney. Meanwhile, former Georgia Republican Party chair, David Shafer, he's looking for blockers, claiming that he was just acting at the direction of then-President Donald Trump. I'm joined now by a pair of former federal prosecutors, who between them were part of the Watergate, and January 6th investigations, on Capitol Hill, Nick Akerman, and Temidayo Aganga-Williams. I won't ask you to make any football analogies. But Temidayo, I mean, with Meadows, and Jeffrey Clark, both trying to make this push, from state court, to federal court? We know what their endgame is. But if they are successful, does that mean the entire case could potentially move there? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: You would only move those particular defendants, who asked for removal. So, for example, if the court allowed, for Mark Meadows, or Jeffrey Clark, to be removed, to federal court, the remaining defendants would stay. One thing I would note that a Jeffrey Clark could be looking to do is not necessarily aim for dismissal. But it's for separation. Because if Jeffrey Clark moves his case to federal court, he could have a trial by himself, which I think would dilute some of the power, of the RICO case that Fani Willis has put together, because she might not be telling the whole story. She's telling just a Jeffrey Clark story. And that'll be less powerful.",

I think one thing that's always, I think, troubled me, personally, is trying to get into the mind of the architects of these schemes, whether they deep-down really believe what they're saying. Because, I think, again, and again, the evidence has demonstrated there was no fraud that impacted the outcome of the election.

Trump knew they were false. And he said they were. And that's all admissible against Donald Trump, as a statement, in furtherance of a conspiracy. It's admissible against Eastman. So, this whole idea that \"He is Mr. Innocent\" is totally out the window. And I might also add, this motion that they made, is going to get blocked, and tackled, at the federal court, because what they've got to show is that they were acting, in the course of their duties, as a public official.

One Georgia State Senator vowed to file a complaint, with the Commission, as soon as those proceedings began, in October. But that is on top of a different effort by another senator, who called for a special legislative session, last week, to investigate and potentially impeach the District Attorney. The reality is that Republican lawmakers aren't likely to have enough votes, to ever remove her. That is something that was even acknowledged by Governor Kemp. Of course, that was a fact that prompted this furious response, from the former President, accusing the Republican governor of blocking Willis' impeachment. Let's get more insight, on this, from Michael Moore. He is a former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, so, the perfect person, to take our questions, on this. I mean, Michael, given the fact that when you look at the landscape here, this effort, from Republicans, on impeachment doesn't seem likely to work. What do you make of this new effort, with the new law, on potentially ousting or sanctioning prosecutors? Do you think it's going -- could it work? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, I'm glad to be with you. And I really think this is just an effort, to get some press, by a young senator, from the north Georgia area. He shares the area with a certain representative, from the State, who likes to sort of throw some bombs, like this. This is going nowhere. There is a law now on the books that the Republicans passed and the Republican governor signed that creates an independent commission, to look at prosecutors' duties. And interestingly enough, the law requires actually prosecutors, to consider every case, for which there is probable cause. Well, the grand jury, in the Trump case, has determined, by issuing an indictment that there is, in fact, probable cause, to move to trial. So, the sort of the nonsense rhetoric that we're hearing, and this request for a special session, because this particular Senator doesn't like Fani Willis' decision to move forward, while she is in fact, bound by the new law that the Republican legislature passed, to move forward with the case.",

And the voters elect those, in each judicial district. And so, this is an interesting time, when the Republicans have decided that they think that they know better than the voters of the district. And so, they should be able to come in and change the person, who won that election. Who does that sound like? And so, that's, again, this was a political stunt. It's a political stunt, now. It's going nowhere. There's some district attorneys, in the state, who have brought suit, claiming that in fact, this violates the duties that they have, under the Constitution, as well as their First Amendment protections. And is backlash, I guess, for some effort, by the district attorneys, to look at classifications of crimes, and make decisions, on whether or not they're going to move forward, and which is clearly within their discretion.

And, you saw this, frankly, if you think about back, at the time of the impeachment, after January, the 6th, you had folks, who were sort of hiding under their desk, and counting on the police, to protect them, from the mob.

He has kick-started the space race. And now, in an area that previously was going fallow, we can send Americans, from U.S. soil, into space. We don't have to rely on the Russians, and their launches, anymore. That's big. In the electric car market, obviously, he has reinvented that as it currently exists. And as we try to advance green energy plans, we need to work around him, because he has a majority of all the electric chargers, in the country. So, there's good.
