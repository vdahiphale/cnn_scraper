President Joe Biden is hosting Japan's prime minister at the White House today, a critical meeting of allies with a shared goal of countering China. That common goal includes deepening U.S.-Japanese military cooperation and defense production, as well as boosting trade, student exchanges as well between the two countries, and even helping Japan land the first astronaut, not American on the moon. In a joint conference, news conference, President Biden celebrated their partnership. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think you can read into that this desire to make permanent some of these aspects that they're announcing today in the defense side sector, in the economic sector to try and sort of future proof this alliance should Donald Trump returned to the White House.And when you talk to officials and we've been talking to them over the course of the last several days, they do acknowledge this anxiety in Tokyo and other capitals about what American foreign policy might look like if Trump is to return to the White House. There is a real, you know, caution about what that might portend when it comes to these alliances, the bilateral alliances, but also these arrangements like AUKUS, that the U.S. has arranged in Asia to try and counter China. And so what you see President Biden doing is trying to cement some of these ideas. So for example, today they are announcing this new joint defense counsel to talk about how the U.S. and Japanese militaries can better integrate, better work together going forward, you hear them talk about boosting the defense industrial base, trying to utilize Japan's capacity to help on that front. So I think it is really important on both of those things, China and the Trump risk, I guess you could call it, that these two liters wanted to discuss and it was interesting in the press conference, President Biden did say very explicitly, this is a defensive alliance that its not based on one particular country, but certainly every official you talked to talks about this goal of trying to counter Beijing in an ever more restive region. And that is certainly the undertone of what they were wanting to talk about today.",

On the one hand, we've heard Benjamin Netanyahu kind of revert to his signature defiance, saying that no country including a close ally like the United States, will make Israel change its plans, being defiant about the importance of carrying out this Israeli military offensive in Rafah.But at the same time, what we've also seen is Israel's government beginning to take steps, at least on the humanitarian aid fronts in direct response to the kind of pressure that we are seeing from the United States. Last week, Israel security cabinet approved the opening of the port of Ashdod, about 20 miles north of the Gaza border, as well as a crossing in northern Gaza to be able to bring in additional humanitarian aid. We haven't actually seen those steps take place but today, I was in a briefing with the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who emphasized that Israel is planning to, quote, flood aid into Gaza, noting the fact that according to COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves -- that coordinates the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the number of trucks this week on a daily basis has done doubled from the number of trucks that went into Gaza last week. And he also framed it as a direct response to the pressure from the United States, making very clear that Israeli leaders had heard U.S. concerns and were directly responding to it. Now, we've seen these plans be laid out, but we haven't actually seen a full effect of those plans actually going into motion. So it remains to be seen exactly how much Israel is actually going to follow through. But certainly there does seem to be a shift in tone, at least on the humanitarian aid front, if not on Israeli military plans for Rafah.",

This as Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a new plea to Western allies at the opening of the Delhi economic forum.

And one of those critical aspects is, of course, artillery, ammunition.Ukraine is only able to produce a bit of its own. It relies almost exclusively on other countries. And crucially, the U.S., there, Chris Cavoli, who is not only the head of U.S. European Command, he's also the supreme allied commander Europe under NATO, said that right now, Ukraine is being out fired five to one in artillery shells. And within a matter of, quote, weeks, that will be ten to one as they begin to run out of the artillery ammunition that they are already rationing. Also crucial on top of that, not just the artillery ammo, they also need more air defenses. Air defense munitions to counter, to shoot down, to fight back against repeated aerial barrages coming from Russian forces. Those are critical munitions and they are running out. He urged Congress to pass the six -- the supplemental that will give $60 billion in funding and be able to provide critical munitions to Ukraine. Now, more than two years into the war, Jim, it is worth noting, for example ample the UK and Ukraine announced they would have an agreement for ammunition production but as have other countries, but the U.S. plays such a critical role here.

It's refusing to continue that lower trajectory at the speed and velocity that the Fed would like to see to get back to 2 percent.So, yes, it's clearly much, much lower than it once was. But it's not going down at the speed and pace now that the Fed will be happy about.

So can you start cutting as you get to the back end of the summer? Do you have to do it now, essentially? In which case is Larry Summers said, you are taking a risk of pouring some petrol, some gasoline on the embers, or do you have to really wait until after the election? And my guess is, that's going to be very much in the mind of the Fed governors. They -- you know, they walk around the world saying, I see no evil, I hear no evil.

That means that Arizona will now join 14 states with total or near-total bans, adding to an ever evolving patchwork of reproductive care here in the U.S. for patients and for providers.

Wade two years ago.If the procedure is banned in Arizona, it is likely that patients from that state will travel to neighboring states, including California for access.

So, absolutely, it's going to -- it's going to create a burden and a shift in where people are getting care. And, of course, the problem always is that people already have access to care issues anyways. So in an overburdened medical system and a system that is not consistently supporting human rights and women's health as human rights because this is medical care, abortion care is medicine. We already have a huge problem. And how are people supposed to now navigate that and travel and leave their homes and get care elsewhere. It's -- you know, it's been an evolving slow-mo unmitigated disaster and I mean -- this strategy of hearkening back to the 1800s, wow. That's -- you know what, Jim, honestly? You know what I think?

If you freeze, you don't do anything and they can continue to take power if you fight back. And that is actually what we really need to see people doing, perhaps we can get back our rights.

What has been consistent throughout his waffling on this issue over the years is that he has often taken the stance that is most politically expedient at the time. And right now, that is trying to convince voters in states that are going to see abortion referendums on the ballot that have seen the aftermath of Roe v. Wade.

He's been leading on the economy, on immigration, on foreign policy.This is the one crux or conundrum, if you will, for Republicans that he cannot get over this hill. And so again, I think moderating somewhat is smart. Evangelicals are not going to vote for President Biden, they're going to vote for Trump. And even though they may go voting for Trump, angry and upset, I think they recognize how important it is to win the White House in November. And so I think President Trump moderating, Republicans writ large moderating their language, suddenly saying, look, if voters want to move in a different direction on this as different from what we may believe, we will respect the will of the people. It's smart politics, Jim.",

I mean, if it was a pro-life agenda and here you have a presidential candidate, the former president who is going wobbly on that issue now, right, in the view of evangelicals, what is the case that Democrats make to them? Or is it just a lost portion of the voting population?",

I mean, look, I think if evangelicals, which I don't want to put them on the block because I know Biden does have quite a bit of support among some evangelical voters are people who classify themselves as evangelical voters. But, of course, the larger block of those voters first are supporting Trump. And I think if those voters really took a step back and realized where Trump is on the issues, versus where Biden is on the issues, the answer would be a little bit more clear that the Biden is the person who is more supportive of them. He is somebody who is a man of faith who, who has been going to church for a very long time for all the right reasons, supports policies that they support.So, you know, I think that they really thought about that. That's where they would go, but, you know, I'm not really sure. Sometimes, where that block of voters -- what their true motivations are when your hands to supporting Trump or they're supporting in the MAGA wing of the party.",

We know that cameras caught local cam, an affiliate caught up with the relative of a 23- year-old who spoke a little bit about what was going on there in that area of west Philadelphia where police responded to a shooting amid a large crowd.This witness says that they were celebrating the end of Ramadan, so Eid, when shots rang out, police -- authorities do not believe that this shooting was connected to that celebration of the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting. But this young woman says her cousin was shot in the stomach and take it to the hospital. So this seems at the moment to be another case of the kind of gun violence that we see often in big cities across America. But more details are coming out and well get them to you as soon as we have them -- Jim.",
