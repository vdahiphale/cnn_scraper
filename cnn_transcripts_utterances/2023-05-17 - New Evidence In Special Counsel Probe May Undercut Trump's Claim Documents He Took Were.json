In the letter, acting archivist, Wall, writes to Trump: \"The 16 records in question all reflect communications involving close presidential advisers, some of them are directed to you personally, concerning whether why and how you should declassify certain classified records.\" So, Anderson, while we don't know exactly what's in these 16 records yet, it certainly suggests that they provide evidence that Trump had firsthand knowledge that you don't just go declassify material without a thorough and rigorous process -- Anderson.",

So on one hand, there is the classified documents issue, which that the -- any president does have extremely broad authority and final authority to declassify documents and that is the constitutional provision, that's under the Article II Commander-in-Chief Authorities.So that is -- that does govern any president's ability to declassify. Then there is separate issue of the Presidential Records Act, which talks about any kinds of documents. So I think in some of the former president's public statements, he tries to combine those two issues together, but Presidential Records Act applied to any records. And the minute he was no longer president, any documents that he had belonged to the United States. So the question then with respect to the classified documents becomes did he actually ever declassify them? And although on this point, there are executive orders, there are processes, a president could make a decision that is outside the scope of that process.

JOHN DEAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It's a tough question when you get to the real ultimate thing, it is can he do what he wants to as he is saying? And that's never been tested in the court. No president has ever tried to do what he is doing. The norm is, as Carrie explained, when there's a process, you're supposed to follow the process.
