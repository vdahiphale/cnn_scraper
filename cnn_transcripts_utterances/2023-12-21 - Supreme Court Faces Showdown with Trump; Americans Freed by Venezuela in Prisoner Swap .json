That was one that Republicans no matter how opposed they are to Donald Trump, and his recurring potential to office, they felt was sort of purely political and beyond the pale, they rallied to his cause. And, by the way, that helped all voters on the Republican side to rally to his cause well in a big substantial way and it changed the calculus of this entire year before the election.

It seems as though people were kind of checking a box, sending statements opposing it.The ground has shifted, the families have done a great job educating folks. Having been involved in a whole lot of prisoner transfers, including, you know, one for dangerous Russian folks, not a single American has been hurt by somebody that we traded. And Mr. Saab, you saw him going down the stairs of the airplane in the clip. This is not a man who is likely to harm Americans, right? He had trouble getting off of the airplane.",

I cannot believe that they have left him behind through this many prisoner exchanges. And, you know, certainly, the Russians have a vote in when he gets out. They have the keys to the jail.But I hear his frustration. I feel it, too. Ever since Trevor Reed came -- got out, we have been on a mission to get Paul Whelan out home -- excuse me, bring him home, too. So far we have not been successful and it bothers me every single day.",

The Hamas-controlled health ministry now says more than 20,000 Gazans have been killed. The World Food Programme says half the population there is now starving. Also this morning, Israel's military says the voices of three Israeli hostages who were accidentally killed by their own troops were actually captured on IDF camera which was mounted on a dog days before they were fatally shot. The statement comes as Israelis are still reeling from the IDF's admission on Friday of that shooting. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joining us now live from Tel Aviv with more on this reporting. So, let's start, if we could, Jeremy, with the statement now from Hamas and what it means for the state of hostage negotiations.",
