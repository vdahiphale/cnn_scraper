We're watching a number of developing stories at this hour.Happening right now, an emotional hearing set to begin in Florida where survivors and families of the Parkland school shooting will share their stories and their pain in court. This is all in advance to the judge sentencing the gunman to life in prison. We are live this morning in Florida. It is also, of course, the final countdown now. We are one week from Election Day. Early voting, as you likely know, is already smashing records. More than 21 million ballots cast so far. But that, of course, is not all the voters. So the campaigning far from over. Candidates out there making their final pitch. And CNN is on the trail. The man accused of attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul in their San Francisco home is expected in court this morning. Forty- two-year-old David DePape will be arraigned on several charges, including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. Today's hearing comes as we're also learning disturbing new details about DePape's intentions. The FBI says he planned to hold House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage and, quote, break her kneecaps if she lied. Now the speaker was not home at the time of the attack. CNN correspondent Veronica Miracle is live outside the courthouse in San Francisco. There was a lot of detail, Veronica, in this affidavit.",

They say that David DePape came here specifically to the Pelosi residence so that he could kidnap and injury her, and that he admitted this to the San Francisco Police Department even after being read his Miranda rights.Now, in that affidavit filed in court yesterday, they say that David DePape wanted to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps so that she would have to be wheeled in front of the - in front of Congress so that other members could see the consequences of their actions. He described her as a leader of a pack of lies promoted by the Democratic Party. Now, DePape is going to be arraigned later today on numerous state charges, including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. And that is according to San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins. She says that this was a politically motivated attack. Here's what she had to say yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And according to authorities, when police arrived, they saw DePape and Pelosi struggling over a hammer and that DePape was able to get control of that hammer and they witnessed him knock Pelosi unconscious to the ground. When police were able to get DePape under control, they found a second hammer, duct tape, zip ties and gloves and other items. Erica.",

You've got one week left until election days. The candidates, their surrogates, going all out right now on the campaign trail, possibly on the ads where you live on your TV. You're going to see several big names out on the trail. Former Vice President Mike Pence is in Georgia, President Biden headed to Florida, a state his advisers have long eyed as the ideal backdrop for his warnings against, quote, mega MAGA Republicans. Former President Obama in Nevada. He'll actually join Biden Saturday to campaign in Pennsylvania. CNN's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju is in Las Vegas this morning. So, Manu, we're seeing a little more from the Democrats as they're prioritizing here in this final week. Talk to me about Nevada and what the sense is in that state.",

So, finishing up her six-year term. She is in a dead heat with the Republican, former attorney general here in this state, Adam Laxalt. Someone who is the grandson of the former governor here in this state. Someone who has a name -- well-recognized name.But both candidates not particularly well-defined among voters, which is why we have seen an enormous amount of ads spent over the last two months. In fact, since Labor Day alone, more than $100 million has been spent in Nevada on the airways. Democrats spending a little bit more than Republicans. But we have seen familiar themes play out along the airwaves. Democrats getting hit over the issues of inflation, the economy, high gas prices. That's what Catherine Cortez Masto has had to face in the attacks that have come against her. She has levied her own attacks against Laxalt over issues such as abortion and concerns over the Republicans pushing for a ban on abortion in the aftermath of the supreme court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade. So, Barack Obama is here today in Las Vegas. He plans to try to rally Democratic voters, try to juice Democratic turn-out as he heads to a number of key states as the fight for the Senate remains on the knife's edge. Not just in here, but in states like Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, even Arizona, very close as we get into the final days, which is what Democrats hope, they can turn out their voters, persuade those voters who have not yet made a decision yet and perhaps hang on to the Senate as it looks increasingly grim, their chances about holding the House. If they can keep the House. Now the focus big time on the Senate and this race here in Nevada. Erica.",

So, as we see this push, you know, as Manu just laid out, there are a number of states where this -- the battle for the Senate really is, in Manu's words, on a knife's edge. Georgia is one of them. I was struck by a response that we just heard from Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who, of course, is running in his state. He sat down with Kaitlan Collins. She asked him specifically about Herschel Walker, who, of course, is running for Senate in Georgia. Take a listen to his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): I would just tell you to talk to Herschel Walker about his policies on abortion. I am staying focused on my race and what I can control in trying to help them fight through Joe Biden's inflation. Eggs up 30 percent. Milk, chicken up 15 percent, 17 percent. Gas prices because of bad domestic energy policy. That's the number one issue. Sixty percent of Americans right now are living paycheck to paycheck. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's poll of polls, Fetterman maintains a lead, but it's slim.ASHLEY ALLISON, FORMER NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN-HARRIS 2020: I do think that Pennsylvania voters know John Fetterman. He's their lieutenant governor now. He did a debate that was an hour long that took a great deal of stamina with a reasonable accommodation of captioning. And if you go and you talk to Pennsylvania voters and folks who are covering the race in state, people say they know him and that his doctor says he's fit to serve and that they are capable of making that decision. And that he's been transparent. And releasing the doctor's reports, I think it would just go down a rabbit hole of like, what about this and what about that. So, I think Fetterman is still going to win Pennsylvania. It's still razor tight. No one can take it for granted. It's going to be a turn- out game just not in Pennsylvania, but in other states across the country, which is why every race is so tight at this point and all the big guns are hitting the trail.",

I like her a lot.But this is remarkable that one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress is, for the first time in her life, endorsing a Democrat and finding more common cause with a Democrat than most Republicans in her party. I think, for Elissa Slotkin voters, Liz Cheney probably is an effective surrogate and for a lot of Democrats who really think that democracy threats and election denialism are a hugely important issue, they stand with Liz Cheney. Now, will she turn out, you know, will she turn out MAGA Republicans? Will she turn out progressives? Probably not. But this pairing actually makes a lot of sense to me.",

Of course that's now new coalition leader, caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, in power.But besides a referendum on Netanyahu, who, I should note, faces an ongoing corruption trial, whether he should come back into power or not. The other thing that's at stake in this election is the rise of the far right of Israeli politics because Netanyahu, in order to form a governing coalition, will likely need to rely on the growing popularity of some far right groups, some of whom whose leaders have, in the past, been convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. I asked Netanyahu about his need for the far-right support, an international concern about what that will mean for a future Israeli government. Take a listen to his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But a lot of polls show them just below that number. Of course, everything will come out to turn-out, especially when you have such razor-thin margin. And what's really interesting, today, Erica, is that turnout so far has been at the highest levels since 1999, even though this is the fifth time Israelis have gone to the polls in three and a half years.
