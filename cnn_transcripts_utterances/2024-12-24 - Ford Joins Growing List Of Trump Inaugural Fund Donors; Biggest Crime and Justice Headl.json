The company confirmed that it is donating $1 million plus a fleet of vehicles, to the president elects upcoming inauguration. Ford is now the latest company to make a donation, joining General Motors, OpenAI, Amazon and Meta. There's also been a steady stream of tech industry CEOs cozying up to Trump, making the trek down to Mar-a- Lago since his reelection. Among them, the leaders of Meta, Apple, Google, TikTok, Netflix and Amazon. A phenomenon that has not gone unnoticed by the president- elect. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I did have a dinner with Tim Cook. I had dinner with sort of almost all of them, and the rest are coming. And this is one of the big differences, I think, between we were talking about it before. One of the big differences between the first term, in the first term, everybody was fighting me. In this term, everybody wants to be my friend. I don't know, my personality changed or something. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What has changed is that people, the sort of society around him and that all these companies no longer feel any sort of stigma of donating to Donald Trump, and they know Donald Trump is incredibly transactional person. The reason why Elon Musk has so much influence in this incoming administration is not just because Donald Trump likes SpaceX or likes spending time with Elon Musk. It's because Elon Musk spent over $200 million helping him get elected, and all these companies are taking that cue.",

So this is according to CNBC. But they, quote, putting tariffs on components could add $600 to $2,500 per vehicle in parts from Mexico, Canada and China. That's according to estimates in a Wells Fargo analyst note.Prices on vehicles assembled in Mexico and Canada, which account for about 23 percent of vehicles sold in the U.S., could rise $1,750 to $10,000.

There's a tariff and there's a threat of a tariff.And access to the United States market is one of the biggest weapons we have to effect change in policies in our other trading partners. I think Donald Trump will be satisfied if Mexico and Canada do all the things they need to do to secure the border and to -- to let our products in there and then and then move on. Remember, he's the one that renegotiated the what was NAFTA now is the U.S. Mexico, Canada trade agreement. So let's -- let's all watch this play out and lets watch see how the threat works.",

Some economists have pointed out that some of his policies that he has floated. To your point, Brad, floating a policy versus implementing a policy are very different. But some have pointed out could be really inflationary.MAX ROSE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  I'm sorry, was that to me? So, so look -- I my apologies. So, look, in the end, right. This is not what Donald Trump ran on. Donald Trump ran and won this presidential election largely by co- opting traditional Democratic talking points in and around, fighting an elitist class that was both culturally estranged from working people and working against the economic interests of working people. He did not run on this notion that he was going to parade billionaires down to Mar-a-Lago in what is ultimately an escalator of transactional deals. So this speaks to potentially what the Trump administration will actually look like, which is traditional Republican politics of being there for the top 1 percent. That's not only a bad set of policies and agendas for working people in the United States of America, but its also going to be very poor politics. --",

And in fact, it's not a new tactic. It's a tactic that he has. He consistently went with during his first term in office. And it's a tactic to ultimately get something that he wants. He doesn't actually want the Panama Canal. He wants something else. He's just not being transparent as of yet about what he actually wants. It's the same thing with Greenland. Greenland is a little bit a little bit more transparent in and of itself because of the trade routes, because of the resources, because of the melting ice caps. And so there's something within there that Donald Trump wants. And so usually when he wants something, he says something outlandish around it. Mexico is going to build a wall. We are going to take back this. We are going to make Canada the 51st state. And what it's designed to do is, in fact, attract a lot of attention to a larger issue. And so that he can sit at a table and say, this is what I want. These are the demands. The actual idea that the United States is going to invade Canada or force Canada to invade Panama, or force Panama to give back the canal is actually is outlandish and as ludicrous as the president alluded to. The president of Panama alluded to. This is very Donald Trump. This is a very Donald Trump tactic. And as we move into 2025 and his second term in office, I would not be surprised if we continue to see tactics like this.",

Americans bled and died to build it.And it's a key to American trade. But secondly, Donald -- you can't criticize Donald Trump for not promoting trade on tariffs and then promoting trade by trying to secure trade routes. It's got to be one or the other. I think that most people hear him talk about the canal and talk about other trading routes, and they know he's a little -- there's a little bit of bluster here, a little bit of overstatement. But they get that he's trying to put America's interests economically first, ahead of our allies and not caring what our allies think. Now, that was in the campaign.
