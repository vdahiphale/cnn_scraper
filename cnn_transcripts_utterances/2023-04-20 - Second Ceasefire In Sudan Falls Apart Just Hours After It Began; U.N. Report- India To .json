If you look at that graphic you will see that the United Nations is now projecting that India's population growth will peak only after the year 2060, which means 1.7 billion is the estimate they have in terms of the population growth by then -- staggering numbers.Now, here's the advantage that India has over China. As of now more than 60 percent of India's population is under the age of 30. That means the workforce community is massive, Christine. And this is something India can tap into only if the policymakers realize they need to generate more jobs, which will come with investments. It will come with health infrastructure being better, and education. So there's a lot of challenges -- there are a lot of challenges that India has lying ahead. But also, at the same time, this workforce, if tapped well, will lead to perhaps the biggest labor force -- workforce in the world for India. Now, of course, over the years we'd have to see how that plays out, the success of the Indian government, and their policies -- Christine.",

Size matters, but what matters more is talent.\" Now, it was last year when China's population fell to 1.4 billion people -- the first drop since the 1960s. And there are a number of factors behind this drop, including changing attitudes towards marriage and family. Of course, China's one-child policy, which was introduced in the '80s. It was later scrapped in 2016. And the challenges and costs of raising children in China's expensive cities. Now, China's shrinking population has, of course, economic implications. You've got a shrinking workforce. You have a shrinking consumer base as well, and that's going to make economic recovery all the more difficult for China. Back to you, Christine.",
