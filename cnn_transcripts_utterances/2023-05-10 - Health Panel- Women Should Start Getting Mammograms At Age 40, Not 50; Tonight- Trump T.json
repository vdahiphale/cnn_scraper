The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force is now recommending that women should get regular mammograms starting at 40 years old. That's 10 years earlier than the current recommended age. The goal, of course, is to screen for breast cancer, which kills more than 43,000 women in the U.S. each year. That's according to the American Cancer Society.Joining us now is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Health Systems, Dr. Elisa Port. Doctor, great to have you.

BARRO:  I don't think it's a done deal yet because I don't think we've seen the full scope of the DeSantis attacks on Donald Trump yet. I mean, I think the roadway for Ron DeSantis is that you have to make the case that Trump says he's fighting for you but he lost a lot of these fights. He ultimately -- you know, whatever you think about the conduct of the 2020 election -- he came out of it and he was no longer president. Many of the COVID restrictions that conservatives were so upset about were imposed under Donald Trump's rule, who kept Anthony Fauci in place through that entire year or nearly a year that the -- that the former president was president during the COVID pandemic.

The \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" tape was a key piece of evidence in this trial going to his propensity to treat women in the matter that E.J. -- E. Jean Carroll accused him of treating her in. So I think that was basically priced in. And when we talk about Herschel Walker, I think most Republicans sort of discard these accusations. And yet, Herschel Walker lost that race at a time when other Republicans were winning statewide elections in Georgia. And so I think there is a real penalty for Trump's behavior. I just think it's a penalty that applied in 2016, applied in 2020. It's something that has been an electoral liability for him, I just don't think it's a new electoral liability.",

And what the lawyers are alleging is that they didn't do that. That they actually were responsible for potentially leaking these communications to the news media, et cetera.And so what they're saying is that in doing that and breaking those promises, it would be a breach of his contract. And that matters, Phil, because that would get Tucker out of a non-compete clause in his contract that prohibits him from launching new ventures, going on other networks, et cetera. As you mentioned and as our sources have told us, because his contract ends in 2025, that would sideline him through the 2024 election, and Tucker Carlson does not want to waste precious time. HARLOW:  What about advertisers? Obviously, that is a challenge that Fox faced with some advertisers pulling out of Carlson's time slot, although he had really high ratings and they started to see those ratings in that time slot really fall when he left.

Twitter has a program called Amplify where it does work with certain media partners to place premium brands around their content, but I don't think premium brands that didn't want to be around Tucker's show when it was on Fox are going to be jumping at the bullet to be being around that show when it's on Twitter. I don't think this is really a revenue play for Tucker. I think it's a prominence play. He wants to reach opinion leaders and he thinks Twitter is the place to do that. What I expect will happen is that he'll do this alongside other ventures. Maybe he has a Twitter show and he also has a subscription product. Maybe he has a Twitter show and he also tries to do something with Newsmax or Daily Wire, or another conservative outlet. I don't think this is going to be his money play.",
