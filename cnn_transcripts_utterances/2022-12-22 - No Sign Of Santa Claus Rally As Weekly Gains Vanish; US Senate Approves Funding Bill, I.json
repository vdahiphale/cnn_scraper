Those are the markets and these are the main events. Wall Street breaks its two-day rally as fears over rate hikes mount. Washington and the G7 commit to aid to Ukraine after President Zelenskyy addresses the US Congress. And more than a thousand flights are canceled in the US during the Holiday travel season as temperatures fall below freezing. It is cold in a lot of parts of this country, the US where I am. Coming to you live from New York. It is Thursday, December 22nd. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest and I too, mean business. All right, tonight, no signs of a Santa Claus rally for US markets. The Dow is sharply lower on the second to last day of trading just before Christmas. After strong gains on Wednesday, investors have been selling. Tech stocks leading the losses. The NASDAQ tumbled three and a half percent. That's in part because of new data like this, third quarter GDP growth was revised higher to an annual rate of 3.2 percent. New jobless claims were also lower than expected on the week. While all of that of course, sounds good, a resilient US economy is fueling worries that the Fed will stick to its aggressive tightening path. Let's bring in Paul La Monica joining us live from New York. So Paul, this is the thing, December is typically a time for a Santa Claus rally. The markets usually love December, but the Dow is actually down about 1,500 points so far, just this month, in about three weeks. So is all of this mainly to do with fears over tightening monetary policy here in the US.",

All that being said, you're right, Zain, the data this morning, GDP revision higher than expected, jobless claims still not really showing any serious signs of strain in the labor market. You add all that up, and it does make you think that the Fed will have a reason to not necessarily pull back on these rate hikes anytime soon. There still are overwhelming bets that the next move will be just a quarter of a point rate hike in early next year in February, but I don't know if we get more data like this, it is possible the Fed has to do another half point hike instead of just a quarter point hike before eventually pausing.",

Just a few minutes ago, and the day after Ukrainian President's historic address on Capitol Hill, the US Senate has approved a funding bill that includes roughly $45 billion in aid to Ukraine. G7 nations also say that they are ready to do a lot more having already pledged about $32 billion to Ukraine this year. A G7 statement says that they are ready to do the same again in 2023.

But after his rave reviews in the United States, that speech before the US Congress in primetime, in English, and the meetings with President Biden and the announcement of billions of dollars in additional aid for Ukraine, it is gratefully accepted here, it is badly needed, and people are certainly proud of their President, but also living with the daily reality of life in a warzone, a reality that includes living for extended periods of time without electricity or heat. Even here in the capital, Kyiv, we have spoken with people who report having power for maybe 40 minutes a day, less than an hour of electricity a day in the capital city. That would have been unthinkable just months ago before Russia began its onslaught of the civilian power grid, bombing attacks, drone attacks that have consistently managed to destabilize and cripple the power supply, cut off the water supply, forcing people to stand in long lines to get a hot meal that's often cooked over a wood stove, or even go to tents to warm themselves up, connect to Wi-Fi and charge their cell phones because they just don't have electricity at home, sometimes for days on end. This is one of the most well-protected areas in Ukraine where they manage to shoot down most of the incoming missiles. Other areas, other cities have been pummeled even harder and have been being harder hit and are therefore, suffering even more with these plummeting temperatures. As for the Kremlin, there is no indication that they are intimidated, certainly not expressing it publicly after this meeting in Washington, with President Zelenskyy and President Biden. The Kremlin is saying that neither leader from the US or Ukraine showed in the Kremlin's words, \"potential willingness to listen to Russia's concerns\" during the US visit. Kremlin also said that the US supplying Patriot Missile Defense Systems to Ukraine will only prolong people's suffering here and they say the collective West is set for potentially a long confrontation with Russia, that coming from the Russian Foreign Ministry. And President Putin of course, echoing those sentiments when he was calling for the modernization of his nation's military, pouring more resources into it, and also training the hundreds of thousands of conscripts, getting them ready for more potential battles to come on the frontlines, not just here in Ukraine, Putin alluding that there could be other points of conflict with Russia as well.

Now, it is not clear how they got to the $250 million number, but the prosecutor said that it was an unprecedented amount for a financial fraud case. And clearly something that they wanted to put enough pressure on Bankman-Fried that he would not have be any risk of flight here. And now in addition to the $250 million bond as you said, he will be under home detention where he will stay with his parents at their home in Palo Alto, California. He will also be wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet on his ankle. I mean, this was the first time Bankman-Fried has appeared in US since his arrest last week in the Bahamas. He was escorted into the Courtroom by a US Marshal wearing a navy blazer, a white button down shirt, and you could hear the clinking of the shackles around his ankle as he was walked to his seat at the defense table. Bankman-Fried only spoke once during the hearing. That was when the Judge asked him if he understood the consequences if he bailed-jump, that is if any of these conditions he violated and he nodded his head and said \"Yes, I do.\" We also learned a little bit more about the kinds of evidence that the Federal prosecutors have. One of the Assistant US Attorneys said that this was a fraud of epic proportions. He said that not only do they have cooperating witnesses who have pleaded guilty and who had deals with the government, but he said they also have the testimony of dozens of employees or former employees of FTX and Alameda Research, that's the hedge fund associated also with Bankman-Fried in what prosecutors say was intertwined in this alleged fraud. In addition, they said that they have encrypted messages, so really giving the sense that they have quite a bit of evidence that they have amassed in this case, and of course today, the first time Bankman-Fried is in Court. He was not arraigned on the charges. The Judge said that that would occur at a future date. The next Court hearing in this case is scheduled for January -- Zain.",

Fever and cold medicine is running out. The local versions of Tylenol and Advil are nearly impossible to get at drugstores across the country. Now to try and calm panic buying, some local governments are resorting to rationing the amount of medicine for sale, down to the exact number of pills, and dozens of pharmaceutical companies say they are going all out to try and increase production. But even as COVID is rapidly sweeping through the country, China has only reported less than 10 total COVID deaths for this entire month. That is a strikingly low number, and the government now saying that it is narrowing the definition of COVID-19 deaths to only include patients who died of respiratory failure directly caused by the virus. That means that people who died because of another underlying condition will not be counted as a COVID death, even if they were sick with COVID at the time. That goes against the World Health Organization's guidelines, and the WHO says it will severely underestimate the true death toll in China. This change in China's counting method also comes as crematoriums across the country fill up. I visited a crowded crematorium in Beijing this week, and from the video you can see the long line of cars waiting to get into the cremation area. The parking lot was also completely full. Several people there told me their loved ones had died from COVID. An employee said they'd been swamped with work. I saw metal containers full of yellow body bags and workers loading more coffins in. Stores nearby selling funerary items said they are much busier than normal. I also went to a COVID-designated hospital where a worker told me elderly patients with COVID are dying every day. A new study by Hong Kong researchers estimates nearly one million people in China could die from COVID if the country doesn't take necessary public health measures like increased vaccinations. The vaccination rate is still lagging for people over 60 and only around 42 percent of those over 80 have received a booster shot. And experts say that third dose is necessary to get enough protection since China is using less effective vaccines compared to the mRNA vaccines used overseas. China is only now going through this painful reopening that the rest of the world has already gone through, but China is not sharing the same data. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's not all the other factors that we are often told. It's actually the loss of space. If wildlife are not able to move over long distances, they affect the environment in a way that negatively impacts their either territories of land are much smaller and have legal prey.

CNN's Pete Muntean is at Chicago's international airport, which has been hit hard, as I understand it, by all these cancellations. Loads of Americans, I think it's more than 100 million people in this country, expected to travel about 50 miles or more over the holiday period. Walk us through how the airlines are dealing with this scale and level of cancellations.",

We've seen the number go up in just the last few moments, according to FlightAware. Nationwide 2,100 flights canceled in the U.S., 5,300 flights delayed. Chicago O'Hare here tops the list. Denver International Airport is next. And then Chicago Midway is third. But this is so important especially for international viewers. Because, O'Hare here is one of the biggest connecting airports in the U.S., a huge hub for American Airlines, the biggest hub for United Airlines. We were behind the scenes with United at the network operations center where they are trying to salvage some of those connections, keep troops from falling apart by rerouting passengers on different flights through different connecting airports that will not be hit as hard by the snow. Want you to listen to Joe Heins, the head of network operations for United Airlines. He says, after all the COVID issues airlines had last year and all the worker shortages they had and then the thousands of cancellations airlines had this summer, they say that they are really learning their lesson and they have stepped up ahead of this huge storm.

We will see, as tomorrow pans, out if we see the number of cancellations today, airlines have preemptively canceled about 1,000 flights tomorrow, Zain.",

Pete Muntean live for us there. Thank you so much. You might not want to book any trips for this week. But \"Conde Nast\" has plenty of recommendations for traveling in the year ahead. The magazine released a global guide of the 23 best places to go in 2023. From British Columbia to Kenya, \"Conde Nast Traveler\" says that these are the destinations people will want to visit in the next 12 months. Erin Florio is executive editor for \"Conde Nast Traveler.\" She joins us live. Erin, thank you. Some like to have on a positive happy story. And I love to travel. So I'm really excited about this. What I love about this list, you didn't have any of the usual suspects. There was no London, Paris, Rome. It was all places that were kind of off the beaten path. Walk us through how you compiled this list. ERIN FLORIO, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, \"CONDE NAST TRAVELER\": Sure. You don't need a reason to return to a place like London or Rome. But what's exciting about this list this year is so much more of the world is finally opened up to us. You know, we've been really limited in our travels for the past two years. With so many more borders opening this year, it created a really strong, really robust list, filled with unexpected places across the world, where people could travel to next year.",

We have other long haul destinations on that list if you're traveling from the U.S. or Europe. You know, it has always been a hot destination. Auckland has always been the gateway to New Zealand. It's played a bit of second fiddle to more of the outdoorsy destinations. But it has a great food scene. It has really exciting hotel openings. We had some great green, sustainable, high design hotels. And I think hot on the heels of the men's FIFA World Cup, it has to be noted that both Australia and New Zealand will be hosting the women's FIFA World Cup in 2023.
