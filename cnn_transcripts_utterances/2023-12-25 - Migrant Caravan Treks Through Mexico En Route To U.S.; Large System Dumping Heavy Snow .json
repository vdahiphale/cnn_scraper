And I was telling you earlier that this holding area behind me Customs and Border Protection had managed to empty it and as you can see now, there are filling it up again and you maybe see the shiny spots behind me. Those are immigrants who have been given a mylar blanket because it's a cold day windy here in Eagle Pass and we're right at the border with Mexico. This is a community of less than 30,000 people, Kate, that has to deal with all of those immigrants arriving every week. And it's been a situation where we see migrants crossing the river not too far from where we are and surrendering themselves to authorities to be processed. Troy Miller, the interim director for Customs and Border Protection earlier said that the influx of migrants they're currently seeing across southwest border is presenting a serious challenge to CBP personnel. This new migrants surge is also putting a lot of pressure on local law enforcement and this is what Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In this particular case, you know, people are still very unhappy with the economy. Even if you see in the recent consumer sentiment and consumer confidence data, they're a little bit less unhappy than they had been. And that's because we've seen a lot of price growth to date. That is cooling right now.But even so the fact that they are unhappy with the price growth that we've seen today, they're blaming Biden for it, whether Biden actually has any control over price growth, I think, is extremely overstated, both by Biden himself and his critics. To the extent that we've seen some good news, it's mostly a credit to the Federal Reserve, which has managed so far, to escape the chance of recession, which, you know, had pretty high odds not too long ago, while bringing inflation down. But either way, you know, Biden's going to get blamed or credited for whatever the economic conditions are. And as long as consumers are grumpy, he's going to get that blame.",

Same thing with gross domestic product, the measure of overall economic output, we're doing better today than had been forecasted before the pandemic began. That is not the case for most of the rest of the world. Most of the rest of the world is still dealing with the scarring effects of the pandemic, as well as some subsequent shocks, of course, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted energy supplies, primarily for Europe. And we've been in the United States somewhat shielded from all of that. So yes, so the rest of the world is not doing as well as U.S. is and there could still be some contagion effects if we have some shocks next year.",
