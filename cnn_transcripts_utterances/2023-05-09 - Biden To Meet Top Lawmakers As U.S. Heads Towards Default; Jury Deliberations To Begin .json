In Allen, Texas, a mass shooting that killed eight people has devastated an entire community and it has reignited the fierce debate about gun reform in America. To the south, the border town of Brownsville is also coping with tragedy after several migrants were fatally struck by a car.That collision has raised more questions about the security of the border and the people who cross it. Tributes continue to pour in for the victims of the Allen mass shooting. Residents have set up more memorials to honor those eight people killed when a gunman opened fire at an Outlet Mall. Authorities are still trying to determine his motive. A law enforcement source says social media posts suggest he may have embraced white supremacy. And now investigators want to know if those extremist ideologies incited him to carry out the rampage. CNN's Ed Lavandera has more on how the shooting unfolded.

But as the war rages in Ukraine, several regions in Russia have scaled back events amid security concerns and a lack of military equipment to display. We're still expecting remarks from President Vladimir Putin and a parade in Moscow where the Kremlin will show off its military might.But Russia's preparations have not stopped its attacks on Ukraine. The mayor of Kyiv says Russia launched a massive attack early Monday. But Ukraine was able to shoot down dozens of drones over the Capitol. And in just the past few hours, the Ukrainian Air Force says it intercepted 23 out of 25 cruise missiles with an official in Kyiv saying 15 were destroyed over the city.

We've already seen multiple cities across Russia's 11 time zones carry out their own festivities.Russian state T.V. is enrolling coverage of this event. But of course, as you say it has been scaled back. Russia is not staring victory in the face in Ukraine. And that is impacting the celebrations. We've seen in several regions closer to Ukraine. Cancel parades or scale them back. We know that there's going to be slightly fewer pieces of military equipment parading through Red Square today, slightly fewer troops on parade. They've canceled an event called the immortal regiment where Russia has traditionally parade holding placards of their relatives who were killed in World War II. The speculation they don't want to draw attention, perhaps to losses in the war in Ukraine, although the Kremlin also citing security concerns around this decision. And those security concerns are real, of course, not only the drone attack on the Kremlin that we saw last week, but there's been fuel depots that have been on fire and Russia, trains derailing, all of that. And meanwhile, in Ukraine, we're seeing President Zelenskyy who has -- who is trying to move Victory Day Ukraine to May 8th.

Prigozhin sees himself as carrying the weight of the assaults in Bakhmut and in eastern Ukraine, specifically kind of long running World War I-style trench battle which has seen, you know, which has caused very heavy losses on both sides, especially for Russia.And Prigozhin has been known to make very public statements throw around accusations and threats in order to get what he wants. He's not, you know, he's willing to make a fuss in the in the public space to get what he wants. In his last video was incredibly dramatic. He filmed himself standing over, you know, rows and rows of corpses of Russian soldiers, you know, bloodied bodies and him there at night sort of shining a torch on these bodies and then screaming into the camera saying the Ministry of Defense, this is your fault for not providing enough weapons. With quite dramatic pictures which were not received very welcomed in Russia. How long that's going to go on for well, Prigozhin was able to receive what he wants. He then recorded a statement about two days ago, I think, saying that the Ministry of Defense had complied and he was going to get the weapons that he wanted to receive. And that a -- General Surovikin, someone he admires in the military establishment who'd actually recently been sort of demoted within the -- within the staff of the established armed forces would now be the point of contact between Prigozhin and the military, per se.

Potentially, the first ever U.S. debt default as soon as the first of June. And there is no way out of this standoff right now, between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House. The White House has said for months, and they didn't want to even negotiate any sort of deal to raise the debt limit.They said a debt limit just needs to be raised and ensure that the U.S. does not default on all of its obligations. But the Republicans have said the opposite, there need to be significant negotiations and sniff significant spending cuts to try to begin to rein in the more than $31 trillion in debt that the U.S. has accumulated. And they have already passed a bill in the House just in the last couple of weeks that would impose a slew of spending cuts and tried to rein in some of Biden administration policy. Something that is a nonstarter in the Democratic led Senate. So, what will happen after this meeting on Tuesday? Well, the President agreed that there needs to be some level of negotiations and then he and Kevin McCarthy should sit down. That is uncertain. The White House is indicating that he will reiterate his same position to raise the National debt limit. McCarthy has said all along also that he will simply not just raise the National debt limit, saying the clean debt ceiling increase simply will not pass his house. It passed the house that is controlled by his party. Now, on the Senate Republican side, Mitch McConnell has also signaled that he is not going to deviate from McCarthy's position. He said he's not going to cut a deal with Joe Biden something he said simply will not pass the Republican led house. So, he says that the real way forward is for Biden to negotiate and deal with McCarthy. But even if they were to begin to negotiate, there is just not much time in order to get a deal together, get it through the House in the Senate before the potential debt default could occur in just a matter of a few weeks. So, just a lot of questions and uncertainty, about what could be a calamitous economic event if no deal is reached of the borrowing limit is not increased?
