The storm roared ashore as a category two hurricane in southern Louisiana, about 30 miles from Morgan City. Dangerous winds and heavy rain pounded the area, leading to flooding, downed trees and power outages. Right now more than 300,000 homes and businesses across the state are without power.

North of Lake Pontchartrain approaching southwest Mississippi. And so we're starting to see impacts in those areas as well. We're going to be working with our emergency partners at the local level to determine what state assets they may need to start the recovery process from this event, but it's been a long night and it looks like we could have, you know, another very busy day tomorrow, depending on some of these impacted areas.",

Once you kind of get away from the coast, there's a lot of areas that are very heavily wooded. And so there could be problems with trees coming down, power lines being impacted in those areas. So that is a major problem.One unique feature about what happened last year was we had a pretty severe drought and even wildfires across the state around this time last fall. So a lot of trees were damaged in that event. And so even with some of the recent thunderstorms and regular, you know, pop-up thunderstorm type activity, we've seen more trees and problems with those limbs and trees falling and impacting areas. So, again, we're going to, you know, start collecting those damage assessment reports from our local officials. Right now the biggest message for the public would be just to hunker down and stay indoors. There's really no reason to be out in these areas where the storm is still passing through. There's a lot of dangerous conditions on a lot of the roadways when you're talking about storm sitting in the overnight hours like this. You know, there's a whole secondary list of problems that could develop. So the best thing for the public to do right now is just to continue to ride this out and give those first responders and utility crews a chance to get out and start that recovery process.",

Of course, Ukraine now also has a new foreign minister as well.However, as far as that topic of those long distance weapons is concerned, there really wasn't much in the way of substance. One of the things that the secretary of state said is that he did have that discussion with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that he would take the points that were made in that discussion back to Washington, talk it over with President Biden, that President Biden would then debate all of this with his British counterpart when they meet later this week. However, the secretary of state did reiterate that the United States wants Ukraine to win and is in it for the long haul. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We want Ukraine to win and we're fully committed to keep marshaling the support that it needs for its brave defenders and citizens to do just that. Our collective message to Putin is clear. Our support will not wane, our unity will not break. PLEITGEN: Both the secretary of state and his British counterpart announced substantial new aid packages for Ukraine. The Brits, in terms of military support, the U.S. in terms of civilian support for Ukraine especially in terms of repairing damaged energy infrastructure, which of course is going to be very important when the winter comes. But one of the things is also clear is that this visit comes as Ukraine remains on the backfoot, especially in the east of the country. And one of the things that Ukrainian forces have been telling us on the ground is that right now they're not only outmanned by the Russians, but they are also outgunned. One of the big problems that they have is Russia's aerial campaign not just against Ukrainian cities, but of course, also against Ukraine's frontline troops. And that's why the Ukrainian say it's absolutely important for them to be able to strike Russia deep inside Russian territory with those Western weapons. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Once here, immigrants are then eligible to apply for temporary protected status. Haitian temporary protected status was recently extended and redesignated for Haiti, mainly due to violent anarchy in the country. But the total population of Springfield is around 58,000. So, that's around 25 percent Haitian. And the growing pains in the community have not always been easy. State officials say it's stressing resources. GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): That obviously represents a massive increase, based upon percentage of the population in Springfield. It is -- it is unprecedented in such a short period of time. The federal government simply has to be part of the solution. They have to step up. It is their policies that have created these surges. JIMENEZ (voice-over): The influx of Haitians has also manifested itself in other ways, including a tragedy. Specifically, in 2023 when 11-year-old Aiden Clark was killed in a Springfield bus crash, one that involved a Haitian immigrant who had a driver's license that was not valid in Ohio, as reported by \"The New York Times.\" Aiden's father declined to speak on camera, but as others have posted about the tragedy recently, he told CNN in a statement, \"We just want our family out of the news and for Aiden to not be mentioned in regards to politics.\" Putting aside any unverified theories about cats and dogs, Vilbrun Dorsainvil, also Haitian, says he understands the criticisms about the strain on resources caused by the influx of immigrants.",
