We're going to be in the same exact position with a potential shutdown just next month. And one of the big unresolved sticking points is funding for Ukraine.Joining us now, CNN Early Start Anchor and Chief National Affairs Analyst Casey Hunt. Casey, one of the things that's interesting to me right now is Democrats are not a monolith, nor are Republicans. The question I have is not can Speaker McCarthy get the votes. It's how is Matt Gaetz whipping votes right now. Do we have any sense if he can get to 218 in any way, shape, or form to actually bounce McCarthy?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the question around getting to 218 is whether there's somebody other than McCarthy who can get the votes it takes to become speaker. And right now, I think the answer to that is absolutely not. And that is the central problem for Gaetz. You can't beat somebody with nobody.However, he can, as we've discussed, create all sorts of headaches. And I do think there's a question about how many people are with Gaetz, because if it's six or ten votes, six or eight votes, that might be a situation where Kevin McCarthy could get what he needs from Democrats. If it's more like 20 votes, it becomes more complicated. And the reason it's more complicated is because of all those faces that you just showed on the screen. And Gaetz, there's been at least one, perhaps two, Congressional aides who've been anonymously out there saying over the weekend that Gaetz is not stupid. He is a smart man who doesn't seem to, in their words, have morals. He's not dumb. He knows what he needs. And he's been courting Congressional Democrats, progressives, to try to tell them, hey, you should be with me in getting rid of Kevin McCarthy. The Democratic establishment, I think you saw over the weekend, has been making some moves to try to keep Democrats together on this to make a collective decision about whether or not they want to save McCarthy's hide. And they clearly haven't figured that out yet. But I will say, and, Phil, I mean, you know this as well as anybody, the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was also out saying, I think you should follow the leader. She got all Democrats to follow the leader when she was in charge. Obviously, Kevin McCarthy cannot do what she did. He keeps saying, oh, I got a narrow majority, so did Nancy Pelosi, had a very narrow majority, and she didn't have these problems. So, I do think Democrats are capable of standing together but there are some questions that still have to be answered.",

So, again, Democratic leaders sent a letter out to their whole caucus saying, let's not say anything about this yet. Let's have a chance to see what happens. Let's talk to each other. Let's all get on the same page.But, obviously, people are going to start asking questions of all these members and they're going to have to answer for themselves. And I think AOC really laid out kind of a clear line for those who are in a position where she is, whose voters are not going to reward them for helping Kevin McCarthy, right? Reality is there is a similar dynamic inside the Democratic Party. There are people who, you know, are from more moderate areas of the country for whom, you know, helping out Kevin McCarthy, they can sell that in a campaign. They can say, you know, it's bipartisan. I was governing. I was trying to help. There are-- the demands from the left of the Democratic caucus, they play out a little bit differently than they do on the right, but they exist, right? There are voters out there who say or saying to some of these members of the House, like, why would you help a Republican? That doesn't make any sense. Kevin McCarthy is not trustworthy. The impeachment inquiry actually is one thing that I think we're going to be talking a lot about because Democrats are upset that Kevin McCarthy, you know, gave into his hardliners and allowed that impeachment inquiry to go forward. We saw the first hearing last week. You know, that actually could come back to bite him in this fight that's about to play out this week.",

I do think it's very interesting that he decided to go with somebody who potentially has a future in this seat, because the conversation had been previously that it would be somebody who would essentially take care of it while the election played out.There are three other major candidates, Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee, in particular, is one who has a lot of support from her fellow members of Congress. Newsom had promised he was going to pick a black woman for this seat. She's only the third black woman to ever serve in the Senate. But I think there is a sense that she might run for the seat, that she has political aspirations of her own for it. So, we'll see. It could really upend the race here. If she decides she's going to step back, then, obviously, that's not what would play out. But Lee has been trailing in some of the polling out in California, so I think it wasn't clear that she would necessarily be the choice of the voters. But I do think there are some angry Democrats in Washington. They don't want to obviously say bad things about this choice. They don't want to be saying negative things about the person that is now going to be the senator. But I think there are some people who are disappointed that this was not Barbara Lee.",

The core allegation the A.G. is making is that Trump grossly inflated his personal net worth by billions of dollars over many years. Let me give you just real quick, there's a bunch of different properties involved. I think there's one example here that really tells the story. Mar-a-Lago, the actual buildings at Mar-a-Lago were assessed by the Palm Beach County assessor at $20 million. But when it came time to value it, Donald Trump and his businesses claimed it was worth $500 million, obviously an enormous difference. And then what would they do? Why would they inflate these beyond ego purposes? They would then take those inflated figures, according to the allegations, go to banks and get loans, much bigger loans, much bigger lines of credit at better rates of interest than they would have otherwise. That is the core allegation the A.G. is making here.

The judge said in his opinion last week, yes, maybe by 10 or 20 percent, but not by 25 times, for example, like we just saw with Mar-a-Lago.Trump is also going to argue, well, we put a waiver in our documents. Basically, what we said is all these numbers we're giving you banks, they're worthless. They actually call it the worthless clause. The judge also was not overly impressed by that. He said the worthless clause itself is worthless. And Trump is going to argue, there's no victim here, there's no loss because the banks all got repaid with interest.

We have -- Fentanyl has killed a hundred thousand American youths or boys and girls. We to stop that. Ukraine send the message to Mr. Putin that we're here to stay and that we don't want to and that we're going to stop in Ukraine. He cannot go -- he cannot expand the war.
