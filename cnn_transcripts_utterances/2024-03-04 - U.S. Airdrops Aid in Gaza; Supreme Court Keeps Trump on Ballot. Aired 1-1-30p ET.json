Because we have been waiting for this for over a month now, and arguably for many months, some would say even since January 6, when even the impeachment hearing discussions were about whether or not the insurrectionist ban would actually apply to Donald Trump.What we see now, the Colorado Supreme Court said, yes, it should, and he ought to be as qualified. But when it came down to this Supreme Court behind me, they said, no, a state is not responsible or should not be in a position to disqualify a president of the United States. They can focus on a state office, for example, but not a federal office. Now, this is a 9-0 decision, but it does have some inconsistency in the sense of a concurring opinion. At least three justices sided together in a concurrence, and another, Amy Coney Barrett, to suggest that, no, no, we may all have the same conclusion here that has reached, saying that he cannot be as qualified, but as how far we need to go, that's a real issue here. Now, the how much further, this is the point of contention. The three so-called liberal justices saying, look, we can all agree there's a patchwork issue, the patchwork issue happening here, meaning that every single person, every different state cannot have their own individual state laws of how one reaches the conclusion here, and therefore it would call chaos into effect. But they said you should stop there, not go far and say that Congress should actually do anything more to change the way they operate for Section 3.",

It does undercut the idea that this is a court that unanimously can understand what was at issue here.I don't want to take away from the 9-0 ruling that Donald Trump has to remain on the ballot, but there's a very fundamental difference on how far the court should have even gone in terms of how Section 3 of the 14th Amendment would be enforced. That's the provision that was at issues here, the anti-insurrectionist provision. And what the majority said was that only Congress through specific legislation can enforce that. And the justices who concurred, at least the three liberals, said, what about if there was a prosecution of someone who had been in their words an oath-breaking insurrectionist? And Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the three liberals that it shouldn't just be specific congressional legislation that should enforce this anti-insurrectionist ban, but she was very tempered in her approach, and she took a shot at those liberals who in writing up their concurring opinion really tried to say, you, majority, have gone too far. They invoked the dissenting opinion from Bush v. Gore, and as if to say you are you're overstepping here in terms of your rationale. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who sided with the three liberals in terms of trying to chastise the majority for going too far, said: \"In my judgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency. The court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.\" But the three liberals, Democratic appointees, were not going to keep that temperature down, especially in a case like this that involves Donald Trump.",

MARIO NICOLAIS, CHALLENGED TRUMP'S BALLOT ELIGIBILITY IN COLORADO: Well, first, obviously, we're disappointed that we didn't win everything. But I want to be clear this in no way exonerates former President Trump from being an oath-breaking insurrectionist. The Supreme Court took great pains to avoid addressing that at all and simply kicked the can down the road. That's really what the Supreme Court says. Oh, well, this is still out there and this is still an issue and Congress should deal with it, is effectively what they said. And I think that when you compare the fact that it took a month for the Supreme Court to issue a 13-page opinion, when we had a 100-page lower court opinion and a 103-page Colorado Supreme Court opinion that went into the evidence and analyzed it and found that he was an oath- breaking insurrectionist, that still stands. All they did is, is say, well, courts and state courts don't have the jurisdiction to do that. They in no way said that he was exonerated from what he did on January 6.",

I think that the decision was an act of cowardice in a lot of ways, in that they did not want to deal with the primary issue of whether there was an insurrection, whether Donald Trump engaged in it. So, again, they kicked the can down the road. My concern is that act of cowardice today will lead to bloodshed in the future, that it will lead to violence in the future.

And, furthermore, I don't think it's clear that it requires impeachment and conviction by the Senate. In fact, that's not even brought into here because he's a former president. There's no impeachment of him at this point. I think the concern is, well, what do we do? Is it something where Congress has to pass legislation now and we could then bring a case immediately, or is it something where, on January 6, 2025, they could actually proceed and say, hey, look, we're proceeding right now and saying he's not eligible to hold office?

And Israeli officials have made clear in the past that that is the deadline for securing a deal here. If not, they vow to press ahead with a major military offensive in Rafah. Now, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, chose not to send a delegation to those talks, we're told, because Israel is still waiting for two key things from Hamas. The first of those is a list of the hostages who would be released under an initial agreement. And they're also waiting for Hamas to respond to the latest framework in terms of the numbers of Palestinian prisoners who they would demand that Israel release in exchange for those Israeli hostages. Now, a senior Hamas official told us yesterday that they view the sticking points as something else entirely. They view it as Israel not having yet agreed to a pathway to a permanent cease-fire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and that there are also major sticking points as it relates to allowing Palestinians who evacuated Northern Gaza to be able to return to their homes, but no question that Benny Gantz arriving in Washington amid all of this at a very, very key moment. He is a member of the war cabinet. He's also, of course, a rival of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's. And he's also been a key proponent in pushing for the importance of securing the release of the hostages, whereas the impression here is that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is more focused on destroying Hamas, putting that above the goal of releasing the hostages. So, certainly, these meetings are happening at a critical time. The question is whether, when he returns to Israel, if he can influence the direction of those talks and whether or not there can actually be a hostage deal struck by the end of this week.",

And I think you heard a little bit of this from Jeremy, that we -- that his argument is that Israel first needs to secure the hostages and then can go about the slow process of trying to dismantle Hamas. I think, because of his military background and a bit more of a pragmatic view in the minds of many in the Biden administration than Prime Minister Netanyahu has, I think he recognizes that you may take out the top leadership of Hamas, but Hamas is an idea about resistance to Israel, and they're never going to wipe out all of that. So the question is, how do you do this with the least loss of innocent Palestinian life and with the maximum number of hostages released?
