The markets and the main events. Look at them. They're all up sharply. The Dow is at probably the best of the day. The events of the day that have been driving everything: The next UK Prime Minister will face a giant economic test and must back the confidence of the markets. Twitter shares are down four percent after the reports that the US government may scrutinize Elon Musk's takeover. And tonight, the Chairman of Turkish Airlines tells me he wants people to visit Turkey, as well of course as transit passengers. I promised that we'd be in London tonight and indeed live from London, it is Friday, October the 21st. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, end of the week, I still mean business. One candidate has already announced that she wants to be the next Prime Minister of Britain. The winner could be announced in just a matter of days. The threshold has left room for no more than three candidates. The one who has already thrown her hat in the ring is Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House. The former Chancellor, Rishi Sunak could be next. And of course Boris Johnson, is still the enigma. No one knows is he, will he, or is he just going to try to be kingmaker? Bianca is with me. She is in Downing Street. So, I'm guessing Penny Mordaunt is hoping for sort of get those signed up fast. Why isn't Rishi Sunak already said \"I'm in\" after all, the vote is only in two or three days?",

He is up over around 90 MPs now, so extremely close to that critical threshold. Boris Johnson on the other hand, he has around 60 MPs backing him and Penny Mordaunt, she has only just around twenty five to twenty six last time I checked, so there's nothing for her to lose to come out and say that she felt encouraged by colleagues that she needed to stand in order to unite the party and in the national interest. But before we get to the numbers and the probabilities, let's just step back and take a look at these three frontrunners.

So only time will tell whether or not the former Prime Minister will be willing to come out and publicly declare. All suggestions this evening is that he is going to do it. He apparently spoke to a former PPS, a private secretary of hers and said \"I'm up for it.\" And he is traveling back to the UK expected to arrive tomorrow. This is a figure who elicits just as much love as loathing within the Conservative Party at the moment. So, making the case that Johnson could be the unity candidate to take the party forward will definitely be a difficult one -- Richard.",
