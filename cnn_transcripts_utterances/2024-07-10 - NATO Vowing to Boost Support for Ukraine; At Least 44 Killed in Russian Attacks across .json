And the secretary of state said that they will be in the air of Ukrainian airspaces by this summer. That's a significant development. Now we don't know exactly how many of those are on their way. We'll try and figure that out but we're learning about bits and pieces of this overall commitment, the security a commitment, this military commitment that NATO is going to make to Ukraine here at this NATO gathering over the course of the last few days here. We're expecting to learn more yesterday. As you said, President Biden announced new air defenses, many new types of air defenses, that are going to be going to Ukraine. And he was very specific to say that some of those air defenses are really, really focused on the capability to shoot down those missiles, like the ones that we saw in just the last few days that targeted that children's hospital in Ukraine. So we'll watch to see what more details we get. But it's very clear that these NATO leaders feel like they are providing a very robust military commitment to Ukraine at this moment in time. And one of the other things that they have been talking about is that NATO is standing up this new command. The secretary of state said, this is the first time that they're setting up a command for an aspiring nation that wants to join NATO. Of course, they continue to say that NATO is in Ukraine's future. Not exactly explicit about when that will happen. But when you talk to diplomats, they say that the fact that they are setting up this command really demonstrates that commitment isn't just rhetorical; it is actually being acted on in practice as well.",

But also with some of theelections that have been happening in Europe as well. But the focus really of this NATO summit right now on that help for Ukraine and especially help for Ukraine as far as airpower is concerned, is extremely important for the Ukrainians right now. Of course, it's not just cities that are getting bombarded by the Russians but Ukraine's front line troops as well. And what the Russians have now apparently figured out is how to -- how to use their own air force more effectively than they have been able to before. They've developed bombs now that they can throw off much further away from the front lines. And there's really only two ways that the Ukrainians would be able to deal with that. One of them is jets with more powerful radars and more powerful missiles. Hence, the F-16s. And the other thing is more powerful surface to air missile systems. That's why the Ukrainians say they so badly need those Patriot air defense systems and also the longer range systems from other countries as well. So it really seems as though what Ukraine has been asking for right now is what NATO appears to want to be giving. And certainly wanted to make that statement at that NATO summit. As far as the air defense is concerned, there's really two nuances that we've been looking at as far as the pledges are concerned. I am standing, as you've just pointed out, on the place where that missile strike took place at the children's hospital, flattening large parts of the building that you see behind me. The Ukrainians are saying that they need a lot more surface to air capabilities. And in those pledges that we heard yesterday from President Biden and now, of course, also from other NATO members as well, there's not only those longer range air defense systems but also medium and short-range ones. And, of course, we know, Becky, that the Ukrainians are saying the building behind me, was hit by a Russian cruise missile and certainly medium range surface to air missile systems would be capable of taking something like that out. The Ukrainians are saying they need more of that to protect their cities. Also in light of the fact that a lot of their critical infrastructure, especially heating and electricity right now, is getting targeted by the Russians. And the Ukrainians say if there aren't able to do something about that very quickly, a lot of people are going to be freezing without electricity once the winter comes, Becky.",

Caught on camera is Maxim, a 24-year-old Ukrainian living here, recruited online by Russian agents, who first just asked him to daub anti-war graffiti, filmed buying a lot of energy drinks, a move that led Polish agents to arrest him and 15 others because he dropped a receipt from here at a crime scene.

And they're making their way down what's known as Salaheddin Road past -- and I was driving that road -- it's like the apocalypse. Huge swaths of Gaza look apocalyptic. It's shades of gray and black.

And then what gets into the south is different than what gets into the north. We have these growing warnings of famine across all of Gaza. And that is because, right now, for example, into the south, about two thirds of the trucks that are getting in are actually commercial trucks, not humanitarian aid. So they're bringing supplies to the market, which is, on the one hand, good but, on the other hand, it doesn't make a lot of sense because most people can't afford the basic cost of fruits and vegetables. When I was there around 10 days ago, a kilo, 2.25 pounds of chicken wings was around $30. I mean, no one can really afford these sorts of prices. And you don't have hygiene kits going in. You don't have baby powder going in, you don't have diapers going in. We've been asking for awhile to be able to use alternative routes because it's also not just an issue of what Israel is clearing. We're also now facing this added layer of challenge on the other side because of the desperation, the growing lawlessness of criminal activity, of actually being able to safely move what is being cleared from the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza, into the warehouses for further distribution. If you look at what's happening in the north where the famine is at its worst, there you really only see flour that is coming in. And obviously people can't sustain themselves eating flour alone. And you try to move certain goods from south to the north, it just -- it doesn't work. I mean, the system has always been broken. And now there's just layers upon layers of challenges that we're having to face. And it's extraordinarily disheartening when you're in these camps and you're literally distributing whatever you can get your hands on, right? So we managed to get our hands on, for example, this -- sanitary pads. And we're handing those out and, yes, people are grateful. But they're looking at us saying, you know, is this all you have?

And with the assumption that he would be the opponent that Donald Trump will face in November. And so, behind the scenes, they don't say this as much publicly. But behind the scenes, they want Joe Biden to continue to be the candidate because that is what they are prepared for. They are not sure what would happen if he were to ultimately step aside and have somebody else run in his place. Someone like Vice President Kamala Harris and what -- how that could impact their campaign over the next four months. We did hear Donald Trump attack Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly last night. I will argue that that's actually some of the first real attacks we have heard from not just Trump but also his campaign overall. So far throughout his campaign, he has largely ignored attacking Harris. But clearly they are monitoring this situation and weighing right now who -- what's going to happen next. They are watching like the rest of the world about what decision Joe Biden will make. Now as for the first part of your question about questions over who could potentially be his vice presidential pick, there are still three top names that I keep hearing from his team. Marco Rubio, who was at that rally last night with his entire family; senator JD Vance as well as Doug Burgum. And every day I talk to Donald Trump's advisors about this. And they say they still are not sure who it's going to be. And they also are unclear if even Donald Trump himself knows who it is going to be.
