A train resembling his top secret bulletproof caravan just spotted at the Russian border, all eyes on Kim's meeting with Vladimir Putin, as soon as a few hours from now.Plus, Hurricane Lee growing even bigger, a new forecast showing Lee on track to get dangerously close to the Northeast. I'm going to talk to a long time storm chaser with a stark warning tonight for those living on the entire East Coast. And police expanding the search for the escape killer who managed to sneak past hundreds of officers, steal a van, and alter his appearance, even showing up over the weekend at our former co-worker's house. A U.S. marshal overseeing that search is my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening, I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Putin's cavalry is coming, led by Kim Jong-un. North Korea's reclusive leader is expected to arrive in just hours for a face to face meeting with Vladimir Putin in Russia, a meeting that Putin hopes will result in an arms deal that he badly needs to fight the war in Ukraine. We've got some new video just shared by Russian state television. They say that this is the train carrying Kim Jong-un. Now, it does closely resemble the green and gold highly armored slow- moving train that's used by Kim. It's pretty incredible to see this, it's right along the. Border you can see that it's moving incredibly slowly. In fact, the train as we understand it that he travels and is believed to move at a top speed of only 37 miles an hour in part because it so weighed down by heavy armor. Well, Russian TV says the train was spotted, as I said, near that North Korean/Russian border that you are looking at right there. We can't independently confirm the authenticity of this video, but we do know Kim has used a train that looks just like that in the past. It also looks very similar to the train used by his father and grandfather who also ruled North Korea. We've got a brief glimpse inside the train back in 2019, when North Korean state media released this photo. You can see the dark pink chairs, and according to a South Korean newspaper report about the train, the train included conference rooms and audience chambers, and event full bedrooms, and flat screen TVs. Now, Kim and Putin are expected to meet for the first time since this visit. Now, this picture that you're looking at here is 2019, before the pandemic. So, this meeting now is hugely significant for both leaders. It's going to be Kim's first known trip outside North Korea in about four years. And, of course, this country is one of only six pariah states that voted this year at the U.N. to side to Russia in its war against Ukraine. And Putin and Kim Jong Un are expected to meet at the Russian city of Vladivostok, which is a little over 80 miles from the North Korean border. Here's how the Kremlin is describing the meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY PESKOV, PUTIN SPOKESMAN (through translator): Like with any neighbor, we consider ourselves obligated to establish good mutually beneficial relations. We will continue to strengthen our friendships. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, obviously, they are saying that because they need to say, it but there is no warning from the U.S. that seems to have any impact on either dictator.

So, thanks very much to both of you. And, General, let me start with you. You know, it's an unprecedented moment, and it's an important moment. How much military aid can North Korea actually supply Russia? And is there a way for you to try to gauge what it would mean for the Ukraine war? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: They can -- they can contribute quite a bit, but mostly in terms of ammunition. They have the same kind of ammunition that Putin has been using, especially in the artillery realm. That's what Putin needs in this stage of the war. It has been an artillery duel from the very beginning. He is running out of the kind of conventional munitions that he needs. None of these munitions would be precision guided munitions, like the HIMARS, or some of the GMLRS that we have provided to Ukraine. So, area fire weapons, he -- Kim has a lot of them. But he does not have the kind of equipment to fire those kind of missiles, or artillery pieces, or the kind of army that you would need. His army is fourth rate, much further behind Russia, not as good, but he can certainly provide a base of support in terms of conventional munitions.",

You know, as we watched over the last two decades, Kim has attempted to build a rocket force, a ballistic missile force, a nuclear force because truthfully, he is spending all of his money in that arm of defense.His standing army his air force is not very good. So, he will use these weapons as terror weapons, but he hasn't had the capability yet, as we've assessed in the West, to match the rockets with the nuclear weapons. That's critical. You know, he throws off a missile every once in awhile over the Sea of Japan, or over to cross the continental land mass of Japan and it's impressive. But he still had difficulties in terms of mastering the techniques needed to use for ballistic missile weaponry. He wants to go, further and have a match between a nuclear weapon, a missile, and in some cases a submarine. So, these are the kind of things that Russia can certainly help with because the Russian government has a great nuclear force.",

In new court filing, Trump points to several remarks the judge has made about January 6th, including that the rioters were there, quote, in loyalty to one man. Trump warning, quote, the public reasonably and understandably questioned whether Judge Chutkan arrive at all of her decisions in this matter and partially, or in fulfillment of her prior negative statements regarding President Trump. Now, we also have a new filing from Trump in Fulton County, Georgia, where he is now asking a court to dismiss several criminal charges against him. There, of course, Fani Willis wants to try all 19 defendants next month. OUTFRONT now, Gabe Sterling, the Republican chief operating officer for Georgia secretary of state. He testified in the Fulton County case. This is his first interview since Trump was indicted. And, of, course I should say, Gabe, you know, and you will call 150 witnesses and you'll be -- you'll be one of those as well. So, the special -- the special grand juries vote to recommend charges against Trump in your state was not unanimous. The newly released report shows that there was one no vote and 20 yes votes. Now, you were in the room. You testified in front of the scope of your peers, Fulton County residents. Did you sense any doubt as you took their questions? GABRIEL STERLING (R), CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE: Well, thanks, Erin. I just want to acknowledge that today is 9/11. And my heart and prayers go out to everybody who -- first responders, people who lost their lives and it reminds us that all these are serious things. And when I was in that room, I took the responsibility seriously. And there were some people who had some deeper questions surrounding, you know, the potentials of the stop the steal type of questions you might expect. But nobody looked like they have their mind made up when I was there testifying. And also, that 20-1 vote was on some of the counts.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Stone by stone, hour by hour, the desperate search for survivors pushes on. The silence in this remote mountainous village punctured only by the whales of those who survive, now left two more. For the rescue team here, this is a race against time. There is a woman in her 12-year-old document buried beneath the rubble, and their family waiting anxiously for the news of whether they have survived Friday's earthquake. They are quickly losing hope. Raziqa has already buried 19 members of her family. Now, she fears she will soon have to bury her niece, Shima (ph). On Saturday morning, we can still hear her voice, she tells me. She was alive, now we can't hear her. They took too long to get here, until now, we have been dogging digging through the rubble with our bare hands. If help had arrived sooner, we could have rescued them in time. Though small in size, the village of Imi N'Tala was among the hardest hit by the earthquake, the deadliest Morocco has suffered in decades. With three days on, rescue teams have only just arrived.

Some people can't go 21 days. You cannot continue to spend your way out of indebtedness. You can't do it. So we've got to make some tough choices. It's not going to be quickly overnight. It can be gradual, but it has to be done. But you can't be throwing more fuel on the fire, and that's what they're doing.",

The latest CNN poll shows 67 percent of Democratic voters do not want President Biden to be the Democratic nominee in 2024. Those numbers are pretty stunning. And 76 percent of all voters have serious concerns that President Biden who is already 80, whether he would be able to serve another four years as president.I know you saw the poll. You saw those members. You know you hear this from your constituents as well. Even if it's not you, and obviously you've considered it -- you are considering it.

The man you see here is believed to be Cavalcante now sporting a clean-cut look, shaved the beard and mustache he had behind bars. He also managed to steal this delivery van, that one, the white van there in the back of the truck.Police say he was caught on a doorbell camera more than 20 miles away from the original search parameter. Now his sister is in the custody of ICE, facing deportations, after she failed to cooperate with the investigation and is suspected of trying to help him. OUTFRONT now, Robert Clark, supervisor deputy of the U.S. Marshal Service. And, Deputy Clark, I very much appreciate your time. You know, 12 days in here, in some sense is incredible that he has been able to evade capture this long. Do you have any idea where he may be tonight? ROBERT CLARK, SUPERVISORY DEPUTY U.S. MARSHAL, EASTERN PA DISTRICT: Good evening, Erin. At this point, we're still investigating the area where that van was left in East Nantmeal Township. We have no reason to believe he's left Pennsylvania. And until he gives us some evidence or we obtain evidence that he's left Pennsylvania, we're going to continue to look in that area where that van was left. So, right now, we have investigators following up every tip, every lead in that area. And we continue to ask the public to be vigilant in that area, should he be walking around in the neighborhood or in that area in Chester County, please make sure you lock your doors. You notice any disturbances, and most importantly, you lock up your keys. Don't leave them in the vehicle. This could be easily avoided. It wasn't --",

I believe, like I said earlier in the press conference, that was an advantage for Cavalcante. But when he came out of the woods and now he's in an urban setting, I believe the advantage shifts over to law enforcement because this is what we do every day in the U.S. Marshal Service.
