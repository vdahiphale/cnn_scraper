The special Atlanta area grand jury looking into whether President Trump and his allies broke the law when they tried to overturn the 2020 election has finished its investigation. But there's no word yet on the panel's findings. Fulton County's district attorney will now decide whether to pursue indictments. Fani Willis started her investigation after then- President Trump called the Georgia secretary of state to pressure him to find the votes needed for Trump to overturn his loss there. The investigation later expanded to include a look into the false claims of election fraud and a plan to use fake electors and a threat against election workers. Let's bring in CNN's political correspondent Sara Murray, who's been following all of this, and CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers. So, Sara, she was also -- Sara, what happens now that this report is done? What can we expect?",

All of this stuff is likely to be reflected in this final report. That is what goes to prosecutors. And then, on January 24, there is going to be a hearing where the judge who is overseeing the grand jury is going to decide whether that report should be made public, something the grand jurors said they wanted was for this report to be published. In this report, the special grand jury makes its recommendations. Who does it think, if anyone, should face charges, what kinds of charges? Then it is up to the DA to go to a regular grand jury, decide if she is going to pursue those indictments, ask for those indictments, and then sort of get the ball rolling as far as the public portion of this goes, Abby.",

She wants the public to know what all of this evidence looks like, how carefully they have assembled it. She really wants to try to work on public opinion on this before charges are brought. So I think she will be very influenced by what the report says. But, of course, the final decision as to whether to seek an indictment is up to her, and she can't issue it herself. She will have to go to a different grand jury in order to actually get that indictment.",

MURRAYcommitted crimes, if anyone, and what kind of crimes do they think these people committed? Do they think that anyone should be indicted? The district attorney has already said a number of people, including Rudy Giuliani, are targets of her investigation. So we will see what the special grand jury concluded as far as those targets. We also just may get a lot more information about what was going on with the former president and his allies around the 2020 election in Georgia. We have obviously learned a lot of that as time has passed, and also through the House Select Committee's investigation into January 6. But this is a report that could really lay out a broader narrative of what Donald Trump and his allies were up to. And in our conversations, we have heard from witnesses that this was a grand jury that's very engaged. They had a lot of information in front of them as they were questioning witnesses, and they would actively sort of jump in, ask questions, ask follow-ups, that kind of thing.",

So the judge will have to weigh those two parties' desires to publish it against the privacy interests of the people who are mentioned in the report.I think, ultimately, because it is a matter of such pressing public interest, it will become public. And then I think, if Fani Willis is planning to indict, it will come relatively quickly after the report comes out. I think she will want to wait for that. She want to let it sink in for a few days, let the public see all of this evidence that's been amassed. And then I think she will probably go forward if she decides to do so and go to the grand jury for her indictments.",

And President Biden is in Mexico City right now for the North American Leaders Summit. High up on his agenda is this record surge of immigration. It has inundated cities like El Paso. And that's exactly where Biden was yesterday for his first trip to the Southern border as president. But, while he was there, he did not see any of the migrants who are there, many of them still living on the streets. He did, however, meet with border officials and local leaders. CNN's senior White House correspondent, M.J. Lee, is with the president in Mexico City. So, M.J., what do we expect from this summit with Mexico and Canada? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Abby, the president arrived here last night in Mexico City. And we will see the formal diplomatic work really begin tonight, when he holds a bilateral meeting with the Mexican president at the national palace behind me. And then the two leaders will be joined by the Canadian prime minister for a ceremonial dinner. But keep in mind that a U.S. president hasn't visited Mexico since going back to 2014. That, of course, would have been President Obama. Things were really tough during the Trump years. The U.S. and Mexico relationship, that relationship was incredibly fraught. And while we expect, of course, that President Biden and the Mexican president will try to show some goodwill during his visit here, of course, they are going to be discussing a number of really tough issues. Top among them, of course, is immigration. Keep in mind that last week, when the Biden administration announced its essential expansion of Title 42, the very controversial program at the U.S. Southern border, it included an agreement that Mexico would take as many as 30,000 migrants per month back into Mexico, these people that were turned away at the U.S. border. And, interestingly, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters here this morning that they're not really looking to announce any sort of new plan during this meeting, as far as that is concerned, that it really will just take some time for both the U.S. and the Mexico sides to figure out whether that initial agreement is working. So, again, needless to say, immigration is going to be a top and probably one of the most important issues that the three leaders discuss in the coming days.",

He met with local leaders and community leaders. He also ended up going to a migrant aid center. But it was really notable that he didn't end up sort of seeing or meeting with any migrants. Yesterday, a senior official told me that that happened to be purely coincidental. And, again, Jake Sullivan, telling reporters this morning that the focus really was to meet with groups who are providing essential services to these migrants, but, again, just really notable that, given that the point was to see with his own eyes sort of the dire situation and the scenes that we have been seeing over the last few weeks, the president or ultimately didn't end up seeing some of those images that we have really been reporting on from the Southern border.",

But, that said, I think what was more important is that he get the briefings from the Border Patrol agents that he met with and get a visual inspection himself of the situation at the border. Ultimately, the president's visit there, while symbolically important, I think the White House has indicated in the plans that they have that they're taking this issue seriously. And, fortunately, I think the plan that they have launched today is an innovative -- or last week, rather -- is an innovative plan that I think will take some pressure off the immediate border and help in the short term.",

He's received a lot of condemnation and criticism from the refugee and immigration rights community for keeping Title 42 and for some of the other policies that he's implemented during his time in office.So, whether or not he was seen with migrants, I think that -- and on the other side, of course, Republicans, he's seen as not doing enough. He talked a lot about El Paso getting the resources that they needed. There -- in this new immigration plan that they announced last week, there are more Border Patrol going down to the border to help process immigrants. So, really, this is -- perhaps they thought this was a no-win situation for him. I haven't heard what their actual explanation was here. But it seems that, at least at this point, they're not ready for those particular optics.",

Mexico could very easily say the United States, hey, you're stuck with these populations. But prior to this summit, the Mexicans agreed to take 30,000 back from certain countries. That was significant. But I really think it's important that the administration understands this, to recognize that Mexico has really leaned forward in terms of taking a wide array. Look, Title 42 would not be possible without Mexican cooperation. Now, does the administration want Mexico to do more, to take more of these individuals back, to do more to secure its Southern border and stop the flow of people? Absolutely. But they're in a difficult spot, because Mexico has done an extraordinary job thus far. And I'm sure the administration's going to be pushing for more assistance. But, at the same time, I really think it's important to recognize how much Mexico has already done.",

And rioters smashed windows and demolished offices. They even tried to set fire to carpet in the building, in the congressional building. And the damage is extensive, Abby. One official says, imagine this. Blood, feces and urine were found in palace rooms. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has only been in power since January 1, and he was barely beginning the process of getting his new government up and running. Now he has a full-blown institutional and political crisis in his hands. Brazilian officials in the capital, Brasilia, have been meeting today in the presidential palace that just yesterday was under siege. The new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, met with his Cabinet for the first time today to make the vandalized buildings operational again and ensure the security situation across the country doesn't get even worse. President Lula da Silva is vowing to prosecute the rioters. At least -- and you mentioned this before, Abby -- 400 people have been arrested, but that figure is expected to dramatically increase. It's hard to overstate the seriousness of what happened. We just learned that at least 70 people were injured, six of them severely, but no one died, According to the Brazilian Health Ministry. Supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed those key buildings over claims that the presidential run-off election in October was stolen. Bolsonaro lost by less than 2 percentage points to current President Lula da Silva. He refused to attend the inauguration of his successor on January 1, choosing to travel to Florida instead, where he currently is -- Abby, back to you.",

Those officers here in Newport News are assigned to middle school and high schools. These elementary schools do have school security officers who are trained. They are not police, but they are trained, and they do not have weapons. The issue here, though, is that one school security officer here at Richneck is also shared with another elementary school.
