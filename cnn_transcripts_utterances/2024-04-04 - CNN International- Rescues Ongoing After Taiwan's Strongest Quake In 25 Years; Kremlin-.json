One of the most stark examples of it is this residential building that was killed over on almost on its side in Wednesday morning's 7.4 magnitude earthquake. Firefighters rescued some of the residents from that building with ladders out of windows.But, as you drive around this city of around 100,000 residents, you're hard pressed to find other buildings that even have a fraction of the kind of damage that you see over my shoulder. In fact, much of this city appears to be operating as usual with restaurants and shops open. There are shelters that the city government has established. I was just at one, for more than 100 people who are spending the night there, now for a second night and being provided with services. But, by and large, this city managed to escape despite the power, the historic power of this earthquake, escape an enormous death toll. Yes. There are more than 1,000 people injured, among them the Mayor of Hualien himself who was on crutches. He said that a cupboard fell on him on Wednesday morning. Everybody I've talked to is sharing similar accounts, Erica, where they say, hey, we've grown up in this earthquake-prone city on this earthquake-prone island and we've lived through countless earthquakes. But, Wednesday's earthquake was a different kind of beast. It was more powerful and it lasted longer. And yet, we are seeing a real sign of Taiwan's resilience, how people get over this so quickly, and also how the buildings around here seem to have a structural integrity that's protected them from falling and pancaking like in other countries where I've seen horrific earthquakes with much higher death tolls. Now, the situation out in the mountains, that's a different story. Erica. As I rode in on a train from Taipei to Hualien, we could see the aftermath of these massive landslides where the entire faces of mountains collapsed, and that's where the rescue effort is so intense right now, to try to reach more than 600 people who are believed to be stranded. Take a listen to what one person said to describe what the deadly falling rocks were like on Wednesday morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): There were too many rocks like bullets falling from above. We didn't know where to run. We were all scared. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, the Taiwanese government has said there could be powerful aftershocks for the next three to four days, which could have a magnitude of as much as seven, which is just a little bit shy of Wednesday morning's earthquake. And residents here said there were aftershocks overnight that frightened some of them. That said, since I've been here, I really haven't felt anything and that's a good thing, because I'm not as experienced as the residents here are with earthquakes. This is a reality.This city lies close to a very active fault line, and that's part of why it is so vulnerable to these earthquakes in the past and perhaps part of why it has been codified to have very strong construction regulations to protect the kind of awful scenes that we've seen in other countries when they're hit by very powerful earthquakes. It does feel, amid the tragic loss of life here, Erica, that this area has dodged a bullet for how awful the destruction and loss of life could have been.",

This will mark their first conversation since that deadly strike. The White House says Biden is heartbroken and outraged. Officials add, though, that U.S. support for Israel's current military operation remains unchanged. This call also comes as Palestinians mark another sober milestone. Gaza's Health Ministry saying more than 33,000 people have now been killed in the enclave since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live at this hour in Jerusalem.

And as we understand that President Biden is set to make known his frustrations, his growing impatience with the way that Israel is conducting this war in Gaza with the Israeli Prime Minister when he reaches him on the phone. We know that in the past they have expressed frustrations with each other. During the last call, Prime Minister Netanyahu was the one to express frustrations about reports in the American press about this criticism of Israel's war effort. That also came as Netanyahu's top political rival Benny Gantz had recently traveled to Washington.So, we have seen points of tension in this relationship before. What is different now is that, of course, it comes just days after the Israeli military carried out these airstrikes that killed seven World Central Kitchen workers, six of them foreign nationals, including one dual American-Canadian citizen. The Israeli military acknowledging its responsibility for these strikes, acknowledging that a grave mistake was made, and apologizing for these strikes. But, the question is now, as President Biden expresses these frustrations, will he actually do anything to change U.S. policy towards Israel? And so far, the indications are that he will not. We have watched, as despite the rising criticism from the White House directed at the Israeli Prime Minister, the White House has continued to support Israel's war in Gaza, has continued to send weapons and approved new weapons sales, including recently sales of F-18s to the Israeli government. So, frustrations to be expressed, yes, but no overwhelming shift in U.S. policy expected.",

No doubt about it, 198 workers aid who have been killed since the beginning of this conflict, the largest number killed in a single conflict annually over the course of the last 20 years. And so, this strike really just served to highlight the dangers that these aid workers face, a danger that they face only because of the desperate humanitarian situation inside the Gaza Strip.Jose Andres accusing the Israeli military of systematically targeting the aid workers in this convoy, saying that the response from the Israeli military, the explanations about misidentifying the target are simply insufficient. And today, the World Central Kitchen is also now calling for an independent investigation into this, as the Australian Prime Minister, for his part, also says that he believes the explanations from the Israeli military of how this strike occurred are still insufficient. And indeed, we still are missing many key pieces to this puzzle. The Israeli military has said that they misidentified this convoy, that it should not have been struck, but they haven't explained how it could have been misidentified, in particular after the World Central Kitchen shared information about this convoy with the Israeli military prior to it leaving. The logos of the World Central Kitchen were on these vehicles. So, many more questions for the military to explain, as we expect an investigation to take place.",

But, I think you've already mentioned some of the really important things and the challenges that NATO has in front of it right now. And really, the 75th anniversary of the founding of NATO is a very important one, because right now it appears as though NATO is probably a lot more relevant than it has been at least over the past maybe two decades or so since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but at the same time, of course, also facing some of the big challenges that it has since the end of the Cold War as well.And I think that's something that Jens Stoltenberg, in one of his speeches also, paid tribute to as well, where he said that NATO countries needed to make sure that aid for Ukraine does not depend on donations from countries but that there is a more systematic approach to all of this. There are some who read into that, that perhaps the NATO Secretary General is trying to make sure that NATO supplies to Ukraine continue even if there is a different administration in the United States that might not hold up some of the commitments that we've seen so far from the U.S. or some of the things that the U.S. has done for Ukraine. On the whole, though, Jens Stoltenberg seemed very confident when he said he believes that right now NATO is in a very strong position, especially in light of the fact that it now has new members, like for instance, Finland and Sweden. Let's listen in to what Jens Stoltenberg had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL: In the beginning, we had 12 members. Today, we are 32.

One of the things that he specifically spoke about were those Patriot air defense systems, especially over the past couple of days. Of course, we've seen pretty sustained missile and drone attacks by the Russians. In fact, just in the overnight hours of tonight, there was a huge attack on the city of Kharkiv that killed several people, using some of those Iranian-made drones that the Russians so often use to attack Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, Erica.",

There have been eight times, by prosecutor's count, that Trump has gone to the judge and asked to push back the trial date. It is April 15, 11 days from now. And this latest request, Judge Merchan told Trump's lawyers this week that it's too late for them to be trying what they're trying now. What they asked for was a delay because of presidential immunity. They said the Supreme Court is looking at this issue in his unrelated January 6 case in federal court.And his team doesn't want the District Attorney's Office of New York to be able to use anything Trump said while he was President in this hush money trial in New York, not even tweets. The jury shouldn't be able to see any of that, they argued. And Judge Merchan said this is not a reason for delay at this point. We're going forward with jury selection in 11 days. And you can bring it up one by one if the prosecutors try and introduce evidence of something Trump said while he was serving as President. We can talk about it then during the trial. So, there is some table setting about how this will work when the jury comes into play. But, right now, Trump is not being very successful in any of these attempts to delay. We still have one request from his team on the table that Judge Merchan hasn't ruled on. That is a request to delay because of pretrial publicity. They say there is too much publicity around Donald Trump for this to be a fair trial. He is also running for President. Judge Merchan has denied that request in the past from Trump's team. He has to rule on it again before trial. The District Attorney's Office, they say this is a perverse request. That's the word they used because the cause of all of the publicity around this trial is often coming from Donald Trump himself. Erica.",

But, they are really, really blunt in what they're saying, first of all, that this is a very serious case, and 15 years is the maximum. They're asking 10 to 15. You know they're going to argue 15, but have that allowance for a 10- year sentence, because they're saying this is for homicide convictions per parent. Involuntary manslaughter is homicide, that you, James and Jennifer Crumbley, you caused the deaths of those students at the school because of what you did not recognizing the mental issues that your son had, and then going to buy him a gun about four days before that mass shooting.They are also saying that James Crumbley has no remorse at all. In fact, during the trial, they're saying that he made his middle finger very apparent toward the prosecutor in the courtroom. They include pictures of that in their sentencing memorandum. But, James Crumbley believes that he should be sentenced to time served. And there is a statement from him that prosecutors have included. Let's show part of that. He says, \"I am wrongly accused, and now wrongly convicted of Involuntary Manslaughter. My actions were that of any other parent. Ethan was a great kid. He never got into trouble at school, had decent grades, and very rarely gotten to trouble at home. And when he did get in minor trouble, it was just about grades or assignments he needed to complete. Ethan always appeared to be a very stable individual. Never did he voice anything to me that anything was bothering him.\" And what he says right there for the most part is exactly true. That was the outward appearance. Ethan even did a lot of things in his room, door closed, through the night. The parents never knew about it. Now Jennifer Crumbley, also in her statement, because there is one that they've included with Jennifer, she said that she is devastated at what happened. She said that she knew her son to be a quiet kid, a good kid, never any major problems with him at all, that she is behind bars for 23 hours a day. It's over two years now.

The city, for its part, has said it is setting aside a million dollars in wage subsidies for workers whose jobs could be on the line because of that bridge collapse which, of course, shut down the Port of Baltimore, impacting some 8,000 local jobs. The city hopes that money will help companies be able to keep their workers on the payroll.A CNN investigation, meantime, has found there are a number of other U.S. bridges that could be at risk of collapse if they are hit in a similar fashion by a large cargo ship.

Israel's Prime minister acknowledged the strike, saying that his forces unintentionally struck innocent people. But, according to CNN's analysis of aftermath videos, the attack appears to have consisted of multiple precision strikes in what was the deconflicted zone on two armored cars and one unarmored vehicle. CNN has geo located video imagery of all the destroyed vehicles, at least one of which was clearly marked with the WCK logo on its roof. And this is just the latest in a string of Israeli attacks on aid convoys. Last month, more than 100 people were killed in northern Gaza as Israeli troops opened fire near civilians gathering around food aid trucks, with some run over by feeding vehicles in the chaos. In what's become known chillingly as the flour massacre, Israel denied targeting the aid trucks, saying the Israeli Defense Forces fired at quote \"suspects nearby\". And less than a week later, witnesses said at least 20 people were killed by Israeli shelling as they waited for desperately needed food in Gaza City. Israel denied it was responsible for the deaths, blaming them instead on Palestinian militants. Even Israel's closest ally, the United States, has strongly condemned the WCK attack, but said it would not affect their efforts to deliver aid to Gaza by sea. MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: That effort is ongoing. The Pentagon is working hard on that, and I know they brief on that on a regular occasion. We want to get that stood up as soon as possible.

Now, it's really echoing what we heard from the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer just last month, saying that he believed this was in the best interests of Israel. He came under vocal attack when it came to the Republicans for suggesting that there should be a change in leadership. But, he has since doubled down, saying that even those in Israel, many, are feeling the same way.Now, there has been pushback from Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, and his Likud Party, accusing Benny Gantz of playing petty politics, saying that you simply can't have elections at a time of war, also pointing out that the elections would lead to paralysis, division and damage, also claiming that it could create damage for a potential hostage deal. What we're hearing from Benny Gantz and others is that there hasn't been a hostage deal because of leadership and that needs to change. So, it just shows the increasing domestic pressure that Benjamin Netanyahu is under in Israel, and as I say, we are seeing that reflected on the streets as well as thousands have been protesting, calling for the release of hostages taken on October 7, and many of them calling for Benjamin Netanyahu to step down.

The American Cancer Society cases, it expects, will jump some 77 percent by the year 2050.

So, first of all, Jacqueline, let's take a look at what is actually driving this expected rise here. That's a massive increase.",

So, in the year 2022, there were about eight billion people around the world. That number is projected to rise to 9.7 billion by 2050. So, as we see more people as a global population and more older ages, we can expect to see more cancer. And in this report, it did show that lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and disease in recent years, in 2022.But, when you look at data by country and by men versus women, you do see some interesting trends. Here is a map of cancer incidents among the men around the world. That green color is prostate cancer. You see how it's very prevalent in North America and South America. The blue is lung cancer, which we see more prevalent in Asia. And then, when you look at cancer incidents among women around the world, breast cancer is the most prevalent globally. On a map of cancer incidents among women, you see breast cancer there in pink. But, it's also interesting, cervical cancer is shown in orange, and you see that prevalent in parts of Africa, and lung cancer is shown in blue, which, again, you see in parts of Asia. So, these trends really help give us a global picture of where we are currently with cancer as a public health concern. And it's estimated, Erica, that one in five people will develop cancer in a lifetime. So, these numbers are very important to watch, especially as we think about what the future could look like.",

NASA is also keeping a close watch on it, launching rockets and high-altitude planes directly into its path at three different times. The space agency says the goal there is for the rockets to collect data and how the Sun's disappearance could impact or even potentially interfere with our communications.[08:50:00] The solar eclipse is not just a celestial marvel. It's also a real learning opportunity, one that, of course, does not come around all that often. CNN's Bill Weir joining us now with more of those details. So, what is it that NASA has planned here, Bill?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is really exciting, Erica. And just to give a little context about how much we can learn during these events, the most famous of all is Albert Einstein, who back in 1916 floated this theory that gravity is the result of time and space, sort of warping the fabric of the universe, and it wasn't until three years later, the 1919 eclipse, scientists saw that. They saw stars that were in a different place than they should be.Our perspective changes because of relativity. It proved the theory of relativity. And so, now, everybody is focused on other mysteries of the universe, for example, the corona of the Sun. That's not the virus or the Mexican beer. The corona is the outer ring that looks like a halo during an eclipse, which is millions of degrees hotter than the surface of the Sun. Even as the sun cycles over these 11-year periods of active and less active material, we were right now at solar maximum. The sun is going off. So, as the eclipse is happening, they're going to send those high- altitude WB-57 planes up to about 60,000 feet, and just to stay in the path of the eclipse, and measure the corona and see how much we can learn about that to figure that out. That affects ultimately the ionosphere, which is the layer of the atmosphere between deep space and livable Earth. And it's supercharged electrically, thanks to the power of the Sun. And so, the rockets, they will fire one before, one during, one after the eclipse, to try to understand how as the Sun sets and moves across the Earth as the Earth rotates in and out of the Sun's glare, how that energy changes. And that energy ultimately affects terrestrial communications, radio waves. It affects our satellite systems that give us everything from weather forecasting to GPS, and so much connects our lives financially. So, this is one of those things where generations ago, Erica, these eclipses brought fear and fascination and all kinds of myths about the Moon eating the Sun. But now, in the age of science, we can try to unlock these mysteries of the universe, hopefully for the benefit of folks down on Earth.",
