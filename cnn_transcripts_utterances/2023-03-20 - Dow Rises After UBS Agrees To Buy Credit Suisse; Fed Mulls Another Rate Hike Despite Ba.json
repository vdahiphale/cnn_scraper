We know the FDIC insures up to $250,000. It's really about what this does to the economy, because the longer the bank crisis lasts, the more expensive it's going to be to borrow, right? Mortgages, car loans, credit cards, small business loans, all of them are going to be harder to get and more expensive. And John, the concern is that the longer that lasts, the greater the risk that this ends up causing the recession that everyone's been so worried about.",

The Swiss government steps in, essentially sells UBS want to ne help you take over our Credit Suisse. Done like that, they think they've put out a fire. The question is, did they put it out the right way? The Wall Street Journal editorial board saying, \"In the biggest insult to the market, regulators will allow this deal to proceed without a vote of either bank's shareholders.\" These are publicly traded companies, but the government came in and said, bam, you're married now.

Because, yes, there are Republican voters that are standing with Trump no matter what, and they're ready to rally behind him. And we know that could be a plurality, for example, needed to win a primary. But is that enough to sustain him in a general election? Is that enough to really sustain him with a wider electorate?
