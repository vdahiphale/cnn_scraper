As you rightly pointed out, these settlements are illegal under international law, but the settlers themselves would argue that this is part of the traditional Jewish homeland or traditional, yes, traditional Jewish homeland. 2005 was also the same year that then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon cleared out 21 settlements in Gaza, along with four in the West Bank, as part of a disengagement process that was meant to sort of kickstart the peace process. It was controversial, of course, because two years later, the government that you ended up with in Gaza was Hamas, rather than the peaceful civilian administration that had been anticipated and certainly had been hoped for. At that time, after these settlements had been cleared out, there were 120 still remaining in the West Bank. Today, there are closer to 150. As you said, Yoav Gallant, the defense minister there, said that this would pave the way for settlements to return there, because these areas, even though that in -- even though last year, excuse me, the Israeli Knesset had repealed that disengagement law from 2005, they were still considered closed military areas. Now, they will be opened up to people. They will still need sign-off from the Israeli government to reestablish settlements there. But again, it's worth pointing out once again that these settlements are illegal under international law. This was met by applause from the head of the regional council of that part of northern West Bank, who said that this corrects the injustice and folly of the 2005 deportation of those settlements, he called it. The Palestinian Authority, though, accused the Israelis of stoking regional instability, saying that there can be no peace until Israel recognizes a Palestinian state. The Israeli prime minister, though, does not support the establishment of a Palestinian state. And it's worth pointing out that there is certainly some impatience growing on this. This is actually part of the reason why the Irish prime minister, or the Irish foreign minister, justified this country's decision to recognize Palestine as a state, because he argues that, look, there is no political will to do this in Israel right now.",

Many countries called on other governments to do the same. You have the Qataris, for instance, who are heavily involved, obviously, in the ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and the Israelis.They said that peace depends on an independent Palestinian state established along the 1967 borders, and said, quote, \"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs voices the state of Qatar's hope for more countries to recognize the state of Palestine and promote the efforts aiming to implement the two-state solution.\" Now, the two-state solution with 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital, is also the solution supported by Turkey, that also welcomed this move by these three European countries. It is also the plan supported by Egypt, which had a similar message. The Saudis came out with their own message, saying, quote, the kingdom calls on more countries to swiftly take the same stance, which would contribute to finding a reliable and irreversible path to achieve a just and lasting peace that fulfills the rights of the Palestinian people. [03:10:07] Now, the Saudis are, of course, conditioning Israeli normalization on the establishment of a, or not on the establishment, but on a clear, irreversible pathway toward a Palestinian state. But as I previously mentioned, the Israeli prime minister does not support this. So, it would certainly take a change in stance. It's also worth noting the timing here of Yoav Gallant's announcement, because it came the same day, obviously, that these three countries announced this plan to recognize Palestine as a state.

UNRWA reports that families are living in the rubble of damaged schools, and are lacking tents, clean water, and other vital supplies. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid coming into Gaza is extremely limited and very difficult to distribute due to the security issues there.

But if you think about the northern areas of Gaza where conflict started again, very little aid is getting through, Max, very little aid.

WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Max. Yes, and we actually have some new reporting now from our producer here in Taipei, Eric Chung, who just spoke with a senior security official who tells us up until noon, Taiwan has detected about 30 Chinese aircraft near this island, most of which crossed the median line into Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone. So, this is not unprecedented, but it is certainly provocative, and it's certainly a large number, a large amount of military activity expected to last for the next two days. The Chinese military also deployed -- this security official tells CNN, about a dozen Chinese warships around the island. No aircraft carrier deployed in the drills at least so far, but we also know near Taiwan's outlying islands, China has deployed about a dozen of its Coast Guard vessels, which have also been in recent months engaged in what Taiwan considers increasingly provocative activity. We have this sound that has just come in from Taiwan's defense minister. We'll play that now.

This is Naval Colonel Lee Hsi speaking in a statement earlier. Let me read you a portion of that.It says, I quote, these exercises are a strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces. And so, the context here is that, Max, just days ago, Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te was inaugurated and he gave a speech that a lot of analysts considered somewhat provocative, certainly less cautious, if you will, than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen when he called on China to recognize Taiwan's existence. And so, in launching these drills, which were expected by the Taiwanese government, this May is around the time that the weather starts to clear up on the Taiwan Strait, which allows for these drills to take place. That's why we didn't see any massive military activity earlier this year at the time of Taiwan's election because it just wouldn't be feasible to conduct these kinds of exercises in the Taiwan Strait. And there's actually been some pretty bad weather here in recent days, which may explain why the drills are happening now as opposed to on inauguration day itself. But these are described by China as a response to, in their words, Taiwan independence, separatist actions and external interference from places like the United States. But some might argue, Max, that China has been planning to do this all along. They've been doing these drills in large scale now several times since Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit here, kind of using the news events and the lines that come out of Taiwan as an excuse to further enhance their military readiness. Some might even view a dress rehearsal, if you will, for an eventual invasion of Taiwan, which, of course, Beijing has never ruled out if the democratically elected government here doesn't agree to be essentially absorbed by the communist rulers in Beijing.",

The split will effectively cut the price of buying shares in the company, making it more accessible for individual investors.

An update on one of the four criminal indictments against Donald Trump, the classified documents case. The trial was supposed to begin this week, but remains indefinitely postponed due to the slow pace of the Trump-appointed judge. On Wednesday, she presided over a hearing that turned into a shouting match. CNN's Evan Perez has the details. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A federal judge overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case appeared skeptical of efforts by the defense to get these charges tossed. However, Judge Eileen Cannon did express some sympathy for the idea that jurors may have trouble understanding what she says is a complicated case. I'll read you just a part of what she said from the bench today. She said, \"It's going to be hard for someone to detect what's different in these counts.\" That's one of the arguments that was being made by the defense attorneys in these two hearings in court today. One of the things that happened was the two sides got heated over an episode by one of the defense lawyers who says that, essentially, prosecutors were trying to push him by mentioning a potential judgeship, trying to push him to get his client, Walt Nauta, to cooperate with the prosecution. That's something that prompted David Harbaugh, one of the prosecutors, to respond that it was pure fantasy. Now, Judge Eileen Cannon did not rule from the bench, and we're still waiting for her to rule on when we might see a trial. This was a case that was supposed to start trial this week here in Florida. We still don't know whether that will happen. We don't know whether she will be able to get this case in before the November election. Evan Perez, CNN, Fort Pierce, Florida.",
