Donald Trump joins Elon Musk for a SpaceX rocket launch, though no catching of the booster this time around. Missile move. Ukraine striking inside Russia with America-made longer-range weaponry, according to U.S. officials. Democracy denied. Forty-five convicted activists will serve prison time in Hong Kong. And tears and tributes. It's the end of an era as tennis legend Rafa Nadal plays for the last time for a home crowd. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, you are watching the return of the SpaceX Starship on its sixth test flight. It's due to splashdown in the next few minutes. And Elon Musk hopes one day it will be used, of course, to send humans to Mars. You are looking at live pictures that we see at this moment of re-entry. Now, there's SpaceX has warned that they're using older sunshields. So, we could see these screens go black at any moment if we do see some form of breakup of the Starship on re-entry, but for now, watching those images and seeing those images is good news as we await splashdown. About an hour ago though, the Starship launched on top of a super heavy booster, making it the world's most powerful rocket. The booster is designed to be caught in the launch tower's chopstick arms. But as I mentioned, that didn't happen this time around. We'll investigate why, and we'll hope to hear more answers. Instead, it splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, also in Texas, the launch was watched by both President-Elect Trump and Elon Musk, who's playing a key role in the incoming administration. Tariq Malik is the editor-in-chief of Space.com, and he joins me now. Tariq, fantastic to have you with us. You were just tearing me in my Amateur way described, I think, what we were seeing. Just talk to the pictures that our viewers are seeing now as we await the starship to re- enter and splash down in the Indian Ocean. TARIQ MALIK, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SPACE.COM:  No, I think you hit the nail on the head. This is a very exciting mission. It's the sixth test flight. What we're seeing now is live video via SpaceX's Starlink internet service from their Starship ship vehicle itself showing, you know, what looked like, you know, nice puffy clouds and mountains and stuff over the -- you know, it's kind of Indian Ocean target zone. It's going to be offshore there. SpaceX usually has a buoy waiting to try to catch it. And this is going to be their first daytime re-entry landing attempt for this vehicle itself. So, hopefully, they're going to get some good views. So, far, we've seen the vehicle looks like perform pretty well, including a crazy banana riding on board.",

And so, they've gotten a lot of experience and really refined that process. And it's clear that they've been able to scale that up to this rocket Starship, the world's tallest, most powerful and largest rocket very built, and they have now successfully returned two of them back to Earth. They didn't catch one, the booster, as you mentioned, they said they had an out of family or a commit criteria that wasn't really correct. They want to prevent any damage to it. But you could imagine in the future SpaceX putting a landing platform out there in the ocean as like a backup to catch these.

But obviously, that -- the hope is that this will be a reusable super booster, a super heavy booster in the future. This time around. I'm sure sea water isn't good for it, and it's now lost.

That's kind of the number one thing that SpaceX is looking for because they want to launch more of these. In fact, we heard during this this launch, they want to launch up to something -- they want to build something like a 20 of these rockets a month, which just sounds crazy, you know, launching eight of them a week. So -- or a month. So, it just seems like they are going to massively scale this up. This is the rocket that NASA has picked to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in the 21st century to do that. SpaceX has to launch on the order of at least a dozen or more of these flights just to get to the moon, to refuel the rockets in space, they have to fly a lot of these. They only have two launch pads right now at this Starbase facility where we saw the launch today. They want to make sure that those are safeguarded, too, because if you lose one, then that does also limit what you can do testing wise in the future. So, there's a lot of options in play, but really, it's safety of the vehicle, safety of the communities around SpaceX, and safety of their own hardware to make sure they can keep flying again.",

Now, that was at a time when SpaceX was very nascent with this program. They didn't have a lot of hardware. They hadn't done a lot of test flights. Since then, they have done several things. First of all, they sold a couple of flights already, tourist flights, for the vehicle. People that are -- have to put down some down payments to help fund this program development. They've also got the NASA contract too, to land astronauts on the moon. So, you know, I would expect, you know, an average SpaceX Falcon 9 launch is on the average of $55 to $60 million. This is likely in order of magnitude beyond that over time. But they have built these at scale and they have figured out a way to mass produce these rockets. I've been to that Starbase facility. There are towering buildings. There are many of these boosters and spaceships just sitting there waiting for the return, and it would not surprise me if SpaceX came back after this flight with a very quick turnaround for their flight, seven test flight.",

I mean, one can call it a bluff, but it leaves not only their president- elect in a difficult situation, but also Putin himself.

So, these are the kinds of things that the Biden administration is basically doing, they're potentially forcing the hand of the Trump administration, the incoming Trump administration, to make decisions that are more favorable to Ukraine, thus preserving the strategic balance that the Biden administration has achieved so far. And it also helps protect the eastern flank of NATO. So, from a strategic standpoint, this is a good thing, even though politically the Trump administration probably will not see it that way.

Outside the courtroom on Tuesday, a single woman tried to hold up a protest sign and she was quickly carried away by police to a police van.

The tariffs have been in place since the Trump first administration, so it's eight years. And if you really look under the hood, the trade balances haven't changed all that much. China's state services continue to increase. And so, unless, you know, you wind up 60 percent across the board nuclear, I think the region will find a way to navigate through that. In fact, for the rest of Southeast Asia, tariffs on China have been helpful in the last four or five years, the supply chains have shifted into Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia et cetera, et cetera. So, that's, you know, uncertain, but could be somewhat beneficial to the region. The other question is the extent of the stimulus in China and, you know, without a shadow of doubt, it's not enough to turn the economy around in the short-term. But I'm contrary and I'm in the camp that I think they should be measured about the steps they take. In 2010, when they, you know, shot a bazooka and threw the everything at it, the downside effect of that lasted several years. So, I do think they're somewhat sensible in being measured to the steps that they take.",

And so, some of the appointments that I have taken will give me hopefully a chance to get into all that. But equally, within the bank, I think we've come a long way. Sushant's been with me for 15 plus years. She's done everything, every part of the bank. The bank has got a culture and a way of working, which I think is fairly stable. So, I think this is a good time to pass the baton on to the next generation. And I'm fairly confident that the team we have in place will take us to even better heights. We talked about our digital transformation. That's obviously been well acknowledged. In recent years, our forays into artificial intelligence have been extremely, extremely beneficial to the bank. And we've got a number of things, focused in the fire in areas like tokenization and digitalization of asset. So, I do think that we have enough tailwind.

Literally the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane in the Pacific Ocean here west of Seattle. Good news is it's not going to make landfall. But I wouldn't want to be a mariner on a cargo ship that just left Seattle on the way to Shanghai. That would not be any fun because the waves are 60 feet, almost. 20 meters. Bombogenesis. No, it's not some social media thing. It's been around since the '80s. And in fact, there's even talk that it's been around since like World War II, talking about how the big storms kind of generated there across parts of the northern coast of Normandy and how the forecasters were watching those during World War II. Rapidly intensifying storms, 24 millibars in 24 hours. This has gone way beyond that, like 50 millibars in 24 hours. And it's attached to an atmospheric river, a Category 4 out of 5 atmospheric river, which means all of the moisture from the subtropical pacific is coming on shore in California and also into Oregon, Washington, and even some rain up into British Columbia as well. But there will be places that will pick up 20 inches of rainfall, half a meter of rain along the coast of California. Now, the good news is it hasn't been wet. It's been, in fact, very dry. So, maybe some of this will actually soak in and not run off like sometimes you can see what happens with 20 inches of rain. We still have a high risk on Thursday of that flood, and that flash flood watch now already in effect for Northern California. Not only that, but it's going to snow, likely two meters, six feet or so, and blizzard warnings where it is going to blow. The good news is, at least for now, this storm system is going to make wind and it's going to make rain, it's going to make snow, but it's not going to come on shore as a Category 3 hurricane. It's going to stay offshore and literally die. So, yes, we get all the things, we get all the wind and all the rain, but landfall. See how they're just spinning around each other. It's called Fujiwara effect. But anyway, I digress. That is the area that's still going to see wind, but not the intense wind, not the intense tree destruction if that storm just came right on shore and barreled right on land, because that's just going to spin out there and eventually kind of go downhill, kind of lose some power by the weekend.

Even though, I mean, he knew it was coming to an end this week and he said he had no regrets about it. He's 38 years of age. He hasn't played competitively for some three months. He knows that his body just cannot do it anymore. We knew that he was going to retire this week, but we just didn't know upon which night because if Spain had kept going in the Davis Cup, if they'd beaten the Netherlands and gone through to the semifinals, then we wouldn't have been doing all of this tonight. But in the end, it was just too much for Nadal and for his team. He played in the first match today and he lost that in straight sets. His teammate, Carlos Alcaraz, then did his best to keep the thing going. Alcaraz won his singles match. It meant it went to a doubles match. And of course, by this point, Nadal is just a helpless spectator on the sidelines, hoping that the young men that he inspired to play the game could keep his country and his team in it and prolong his career Just for a couple more days, but in the end, that wasn't possible. Spain lost the decisive doubles match. So, they are out. And we've just been watching a really emotional powerful retirement ceremony. Of course, Nadal has been reflecting on his career. He's been shown a video of all his incredible career highlights. Some of the all-time greats, of which he is one, have been speaking to him on that video. We've heard from Roger Federer, Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, football stars Andre Iniesta and David Beckham as well. And he's been watching back on everything that he's achieved, of course. The remarkable and a record never to be beaten, I'm sure, 14 French Open titles. He won Wimbledon twice, the Australian Open twice, the U.S. Open four times. He won a couple of gold medals at the Olympics. He was at the top of his game pretty much for 20 years. It is absolutely remarkable. And he was very, very much a member of the big three, the three players who dominated men's tennis for the best part of two decades. Now, two of them have retired. Of course, Federer retired a couple of years ago. He retired with Nadal by his side. They played together in the Levis Cup. They cried together on the side of the court. Federer retired, now no doubt retired. Only Djokovic is left standing. It is the end of an era, but all good things have to come to an end. But it is very sad and emotional for so many people.",
