The qualifications and certifications from the Mariners who operate these ships, those are actually networked with a global set of regulations that we negotiate and uphold through the International Maritime Organization in London. So this ship was flagged by Singapore. That was the Flag State Administration. I spoke with the administration in Singapore just a few hours ago. They'll be participating in the investigation.

Again, it's difficult to overstate the impact of this collision. We're talking about -- this is not just as big as a building. It's really as big as a block, 100,000 tons all going into this pier all at once.

I think sometimes even not just as a matter of practice but as a matter of culture different shippers and other entities that have been rivals, just don't coordinate. We built a program called FLOW, which invites different participants, cargo owners, shippers, ports, terminal operators, and others to begin sharing data. That's something that's served us well going to the Red Sea issues. It's certainly serving us well right now.
