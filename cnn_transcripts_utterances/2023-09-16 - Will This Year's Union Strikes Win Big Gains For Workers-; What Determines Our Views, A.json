First, negotiations are expected to resume today in the strike by the 145,000 member United Auto Workers against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Only 13,000 of stop work so far, they staged select walkouts and plants in Missouri, Michigan, and Ohio with threats of more to follow.It's the first time in UAW history that it has struck all three of America's unionized automakers at once. As CNN reports, the company has offered to raise hourly wages as much as 20 percent over the four- year contracts, which would have taken the senior most workers to a base pay of more than $80,000 a year not including overtime or profit- sharing bonuses. But the union is demanding 40 percent during the life of the contract and seeks to reverse concessions that it made back when GM and Chrysler faced bankruptcy and needed federal bailouts in order to survive. The highest paid of the big three CEOs GM Mary Barra made 29 million last year, that's 362 times the median worker's paycheck. The other two had similarly proportion compensation. By comparison, in 1965, CEOs typically earn just 20 times the typical workers pay in their industries according to the Economic Policy Institute. President Biden has voiced his support for the union.

Both unions contend that their pay has gone down dramatically while corporate profits and CEO compensation have boomed. The strikes have brought production of film and T.V. in America to a near standstill. But a poll last month showed that 67 percent of Americans supported the strikes. This week, T.V. host Drew Barrymore and Bill Maher announced they're going to start making shows without writers.In other fields, more than 60,000 healthcare workers in California, Oregon and Washington just voted to authorize strikes against Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest nonprofit health plans in America if no agreement is reached by the end of the month. The workers say that pay has not kept pace with inflation, and that understaffing has led to long wait times and neglect of patients. Last month, the 24,000 American Airlines flight attendants voted almost unanimously to authorize a strike if their contract demands are not met. And in August, 340,000 UPS drivers who had threatened to walk out scored a big contract game. Labor unions are enjoying a resurgence in popularity with the public. Gallup recently found that 68 percent of Americans approve of labor unions. That's the highest number since 1965. But with income inequality growing, there's a question as to their effectiveness. And while all this activity has increased awareness of union activity, the number of unionized workers in America has been on the decline for decades. Joining me now to talk about this is Scott Galloway, Professor G, the host of a great podcast, and someone who has strong opinions about this subject. Scott, so you heard me sketch out the fine points of this, union membership is in decline at a time when their population their popularity is growing. How do you see it? Are they the most effective means of dealing with these crises?",

But when you just let the market take over, which the entrenched incumbents and corporations will urge, you end up with households where one in five households with children are in poverty, you end up with people living in their cars, you end up with child labor. So the marketplace is a key force here. But it's not enough. There are two former UAW presidents in prison because of corruption.There are 1000s of unions that don't coordinate, they're not effective. There should be one union in the United States, and it should be the federal government. And we should take minimum wage, and I'll propose this from $7.25 to where it would be if it had just been scaling or tracking productivity, somewhere around $23 or $25. Michael, can you think of any one move that federal government could make that would reduce childhood poverty, obesity, blood pressure, suicide, male abandonment, diabetes, poverty, homelessness, than raising the minimum wage? And the incumbents will argue that this would damage the economy. And what we've seen in studies out of Berkeley and UC Riverside is that when you raise the minimum wage, as they did in California, New York and Washington, you not only don't lose jobs, you gain employment and the economy grows, because the wonderful thing about lower middle income households is that when you give them additional money, they spend it. So since 2009, the NASDAQ is up six fold CEO pay is up threefold, and minimum wage is stuck at $7.25 an hour. There should be one union, the head of that union is Biden, $20 To $25 federally mandated minimum wage.",

And I think that the additional income -- the thing that is creating a soft landing in our economy is the additional or the remnant stimulant payments being spent by lower middle income households. These are the engines of the economy. And it comes down to this, what kind of nation do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a nation where the child income tax credit gets stripped out of the infrastructure bill where the average 70 year old is 72 percent wealthier than he or she was 40 years ago, and the person under the age of 40 is 24 percent less wealthy? Minimum wage impacts lower and middle class households and younger people who have all been on the wrong side of the economy. Of the 100 -- with every $100 increase in wealth over the last 10 years, 50 cents of that $100 has gone to the bottom half of Americans. There's always a tension between capital and labor, but over the last 40 years capital has beating the crap out of labor and it has resulted in deaths of despair skyrocketing. There is -- this is the most -- the wealthiest nation in the world should be paying people a living wage. The intentions here are correct. The construct is ineffective unions.

He's advised over 50 U.S. senators and governors. And in his most recent missive, he addressed what he called the approach of the political tipping point.He wrote these words, \"The country is in the final chapter of the political dominance of the greatest generation and the baby boomers. By the end of the decade their influence will give way to millennials, Gen Z voters and subsequent generations who will make up the majority of voters. What is clear is that the generational changing of the guard and continued political reform will act as circuit breakers on the tribal politics that have dominated the last several election cycles.\" When I asked Sosnik on my Sirius XM radio program, when the climate of polarization will improve, he had a provocative reply.

Della Volpe is the author of the book \"Fight, How Gen Z is channeling their fear and passion to save America.\" And this past June, he wrote a Substack post about the findings of a recent poll under the headline, Ring the Alarm.Della Volpe analyzed 18 to 29 year olds, a cohort that would be mostly Gen Z. Among his findings, this group is principally driven by their values, rather than transactional politics, and they are out voting the generations that preceded them at a similar age, and it is even close, he found that the group as a group is becoming increasingly progressive, and that they've got an antipathy for the modern MAGA Republican Party. Quote, \"In 2020, President Biden flipped five battleground states in large part due to the combination of record level turnout and youth support. Voters aged 45 and older they chose Trump in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, President Biden won the under-30 cohort by roughly a 20 point margin, and millennial voters in their 30s by high single digits.\" He was also clear that this is no guarantee for Democrats that the same pattern will repeat in 2024, writing, \"Nearly every sign that made me confident in historic levels of youth participation in 2018, 2020 and 2022 now flashing red. Twenty plus years of directing the Harvard youth poll taught me that the ground is more fertile for voting when you believe voting makes a tangible difference.\" And he cites data that shows the following, young African Americans are turning away from the Democrats. The GOP is succeeding in wooing young Hispanics. And young white Americans are least likely to be Democrats, and most likely to vote. Both parties will have to reconfigure as the torch gets passed to that next generation. Joining me now is Jean Twenge, professor of Psychology at San Diego State University. You'll remember she's the author of both \"iGen\" and the new \"Generations.\" The real differences between Gen Z, millennials, Gen X, Boomers and Silence and What They Mean for America's Future.\" Dr. Twenge, nice to see you again. Question, what determines our views? Is it age or the generation to which we belong? JEAN TWENGE, AUTHOR, \"GENERATIONS\" &amp; \"IGEN\": Well, it's both. People do tend to become more conservative as they get older. But there is also a generational influence. There some interesting research to suggest that a generation tends to lean in the direction of a, whatever popular president there was when they were adolescents or young adults. So, for millennials, that's going to be Obama. So millennials tend to lean a little democratic. But there's another generation that was almost completely left out in that discussion that you mentioned, and that's Gen X. So Gen X tends to lean Republican because they came of age in the Reagan era.",

Paul Landis, a Secret Service agent assigned to Jacqueline Kennedy, who was just a feet away from the president that day, has broken his silence. In an excerpt from his upcoming book \"The Final Witness\" to be publish next month, Landis, who is now 88, shares a new account of that day that some say upends the long-held single bullet theory.In its final report, the Warren Commission decided that a single bullet fired that day, recovered nearly intact, had struck the president from behind, exited from the front of his throat and went on to hit Texas then Governor John Connally in multiple places. Skeptics who thought it unlikely that a single bullet could do all of that and still be in such good condition called it the magic bullet theory. Part of the reason investigators came to that conclusion was a bullet found on a stretcher believed to have been held or holding John Connally at the Parkland Memorial Hospital. It was assumed that it had exited Connally's body during efforts to save his life. Landis now disputes that. He says that after the motorcade arrived at the hospital, he had found that bullet lodged in the back of the seat behind where Jacqueline Kennedy was sitting in the presidential limousine. He says in an impetuous moment, he grabbed it to thwart the press and souvenir hunters. In the chaos after he entered the hospital, he says that he ended up putting it on the president's stretcher next to his feet. He told this to Jake Tapper.

And, you know, trivia buff that I tend to be, he is interviewed by Warren Commission staff attorney Arlen Specter, who goes on, of course, to an illustrious Senate career.

GERALD POSNER, AUTHOR, \"CASE CLOSED: LEE HARVEY OSWALD AND THE ASSASSINATION OF JFK\": You know, it doesn't. You know, I have been looking at this. I gave Paul Landis the benefit of the doubt. Originally, I said his account has to be taken, Michael, seriously. And it does. He was there. But the more you look at it in his statements, in his interviews, like the one with Jake Tapper, you realize that he put that bullet on a stretcher and then 90 minutes after the assassination, you have this chief engineer walking down the hallway in Parkland bumping into one of two stretchers. One belonged to Governor Connally and one belonged to a young boy who had been rushed into the hospital for emergency treatment around the same time. That bullet is the single bullet and it is the one -- if Landis did pick up one that day that he picked up. So, I think the key here is that Landis picked up a bullet, put it on a stretcher.

Why would you lay a bullet down on the table next to the president? As a Secret Service officer, you should at least have the decency to report it to the proper authorities. Gerald Posner, you say what to that X response?",

Imagine if there was an assassination of a president today, Obama, Trump, Biden, and we found out that a Secret Service agent found a whole bullet where the president's body was and then took the bullet, put it in their pocket and later put it down on a gurney and didn't tell any of their superiors or anyone else investigating the case. The shame of this story, Michael, is that Paul Landis didn't come out with this story decades ago when it could have been investigated, when everyone was alive.We could have found out the final truth. Now, we'll be left with a bit of mystery forever because he's telling it so late.",
