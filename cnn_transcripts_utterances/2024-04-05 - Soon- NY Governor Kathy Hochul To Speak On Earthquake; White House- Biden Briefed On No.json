So, it can happen in this common -- haven't really heard any reports of that. But that can happen.As far as economic losses, we know we haven't heard too much about damages, you know, any physical structural damage. Because, again, with this being you know, a 4.8, you don't really see too much catastrophic damage with that. And it is showing with some of the data that we have from the USGS that it is, you know, kind of lower on that impact scale. I think we're finding a lot of that impact is a lot of New Yorkers just physically -- emotionally rattled, you know, just because it is so rare and so not common in this area. A lot of people walk in about on their Friday trying to wonder what that was. I know, we heard from guests, you know, that people thought maybe it was a truck that ran by or, you know, what was that? Everybody's just asking each other what was that because so many people felt the shaking. So, what we can -- what we know so far that it was very light but shallow. So that's why we could feel the shaking in places like New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., some of our biggest cities in the country. Seismic waves can travel farther on the East Coast than on the West Coast. On the West Coast, we have a little bit more of that fault line structure. And that's where the earthquakes are more common. You have more of the fault lines in the volcanoes that seismic activity, you know, where -- from Alaska, down towards California, you're sitting on the ring of fire. That's where these things are much, much more common, you know. And we've been doing coverage earlier this week, about the seven-point magnitude earthquake in Taiwan, which was catastrophic, you know. Destructive, you know. You had more of that damage, you had more of the injuries, and that's an area that's much more prone to this as it sits on the ring of fire there in Southeast Asia. But this is just not -- it's not that, right? We just don't get these types of earthquakes you know, in this part of the Northeast, you know, from New York to New Jersey. It's just -- it's just not common -- it's not common at all. And I think that's just why, you know, our e-mails have been -- and phones have just been you know, what all of the family and friends that are just saying, you know, what was that? What was that shaking? That -- and so many millions of people were able to feel this on that front -- on the -- on today on this Friday, Wolf.",

And everybody was told to evacuate the building. There was concerns there could be damage, even in these big buildings.What is the recommendation generally now, in the aftermath of a 4.8 earthquake? Should people be evacuating tall buildings? Because we saw it in Taiwan, those images of those buildings that have simply collapsed and tilted over. What's the recommendation as far as what we're seeing right now?",

But absolutely, you don't want to be at the tops of some of those buildings if they might be shaking, you know.A lot of that saying is, you know, you want to get under something, right? Get as low to the ground and cover yourself in case anything is falling right off of shelves. You know, light fixtures, plates, things like that. So, you know -- you know, stop, drop, and roll. Getting your -- getting underneath, you know, covering from anything that might be falling. So, for sure, you'll definitely not want to be up towards the tops of those skyscrapers. We haven't heard anything about damage or you know -- you know, we're waiting some updates from officials about things like that. You know, we haven't heard anything, really, from the weather team about anything like that. I think we're really mostly just hearing people just confused, really, and just so surprised and just emotionally shaken by this as well as figuratively just because it doesn't happen as often.",

The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre posted on social media moments ago, \"The president has been briefed on the earthquake which had an epicenter in New Jersey, and he is in touch with his team who are monitoring potential impacts.\" She added the White House is in touch with federal, state, and local officials as we learn more.Now, the president was here at the White House when this earthquake occurred. He is set to leave the White House in the next hour to travel up to Baltimore, Maryland. Well, he will see firsthand the wreckage of that devastating bridge collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The president will be meeting with local officials. They're surveying the damage as they talk about the next steps in the recovery process there. Now, the president is also scheduled to meet with families, the members of the people whose six loved ones died in that bridge collapsed just last week. So, there will be a few opportunities to hear from the president today when he leaves the White House in about less than an hour. And then also as he has in Baltimore a bit later today, where he's expected to deliver remarks. But we'll see what else the White House has to offer about what they're learning of this earthquake and whether the president is in touch, perhaps with the governors of New Jersey and New York at some point today as well.",

And that immediately, all of the infrastructure agencies activated their policies and procedures to deal with this. Because while highly unusual in the state of New York, we do actually have fault lines.This was significantly bigger than ones that are typically felt in the state of New York or occur and actually are not felt. That is because earthquakes happen on a logarithmic scale, which means that a 3.0 is 10 times worse than a 2.0. So, a 4.0 is 10 times easier than a 5.0. So, every one of those makes a significant difference in what you will experience and what the damage could be. In addition, we are also tracking whether or not there's any increase in hospitalizations as well as whether or not there's any increase in vehicle accidents that have not been reported at this time.

      "sentences": "Yes, they are pretty significant, Wolf, right now. And the ground stop at Newark Liberty International Airport has been extended until half past the hour, 12So, the FAA tells us this is an evolving issue. They're staying on top of it. They need to inspect the runways at some of these airports in order to get things fully back to normal. There was a call -- a conference call at the FAA earlier in response to this. Remember the best place to possibly be during an earthquake it's possibly in an airplane. But the issue is really the infrastructure. And so, they need to really inspect things on the ground. Those inspections also occurring by Amtrak right now. Amtrak says it's doing track inspections, and it is slowing the speed of trains throughout the Northeast. That could mean delays up and down the Northeast Corridor. Customers are encouraged to rebook on their app. There's an 800 number that they have published. Remember, New York, a city on the move. Never sleeps. About a million to a million and a half people commute in and out every day. New Jersey Transit, things are delayed there by about 20 minutes on pretty much every line on the New Jersey Transit System. The Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel, the Port Authority of New York In New Jersey says both of those have been inspected and they are OK. There is no delays in the Holland and Lincoln Tunnel right now. Although, remember, especially this is important to put in context for the Californians watching who may chortle at this, New York is not a city that is really built for a lot of seismic activity. It's heavily tunneled. The -- a lot of those tunnels are very old. One of the main tunnels that goes under the Hudson River from New York to New Jersey, one of the main train tunnels is maybe 115 years old or more. So, some of this infrastructure is aging. And in a lot of cases, those inspecting this infrastructure need to go out and see it on their own visually with the mark one eyeball to make sure that things are OK. And so, we're just really at the genesis of the story, Wolf, and it may take some time to figure out the full totality of the damage here.",

Tell us what happened.RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR UNITED NATIONS CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Yes. People, Wolf, often say the U.N. doesn't feel anything during these global crises like the Mideast. But the meeting was ongoing. And then the speaker, a U.N. official, paused. The camera went to a wide shot where you couldn't see anyone's face up close. So, there's a little confusion. And then you hear the Palestinian ambassador sitting next to the woman who was speaking to the council say you cause -- you made the ground shake, is what the Palestinian said. And then there were some back and forth where the speaker said, Madam President, should I go on, and the meeting did continue. You can detect some shaking from a U.N. camera, nothing dramatic, like you see in the earthquake video in stores and flying glass. And the meeting continued. We have not heard yet from anyone who was attending the session. But the U.N. survived and back to the real world, so to speak.",
