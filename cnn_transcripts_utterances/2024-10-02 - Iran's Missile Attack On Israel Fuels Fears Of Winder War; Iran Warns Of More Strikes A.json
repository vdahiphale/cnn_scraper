      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, more fear of a widening war. Tension across the globe is palpable as the world waits for a response to Iran's largest missile attack ever against Israel. The Biden administration says America's support for Israel remains ironclad. I'll talk to the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about that and this neck and neck election. She played a key role in reshaping.Plus, Midwest nights. Tim Walz and J.D. Vance keep it civil on the debate stage as Donald Trump rages on Truth Social. How much will their exchanges on January 6, abortion and the economy matter to voters in this deadlocked race, and communities quote, wiped off the map. President Biden is heading to the Carolinas today to survey areas gutted by Hurricane Helene. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start in the Middle East, Israel is promising payback after yesterday, at this hour, we all watched Iran fire nearly 200 ballistic missiles into Israel. The crucial question today is, how will Israel respond? But nearly one year since Hamas is barbaric, October 7 massacre of civilians inside Israel, hostages still captive. And a war that's killed thousands of Palestinians living under Hamas rule, it seems that the wider regional war that so many feared could be upon us. CNN's Nic Robertson is live in Tel Aviv. So, Nic, if we needed any more evidence of that, we are seeing still fighting on Israel's western front and Gaza southwest. We see it in the northern up front in Lebanon, Hamas and Hezbollah. And of course, the big question is whether the country that has these two groups as its proxies is going to be even more aggressive and what Israel is going to do in retaliation?",

      "sentences": "Nic, thank you so much for that important report. Appreciate it. At the White House, a senior U.S. official says that they don't believe Israel has decided what a retaliatory strike will look like. President Biden said yesterday that quote, it is an active discussion.I'm joined now by the former speaker of the House, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi of California. Thank you so much for being here. You just heard Nic Robertson lay out the options being discussed inside Israel about how to retaliate. Yesterday, you said that the U.S. is unwavering in our commitment to the protection and defense of the Israeli people. Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was on with Wolf Blitzer here on CNN. He said, now is the moment to destroy Iran's nuclear program. If Israel does that, should the U.S. support the move? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D) FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Well as you know -- good morning. Good morning in California. As you said before Nic was on, we want to avoid a bigger war. As you know full well that masterfully, President Obama had a plan to reduce the capacity of the Iranians to produce a nuclear weapon. The next president in line, he came in and eliminated that unfortunately, because now Iran is on a path again for enriching uranium more fully, taking it closer to having the capacity for weapon. I don't know how close they are to that, and if I did, I wouldn't say. So again, we want to avoid a bigger war. We do know that Hezbollah and Hamas are proxies for Iran. They are the troublemakers in the region. The fact that Israel was attacked, 200 ballistic missiles coming into Israel, thank God, without any major effect, shows that they must be stopped. But I don't think we should get in an open discussion now as to how we deal with their nuclear. We had a plan to do that. I think that there are other countries as we had before, who had worked together to do that again. But the reason that they're in the strong position they are today, nuclear wise, is because of the failed policy of Donald Trump.",

VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women, who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And you know, I -- one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight, and I love you. And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.

Vance as a weird guy, castigating childless, cat lady, saying women without children should have no real place in the public square. And so there he was, name dropping his mother, name dropping a friend of his who supposedly got an abortion, constantly calling Margaret by her first name. So that you can see what he was up to there. There was sort of a rehabilitation effort that Vance was advancing for himself. What he didn't do as much and what I expected him to do was go after Kamala Harris in kind of pithy ways, pithy and memorable ways. There wasn't a lot of that really at all. And so, I mean, part of me was wondering, like, this seemed to be more about Vance, more about his future, more about maybe a 2028 run than necessarily what was going on here. You could -- I don't know what Walz's a strategy was going in. It felt like he was going through the whole time, feeling like there were landmines all around him that he needed to avoid, whether it was -- you know, he can -- he can be a short tempered at times, he seemed to be avoiding that. He didn't want to come across as too progressive, the guy from Minnesota. So, he, I thought, was authentic. That was -- I think, the Tim Walz that a lot of people who've covered him for years recognized. It wasn't the Tim Walz that people, I think, recognize from cable news, the sort of pithy guy.",
