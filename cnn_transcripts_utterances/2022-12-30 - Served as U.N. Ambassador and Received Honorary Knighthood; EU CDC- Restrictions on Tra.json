Welcome back to \"Connect the World\"! Pele changed everything, those words from current Brazil Football Star Neymar, honoring the football legend who died Thursday of complications from colon cancer. Brazil is observing a three day period of national mourning for Pele while tributes pour in from across the globe. A public wake will be held on Monday at the stadium in Santos where Pele burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager capturing the imagination of a country and later the world. Pele's funeral will take place on Tuesday in Santos. World Sports Don Riddell kicks off this hour with a closer look at Pele's remarkable life and legacy. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): When the world knows you by just one name, you have truly succeeded. Pele is regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time his humble demeanor and generous spirit have guaranteed his legacy as a global icon.",

RIDDELL (voice over): Rose in the slums of Sao Paulo in the 1940s. Edson Arantes do Nascimento discovered football at a young age. He made his debut for Santos at the age of just 16 and within a year he was scoring goals for the Brazilian national team. By this time, he was better known by his nickname, Pele. And in 1958 at 17 He became the youngest man to play in a World Cup final, scoring twice as Brazil beat Sweden. It was the first of three world titles he'd helped win for his country. He electrified audiences with his fancy footwork and ability to score seemingly impossible goals. So it was something of a disappointment that his 1000th goal was a penalty.",

It comes as Beijing uses its own strict COVID policies. South Korea says it will stop issuing most short term visas from its consulates in China for the time being at least. Flights coming from China will be partially reduced and passengers must present a negative test before entering.

You have the requirement for travelers from China to have a negative test result before boarding; they have to have another test within 24 hours of arriving here. And if they're on a short term visa, and they test positive, they have to be quarantined in a government facility. If they're a resident, they can quarantine at home. All of the flights from China that would land anywhere in South Korea are now all going to be redirected to the one main airport - just outside Seoul so that they can monitor the situation. They are lessening the number of flights that will be coming from Seoul as well. And as you've mentioned, up until the end of January, they will be restricting the amount of short term visas that they will be issuing at consulates. There are a couple of exemptions for business for diplomats, for example, for humanitarian reasons. But South Korea has gone a step further than many countries. They're not just testing people coming in or where they will be in the next few days. They're trying to prevent some travelers from China even being able to get to the border, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Becky, the experts I'm talking to they are concerned, they're not hysterical. They're not sayingfor sure something terrible is about to happen. But they are concerned. And here's the reason why. When you have a group of people who were basically, you know, in many ways, isolated for several years, not exposed in the same way that the rest of the world was exposed to COVID vaccinated with a vaccine of questionable efficacy. And then all of a sudden, they're allowed to be out and about, the problem is that kind of gives the virus a field day, the virus then multiply in many, many, many people. And that gives it opportunities to change into a different variant. Now, different variants aren't necessarily bad, they might be different variants that aren't all that harmful, but you just never know with a little twist of some DNA, when or if it's going to become a bad variant that will then spread around the world. So the way that scientists deal with this is they try to keep really careful surveillance of the variants that are out there. So there is a website that where countries post, hey, here's what we're seeing. They swipe people's noses, they do genetic sequencing, and they say here's what we're seeing. And the more noses you swipe, and the more samples you post, the better. So let's take a look at how countries are doing with this. And you'll see why there's concern. So in the past six months, the U.S. has posted more than 576,000 sequences to this online portal, basically called GIZI. UK in the past six months has posted more than 123,000 China bigger than either of those countries has posted 412. So there is concern that there's a lot of we just don't know what's going on there. And that's really a problem. Now let's take a look at the rules in the United States. We just heard about rules in other countries. Starting January 5, all passengers, including U.S. citizens will have to get a test PCR or antigen no more than two days before departure. And then at seven U.S. airports on select flights, including hundreds of flights a week from China, passengers can volunteer to say swipe my nose see if I have COVID and if I do see what genomic sequence I have? And if enough people do that, hopefully that might help. But let's be clear requiring this testing, it doesn't mean that is going to keep out bad variants. It may do some good, but it is by no means a surefire way of keeping out dangerous variants, Becky.",

As far as China goes, they're struggling with the aftermath of the lifting of that very harsh, zero COVID policy and now experiencing a wave of infections, the likes of which I don't think that country has seen so far. So these are not men who, a year ago, the same men that a year ago, declared a partnership without limits. It's proved to have its limits. China, for instance, even though rhetorically it has supported the Russian war in Ukraine, in practical terms, it has not provided Russia with any weaponry, the way it doesn't want to risk western sanctions, rather the Russians have had to turn to Iran and North Korea for badly needed ammunition and equipment.

And I think obviously, since his sad passing yesterday, we lose a great slice of that history.",

People join the master of ceremonies on stage to throw out confetti and a few trial runs more than a million are expected to attend the celebrations in person overnight on Saturday and millions more will follow along on TV. Well, CNN's Gloria Pazmino joins us from Times Square. To give us a sense of how preparations are going on, we're a good what hour - we're a good 36 hours out give or take at this point, less than that 30, I'm getting my math wrong.

And also, you know, for the past two years, the event has had to be significantly scaled down because of COVID. This will be the first year where there is going to be no restrictions or requirements for the crowd.

We had a lot ofcompanies that all of a sudden found religion in E-commerce. They were going to sell things online, everyone wanted to be the next Amazon, no one wound up being the next Amazon, all of those companies, including Amazon were overvalued. Now, obviously, it's not a perfect comparison, because Amazon is still around, they weren't a fraud. They didn't go out of business. But there was too much hype and too much enthusiasm about something that yes; it would eventually become a much bigger thing. And I kind of feel the same way about block chain technology; we are eventually going to be doing far more transactions than we even do now. And even consumers, probably through the Blockchain, we're just not there yet. And companies like Binance and FTX and Coinbase probably didn't deserve their valuations in either the private markets or public markets. I mean, look at Coinbase their shares have plunged like 85 percent this year.",

And then why invest in boring stocks that may only go up 10 to 15 percent a year when you can buy crypto, that's what was turned out to be the folly here. And I think that yes, people talk about how you know; you should have gold in your portfolio too. But again, most sane people say two to 3 percent, maybe five, not 25 or 50 percent. And I feel the same way about crypto. If you want to have 2 percent of your portfolio in Bitcoin be my guess but don't put 70 percent of it in Bitcoin that's insane.

You know, growing up, I took so many photos, so many videos because in that moment, I cannot really see clearly. So then I go back and I look at the videos and photos I'm like, oh, OK, that other person was there. OK, we were in this location. Because I thought I felt like the cameras really made for me because in the olden days, like all the cameras had like one lens to see from. And I felt like OK, that's perfect for me because I have one eye so like, this is meant, this was meant for me, you know, I love bringing new stories. And I love putting things together like a puzzle, so one of the challenges in my life is not being able to drive. Of course, I can never get my license. You know, I'm legally blind on in documents. So one of the challenges is, of course, always trying to find a way to get somewhere like I work obviously. So I have to, you know, find a way to get to work, whether it's family, whether it's a taxi, whether it's an Uber, whether you know its public transport, it's just always a challenge. I'm so happy and thankful that my cancer is asleep right now. It's still in my body, but it is asleep. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
