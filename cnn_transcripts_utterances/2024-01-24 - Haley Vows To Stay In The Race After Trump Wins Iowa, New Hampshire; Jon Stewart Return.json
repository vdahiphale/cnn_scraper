They believe and they repeat his lies, and they believe and they like the coarseness in the fight. But a decent part of the Trump base are hardworking Americans who are so disaffected with politics, they don't trust Washington to do anything. You know, one of the fishermen I've been spending a lot of time with up in New Hampshire. G. KING: A lot of fishermen? J. KING: A lot of fishermen, commercial fishermen. Trump opposes the wind farms they want to put off the shore. He thinks that's going to put his job -- take his job off the map. I don't know if that's true, but that's what he believes. It's a blue collar guy who works really hard, just barely paying his mortgage. You know, thinking about starting a family, he thinks Trump's the only guy who's going to save his job. He hates all that other stuff. But he looks around and no one else is talking about it. Nobody else mentions his business. So, he votes for Trump. People have just made this transactional decision that, I don't like a lot of this, but I'm busy anyway. I won't pay attention to that stuff, I'll use a polite word, and this guy will help me. Now, you know, part of the problem here is the creation of Trump is part of his critics within the Republican Party and the Democrats are not given these people who are disillusioned, disaffected, disgusted, and worse with politics, they're not giving them an alternative. G. KING: Yes. On the other side, they're not -- I was going to say on the other side, they're not actually jumping up and down for President Biden either. J. KING: President Biden has a giant problem right now. You are saying you don't think black people are going to rush to vote for Trump if you pick somebody like Tim Scott. I tend to agree with you based on history. However, it doesn't have to be a rush. It doesn't have to be a parade. It only has to be a tiny percentage in Milwaukee and in Detroit and outside Atlanta, and Trump who won the presidency. I was in Michigan a few weeks ago, this Israel-Hamas War, young people viscerally angry at the president. Outside of Detroit, in Michigan, Dearborn's part of it, but in Michigan, you got 3,400 thousand Arab- American voters who traditionally vote Democrat, big for Biden. They are furious. So, wherever you look, the president has cracks, or worse, in his base. Now, we're having a conversation in January. He's got until November. But he's got -- you know, you list your problems. You try to list -- he's got a lot of eggs. G. KING: But, Charles, if things have gone differently, we could be sitting here talking about you.",

Which one of those three issues do you think is going to come -- be the most important part coming down the stretch?J. KING: There is some evidence that inflation is getting a little bit better. His problem is that working class people were so punished, so punished in 2022 and 2023, you know, they're still driving their old car, they couldn't take their kids to the ball game, in the amusement park. You know, coming from a working class family, I know what that's like when your parents have to say no, that there's no money to do that. That's what we feel among a lot of blue-collar voters. So Biden has to hope people start to feel better about that. But the age question, I call it the vitality issue, right? I don't think it's so much about the number. When we travel, black voters in Milwaukee, these young voters on campus around the country, Latino voters out and about, they want to see him. They want to see him in their community, even if you're going to take your lumps. Even if they say, Mr. President, I disagree with you on this. What are you doing for me on this? Let's talk. But they want to see him be more active. And, again, whatever you think of Trump, he's active. He's out there. You hear from him every minute, not just every day. You hear from him just about every minute when he wants you to hear from him. G. KING: And when you talk about vitality, he certainly has that. Thank you, John. That's a good way to look at it. It's not the age, it's the vitality. I totally agree with you. J. KING: Be present, be active. G.
