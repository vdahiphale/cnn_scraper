Plus, investigators dig into the suspected Iranian hack of the Trump campaign.And tonight, we're learning that the Trump campaign was not the only target. And it's the near-fatal helicopter crash. Trump has been talking about it. But it turns out, he apparently confused who was riding with him on that helicopter. We'll speak to the person who was actually there. Elon Musk billed it as the interview of the century. Donald Trump broke his long silence on X to promote it, but their conversation on Musk's platform was plagued with technical problems that are overshadowing the interview itself, at least parts of it. At the scheduled start time, many people could not connect to the feed where it was happening. Musk claims a denial-of-service attack, as it's known, overwhelmed the company's servers, but it's unclear if that was the issue or if too many people were trying to get into the room. The interview eventually got underway nearly 45 minutes behind schedule, and from there, Trump launched into his normal talking points and grievances and attacks on Kamala Harris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (voice-over): They're doing it right now while this third- rate, phony candidate -- don't forget, I beat -- I beat Biden. He failed in the debate miserably. We cannot have a Democrat. We cannot have her. She's incompetent. She's as bad as Biden. No tax on tips? And all of a sudden, she's making a speech and saying, \"there will be no tax on tips.\" I said that months ago. All of a sudden, for politics, she says -- you know, she comes out with what I said, which I think is terrible. And I think it's also hitting them very hard. These people are fake. Kamala wouldn't have this conversation. She can't because she's not smart. You know, she's not a smart person, by the way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The billionaire has used the platform as his personal megaphone, expressing increasingly far-right views aligned with Trump. Remember, Musk endorsed Donald Trump after the assassination attempt against him. And there's new reporting tonight that shows just how far Musk has ventured into politics. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says his Super PAC wants to turn out 800,000 voters for Trump in battleground states. We will dig into that later on tonight. And if you want just a sense of just how much their bromance has grown, all you have to do is track Trump's evolving comments on electric cars.

I saw it reach about 1.3 million at the max viewership, just on Twitter, not some of the other streaming platforms that were also carrying it. So, you're getting a non-traditional news audience that's consuming this conversation. And I think the fact that it was a conversation, was very entertaining. It's different from a politician, what they typically do. And you -- and it -- I think people were engaged with it that way. You literally heard Elon Musk and Donald Trump debating everything.

But all tight races, all in all these states, Donald Trump is doing better than he did four years ago. Now, jump ahead to August. What do we see? We see now Harris versus Trump, look at this, gains for the Democratic nominee. Harris is up by four. And all these states, her lead, her advantage, she is now doing seven points better than Biden was doing in Pennsylvania, five points better in Wisconsin, and three points better in Michigan, but jumps across the board. But it's not just about these top line numbers. It's about what's underneath the hood. This was something that you and I spoke about, right? It's the economy stupid, as James Carville once said. Trust more in economic issues. Now, this is nationally, but we are seeing a similar trend in the key battleground states. Look at this. Who do you trust more in economic issues? In July, 41% of voters nationwide said Trump compared to 35% who said Biden. Now, look how close we are. We're at 42% for Harris, 41% for Trump.

Eighty-six percent of Harris supporters say they're enthusiastic about voting.That actually leads Trump, who only 80% of his voters say they're enthusiastic about voting. That is unchanged from 2023, basically, when Trump held the advantage on the enthusiasm question. Now, it's the Democrats who hold the advantage on the enthusiasm issue. And just one little last thing on temperament. I think this is so important because we've seen Donald Trump kind of go off the rails in recent days, whether it be, you know, saying potentially that Kamala Harris's crowds were fake, they were AI-generated, no proof of that whatsoever. That just plays into this right temperament to be present. Look at this. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin say that, yes, Harris has the right temperament. For Trump, it's the exact opposite. Fifty-four percent say no, he does not have the right temperament. You put it all together, Jim. You put it all together. This was just a very bad polling day in the past few days on the poll front for the former president Donald Trump, but I guess the good news for him is he still got a little bit around, let's say, 80 or so days, a little less than three months to turn it all around because he'll need it.",

She's not going to lower prices. She's not going to deal with gas and energy prices. Those are all problems of her own creation.

She's going to have to come out and explain how her economic policies will be different if she wants to continue to sustain that advantage in the polls.The other problem with her not being visible enough is she risks being sort of attacked constantly by Donald Trump with having no substantial rebound other than what she's putting on terms of social media memes. That's not really effective when you're trying to reach an entire electorate. Yes, there are 160 million Americans that use TikTok monthly, but the vast majority of older Americans are not getting their news on TikTok, they're not getting it through memes, they're getting it still from traditional television interviews, newspaper interviews, etcetera.",
