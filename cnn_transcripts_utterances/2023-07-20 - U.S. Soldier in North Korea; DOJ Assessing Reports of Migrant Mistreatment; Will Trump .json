U.S. officials now trying to figure out why he ran.This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Right now, all eyes and at least one Trump legal team is keeping watch on a federal courthouse in Washington. That is where a grand jury is convened right now. And one decision that they could make as soon as today is handing up a criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump, making this -- this would make it the third time that he'd be hit with criminal charges, this time over the efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. And while it is unlikely, today is the last day for Trump to respond to the special counsel's target letter to appear and testify before that same grand jury, again, though, unlikely. CNN has learned who will be testifying today. His name is Will Russell. He's a special assistant to Trump, and this would be Russell's third time testifying. CNN's Paula Reid has the very latest for us. She's joining us now. Paula, how soon could we see an indictment? What are you picking up about this?",

We also don't expect he's going to formally decline or give the special counsel and official notice he's not going to do this. So that lends itself to a lot of ambiguity around the timing of a possible indictment. We know from other target letters and the special counsel's previous actions that there will likely be a beat, at least a few days, before anything happens. As you noted, the grand jury hearing evidence in this case is seated today. But we also know, Kate, from our reporting that other witnesses are expected to testify in August about this case. So, right now, in our reporting, we're trying to reconcile what we have learned about this target letter and the fact that we're expecting more witnesses in the coming weeks. I know there's a lot of speculation. It's a little confusing, but these are the actual facts that we have. He received a target letter, but there are some other, some of them pretty significant witnesses who won't even be speaking to investigators until August. So, at this point, it's unclear when an indictment will come.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, good morning, Rahel.They are. They are reaching out to lawyers and Trump allies and trying to get a better picture of what the potential criminal case against Donald Trump may look like. And, specifically, they're asking about a couple different things. One is, did anyone else receive a target letter like Donald Trump did, or is he the sole subject of this investigation? The second thing they want to know is what the scope of the evidence is against him and what exactly, like, special counsel Jack Smith's team has to back up some of the charges that they laid out in that target letter? They also want to know who in Trump world may be cooperating with the special counsel's team. And I do think it's important to know that the charges that they laid out in that target letter that he received on Sunday night are much more scrawling than Donald Trump's team had anticipated and clearly very concerning for them. Another thing to note as well is that many of the witnesses that had gone before the grand jury are represented by lawyers who are paid for by people within Trump's world. And so that does give them unusual insight into some of the questions that may -- they may be asked of and also something, of course, that Donald Trump's team is looking at very closely. Now, Trump's team is expected to only have until the end of the day to come and speak before the grand jury if he wants to. We are told that he's not expected to, but we're still waiting to see if he tries to take that opportunity. And, from there, they're going to see, OK, when do we expect an indictment to come in this case, Rahel.",

So what may be happening is, they may not indict until all of these witnesses have been heard, or they may actually indict as to the former president, because I think they're very intent on getting this on the calendar before the election. And they may continue as to potential other defendants. There's been a lot of talk about why folks like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and others haven't received target letters.

The first two sets of concertina wire that you see here, the property owner of this property has told us that they have asked the state of Texas to remove it and that Texas refuses to do so. We have asked the governor's office about that. They have not responded. The next layer of border barrier are the buoys. If we can pan over here to the side, you will see that there are border buoys that have now been deployed. And these are buoys that are anchored to the bottom of the waterway. Now, this is an international boundary. And you there are treaties between the U.S. and Mexico that govern all of this. And, according to the U.S. State Department, the state of Texas didn't ask for permits before deploying that border barrier. Now, as I was just saying, there's a group of migrants that just crossed, and you can see them there right now. They are making their way to this property, which, of course, is blocked off by the concertina wire. Now, I have seen in the past migrants use their clothing or other objects to try to protect themselves from the concertina wire to get actually on land. Right now, you can see that there are several vehicles here and Texas National Guard. Now, regarding all of the allegations that we have heard of, right now, today with these migrants who have just crossed, we have not seen much activity in relationship to what Texas DPS and/or the National Guard, what their interaction is with them, as, at this point, you can take a look and see that the migrants are really just waiting at the moment. Now, top brass at Texas DPS has acknowledged that the number of injuries due to this concertina wire has increased. And that takes me to the Texas State Trooper who blew the whistle, that Trooper that e- mailed his superiors saying that they were given orders to push migrants back into the river and also not to provide them water. Now, Texas DPS denies that. The governor of Texas says too that that is not what is going on here in the state of Texas. Now, the owners of the property where I'm standing, the ones that say that they have been asking the state of Texas to remove this concertina wire, say that they have witnessed this. They say that they have been on their property, have watched the National Guard stand here doing nothing while migrants need help. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
