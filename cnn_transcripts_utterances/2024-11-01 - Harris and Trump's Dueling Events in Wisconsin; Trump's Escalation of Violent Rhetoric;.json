They want all of the comments to be played in full, which, of course, we just did, to show that they say Donald Trump was using remarks that have been used before.Obviously, it's Donald Trump, so he has gone so much farther in terms of calling her a chicken hawk, that's what they say that he was doing, was saying that she's a warmonger, but that she would never go to war herself. And that's what they've been trying to hammer home in various statements and calls that we've been fielding today. This is the exact same statement they gave us. And I do want to read this. They say, President Trump is 100 percent correct that warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them, rather than go into combat themselves. This is just the continuation of a large -- the latest fake news outrage days before the election in a blatant attempt to interfere on behalf of Kamala Harris. Obviously, that last part is just simply not true. Donald Trump did say those remarks, which we just played in full. I think a couple things. One, Democrats clearly seizing on this. Two, Donald Trump doesn't have a lot of goodwill when it comes to comments like this because of the fact that he has called Democrats the enemy within, because of the fact that he has said that the people need retribution, essentially that he would be seeking revenge if he was brought back into the White House. However, they are saying this is not part of those kind of comments that Donald Trump has made in the past, that this is a separation, that he was simply saying that she should go to war herself if she's going to call for wars. She's also -- he has also went on to call her a moron, stupid, various different name calling within this. It is clear that Liz Cheney is somebody who has gotten under his skin. Regardless of these past comments, we know that to be the case, particularly as Cheney has been on the campaign trail campaigning for Kamala Harris. But one other thing to note here, everything both of these candidates say is under an enormous amount of scrutiny. So, saying these comments at a time just close to the election obviously is going to call -- cause uproar because everyone, voters, media, we are all watching everything both of these candidates say.",

The challenge we've got is it's tough to quantify how much of each. And that was the overriding message, I think, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They said, look, we saw a, quote, \"severe impact\" from Hurricane Helene and from Hurricane Milton and that they couldn't quantify the impact. So, that leaves us grasping around to understand.To the numbers, as you pointed out, 12,000 jobs added for the month of October, a fraction even of what we were expecting. And that is jarring. Let's be clear. We were expecting a hit of somewhere between 60,000 or to 100,000 jobs as a result of those Boeing strikes and the storm impact. Even if you add the best-case scenario, this does look like a softer report. Then take the revisions to the months of August and September. We saw 112,000 less jobs added over those two months, too. So, it's not a collapsing jobs market, it is a cooling jobs market. In terms of the sectors, let me just give you a look. It's what you would expect. We saw a big hit to manufacturing. We saw a big hit to temporary jobs as well. We saw gains from government hiring jobs and people and from health care as well. What's most interesting to me, guys, very quickly, is the unemployment rate, 4.1 percent unchanged from the month of September. So, through all this noise, perhaps that's the best way to look at these numbers and the jobs market and just wait for next month, quite frankly. What does this mean and where does this leave us four days out from a presidential election? Plenty of room, I think, to politicize this report.",

And in fact, in some cases they say, you know, like, for example, we go to a door and one of them might have a Trump sign in the front yard. But typically, because of the gender differential that we're seeing in this race, typically, the woman in the household is saying, look, I'm with Kamala.So, I'm not sure how that shows up in polling. All I know it's right now, you know, it's going to be a close race, but the energy is on our side. A lot of it has to do with people who are just sick to death of this sort of anger and venom that Donald Trump introduces to the political process. But it also is about reproductive rights. It's about the economy. It's about our democracy. All of that falls to our advantage. The interesting thing is that there's some recent polling that shows there's almost no undecided voters. The decision are for voters who don't know if they have a stake in this race as to whether they're going to participate. So, our argument, really, is not to appeal to people to change their minds, but to activate themselves based on what their interests are and get to the polls. If we do that, we'll be fine.",
