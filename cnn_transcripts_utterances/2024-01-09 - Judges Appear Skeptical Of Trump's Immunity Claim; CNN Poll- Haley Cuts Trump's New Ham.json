Now, the three appeals court judges appeared skeptical of Trump's arguments that he was working in his official capacity as president when he tried to overturn the 2020 election.

If that were the case, Ford wouldn't need to have had to pardon Nixon. So, this whole idea that there's a sphere of conduct that somehow presidents are immune from is just ludicrous. And Judge Pan, Florence Pan, today was the one that really picked on it. And they didn't have answer for it because there is no answer for it.

She's the only candidate that has surging numbers in Iowa or New Hampshire. And that the numbers in New Hampshire are not just closing a gap but really approaching Donald Trump. And at this rate, yeah, she has every opportunity to win here in New Hampshire.

He has an opportunity here, whether to get out of the race or to have supporters galvanized behind Nikki.And again, commit on his mission. Once the lost starts here, once he loses that first primary in New Hampshire, they go to the home state of South Carolina for Nikki Haley, and with a month to campaign there and close the gap there. So everything gets reset if Chris were to get out of the race. I think he knows that. I'm still hopeful he'll make the right decision. He's done a great job on the race. You have to give him a lot of credit, to be sure. But now, it's time to say, well, this was kind of a long shot, we always knew we had to consolidate and here's the chance to do. It would be given all the credit in the world if he were. But, yeah, that's the margin of victory right there. If Chris were out of the race, Nikki wouldn't just be close to Donald Trump, she'd be three or four points ahead of Donald Trump, something no one in the national media thought was possible.

More than 500,000 are without power and that number likely to increase this heavy winds and rain get worse throughout the night. And in our politics lead, finally, some answers after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's secret hospitalization in the middle of a brewing global conflict involving U.S. troops in the Middle East. In a statement this afternoon, Walter Reed Medical Center explains Austin was treated in late December for early stage prostate cancer. He was readmitted to the hospital January 1st for severe pain and an infection. The hospitalization, the White House, President Biden and Austin's own deputy were unaware of for three days. CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann is with us now. Oren, did the Pentagon explain why Austin didn't notify anyone? OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Pam, there's a personal side of this, which a statement from Walter Reed and the Pentagon in a press briefing pointed out that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is a private person and the decision to treat prostate cancer is a private decision. But this isn't just an average citizen. This is the secretary of defense of the United States. Some of that privacy simply isn't there. That leads to the question of, why is it that President Joe Biden didn't know that his defense secretary was in the hospital, that the deputy secretary of defense didn't for days, neither did other senior administration officials? There's also the question about whether anyone knew that he was under general anesthesia on December 22nd, when he was initially treated with a minimally invasive surgery, according to Walter Reed, for prostate cancer here. He spent the night in the hospital there. That, too, a major question here that has yet to be answered. The Pentagon saying they've initiated a 30 day review of the notification procedures. They say it was his chief of staff Kelly Magsamen's job to pass on the notification to others but she had the flu is the answer or excuse we're hearing from the Pentagon here. Still, his senior medical adviser knew and didn't pass on the notification. So, Pentagon saying they're reviewing this as part of a 30-day process. White House clearly concerned as well, because they told other agencies to look at their protocols as well here.",

So, who is Nathan Wade and how long has he known District Attorney Fani Willis? TAMAR HALLERMAN, REPORTER, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Nathan Wade is the special prosecutor who has really been spearheading this Trump election interference case in Fulton County, more or less, since the beginning. He joined in fall of 2021, he has been working closely with Fulton D.A. Fani Willis, as she collected evidence and the case, signed off on subpoenas, interviewed witnesses, helped negotiate immunity deals with potential witnesses. And he's known Fulton D.A. Willis for several years now. He was assigned to mentor her back before she became district attorney when she was serving as a magistrate judge.

We've heard critics who said it's yet another reason not to trust what D.A. Willis is doing in Fulton County and really to try to undermine whatever may come out as a part of this trial.Legally, we are still waiting to figure out what all of this means. Of course, we are waiting to see what kind of evidence miss merchant brings forward and eventually at some point, and we're also waiting to see what D.A. Willis has to say about all of this as well as Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor. They have not weighed in and they said that they would respond in the upcoming court filings.

There are some folks who've I spoken to who say that this is more of a case of bad optics more than anything else.
