Welcome to our live coverage of the Iowa Republican caucuses, the first nominating contest in the 2024 race. The first in the nation contest is shaping up to be a memorable one.Donald Trump, the frontrunner, is urging his supporters not to be complacent. Nikki Haley is making the electability case, arguing she's best suited to take on President Biden. Gov. Ron DeSantis says he's the only one who can compete with Trump for the Republican base. Stakes are extremely high, the temperature is extremely low, and the entire nation is watching to see what tonight's results will mean for an already intense election year. Let's get you to the ground with CNN's Alayna Treene in Des Moines. So, Alayna, what are you hearing there in the homestretch?",

Well, after months of crisscrossing the state of Iowa and pouring 10s of millions of dollars into campaign ads, the candidates really spent the final days before tonight's Iowa caucuses delivering their closing arguments to Iowa voters and urging them to brave the frigid weather here in the state and turn out and caucus for them.Now, Donald Trump has remained the clear frontrunner. He has maintained his commanding lead in the polls. But a big question is still whether or not his path to the potential Republican nomination will become more difficult after Iowa. We're also paying close attention to whether Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis will emerge as the number two and see where they fare tonight. A lot of people are trying to see which one of them will become the clear alternative to Donald Trump. And that is something that Nikki Haley actually addressed recently with our colleague, Kylie Atwood. Take a listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's the wind and it's the ice that's on the road. Iowa is used to cold. Kasie Hunt did a - interview this morning from Mars coffeehouse, which is a small chain in Des Moines. She was dressed for the South Pole. The person she was interviewing was wearing a light jacket. We've seen people go to these events, whether it's for Trump or DeSantis or whomever, and some of them are wearing shorts. They're dressed like John Fetterman. So cold does not bother these people. But if it's windy, if it's difficult to get to their place, it could affect Donald Trump. And for the reasons that Karen laid out, it could affect Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis.
