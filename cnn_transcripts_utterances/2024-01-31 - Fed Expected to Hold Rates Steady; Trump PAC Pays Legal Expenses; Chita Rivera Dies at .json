Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this month that he sees, quote, \"no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly in the past.\" What does that actually mean?CNN economic commentator and \"Washington Post\" opinion columnist Catherine Rampell. If anyone knows what that means, you know what that means. Talk to us about the significance of the Fed, this first meeting, and what it means for everyone at home. CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMIC COMMENTATOR: Sure. So, the Fed is meeting today, or has been meeting actually the last couple of days, as you note. And everybody wants to know what they're looking at. And what they're looking at is the same data everybody else is examining, the state of the economy. And the real question is, how hot, or cold, is the economy today. And there's some conflicting data on that. So, the kinds of things they'll be considering, what's happening to prices. Obviously on lots of consumer's minds. What's happening to other broader measures of economic activity. GDP, for example, has been stunningly strong the last couple of quarters, beating expectations. And, of course, what's happening to the job market. Which, as Phil mentioned, has really held up. So, let's dig into some of those numbers. So, on inflation, this is the -- a chart of the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. It strips out energy and food prices. I know that matters to consumers, but for the purposes of the Fed, those are pretty volatile. They want to see the underlying numbers. And you can see, it's come down quite a lot. It's still above where it -- where the Fed would like it to be. Their target rate is around here. And we're still a little bit above that, even if we've come down quite a bit. And then beyond that, looking at the job market, here's some data that came out yesterday. It's a different measure of the job market, looking at how many jobless workers there are per job opening. So, it's a ratio. And you can see it's very low. There are fewer than one worker available per vacancy in the United States. That's close to historic lows here. Again, a sign of a hot economy rather than one that potentially needs to be stimulated through interest rate cuts.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, let's talk a little bit about what to expect today.So, Jay Powell is going to be talking today. They're releasing a statement. And the real question is, are they going to cut rates today? And if you look at where markets are placing these odds, they do not think it's going to happen today. So, this is where the - where markets are today. You know, 98 percent chance there is no change. However, as you pointed out, the Fed has signaled it may start cutting rates at some point this year. A lot of market participants think, you know, there's a pretty decent chance that they'll start cutting as soon as March. You know, 40 percent chance or so. And so they will be paying very careful attention to what's in that statement. Any tiny tweak of verbiage in that statement to indicate their timing, as well as the press conference that happens later today at 2:30 when Chairman Powell will be taking questions from journalists about how he's viewing the state of play and how he views the economy. And now the question about what this means for consumers is a great one. So, interest rates, what the Fed controls has a lot of knock-on effects for other consumer products. So, things like the price of your mortgage. If the Fed cuts rates, you might expect that that will feed into mortgage rates, 30 year mortgages, as well as car loans. Car loans again also benchmarked against the Fed's funds rate. And then you also have things like credit card interest rates. Those will be affected as well.",

I mean, to -- I wrote an op-ed the other day arguing that he hasn't clearly defined why he's running for a second term. And I think he -- I think he needs to do two things. I -- he has to campaign in poetry and pros. The poetry is spelling out in no uncertain terms the threat to democracy that Donald Trump unquestionably poses. But the pros is reaching people where they are, around the kitchen table. And Biden is potentially terrific at that. And he -- we know he can do that. He hasn't done it so far. I find that kind of odd. But I think he needs not to talk about Bidenomics, which is a kind of wonky recitation of his achievements. He's got to talk about - he's got to be honest with voters who feel that prices are higher and say, look, I get it, prices are higher on a lot of stuff, and here's what I'm going to do to change that. Here's how we're going to do - here's how we're going to bring those prices down. Here's how far we've brought them down already.
