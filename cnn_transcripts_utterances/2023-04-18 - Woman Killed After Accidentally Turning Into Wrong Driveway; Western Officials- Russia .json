They described her as a beautiful soul. A ray of light. Authorities say this man 65- year-old Kevin Monahan fired two shots at the vehicle Gillis was riding in from his front porch as the friends were actually leaving. They realized they made a mistake. They turned around. Monahan is now charged in connection with her death. CNN's Brynn Gingras, she's been following the story. Brynn, I mean, do we know any more details as to why he chose to fire from his front porch at these folks who made a mistake and it seems they were leaving as it happened.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, I mean, we're getting a little bit more about what the defense strategy might be here. I talked to the attorney for Kevin Monahan, the 65-year-old man charged in this case, and he says his client says he felt threatened by this group of vehicles that approached his home. And he said it wasn't just one car. It was actually a motorcycle and a second vehicle carrying two people that pulled up into the driveway. He said they're rubbing their engines and he felt threatened and those were warning shots basically that he fired.Now I did reach out to the sheriff, and he confirmed it was a motorcycle, a second car and then that third car that carried four people, including the victim, 23 -- or 20, year old Kaylan Gillis and her boyfriend, Evan. He says, they were driving up and down that rural road looking for cell phone reception to use GPS to find a friend's home. Went up the driveway. Quickly realized it was the wrong home and as they were turning around, he says, forensic forensics prove and witness accounts from those who were inside the car show that he fired those shots at that last car as they were all turning around. They want you to hear more from the sheriff who was on our shows earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF JEFFREY MURPHY, WASHINGTON COUNTY, NEW YORK SHERIFF'S OFFICE: He has not made any statements. He obtained a lawyer before he came out of the house. Many has not made any statements and, quite frankly, it's not shown any remorse in this case. He was not threatened at all. So, the kids didn't he get out of their cars. They didn't say anything. There was no words exchanged. You know, they were turning around as I said, leaving so there certainly was no threat. So, you know, I'm hopeful that will be able to get a successful prosecution in this case and that justice is served for the Gillis family and for Kaylan. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In a briefing today, the official said that Russia is resorting to using old tank models, some of them dating back to right World War II. It comes as the NATO secretary general tells CNN he wants Ukraine's allies to do even more to supply weapons to Ukraine.Let's walk over to the magic wall now and Cedric Leighton. He is a retired Air Force colonel and a CNN military analyst. Colonel thanks so much for sharing part of the afternoon with us. Let's start with the map. Because we want to break down the gains or lack thereof that Russia has made in Ukraine. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Absolutely Boris. Well, one of the key things to think about is, you know, when everything started back in February of last year, the Russians were coming really close into Kyiv, and they could have -- they could have if everything had worked out for them taking that capital within a few days. That was their plan. It obviously failed. And the reason that it failed was that they didn't have the equipment that they needed. They didn't have the wherewithal to make it happen. But then fast forward you've got in this area around Kharkiv, this area in the south. So, through the spring, summer and the latter part of summer and early part of fall, the Ukrainians were able to recapture all of these areas right here. That was significant, and that really put the Russians on the on the back foot when it came to their ability to occupy parts of Ukraine.",

In fact, over 100,000 T-55 have been produced throughout the history of this particular tank, and they're being used all over the world. But the Soviets and then after them, the Russians have used them to great effect. They replaced them with a bunch of tanks like the T-72 in 1972 and the T-80 and 1976. But these were all Cold War era tanks. The closest one in time to our period right now is the T-90, and that one has a lot of capabilities that the West, you know, has emulated in some respects and they also served to actually use as part of the model for developing our tanks.But the key thing here is these tanks are really old, really stalwart, but they have no way to survive the armor piercing shells that the Western allies have right now.",

And as he said, people essentially saw him -- saw this all transpired on live TV. But you know that for the last 3.5 months what they've sort of been trying to figure out is just how safe it would be for him to return. And we talked to a lot of people about this. A cardiologist, including our own, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, about this, and they're not surprised most of them that he could return. What it basically means is a few things. One is that his heart function returned to normal. He has no underlying problems with the anatomy of the heart itself, and he has no underlying electrical problems. So, that that's the most important thing. And the way they figured that out over the last 3.5 months was to do a lot of tests. I mean, this is the types of tests that they've been doing to try and make sure there wasn't some sort of underlying problem. Look Jim, this is rare. So, there's not a lot of data on this sort of thing. You can't say look based on 10,000 patients we know this. But the American Heart Association does weigh on this way -- weight in on this, along with the American College of Cardiology, basically saying, if none of these abnormalities are found, no underlying cardiac abnormality is found, then individuals can safely resume training and competition after resuscitation from commotio cordis, which we now know is the diagnosis.",
