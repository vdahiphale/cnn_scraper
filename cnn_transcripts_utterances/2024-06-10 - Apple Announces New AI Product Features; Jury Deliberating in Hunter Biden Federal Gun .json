However, prosecutors did not establish that Hunter Biden was using drugs on the days that he possessed the firearm. Now, common sense would dictate that he was. I think, and this is what the prosecutors tried to tap into, you ought to believe that based on the evidence in the record, you believe this individual was addicted to and using drugs and knew he was addicted.

So the defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, made a big deal about it.It says, are, are you? Meaning now it's a little bit like Bill Clinton, is there a relationship? We're now in the unknown. We're in the great black box of our jury process. We don't know what they're doing back there. They could be back with a verdict in an hour. They could be back with a verdict later today. They could take till the end of the week. We just don't know. I do think this is a case, I agree with Elliot, I think he's pretty clearly guilty under the -- a reasonable take on the evidence, but there's also a lot of reason here why a jury may just say, we don't like this charge. We don't like this case. We don't like the way it was handled and therefore find a way to not return a guilty verdict.",

The same statute provision involves barring the possession of firearms by someone convicted of a felony, right? That's easy.You come into court with a certificate of conviction that says this guy is convicted and therefore shouldn't have had a gun. This idea of, and this is your question, Brianna, this idea of, was he using it on the day or the day before? Was he addicted after? What does it mean to be addicted? Are you using sort of, and it's just fuzzy enough that a successful defense attorney and the right jury could sort of get to a point where they just aren't convinced of addiction.

I think the question is, well, did it stop? Did we have a break in the rain in the middle? That's what the defense is saying. Well, for these 11, a little more than these 11 days, but they haven't proved that he was still using.But I think there's both direct and circumstantial evidence. I mean, there's the before and after. There's also texts that Hunter Biden sends during the crucial period that say he's using, and the defense tried to argue, yes, but he was lying or he was just sort of fabricating there. That's a little bit tough. [15:40:00] WILLIAMS: The rain metaphor is a great one and something, you know, a law professor would use because here you would say the person looked out the window before and saw rain on the ground, looked out the window a few days later and saw people walking around with umbrellas and so on. But at the time in question, did you look out the window and see if people were holding umbrellas and see that the ground was wet? Probably not.",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, the jury has begun its deliberations. In this case, we have about an hour until court usually wraps up around 4They have to deliberate on three different counts and we're just watching and waiting to see if there is a verdict or more likely with juries, a note, a question, something that they would like to see, something they would like to review. We learned earlier that they will have access to some of the evidence that was presented in this case, but not all of it. For example, they're not going to have the gun at the center of this case. They're not going to have the infamous laptop. So they could potentially send a note this afternoon asking to see something or asking for clarification on the law. But we are here, we are watching, and we are waiting. And of course, these deliberations come after closing statements from both prosecutors and the defense. I thought it was notable that the prosecutors kicked off their opening statement by pointing to the gallery. When I was in court today, it was notable just how crowded it was in there. So many supporters and family members there to show their support for Hunter Biden. And the prosecutors pointed to those people and said they are not evidence. So that was notable to me because it suggests that perhaps prosecutors are worried about, for example, the presence of the first lady on most days of court and this large show of support somehow undermining their case. I didn't expect them to kick off that way. And then the defense had their chance to go and they really focused on the idea that there is no direct evidence of Hunter Biden using drugs during the time he owned that gun. They tried to undermine the credibility of two of Hunter Biden's ex-girlfriends who testified in this case. One, a young woman he met at a gentlemen's club who spent long stretches of time with him. In 2018, provided a lot of the photos that we see with him and drug paraphernalia, but had nothing to offer regarding October 2018. They also took aim at his sister-in-law and one-time girlfriend, Hallie Biden, saying that, look, she couldn't even remember key details about when she discovered that gun in his truck. But I think one of the most difficult moments in these closing arguments was when prosecutors brought up the testimony of Naomi Biden, Hunter Biden's daughter. She testified on Friday. Look, I was in court for that. It was clear it was very difficult for her. But she did, that testimony did provide an opening for prosecutors. And they reminded the jury that she testified that when she returned her dad's car to him on October 19th, 2018, she saw no evidence of drugs in the car. But they reminded people that Hallie Biden testified that on October 23rd, when she discovered the gun in that same car, that she found it alongside drug paraphernalia. That is a really important connection that prosecutors have made. But bringing that back in the opening statement, something that is likely going to be very painful for the family, because that was, of course, a very difficult thing for Naomi Biden to have to get on the stand and talk about her father's addiction and what she observed in October 2018. Even though she consistently said that she believed he was clean during the time he owned the gun, her testimony, her appearance on the stand, did give a valuable piece of evidence there to prosecutors. So we'll see what the jury thought of it. We're standing by, watching and waiting.",

It was interesting talking during the Trump trial with jury consultants. They say a lot of times the jurors get into the room, and they just kind of do an initial gut check. Hey, this is my impression, or this is where I am. You know, if they're all on the same page, off the bat, there you go.

Now, these are high- profile people that you see on CNN and other news networks, but many people just simply aren't familiar with who they are.The first ladies across history, Hillary Clinton, let's go back, or Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, are immensely popular and also recognizable people. And I think the jury sees that. Now, whether that factors into their deliberations now, the judge will instruct them that it should not. And prosecutors made the point to start off today that, you know, you're not -- don't worry about who's sitting in that gallery.

No one saw him using on that day or during that period. And it's an open question as to what the jury will choose to believe.
