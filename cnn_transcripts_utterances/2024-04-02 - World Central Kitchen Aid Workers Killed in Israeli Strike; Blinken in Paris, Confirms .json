But also urgent questions coming up from the many aid organizations that have been trying to get help to the more than half the Gazan population that is currently facing famine, according to the United Nations. And it is in that context, I think, that you have to bear in mind the response that we've had from Israeli authorities so far, not just Benjamin Netanyahu that you heard there but also the IDF, that has said that it is not only investigate -- will be investigating this at the highest level. But it is a top general who will be reviewing the information as it comes in. This was, according to the World Central Kitchen, a deconflicted zone. Their car, when you look at the aftermath of that strike, was clearly marked with its logo on it. It had, it says, coordinated with the IDF, the movement, the delivery of this hundred tons of aid to this warehouse. And it was nonetheless hit, that convoy, as it headed off. So that is a subject to review. And those questions that are now urgently being put by so many different parties in the world and the U.N. agencies also working in Gaza urgently will have to be answered relatively quickly. All the more so that Israeli officials have repeatedly claimed over the last few months that they're working closely with the aid organizations and they're getting relief to the people of Gaza is amongst their top priorities.",

Specifically, the most basic of needs and that being food. He said that he spoke to the Israeli government and they've called for a swift and impartial investigation into the strike.

Let me take the second question first.It has been our view and policy from day one, when it comes to Ukraine, to do everything we possibly can to help Ukraine defend itself against this Russian aggression. At the same time, we have neither supported nor enabled strikes by Ukraine outside of its territory. With regard to arms transfers, look, I think it's very important to put this in its proper perspective and understand what we're talking about. First, we have a longstanding commitment to Israel's security and to helping ensure its ability to defend itself. That's been a policy from administration to administration -- Republican, Democrat -- back and forth. And, indeed, that policy developed over many years, developed into successive agreements between the United States and Israel, long-duration agreements -- 10 years, in this case -- to provide military assistance over that timeframe to about $3 billion a year. That's the system that's in place and has long been in place. These arms transfers, every single one happens consistent with statutory and policy requirements. That includes both informal and formal notifications to Congress. And it's what we do with every country with whom we have a defense relationship that involves the sale or transfer of arms. Now the other important piece of context is this:  with Israel -- and this is also true with other countries -- there are a number of open cases, open requests of previously notified cases, which have not been fully fulfilled or completed. In the case of Israel, for example, there are many requests that were made and were notified to Congress and agreed to that go back a decade or more. And it takes time often to produce the materiel or the weapons in question, the parts, et cetera. These complex systems, simply put, can take years to actually allow us to fulfill the request and the agreement. So many of the cases that you occasionally report on now underwent congressional review years ago and were notified years ago, well before the conflict in Gaza started.",

So the secretary of state is making a distinction there between sales that have been notified previously -- in some instances,many, many years ago -- and of course, it takes some the time for the equipment and the weaponry that are sold in those instances to actually be produced. And so part of what you're seeing now is those sales actually being fulfilled, right, those -- that equipment is now produced, it is now going to be sent to Israel under previous contracts. And he says that that is basically something that the U.S. is not willing to compromise on because they are -- they're part of the U.S.' long security relationship with the Israelis. But then there is what we have reported on, which are new sales, sales such as the F-15  case, worth $18 billion, that the U.S. is only entering into with Israel now. These are not previous cases that have already been notified to Congress. These are brand new that the administration is choosing to enter into with Israel at this moment when there is all of this, of course, spotlight on the way that Israel is carrying out its campaign in Gaza and how they are not doing enough, according to the U.S., to protect civilians. And so while Antony Blinken is making a case that they have to honor previous commitments, he is not necessarily laying out here just why the U.S. feels like it has to enter into these new relationships and new contracts with the Israelis. To provide them with equipment, including 50 F-15s that many critics say the Israelis don't necessarily need at this moment to fight this particular war. And it remains to be seen whether or not they will in the next four to five years. And so the question now, of course, becomes whether the U.S. is going to do more to restrict or limit aid to Israel in light, of course, of that WCK strike, in light of the other things that the Israelis have been doing in Gaza. It does not seem at this moment, according to Secretary Blinken's answer there, like they're willing to do that.",

It has a very large main embassy building and then several annexes as well. And it seems as though what the Israelis hit seems to be one of those annex buildings that appears to be close to the consular section but then also part of the rest of that very large compound as well. And you're absolutely right, the Israelis have come out and said they don't consider basically the entire embassy compound but certainly that building to be part of the diplomatic mission of Iran to Damascus but rather a base for Iran's Quds Force, which, of course, is the foreign operations wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. And, of course, we do know that several -- as the -- as the Iranians put it -- military advisers were killed in that strike, including at least two very senior generals who were very important to Iran's operations in that part of the Middle East. But officially, of course, this is very much of Iran's diplomatic compound really right in the heart of the Syrian capital. This is right on the main highway that leads exactly into the center of Damascus. So certainly a very bold strike if indeed the Israelis were behind it. They, of course, have not claimed responsibility yet. It also seems to be one that was conducted fairly precisely. What we do see is the main embassy building seems to be almost untouched but then the building next to it, the one that got hit, absolutely flattened by what appear to be several munitions -- Eleni.",

But several of those who were invited to attend told CNN that they declined the invitation amid frustrations with President Biden's support for Israel, amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Now last year, the White House did not hold this event but they did hold a celebration marking the end of Ramadan for about 350 people here at the White House. But this dinner will be quite small with President Biden, Vice President Harris and other top White House aides attending along with fewer than a dozen invited guests. Now the officials said that they hope that this dinner will give those guests an opportunity to share some of their concerns and speak with President Biden directly. The White House and the Biden campaign have acknowledged that there is more work that they need to do with the Muslim American community, especially, as they've seen this frustration with the president's approach when it comes to Gaza. But it's not just Muslim Americans; Arab Americans and young Americans have also expressed frustration with the way the president has handled this conflict. And we've seen that play out at the ballot box as well. There could be a key test today in the battleground state of Wisconsin, which is set to hold its primaries a little bit later this evening. There is a campaign for voters to vote uninstructed. That is similar to the campaigns that were conducted in states like Michigan as well as Minnesota to urge voters to not -- to vote uncommitted and uninstructed in the Democratic primaries as a sign of discontent with President Biden's handling of Gaza. So there's this organization has been pushing this campaign also in Wisconsin. The president, of course, is expected to win the Democratic presidential primary but everyone will be watching to see how many people vote for uninstructed. Over in the battleground state of Michigan, they got more than 100,000 votes for uncommitted back in their primary at the end of February. And that comes at a time when every single vote in those battleground states is going to count. Michigan and Wisconsin were two states that Biden narrowly won against Trump in -- back during the 2020 campaign. So the White House and the Biden campaign have acknowledged that they still have a lot of work to do. But so much for the president is trying to hear directly from people about their concerns and officials are hoping that, at this iftar dinner tonight, he will be able to hear a little bit about how people are feeling about what he has done with his approach in Gaza.",

And so it represents a continuing effort by Israel to disrupt Quds Force operations, not only in Syria but of the broader axis of resistance. So on one level, it's a disruption of Iran's activities in the region and its coordination of the extra resistance. Looking at it a bit more broadly, General Zahedi is part of this old network of IRGC commanders, going back to the period of the war. He served as a mid-level position -- in mid-level command position during the Iran- Iraq war and was really part of the inner circle of the IRGC. So putting aside the death of Qasem Soleimani in 2020, this is potentially the most senior IRGC commander killed outside of -- outside of Iran, since Qasem Soleimani.",

One would be to do what it has been doing since the outbreak of the conflict in Gaza, which is to support acts of resistance forces, whether that's (INAUDIBLE) Hezbollah, Ansarullah (ph) in Yemen or the so-called Islamic Resistance in Iraq to strike at Israel. And often, oftentimes this is the way that Iran has responded. In other instances, Iran has tried to directly strike, assassinate or kidnap Israelis around the world, although in the overwhelming majority of cases, those have been failures. Given the nature of the strike, killing a very, very senior IRGC Quds Force commander, as well as openly attacking an Iranian diplomatic facility, Iranian leaders may feel that a further escalation is called for. And so they could choose from a number of options. For example, they could go after Israeli diplomatic facilities, whether it's in the Middle East or potentially even in the Caucasus. We've heard certain Iranian officials talk about that. They could also attempt and disrupt basically economic diversionary trade that's been going through certain Middle Eastern countries to aid Israel during the war. And finally, they could, as it appears they are doing, strike at U.S. personnel and U.S. facilities in order to pressure the United States to pressure Israel to stop its attacks.",
