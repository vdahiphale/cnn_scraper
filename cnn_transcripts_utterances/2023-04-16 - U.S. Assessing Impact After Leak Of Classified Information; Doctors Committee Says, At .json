I'm Laila Harrak.The U.S. scrambles to contain the fallout from leaked Pentagon intelligence as we learn more about what was in the documents and the evidence against the National Guardsman charged in the case. Dozens of people are dead in the power struggle between Sudan's army and a rival paramilitary group, the international community urging a return to peaceful dialogue. And a major crackdown on a Mexican drug cartel by the United States, the link to America's fentanyl crisis. The U.S. is grappling with fallout at home and abroad after a massive intelligence leak that includes blunt appraisals of some key allies. The Washington Post reports that assessments found in the classified information say Taiwan would probably be unable to defend itself against China's air power in a direct conflict. A Massachusetts National Guardsmen is in custody in connection with the leak, as CNN's Alex Marquardt has more now on the suspect and the case against him.",

He's been in the Air National Guard since enlisting back in 2019, and for the past two years, has held a top secret security clearance.Now, according to the unsealed affidavit, he began violating the terms of that security clearance back in December starting to post classified information as just paragraphs of text. Then in January, he started posting photos of classified documents on the social media site, Discord, which is popular with video gamers. So, these documents and we understand there were hundreds of them were online for months before they really came to light on April 6th. That is the day that the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, got his first briefing. And that was just one week before Teixeira was arrested at his parents' house just south of Boston. So, why did Teixeira have access with such a low rank in the military? Well, he worked for the 102nd Intelligence Operations Wing out of Massachusetts, and that produces intelligence for senior commanders around the world. And Teixiera's job was called a cyber defense operations journeyman, essentially I.T. support for this highly classified network that he worked on. And you can't be a normal I.T. guy and service that network so you have to have a high level clearance. Now, federal agents are certainly looking into what Teixeira accessed, how he accessed it, whether he printed the documents out himself and how he got them out. And there will be much bigger questions now about who can access what kind of intelligence going forward. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington.",

We've now crossed the 24-hour mark since these tensions began since this fighting began, and it seems to have intensified after Sunday morning's prayers. Eyewitnesses report hearing blasts overnight, but after this morning's prayers, there's loud explosions, there's smoke coming out of some buildings, and there still seems to be combat between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces.This -- some people are describing that as an attempted coup, but CNN is not doing so right now. Because what it really is, is a power struggle between the two generals that run Sudan. The General Burhan, who is the leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and the defective leader of the Sovereign Council that runs the country, and his number two, General Mohamed Hamdan, or Hemetti, who is the leader of the Rapid Support Forces, who are, have been back to the past, armed and trained by Russia, and that's what we see here. The big contention here is about to return to civilian rule in Sudan and who will be overly charged when these two forces are marred. We -- I want to show some video right now from the Sudanese military that claims to have taken over the state radio television broadcaster, which initially (INAUDIBLE) claimed to have taken over its dramatic because the military claims they're celebrating what was their takeover of this key installation in the country because whether who has control over the state broadcaster essentially can get on T.V. and say we have control of the country. That is why this has been one of the battlegrounds there beyond the presidential palace and the basis of the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese military.",

But, certainly, cooperation in the defense sector will be closely scrutinized as we know that the U.S. has concerns that China is considering supplying military aid to Russia in its war on Ukraine. Russia, just two days before this visit, announced snap military drills of its Pacific fleet, saying their routine just to test the readiness of the troops. And this morning, we have new video from the ministry of defense showing nuclear capable bombers carrying out patrols and air support as part of those drills. So, clearly, the defense cooperation between these two countries will be closely scrutinized. This is also an interesting character, the Chinese defense minister, he's only been in that role for just over a month. He was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 for buying Russian-made combat aircraft and equipment. So, certainly, a very closely watched visit, he will be set to arrive in Moscow this Sunday.",

It apparently lasted almost 1.5 hours. The Ukrainian president said that he was -- they spoke about the China visit. He was thankful for, quote, the clear support of those principles that unite our entire anti-war coalition, and he wasted little time getting into the issue of NATO, saying they discussed preparations for the upcoming some summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in July. And effective security guarantees for Ukraine, he said, and, in fact, for the rules based international order were needed even before they joined the alliance. So, I think carefully chosen words there by the Ukrainian president, and certainly it doesn't seem that the stated purpose of that trip by Macron to try to get China help in some kind of solution to Ukraine, to put pressure on Russia.

On Thursday, an El Nino watch was issued by the Climate Prediction Center, and that's likely to have some big implications on the upcoming tropical season. Here's why.Traditionally speaking, when you have El Nino, with that jet stream begins to shift farther south. In doing so, it kind of increases the wind shear across this particular region, effectively inhibiting tropical storm development in that same region, but also at the same time, we tend to have fewer storms forming just off the Coast of Africa. So, overall, you tend to have a slightly below normal season. And that is exactly what Colorado State University, the first entity to make their predictions for the tropical upcoming season, has decided to go with. They are forecasting 13 total named storms, six of which are expected to become hurricanes, two of them major hurricanes, which is essentially category three, four or five. Now, for some perspective, an average season has 14 total names, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. But to also put this in perspective, take a look at last year, for example. We were relatively average in terms of the overall season. With that said, we still ended up with two storms that ended up becoming retired, Hurricane Fiona and Hurricane Ian. So, at the end of the day, whether it's a below average season or not, it only takes one storm to be impactful. Now, as well as El Nino, there is also another component going into the upcoming season, and that's warm ocean temperatures. Because already so far, we're seeing sea surface temperatures across the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and even the Atlantic Ocean above average already even in April. Now, the question becomes how does that correlate into the upcoming summer regardless of what happens this upcoming season. Here is the list of names that will likely be used, fingers crossed, we don't have any of these names they get retired at the end of the season.",

I think some people of my generation, who were the protester generation, have come to regret the decision to completely abandon nuclear power because of, of course, the ward, Ukraine, the dependency on natural gas, Russian natural gas.Of course, now, they're diversifying. Natural gas is also coming from Norway, for example, and also from the United States. They're able now to liquefy natural gas. But they are burning more coal than they should. And in the era of global warming, of course, that's worrisome. So, the debates continue.",

Officers seen detaining some protesters and preventing others from scaling the perimeter fence, while some also managed to run onto the more than two-mile course to cling on to one of the fences. Police making over 100 arrests, the race eventually starting around 15 minutes late after the jockeys returned to the paddock. While the Grand National's 175th running seeing a famous victory for the pre-race favorite, Corach Rambler, the horse soaring over the last of the 30 jumps and bounding clear down the home stretch for the winning jockey from Ireland, Derek Fox, who overcome injury to ride in this race. It was a second career victory at this iconic steeplechase. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
