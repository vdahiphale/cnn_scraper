I have often commented that there's never been a response to Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA.\" And, by the way, I love that song. It gives me goosebumps. But Arlo Guthrie, \"This Land is Your Land,\" which has usually been the Democratic response, has never worked. And what most stood out to me about the convention, big picture this week, because, Kasie, I've been a viewer, I've been afar, you're there in the thick of it, is the bid for patriotism from Beyonce's \"Freedom\" to the chants of \"USA, USA,\" to the internment of love of country. These are the sort of things that normally come with Republican convention. So much so that I have done radio segment where I've asked listeners, if you see an American flag outside of a home, do you presuppose you know the politics of the people? And many have said, yes. Like, I get it, if it's a flag on the back of an F-150 and it's alongside some kind of reference to Brandon, it's probably a Trump supporter. But this convention to me said the Democrats are no longer going to cede the flag to the Republicans, and they want to wrap themselves, cloak themselves in patriotism. And I loved seeing it because no one side ought to own the flag and patriotism.",
