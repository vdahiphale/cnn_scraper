We'll have all the details from the summit that is now underway. Then more pressure on Joe Biden as actor George Clooney joins a growing chorus of calls for him to step aside in the presidential race. We'll have the very latest. Plus, just moments ago, a triple murder suspect had been found in north London after a major manhunt. We are live from the scene with more details on the gruesome attack involving a crossbow. But first at this hour, U.S. President Joe Biden is doing some high-stakes juggling. Right now, he's leading NATO's growing commitment to defending Ukraine, while at the same time, trying to convince those same world leaders and American voters he's up to the task of beating Donald Trump in November. Mr. Biden greeted other heads of state at the NATO Summit in Washington, as you can see there. His unwavering message, the United States will always have Ukraine's back. NATO appears steadfast in its support. Secretary- General Jens Stoltenberg says he expects allies to agree to quote, \"a substantial package for Ukraine\". Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told leaders, NATO members are already making good on their promise to Kyiv. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We haveseen the U.S. as well as its allies promise additional air defense systems including new Patriot batteries that will be donated by the U.S., which is a very key air defense system that the Ukrainians really need at this moment. And of course, we've also seen the U.S. commit to providing those F-16s, they are going to be delivered soon. Those U.S.-made F-16s from countries including Denmark and the Netherlands. And so, things are moving along here in terms of the U.S. commitments to Ukraine, showing really no signs of letting up. But at the same time, of course, President Zelenskyy saying, look, we need permission to strike deep inside Russian territory, because if we can't defend ourselves from those strikes, if we can't hit back, then really we - - our chances to win the war here are going to get slimmer and slimmer. And so, he is making a public plea still for the U.S. to change its position on that. Of course, as of right now, they are permitted to strike right across the border into Russia. But many of those strikes on pretty regular occasions are  coming from deeper inside Russian territory. And the Ukrainians are forbidden from using U.S.-made weapons to hit back at them. So, Zelenskyy been very public about that. But then again, you know, we see also some of Zelenskyy and Ukraine's NATO aspirations coming to the fore here with the communique that is expected to be released after the summit is, you know, reaching its conclusion. We're told that is going to say that Ukraine's path to NATO membership is quote, \"irreversible\", which is a significant victory for the Ukrainians who wanted that language inside that joint statement. And so, it's kind of a mixed bag here on the one hand, they are getting significant commitments from the U.S. and its allies. But on the other hand, they say that, that needs to strike directly over the border and further into Russia is greater now than it has been ever before, Isa.",

However, it does appear as though, especially those F-16s and a surface-to-air missile  systems, those certainly are things that could help the Ukrainians at least to a certain extent, turn the tides in some areas of the battlefield. Of course, in the past couple of months, you're right. I mean, we have talked about this a lot. The Russians have been on the offensive. The Russians have had the initiative, the Ukrainians have sort of managed to stall that in several places now along the frontline, that they've gotten more ammunition from the U.S. and from its allies. Of course, for a long time, the U.S. wasn't sending any sort of ammunition over to the Ukrainians, and they really suffered from that. The Ukrainians do hope that the F-16s, for instance, once they do go into service and hit the battlefield, that they may make a big difference, because one of the things that's really hurting the Ukrainians right now, Isa, is the fact that the Russians have become much more effective using their own Air Force. They-ve developed, of course, aerial glide bombs that they can drop from much further away from the frontlines with their jets really hurting the Ukrainian frontline positions. But with F-16s and their powerful radars, the Ukrainians hope they'd be able to engage the Russian Air Force and keep that away from their frontline troops. So, that certainly is something that could be very important for the Ukrainians. What they've been saying is, with all of these things, with air defense, with the jets, but also with some of the ground systems that they've been getting, is that they need a lot more than they've been getting so far, and they obviously need it faster as well if they want to turn the tide on the battlefield. But again, there are also two sides to that as well. Of course, the Ukrainians do say they need more weapons. However, the West also says Ukrainians also need to draft a lot more troops to be able to use those weapons if they really want to turn the tide --",

He said, look, everyone here, including theUkrainians, including him, they are looking towards November and what is going to happen in the presidential election. And the way that NATO is thinking about it, according to our reporting, just that they are essentially going to take a lot of the planning for the training for the Ukrainian military for the equipment of the Ukrainian military, giving them weaponry and things like that. And they are going to centralize it into a NATO body so that the U.S. really doesn't have outsized control over that process. So that, for example, if our future president were to pull out of NATO or if a future President were to say, look, I don't want to support Ukraine anymore, then that could be under kind of the NATO umbrella. And so, they're setting up a system for that right now. It's going to be headquartered in Germany, and this is really a way, according to a NATO official that I spoke to, to exactly that, to Trump-proof the support that the alliance is giving to Ukraine at this moment.",

They were not focused on the President's public demeanor or any of what they called noise from Democrats in the party suggesting that he would step aside. I spoke with a senior adviser to the President last night who said that there was zero chance that the President makes any personnel changes within the White House or atop the campaign after the debate debacle and what has happened since then. And that there was zero chance that he would reconsider his position to run again, saying that he truly believes that he is the only one who can beat Donald Trump. It is not an act. But this person also told me that the president's own family could be the ones to persuade him otherwise, if not other members of the party, saying that Jill and Valerie(ph) won't let him go down in flames in this adviser's words, if the polls spell a really bad outcome for the President to protect his legacy, that they would encourage him to do the same thing that other members of the party that you just cited are doing. But it doesn't seem that we're at that point today. The President is still on the world stage rallying world leaders and hailing the expansion and the strengthening of NATO. Of course, we wouldn't expect him to do any, otherwise the planning for this event, the groundwork was laid months ago. So, certainly, this is not the backdrop that his White House or world leaders envisioned having when they came to town for this high stakes discussion about geopolitical stability.

But a senior NATO official has toldme of a six- to nine-months' effort by Russia to sabotage NATO weapons supplies into Ukraine. A fair bit of it going right down these tracks. Now, they described it as something that is against, at times, the point of production, against those making the decisions, against the storage of weapons or even their actual delivery, saying the operation has been bold. WALSH (voice-over):  It too is something in the shadows with a huge potential for escalation. This is the moment, first broadcast here, a vast saboteur operation in Poland gave itself away. Caught on camera is Maxim, a 24-year-old Ukrainian living here, recruited online by Russian agents, who first just asked him to daub anti-war graffiti, filmed buying a lot of energy drinks, a move that led Polish agents to arrest him and 15 others because he dropped a receipt from here at a crime scene. His Russian handler, Andrzej, had begun asking for much more, positioning cameras, some here overlooking these tracks to Ukraine; others, where Poland trained Ukrainian troops and for Maxim to commit arson. In all, it got him six years in jail.",

We could not record, so an actor is voicing his words. MAXIM, UKRAINIAN RECRUITED BY RUSSIAN AGENT (voice-over):  It was easy money. I needed money badly. I didn't think any of it could cause any harm. It seemed so insignificant. When Andrzej told me to install cameras where Poles were training Ukrainian soldiers, that's when I knew it could be serious. It made me feel uneasy. That was when I decided I'd quit. But I never got a chance. I got arrested the next day. WALSH (voice-over):  Put together, suspected Russian sabotage is quite widespread, with arson around Poland at an ammo depot and even a shopping center. Concerns voiced over a fire at a key Berlin metals factory. Czech officials have pointed at Russia over railway hacking. France arrested a pro-Russian separatist plotting to blow up a Paris hardware store. And last month, intelligence chiefs warned, on a Swedish island close to Russia, there was an increased risk of sabotage of weapons bound for Ukraine. But it gets fiercer here, right next to Russia, in Estonia. Russia's appetite to disrupt led them, at this tense border crossing one May night, to sneak out in these thermal camera images and remove the buoys marking where Estonia ends and Russia begins, literally removing the border. Tank traps and razor wires speak of how bad it has got. Estonian GPS signals have been jammed. In the skies above, Russians film us filming them.",

Isa, though, as you can see, fans piling into the stadium now. The white of England and those orange of Poland. And if you go into -- and as it has been all day in downtown Dortmund, it's basically been in what looks to be an extension of a new province of Holland. Some almost 90,000 Dutch fans have descended on Dortmund to support their team. There's no way that all of those fans are going to get in here. And there needs to be a 50/50 split for partiality -- or impartiality rather. It should be, as the atmosphere has been building in the city all day, an absolutely fantastic atmosphere inside. We'll wait to see who comes out on top, but it should be a fantastic game of football all the same. Both teams have rightful feelings to believe that they are the ones who will go all the way in this. England need to play perhaps a little quicker and a little more direct with their football and perhaps a little slicker and look, maybe not to go behind in games before trying to pull themselves back out of it. Holland, on the other hand, have often gone ahead in games and scored plenty of goals in this tournament. So, we should be in for something really special here, Isa.",
