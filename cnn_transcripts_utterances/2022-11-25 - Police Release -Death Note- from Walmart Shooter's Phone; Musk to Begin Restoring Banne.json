The note discusses God, the Holy Spirit, and how the author felt that his associates at work were mocking him. Here is one passage from that note. Quote, \"The associates gave me evil twisted grins, mocked me and celebrated my downfall the last day. That's why they suffer the same fate as me,\" end quote. And here's another quote from that note. Quote, \"I wish I could have saved everyone from myself. My God, forgive me for what I'm going to do,\" end quote. This note also discusses how the author wished his parents had paid closer to attention to what he called his social deficits and said that he felt like he was, quote, \"led by Satan.\" The note says the attack was not planned. Also CNN reached out to Walmart and asked whether the shooter, Andre Bing, had ever had any disciplinary measures taken against him, whether he was demoted, if any complaints had been made against him or if he ever complained about others. Walmart responded to all of those questions with this statement: Quote, \"There's nothing that can justify taking innocent lives. Our focus continues to be on the families who are grieving and supporting our associates through this difficult time.\" Boris, they're really not answering those questions. And we have to try to get at that, if we can, to figure out the motive.",

Amnesty begins next week.\" And then, in Latin, \"The voice of the people is the voice of God.\" Joining us how is CNN intelligence and security analyst, Bob Baer. Bob, thanks for joining us. We hope you're enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday. I'm curious to get your reaction to these accounts being reinstated. ROBERT BAER, CNN INTELLIGENCE &amp; SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Boris, I can tell you one thing, Putin will be all over Twitter if there's no regulations on this. Fake accounts, spoofed accounts, the rest of it, this is a great opportunity for him. And so when he's talking about the popular voice, Musk, he's really talking about Russian intelligence. The Russians are waiting for something like this. They need a propaganda campaign against the United States and against our support for Ukraine. And they're going to be all over Twitter.

There's a new study casting doubt on that rule of thumb.CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is with us. Elizabeth, how much water do people actually need to drink a day? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Boris, I know we hear that eight glasses a day all the time but there's actually no science to it. It's just kind of an adage that developed over time from who knows where. And the CDC says there's no specific recommendation for people, you know, how much water that they ought to be getting every day. So let's take a look at this new study. It was done -- it's an international study, 5,600 people. So the researchers gave these people water to drink that had isotopes that they could track, the researchers could track how much of the water their body was using. And the usage ranged from about four to 25 cups a day. That's how much their bodies were using. That's obviously a huge range. And that's why the CDC doesn't give a specific number. So the amount depended on the person's physical activity, their gender -- men seemed to use up more water than women -- climate, weight, all of those things really factored in. So if you're wondering, well, what do I do with this? If I don't know how much to drink, what do we do? And I'm going to get graphic here. Many experts say, look at your pee. That's what matters. Look at the color. That's going to tell you a lot. The Cleveland Clinic has a wonderful color chart I want to share with you. What they say, if your urine is the color of light pale straw, you're in good shape. You're hydrated. If it's kind of amber or honey, that's an indication that you may be dehydrated. Step up the water a bit. If it's like syrup colored or the color of brown ale, that is a sign that you're really dehydrated and may actually have liver disease or some other medical problem. Drink some more. If it doesn't change, go see your doctor -- Boris?",

People feel sleep deprived sometimes for a little bit.When you look at communities of color and you look at white people, everyone has experienced increased rates of sleep deprivation over the past 15 years or so. That's -- everybody knows that, right? Everybody knows that we're just not getting enough sleep. But communities of color, their sleep deprivation rates have been going up even higher than white people. And several reasons for this. There are reasons that have to do with where people in communities of color often live, the stress that they live under. All of those things can amount to sleep deprivation. And sleep deprivation has been linked to high blood pressure or heart disease. Both of those are things where people of color unfortunately have higher rates -- Boris?",
