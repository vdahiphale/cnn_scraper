We'll have new details about the attackersAnd Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will end months of speculation in just a few hours. He's set to announce he is running for president in a conversation with Elon Musk during a live Twitter event. Typhoon Mawar is roaring over Guam. It's described as a storm that'll be remembered for decades. The eye of the storm has just passed north of the U.S. territory, but its eye wall, the strongest part of the typhoon, is lashing the island with ferocious winds, torrential rain and a treacherous storm surge as well. Most of the island is in the dark. On Tuesday, the governor ordered the evacuation of low lying coastal areas. CNN's Anna Coren joins us live from Hong Kong. What information are you getting there, Anna?",

      "sentences": "Look, Max, the good news is that Typhoon Mawar is now moving away from Guam. Landfall didn't happen as expected, however, it passed over the northern tip of the U.S. territory, located in the western Pacific Ocean, home to about 150,000 people.As you say, the eye wall of the typhoon is hitting Guam. This is when the most intense winds and rain hit. The U.S. National Weather Service Guam reports maximum sustained winds of 140 miles an hour. That's about 225 kilometers an hour, packing obviously, you know, quite a punch. And they said that the weather service building was being hammered and that the doors and windows were rumbling and vibrating. They could hear the howling winds outside and things breaking. As you say, there was a virtual blackout across the island as most of the power grids went out. Only about 1,000 of the 52,000 customers had power. The Guam Memorial Hospital it's operating currently with generators. Mawar is no longer classified as super typhoon, Max, but that's not to say that it isn't causing significant damage, but it will be some time before we know the full extent of the destruction. The weather service held a press conference just a short time ago reporting that there will be a few more hours of heavy rains and strong winds, probably through to about midnight local time before conditions will start to ease. There was much talk earlier in the day of a risk of a triple threat. Torrential rain, you know, destructive winds, and a storm surge that could pose a major risk to life and property. Everyone on the island, including the U.S. military station there have been told to stay indoors and to ride this out. The weather service, you know, finished the press conference telling folks that this will no doubt be a scary night, but it will all be over very soon, Max.",

We'll have more as we get the details as it passes.Now, two days after a daring assault on Russia's Belgorod region, the Wagner chief is blaming Moscow for its inability to stop the cross border attacks. Yevgeny Prigozhin says Russian forces are not ready to defend their own territory from the group of anti-Putin Russians which claims it crossed the border from Ukraine and carried out the strikes. It comes as the Belgorod region in western Russia faces an ongoing threat. The governor says nine people were injured in drone strikes. Overnight, Prigozhin also claims his mercenaries will leave the eastern Ukrainian front line on Thursday. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins me now live from Kyiv.

We're learning that the senior general in charge of U.S. forces in the Middle East, Erik Kurilla, ordered his command to tweet that an al-Qaeda leader was targeted in the strike, despite not having confirmation of who had actually been killed. That's according to multiple defense officials. The Pentagon says a review is ongoing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: They are investigating the allegations of civilian casualties. So, you know, I think our record speaks for itself in terms of how seriously we take these. Very few countries around the world do that. The secretary has complete confidence that we will continue to abide by the policies that we put into place. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max. So, obviously, there are questions now about whether this strike that happened on May 3 that was carried out by CENTCOM forces actually killed a civilian instead of the senior al-Qaeda leader that Central Command had originally said was targeted. And we are learning now that that original tweet that was posted on May 3 by Central Command was actually ordered to be posted directly by the Central Command Commander, General Erik Kurilla.Now, this raises a lot of questions, obviously, about why this tweet was posted and why this information was made public, when, in fact, defense officials tell us they still did not know for a fact. They did not have a confirmation just yet that they had actually successfully targeted a senior al-Qaeda leader rather than someone else, or even a civilian. And defense officials acknowledged to us that at the moment when General Kurilla actually ordered that announcement to be made, defense officials were wary because they still expected it to take a few days in the least to be able to confirm the identity of who that U.S. airstrike actually killed. So we're learning now that the Pentagon only opened an investigation into whether or not this was a civilian casualty after questions were raised by The Washington Post and after the Post presented the Pentagon with information suggesting that this casualty may have actually been a civilian. And it took about 12 days before the Pentagon actually officially opened a review into whether the civilian casualty resulted from this airstrike. We are told, according to one defense official directly familiar with the situation, that Erik Kurilla, the commander of Central Command, was urged by his subordinates to not make that announcement about the senior al-Qaeda leader being targeted until they had more confirmation that that was actually the case. Now, two other defense officials said that that is not true, and they pushed back on that, saying that they did not hear any consternation voice by any of his subordinates. But look, the bottom line, Max, is that Central Command pushed to have this announcement made to the public that a senior al-Qaeda leader was targeted before they actually had all of the facts to back that up.

And with a looming deadline now less than eight days way, there's still no deal between President Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. That uncertainty is creating market jitters at home and overseas. You can see here, these are the latest U.S. numbers ahead of the open. They're, actually, they're down slightly, but they're not too bad. A judge in New York has set a date for Donald Trump's criminal trial related to hush money payments, and it could complicate the former president's run for the White House. The trial is set to begin in March of 2024, in the heart of the Republican presidential primary campaign season. As of now, polls show that Mr. Trump is the front runner in that race. He's pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is in Washington with more on that. How is it going to affect things then, do you think?",

It would put it right in the heart of the Republican Party's efforts to select their nominee for the presidency in 2024.So the way the calendar looks right now is that people will start going to the polls at the beginning of 2024 to vote in primaries and caucuses to select a nominee for the Republican Party. Trump is obviously the front runner for the Republicans right now. And Super Tuesday, the day where many, many states are making their selections is at the beginning of March. March 25, right now, is the date on the calendar for Donald Trump to go to trial in New York to fight these charges, dozens of charges related to a hush money scheme in the 2016 election and his business records. And so that really does mean that he's going to have to take time out not just to appear in court to face this trial as a criminal defendant, but he also is going to need to take time out during the campaign season very likely to prepare for this trial. Possibly consider whether he may want to testify in his own behalf. That takes time to prepare for some sort of testimony like that if he wanted to do it. And he also will need at that period of time to be consulting with his lawyers who will be arranging for his defense and preparing for trial. It is a laborious process to go to trial. And so it will be something that really does make days for Donald Trump where he cannot be on the stage speaking to his supporters from morning to night because he will have things to do related to this court case.",

Hours from now, he and Twitter owner Elon Musk will hold an event on Twitter Spaces, the site's audio platform, and DeSantis will officially kick off his campaign, according to his spokesperson.It'll be the first time a presidential run is announced on the platform and gives DeSantis exposure to the millions of active Twitter users, in particular, the dedicated fan base of Elon Musk. Of course, the unconventional announcement is also a clear poke at his chief rival in the Republican race, former president Donald Trump, who was a prolific tweeter before he was banned in 2021. Musk reiterated or reinstated, rather, his account last year. But Trump has been using his own social media site, Truth Social, since then. There's no one better to unpack this than CNN's Donie O'Sullivan joining us from New York. Donie, I mean, what do you know about what we can expect today with this announcement? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Max. I mean, I think it's going to be quite the spectacle. I guess that's the point of it. Look, Musk has been trying to lure more right-wing figures, conservative figures to the platform. We saw that Tucker Carlson, who's recently been fired from Fox News is now making his way, is going to have a show on Twitter. And so there has been a lot of competition in this space, in the kind of right-wing, conservative space in the U.S. to try and get people to sign up to social media networks. You know, Elon Musk has tried to sell Twitter as this idea of a bastion of free speech. Of course, not always the case if last week, for instance, in recent weeks, they conceded as to censorship requests from the Turkish government. And also, of course, we saw Musk suspend some journalists back before the holidays for tweeting about the location of his private jet. But putting all that to one side, he still claims it's a free speech platform. So for DeSantis, that's very unbrand for him, a governor who very much plays into the culture wars here in the U.S.",

I mean, it's -- Twitter is for active users of us like yourself, Max. It's become a different place recently. You know, the algorithms have certainly changed. I know from opening my app every day, I open it less than before, I must say, you know, there is kind of a lot more junk there. We also saw, you know, just this week the whole thing with Musk messing around with the blue check mark verification process that is kind of piling on to the -- to misinformation space we saw earlier this week. So called verified accounts that were posing as a news outlet posting a fake AI -- believed to be AI-generated image of an explosion at the Pentagon. This week, of course, that did not actually happen. So Twitter is becoming, I would say, a bit of a messy place. He is certainly trying to, I think, lure a lot of conservative right-wing figures there. We also heard yesterday that The Daily Wire, which is a kind of big conservative online network here is moving onto Twitter as well. And look, I would just say, finally, that, you know, I think a lot of folks are looking at this as DeSantis is trying to bypass the mainstream media -- so called mainstream media, by going directly to Twitter. But also within the kind of right-wing, conservative online space, there's a lot of competition. Because there's, you know -- because there has been so much perceived censorship of right-wing figures in the U.S., we've seen new platforms pop up like Trump's Truth Social, like Parler, and like the video app, the video platform Rumble, which has signed exclusive deals with some pretty prominent figures here. So there's a lot of infighting and incompetent in that space. And Musk certainly seems to be dipping his toe on it.",
