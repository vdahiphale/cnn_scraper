New video into CNN showing heavy damage to the Kerch Bridge. This is Russia's artery that links to occupied Crimea. And you can see giant holes. You can see the twisted metal here along a portion of the nearly-12-mile-long span. And there appears to be significant damage to one of the bridge's road spans, though Russia says traffic on a parallel rail bridge does continue to operate, two strikes reportedly carried out before dawn this morning. A source in Ukraine's security service telling CNN this was an attack, it was a joint operation with Ukraine's navy. Russia claiming that two people were killed here. And this is a bridge, mind you, that was built after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea back in 2015. It's a supply line that is vital for Russia, particularly in Southern Ukraine. In the meantime, the White House is urging Russia to immediately reverse course after the Kremlin announced today that it would terminate its deal that allows Ukraine to export its grain. The Biden administration says Russia pulling out of the grain deal will -- quote -- \"worsen food security,\" that it will harm millions of vulnerable people around the world. The impact of the global -- on the global food market could be devastating here, the European Commission saying that Ukraine accounts for 10 percent of the world's wheat market, 15 percent of the corn market, 13 percent of the barley market, and it's also a key player in the sunflower oil industry. CNN senior national security correspondent Alex Marquardt is live for us in Odessa, Ukraine, in the south. So, Alex, let's start with this attack not too far from you on the Kerch Bridge.

WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  The bridge is mainly a target -- the first answer is that -- exactly what you described. That is, it is the way that the Russians are getting military equipment into Crimea, and then into Southern Ukraine. So this is clearly a military target. This is a supply line. This is weapons. This is soldiers, ammunition. That's the first reason. The second reason, you have also described, this is a symbolic connection, which the Ukrainians hate, between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia, so they were glad to take this out.",

The reading was 157.9 degrees. So, the surface is going to be very dangerous for everybody, especially children and pets.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  This is the Canadian wildfire season that just won't quit. The season started early. It will likely end later. There have been wildfires burning in Canada literally from one end of the country to the other. And while there has been some rain, it has done very little to dampen these large, incredible, record-breaking fires. I mean, think about it, 10 million hectares -- that's nearly 25 million acres, a land area the size of Ohio -- has already burned, and the season is little more than halfway done. As Canadian officials put it to me, look, even if it does rain, it is little more than a drop in an empty bucket. It is for that reason that many tell me this is more than one country can handle. There are in fact firefighters here from all over the world and, principally, American firefighters here. I want you to listen now to the incident commander here from America Southwest talking about why many people in North America will continue to get air quality alerts for some time to come. Listen.

The Florida Bay there literally has the temperature of a Jacuzzi, of a hot tub, which is hugely stressful on all the sea life, for the people who depend on that industry, as well as just a livable ecosystem down there. But it's too warm for tropical fish in Florida. It's too warm for trout in the streams of Montana. It's too warm for millions of species that are literally now moving, as to try to escape this heat, not the least of which, of course, humanity now. And we saw strange records before. It's interesting. Vegas hit that record today. Portland hit it last summer, when that big heat dome settled on the Pacific Northwest, these freakish occurrences where they're happening in odd spots around the globe. Now, this summer, we're starting to see how long these things can last, now that El Nino is here. Last year, last couple of years, we were actually -- we were benefiting from a natural sort of air conditioning called La Nina. That was replaced with a new heating system known as El Nino. That combined with all that pent-up energy due to 150 years of burning fossil fuels. And it's only going to get hotter the more of those we burn. That's really -- the problem is very -- the problem is very basic. Solving it is hugely complicated.
