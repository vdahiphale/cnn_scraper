And they found that those who maintained that muscle strength had better heart health outcomes after a heart attack. So, this just shows the importance of exercise and maintaining muscle strength as you age.And what the researchers did, they looked at the data on more than 900 heart attack patients between the ages of 57 and 74, and again, they measured quadricep muscle strength. And they found that the incidence rate of heart failure among hearth attack patients who had low muscle strength in their quads was much higher than those who have high muscle strength, so much so, that high quadricep strength was associated with a 41 percent lower risk of developing heart failure after a heart attack. But the take away here, Kate, is that overall, the importance of maintaining that muscle strength can lead to better outcomes while recovering from a heart attack. And the researchers say that this might be evidence to support doing cardiac rehabilitation and strength training during that recovery process, Kate. BOLDUAN:  That is really -- I think that is really fascinating, this connection, this correlation however the -- specific way to say it. Thanks for bringing it to us, Jacqueline. John.",

And now, as of this weekend, it's no longer going to sell new home insurance.So, the company is citing three main factors here. One, the skyrocketing cost of rebuilding when disaster strikes. Two, the fact that in California, disaster has been striking a lot more often, largely because of the state's wildfire problem. And then re- insurance, which is basically insurance for insurers. It has become harder to come by in California because of those first two issues, inflation and wildfire. Now, the company says that they basically had no choice here in order to boost their financial results that they felt like they needed to take a step back in California. Now, the inflation issue, of course, that is not a problem specific to California. That is a national issue, if not a global one. It's really the catastrophe risk that is specific to California. The governor's office there says that the state has averaged 7,000 wildfires per year over the last five years. And California -- in California, those wildfires have consumed more than 2 million acres per year, stunning figures. And scientists, they blame the climate crisis for this issue. If you look at the worst wildfires in California history, three of them have occurred in just the last six years, John. So, no surprise to see State Farm pulling back.",

Party leaders, both Republican and Democratic Party leaders, attempting to convince their members to back this new debt limit deal.

The plan would suspend the debt for about a year and half, through January 2025, this pushes off any kind of debate about this until after the presidential election.

There are a number of members who have already said that they will not back this proposal because it does not cut spending at the levels that they wanted it to. It doesn't reflect the same agreement that was passed out of the house with just Republican votes. But that is OK. The speaker can still move this bill through with a coalition of moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans. In fact, just a few minutes ago, Kevin McCarthy arrived on the Hill, our colleague, Morgan Rimmer, asked him if he was concerned about losing that conservative support. He argued, he does not operate under hypothetical, that he is not worried about it. Asked if he was concerned at all about a critical vote tomorrow in the house rules committee where there are a number of conservatives voicing concern. He said, nope. He's not concerned. So, that gives you a sense of where things are. We expect that this could pass the House as soon as Wednesday, then it goes through the U.S. Senate, that is where things could take a little bit of time if anyone member voices objections, they can really slow down the process, pushing us closer to that June 5th deadline.
