U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Italy from the Middle East, where his latest diplomatic push failed to secure a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Blinken left the region frustrated over numerous Hamas changes to the proposal, and he questioned whether Hamas is proceeding in good faith. But he said work would continue to try to bridge the gaps between the two sides. CNN's Oren Liebermann joins us now from Tel Aviv. And Blinken seems to be very much putting the ball in Hamas's court at this point.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wasn't looking for a breakthrough while he was here. He wasn't in the region all that long, several days. But he was clearly trying to lay the groundwork for an area to move forward. And the question is, how large is that area now, if it even exists, or has this fallen apart where it has so many times before in the details?Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when he spoke here as he moved through the region, Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Qatar, made it clear that from the U.S. perspective, the ball is in Hamas's court. Israel is on board with the ceasefire proposal and the hostage deal on the table. And now it's a question of getting Hamas to agree. He openly questioned whether Hamas was negotiating in good faith, saying they had shifted positions to which they'd already agreed to. Now, he did say in the response they finally gave 12 days after President Joe Biden publicly backed a proposal, there were numerous changes, in his words. Some were workable, some are not. And it's that some are workable that gives a window here to try to move forward, to try to get to some agreement. And he and his Qatari counterpart said they would work to try to bridge those gaps and make this happen. Israel, however, viewed Hamas's response as a rejection of the ceasefire proposal on the table. Meanwhile, in an updated response from Hamas just a short time ago, they said they had shown the necessary positivity to move forward with negotiations and with the process here, and instead said Blinken should put pressure on Israel, pointing out that Israel's leaders have not publicly stated and openly stated their commitment to the ceasefire proposal that's on the table. If you look at the situation, it looks like this process may have once again fallen apart, even though this time, at least in theory, it has backing from the U.N. Security Council resolution that passed with 14 in favor, and only, if I'm not mistaken, Russia abstaining. The hope was that that sort of international backing would help get this over the line, and yet this falters on the point where it has many times before, and it's that Israel wants to see the war continue, its ability to continue its campaign in Gaza, whereas Hamas wants to see a ceasefire proposal that brings a permanent end to the fighting, and that is a gap that nobody has been able to bridge yet.",

So this is essentially a dispute between the executive branch and the legislative branch. And ultimately, if this gets resolved, it would have to be by the courts to determine whether Congress has the right to that audio. And if this plays out in the courts, this could take months and months and months to resolve, certainly after the November election. So ultimately, that's how it could play out.

Although Trump won't be entering the U.S. Capitol building, this will mark his first appearance on The Hill since the January 6th insurrection more than three years ago. And it'll be his first meeting with top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, who he's butted heads within the past.But other Senate Republicans who have been critical of Trump, such as Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, either said they wouldn't attend his meeting or wouldn't commit to being there. Now, the former special prosecutor in the Georgia 2020 election subversion case says he believes Trump will absolutely be put on trial, even if he wins the White House. Right now, the case remains indefinitely postponed after a Senate appeals court agreed to take up the defendant's push to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. She's accused of having an improper relationship with former special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who has since resigned from the case. The appeals court's pause makes it highly unlikely that a trial would happen before the November presidential election. Wade spoke to CNN's Kaitlan Collins about the case and what it would mean to potentially prosecute a sitting president. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is accusing House Republicans of turning their congressional authority into a partisan weapon. It comes after they held him in contempt of Congress for not releasing audio from interviews with President Joe Biden during the classified documents investigation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Italy for the G7 summit after his latest diplomatic push failed to secure a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. He's expressed frustration over numerous changes Hamas has made to the proposal, and he questioned whether Hamas is proceeding in good faith. U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady as expected on Wednesday. The big news is their new projections for rates cuts later this year, or rather the lack thereof. Back in March, officials had been expecting three cuts in 2024. Now the median outlook is for just one cut, with four officials predicting no cuts at all.
