The only way that they can move onto the next round is with a win. For Iran there's more leeway. As a victory or a draw could help them advance. But the Iranians under heavy pressure politically. According to a security source the players have been warned if they protest their government or decline to sing the national anthem, their families could face imprisonment or even torture. To add to the controversy, the U.S. Soccer Federation upset Iran after posting a doctored image of its flag in support of the Iranian protesters without the emblem of the regime.

You'll remember Elnaz Rekabi, the rock climber who competed without her hijab. Now it seems the Iranian national football team is no exception to that pressure. They didn't sing the national anthem at that first opening game but they did sing the national anthem at their second game. And it does appear now that they have been facing pressure and threats from the Iranian regime.We are learning from a source working closely on the security of the games that the Iranian regime has placed threats, not only on the players themselves but also on their family members and loved ones threatening them with potential imprisonment and violence and even torture if they fail to sing the national anthem ahead of today's game against the USA or if they take part in any other form of protest at this match. And according to this source, the players themselves were called into a meeting with representatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as the head coach as well being called into a meeting. Essentially telling them that if they don't behave in the way that the regime expects them to ahead of this game and they will face repercussions and their loved ones and family members back home will face repercussions. And of course, we've also learned from this source that the players themselves are facing pretty strict restrictions. They aren't being allowed to speak to anyone outside of their squad -- according to the source. And there is apparently an increased presence of the Iranian security forces in terms of their monitoring of the team itself as they take part in the World Cup. So, clearly a lot of pressure now mounting on the team.",

Authorities are erecting barriers in Urumqi Road which is the site of a major protest over the weekend. And we've also learned that protesters are being rounded up. In fact, one protester told CNN that Shanghai police after Saturday's protest detained 80 to 110 protesters and also took the biometric details including their retina scans, fingerprints, photographs as well. And it's unclear how many remain in detention. On Monday no new protests or new signs of protests in Shanghai and in Beijing but protests do continue.In fact, there was a significant one in Hangzhou last night, Monday night. Where there were scenes a very tense confrontations between protestors and police at a shopping center there in Hangzhou. I want to show you a map. And this is a map of verified COVID-related protests across China. And according to this map that we've put together, we have verified 20 COVID related protests in 15 cities from Beijing to Shanghai to Guangzhou to Urumqi to Nanjing and Wuhan and elsewhere. There have also been protests -- very rare ones -- here in Hong Kong. Last night there was a vigil in the central business district and some protesters were seen holding those blank sheets of paper, a symbol of censorship which has also become a symbol of the protest movement. Because of these protests there is so much pressure on China to find a way out of its zero-COVID policy and the experts I'm talking to say that requires boosting China's medical capacity. Changing its medical or COVID-19 messaging as well as boosting its vaccination rate especially among the elderly. And we have just learned this afternoon China's national health commission has announced plans to boost the vaccination rate among the elderly in China. According to a spokesperson of the national health commission, they also said that lockdowns should be lifted, quote, as quickly as possible to reduce inconvenience for the people. A very significant reaction to these protests. Back to you.",

There is no end here. And that was the frustration living under the lockdown and talking to my neighbors who were local Shanghainese who had with there for generations and who had felt at this point in their lives they had nowhere to go and no one to voice their concern to.You go to places like Schengen, right, where we have traveled to. It is one of the most heavily surveilled places on this planet arguably, certainly within China. And you start to see now traces across China, particularly in Shanghai where we were, one of the most cosmopolitan and the financial hub of China, the city that really had gravitated in getting a lot of attention internationally for folks who saw this as perhaps the window to the West, and they started building that same infrastructure. We started to see it in front of our own homes. We started to see the walls go up, the cameras go into place. And they would corral you through certain areas where conveniently those cameras were pointing on your face. So, they start to build that same infrastructure in the name of COVID security across China. I really believe that COVID is not a huge factor in all of this. I think what we're looking at is an ideology at its core to part of the party's effort to try to purify -- certainly from Xi Jinping's perspective. And remember, he's at the center of the party which is at the core of human life within China as they see it. And so, this seems to be an effort to really maintain control over a massive population. We started to see that with the big brother data that they were implementing there, have the QR codes which at first seemed effective and ultimately you begin to feel that they were tracking you. And now just get into a restaurant in places, just to go into any sort of public space you need to scan in. So, not only are they able to acknowledge that in their words, that you're not a close contact or you don't potentially have the virus but also, they know exactly where you've been if they want to trace from one point onward. And they're able to do that with these protesters by the way. They're going to be able to track them all down individually. So, it's not going to be that tough. One thing that has also worth noting -- I was talking to some friends on the ground. And they said they are stopping people randomly in cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou and Beijing and they're asking to see their phone. They're going through their camera rolls. Imagine a cop here doing that and having to hand over your photo album, things being deleted, apps being deleted, especially those that are WhatsApp and Signal, things that might have connection to outside of China. It's scary. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Bianca. A very multi-faceted setup here when it comes to the severe weather potential later on Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night. And you'll notice around the western U.S. an entirely different weather pattern impacting a lot of folks across that region where parts of 13 states dealing with winter weather alerts and as much as 2 feet of fresh snow possible across some of these high elevations. And even across the lower lying areas, some major cities like Portland, like Seattle seeing some unusual snowfall for the month of late November into early December where climatologically the sort of weather patterns develop across this region in late December into early January.So, you notice temps into the 30s for multiple days here. We're at 49 degrees which is what is considered normal. So, we'll watch for additional rounds of snow here and then also the severe weather threat across the southern United States. But as that front really quickly pushes across portions of eastern Texas, into western Louisiana as early as say, 5, 6 p.m. Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday evening, it really sparks up a round of severe weather. The elements are in place, Gulf moisture coming in from the South, cool dry air coming in from the north. And put it together and you've got the clash of air mass here that will in part be responsible for the severe weather outbreak that we expect Tuesday afternoon, and especially late Tuesday -- maybe into Tuesday night -- and that's the concern. Any time you see a pattern like this where the storms begin to develop, this time of year, keep in mind, the sun will begin to set between 5 and 6 p.m. across this region. So, as the system migrates off towards the east, you get the storms that develop and possibly create long track tornadoes into the overnight hours. Those are often times twice as likely to be fatal than ones during the daytime hours for obvious reasons. It is harder to get the alerts out to folks in those hours. But notice the threat here for damaging winds in place there. Some of these wind gusts could be 50 plus miles per hour into the afternoon and evening hours. And then the larger threat being four large hail and also some large tornadoes. Again, possibility for what is called long track tornadoes. These storms that produce tornadoes that could stay on the ground for many, many hours in some cases. And in that setup develop and lead to a lot of damage and a lot of fatalities as well. Notice that threat for tornadoes has kind of shifted farther towards the south where the highest risks include the city of Jackson. Where this time yesterday the highest risks extend a little farther towards the north and included places such as Memphis. So, within this area, as much as 10 to 15 percent probability that we'll see at least a few strong tornadoes within 25 miles of a point. The other threat across the region will be large hail potential. As much as 2 inches or larger in diameter with the storms that'll develop into the afternoon hours. And Bianca, any time you look at storms that produce almost 2 inch or greater hail stones, we're talking golf ball size hail, possibly larger than that with these storms as we go into the afternoon, overnight hours. So, certainly, a story we'll monitor here on CNN.",

CNN's Dianne Gallagher has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Just seven days to go before the runoff election here in Georgia between Senator Raphael Warnock and his Republican opponent Herschel Walker. Now Monday was the first statewide mandatory day of a five-day early voting period in the state of Georgia. And according to the Secretary of State's office, we're looking at potentially record-breaking numbers for that day. Now get out the vote event just wrapping up here in Atlanta for the incumbent senator. Democrat Raphael Warnock with artist Dave Matthews trying to go increase enthusiasm because of this abbreviated four week period. This is something we expect to see quite a bit of over the coming days here. One person we do not think we're going to see here in the state of Georgia, that's the former President Donald Trump. A person close to Walker tells CNN that the former president not going to come and rally for the senate candidate here in the state of Georgia. Instead, he'll hold a tele-rally. There are plenty of Republicans who are breathing a sigh of relief about that here in the peach state though. Many of them still blame President Trump for their double losses in the January 2021 runoff elections that saw Senator Warnock be elected into the Senate for the first time that abbreviated finishing out a term there. We will see former President Barack Obama later this week rallying support for Senator Warnock as well. Now again, people will be early voting for the duration of this week and then of course election day on Tuesday in this very, very closely watched election. Dianne Gallagher, CNN, back to you.
