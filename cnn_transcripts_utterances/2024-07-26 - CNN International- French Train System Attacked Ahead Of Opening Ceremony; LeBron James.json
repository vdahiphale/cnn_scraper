ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS MAYOR (Interpreted): I felt that the enthusiasm arrived a little before during the passage of the flame in Paris on July 14 and 15th. The Olympic flame was paraded in Paris, and there were people everywhere, children, elderly people, all social classes, everyone was really happy. And I said to myself that it's the magic of the games working. BELL (voice-over): The opening ceremony will still go ahead as planned tonight along the River Seine, despite the train attack and the threat of rain. Whether it will further dampen spirits could depend more on the weather than the turnout. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

For more on the games themselves, let's turn to CNN Sports Analyst Christine Brennan, who is ready there with her umbrella because we know that the weather in Paris is going to be somewhat miserable today leading up to the opening ceremony. So, I do want to ask you, Christine, just in terms of the amount of pressure on a host nation to deliver a world-class opening ceremony with a world-class performance, I mean, it really does set the tone and the tenor of the games, especially because this time is a little different because it's taking place outdoors. It's along the River Seine and it's city-wide. There is challenges with that, but also a real opportunity for Paris as well. CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST, &amp; SPORTS COLUMNIST, USA TODAY: That's right, Zain, and this is a very ambitious, the most ambitious opening ceremony in Olympic history. Paris, of course, hosted the games 100 years ago. We've never seen an opening ceremony not in a stadium that could be secured, a football stadium, a soccer stadium, 60,000, 80,000. So, already this was a complete departure, unprecedented. French President Emmanuel Macron, I was at an event on Monday with him, and he was talking about the open theatre that Paris has become. So, it has been celebrated and beloved, but here I stand with an umbrella because it started raining again, I'm about eight tenths of a mile from the Seine River here close to the Arc de Triomphe. The old adage, will it rain on their parade? I mean, you roll the dice, when you're the French and you decide to do something like this, kudos to them for doing it. The Paris organizers wanted this from the get go. They're following through. But, you are dealing with obviously Mother Nature and then the security risks. The perimeter is here. As I said, eight tenths of a mile. I have never seen a security perimeter, all the Super Bowls, men's and women's Final Fours in the United States and all the Olympics I've covered, saying where the perimeter has been this far away from the venue.",

To the point you were just making, the word twisties that she told us about three years ago in Tokyo, that's a word I don't think anyone knew what it meant in gymnastics terms, until Simone Biles told us, and then the sympathy and the outpouring of concern and support for Simone Biles three years ago, that was extraordinary. Also, she is the best-known survivor of the worst sex abuse scandal in sports history, the Larry Nassar story, of course, the hundreds of women, the gymnasts, who were abused by him, and she has spoken out time and again on behalf of survivors and fighting for them and speaking in front of Congress.So, this great athlete is also a great human being, and she is a fabulous representative of so many things that many young women and men have gone through. And I think that's why she is just so appealing. And oh, by the way, she probably will help the U.S. to win the team gold medal. She may well, of course, win the individual all- around gold medal, and she could win three more gold medals on the individual events. So, extraordinary athlete, and at 27-years-old, as Katie Ledecky is also 27, remarkable to see these top athletes who are going on longer than most athletes do in terms of the length of their career, and just being so good, and also such terrific role models for young people around the world.",

Senator, thank you so much for being with us. So, in your -- we're obviously going to talk politics in just a moment, but in your capacity as a member of the U.S. presidential delegation in Paris, I just want to get your thoughts on the news we got, we all woke up to in the U.S. this morning, about the coordinated arson attacks on the French railway system. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, it's gravely concerning saying there is always concern about safety and security at an event as prominent, as global as the Olympics. We did get a chance to talk with the head of the French Olympic Committee earlier today. My impression is that there were no injuries. There was no actual interruption of any significant Olympics-related event. But, it was a very concerning act of sabotage, and it impacted a number of the major high-speed rail lines coming into Paris. So, as we've gone to events in different venues today, it's been striking just how many police are out on the street, just how tight the security is here in Paris. I'm very much hoping that they will have a safe and enjoyable Olympic Games here in Paris.",

There have been many expressions of concern by members of Congress, by President Biden, by his senior leadership team, Secretary Blinken, National Security Advisor Sullivan, over months about the number and level of civilian casualties. This is nothing new. This is part of the ongoing conversation between the United States and our close ally Israel about the conduct of the war in Gaza, the urgency of securing the release of the hostages. Many of us, myself included, met with American hostage families just before Prime Minister Netanyahu's address. Two of my guests for his address to Congress were the parents of one of the American hostages.So, look, I do think that she was delivering that forcefully as a message. But, I think she reflects very widespread views, certainly among the Democratic Party, more broadly, I think, among Americans, that Israel seems to have accomplished the vast majority of its military goal in Gaza. In fact, the Prime Minister has recently said that major operations are winding down or nearly concluded. And I think, given how long this conflict has gone on and how many continue to be held hostage, there is a growing sense of urgency about achieving a ceasefire that could move forward the regional peace deal that President Biden has been championing.",

From Donald Trump, as you just heard from Alayna, it is finish the job. Get it done. Essentially, keep going, but just wrap this up quickly. The message from the Biden administration is essentially this war needs to end now. We heard Kamala Harris saying very forcefully yesterday that the ceasefire is needed right now, and she detailed at length the suffering that is going on among Palestinians in Gaza.The White House had intended to use these meetings with Netanyahu to push the ceasefire forward, to get Netanyahu to a point where he could agree to a ceasefire. We heard from U.S. officials that they believe that the ball is in Israel's court. I've heard from sources that the meeting is being planned for next week for the mediators to try to iron out some of the final details. But, it's clear that there are still specifics to be worked out. But now, what we're hearing from Israeli officials is they believe that what Harris said yesterday is problematic and could complicate these ceasefire negotiations. Now, in these remarks, after her meeting with Netanyahu, which were quite striking, because they were much more forceful than we have heard from President Biden or other members of the White House, she did start talking about this ironclad commitment to Israel's security. She made very clear that she is, as you said, Zain, in lockstep with the President when it comes to policy towards Israel. But, she spoke in much more emphatic and empathetic terms about the suffering of Palestinians. And then went on to say, this is why we need a ceasefire now.

And now we're hearing from an anonymous senior Israeli official, not only calling her comments problematic, but arguing that because of the sympathy that she showed in those remarks, that Hamas may interpret that as daylight between Israel and the United States, and that that could really throw a wrench into these ceasefire negotiations.So, I don't want to say that Harris's remarks upended things but they certainly added a new dimension to this conversation and to these negotiations that could be very interesting and well worth watching.

But look, we got to face the reality, because the opening ceremony, which kicks off in about three and a half hours, is so heavily weather dependent.So, I was actually on the ground in Paris a couple of weeks ago. We went and got an exclusive interview with some of the weather forecasters who are responsible for advising the International Olympic Committee on approaching severe weather, whether that's extreme heat or rainfall. So, what you're looking at on your TV screen is my time with the head of the Meteo-France sports division, and he showed me this little known device called a mobile weather radar. They brought that into Paris, set it up just on the outskirts of town to give street-level minute-by-minute weather forecasts of approaching rainstorms for the event venues, and also for the opening ceremony, considering that the ceremony is going to be held along a six-kilometer stretch along the River Seine, the first time it has not been held within an Olympic stadium. So, we are subject to the weather, and they've got to put all these contingency plans in place. So, their technology is really high tech. They've got all the safeguards out there. But now, it's just simply up to Mother Nature. If it rains too much, by the way, the river current could be too strong for the opening ceremony. And of course, the performers who need a dry stage may slip if it's raining too heavily. 15 millimeters, that's what we're calling for over the next six hours or so. That's about a half an inch of rain, not ideal. Looking at the current radar, guess what's coming. Yeah. We're going to rain on the parade near Coy. You can see a little bit of rain now approaching Paris and more moisture streaming in from the Atlantic Ocean. So, what this kind of equates to is at least the potential. But, it's looking more and more likely that light-to-moderate rain will begin right around the same time as the opening ceremony begins along the River Seine, continues overnight intermittently, and then builds through the day on Saturday once again. So, our official forecast does call for wet weather as we head into the next few hours, even into the overnight period. There is the 15 millimeters of rain or roughly a half an inch for Paris. It does dry out on Sunday. And then we need to start introducing the potential of heat for the athletes and the spectators by Monday and Tuesday of next week. So, weather and the Paris Olympics are completely intertwined. Zain.",

It is the fact that Barack and Michelle Obama, who are incredibly influential power players still within the Democratic Party, are going to be lending their own firepower to Harris on the campaign trail. You heard there in that phone call, they said that they were going to be doing everything they could to get her through the election and into the Oval Office, including stumping for her out on the trail.Now, this has been a carefully choreographed succession of endorsements by top Democratic leaders, as they throw their own political weight behind Harris and agree to do everything they can to help her with a very, very short clock until the convention for the party, which is in less than a month, and the election itself, which, as of Sunday, will be just 100 days away. The Harris campaign is undergoing what it is calling a weekend of action with more than 2,000 events around the country, including a handful today in key battleground states, where surrogates and elected officials there will be a championing the nascent Harris campaign, which, as of less than a week ago, was still the Biden campaign. There has been a good drumbeat of momentum for Vice President Harris in her new role atop the Democratic ticket. But, strategists say it's unclear how long this honeymoon will last, and the key will be whether she can keep that momentum going into the fall. Zain.",

I'll tell you, there is so much excitement in the Democratic Party right now. And frankly, we've dominated the conversation for a week. And I think the timing of these things, the way they have rolled out, has been tremendously, tremendously impactful.And right now, sitting here, we've got 40 million views on that video in six hours.

South Asian women also organized a call the other night, and they were also quite successful in getting dollars and numbers. People saying that they feel energized. And look, it's not entirely about identity because that's what Republicans are going to go for. They're already calling Harris the DEI pick. And that's fine. We don't want to get into the specifics of that. But, American women have particularly felt themselves seen.This is not a Clinton or an Obama or a Biden. This is somebody who is seen as having come up through the ranks and being the most experienced Vice President of our nation's history. And they're really giving her an honest look. So, I think center-right women and independent women are also sitting there thinking, I want to know more. And already, we learned a little bit more when Kamala Harris came out, I believe it was just yesterday, saying that she wants that ceasefire deal between Israel and Gaza in Gaza. So, there we go. We're seeing her start to take action, and that should scare Republicans, because this has all happened in a condensed period of time, which makes it especially hard to fight back on.",

And I will tell you that, easily, anybody is vulnerable to getting chewed up and spit out by the former President of the United States. He doesn't care what you think of him. He cares about what he is going to do to you. And that's a tough thing because a lot of the debate game is mental. It's that mental prep you need. Harris is up for it, I think. I think she has proven this entire week that she can change herself. I'm not saying she is a chameleon. I'm saying she has shown she can do this pivot quite well.I mean, even in miniscule moments, like changing her tone, it's clear she was trying to match the tone of her boss, Joe Biden, by appearing a little less energetic all these months and years, because what she has brought out now to the fore, Trump should be a little bit scared up. So, if I were advising Trump, which I'm not, I would say, don't debate her, because number one, they're going to try to, in debate prep, try to get Harris ready to debate on policy, which they should. And there is a lot being made of how Biden shouldn't have been so prepped going into that debate with Trump, that he was too prepped, and that it wasn't going to be about policy. It was going to be about style and fighting back, going mano a mano. But again, going to Harris, she has to divorce herself of the record of Biden. She has got to -- even though Bidenomics on paper has some positive points, Republicans are going to tie her to the feeling of the economy that Biden has created. Going beyond that, she is going to have to get mentally ready, but I do think she is up for it. I do think Donald Trump would be worse off if he met her this version, this week's version of Kamala Harris, he'd be worse off if he met her on.",
