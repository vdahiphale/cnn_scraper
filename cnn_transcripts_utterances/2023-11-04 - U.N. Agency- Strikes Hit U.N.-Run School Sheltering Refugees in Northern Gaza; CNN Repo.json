I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We're watching several new developments across the Middle East as Israel -- Israel rather pushes forward with its war against Hamas. We're seeing more airstrikes across Gaza today, with Israeli forces closing in on Gaza City. One explosion hit a U.N.-run school that is serving as a shelter for thousands of Palestinian refugees. The Hamas-run ministry of health says the blast killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Arab foreign ministers today in Jordan for a high-stakes summit, but while the Arab officials called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, Blinken says now is not the time.

Journalists embedded with the IDF in Gaza operate under the observation of Israeli commanders in the field, and are not permitted to move unaccompanied within the strip. As a condition to enter Gaza under IDF escort, outlets have to submit all materials and footage to the Israeli military for review prior to publication.

I don't know if you're able to turn the video around, but we were recording just now, Ken's panning the camera over to take a look at the horizon. But we were literally seeing red rain that we believe was coming from, there's a little bit of it coming down again. Looked like red rain, but it, but it is gunfire, we think, coming from Apache helicopter, or perhaps a couple of Apache helicopters, into the north, northern part of Gaza. At the same time, there's some more of it coming down now. The same time, there were rockets coming in from above, possibly aircraft. So it does appear to be an uptick in the fighting right where those, that, that gunfire is raining down. We can also hear the sound of -- the sound of heavy machine gun fire in that area. But it just is an indication of how volatile the fight here still is. And even while that story was running, it was running for seven minutes, during that time, that was happening in Gaza, and more rockets came out. Again, we had to run for cover again, Fred.

This while donors are calling for the university's president to resign after she allowed a Palestinian literary festival to be held on campus in September, prior to the terror attacks by Hamas against Israel. Well, CNN's Danny Freeman is on the University of Pennsylvania campus, where Penn and Cornell football teams are playing each other today. And while it's football that brings them together today, both campuses are also trying to figure out how to deal with growing discord stemming from the Israel-Hamas conflict, Danny. So what is the mood today among the students, the fans, everyone there?",

And then, like is that, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, they're certainly not immune. Cornell canceled classes on Friday because of that student making those antisemitic threats. He was ultimately arrested. And then here, as you said, the University of Pennsylvania leaders here have been facing a backlash for not doing enough to fight back against antisemitism.

The last time there was a war in 2006, more than 1,100 Lebanese were killed, 158 Israelis. The war turned into a bit of a stalemate, with neither side really winning. But, right now, as you know, Fred, Lebanon is suffering its worst economic crisis in its history. The economy is it completely in shambles. If there was another war, the 2006 were created billions of dollars of damage to Lebanon, and, you know, Hezbollah is not only just a military movement, it's also a political party with a substantial presence in the Lebanese parliament, and you have to take into account the views of ordinary Lebanese people, who probably are not eager to have another very damaging war on their territory.",

And there were some pretty strong analogies between these two kind of conflicts, and you're seeing here these armored bulldozers, which are absolutely key to kind of what Israel is trying to do in Gaza.But you have to clear every house, and that's a very, you know, soldier intensive effort, and it's also very costly, both in terms of soldiers lives, and also civilians lives, and you can also guarantee that, at the end of this, Gaza may well have 90 percent of its buildings either damaged or destroyed based on other kinds of urban warfare that we've seen in the past.",

In addition, though, there are other counts that haven't been resolved by summary judgment that include fraud, and the prosecutors are trying to establish that as well.So there's damages, plus liability in other parts of the case, and the prosecutors are going to go after Donald Trump to say, what did you know about this, and what was your involvement in this. He may take the Fifth Amendment. He did that in the deposition.
