Now, he spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday afternoon one again about the ongoing conflict. And there are new concerns being raised now that Israel's war to take out Hamas could spread into a wider regional conflict. I want to play for you what U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told ABC yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We're concerned about potential escalation. In fact, what we're seeing is a -- is the prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region. And because of that, we're going to do what's necessary to make sure that our troops are in a right -- a good position, they're protected, and that we have the ability to respond. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, you know, Israel is going to do what it does in terms of the military action. You want to get the hostages out if possible. And you are trying to figure out, you know, how do you use military action, you know, to set the stage for whatever you want to achieve the day after the conflict ends.You know, and in some cases, these are objectives in conflict. You know, and that is one of the reasons why, you know, trying to figure out what you can do on the hostage front before you go into a ground incursion into Gaza, and you come into, you know, conflict with Hamas more directly.",

How does Israel get this right or how challenging is it while trying to dismantle Hamas who has controlled government in Gaza now, and all of the information flowing out of Gaza for 17 years.",

And in terms of trying to transform the Middle East, you know, and Southeast Asia and -- or South Asia in terms of Afghanistan and Iraq, you know, we struggled with the political dimension. I think this is where, I think, the United States is asking Israel some tough questions, you know, as to how you link up a military strategy and a political strategy.Because at the end of the day, if you are trying to change how Gaza is governed and Gaza's relationship with Israel, that is largely a political challenge far more than a military challenge. And so, that's where public opinion, you know, matters profoundly. And right now, the challenge for Israel is that the Palestinian people who have a stake in what happens down the road, you know, they see themselves being at war with Israel in addition to Hamas seeing itself as being at war with Israel. But I think, you know, part of this is how do you use military action? How do you supply humanitarian assistance? How do you build or grow public opinion to support whatever you want to achieve once the military conflict is over. That is Israel's challenge the United States is certainly in a position to help.",

As a prosecutor, the federal way to do this -- and remember, we're now talking about Georgia State prosecutors, we'll have to see what DOJ does. The federal way is, you can only cooperate if you give up everything, if you admit to all the crimes you were involved in.And the question I have here is -- let's remember, Fani Willis charged Sidney Powell with RICO, but didn't make her plead to RICO. She let her plead to these low-level misdemeanors. So, is she all the way in, that we have to watch for.",

There is this new reporting in \"The New York times\". First of all, it's extensive about how hard Pratt worked to get access to Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which is interesting of itself. We're talking about pay for access, I mean, it really does seem like this guy reportedly was doing that. But he also talked allegedly about conversations that Trump had with him about talks that Trump had with world leaders when he was president. How does that fit into -- I imagine, it would be the classified documents case against Trump, how does that fit and does this make Pratt an interesting witness?",

We know he has some of the statements from this Pratt individual. The way I would use it as a prosecutor is it shows knowledge. It shows intent and motive. It shows, why is Donald Trump interested in taking these classified documents? What's his purpose? I would argue, he loves having this stuff. He deploys it after his president however it's helpful for him personally. Building personal relationships. Perhaps building business relationships. All of it illegal and proper.So, it sort of explains the why of this all. Why would he have taken the classified documents, I argue? It's part of the broader pattern.
