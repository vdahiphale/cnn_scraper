Israel's prime minister making the case for spitting Hamas out like ISIS, showing unspeakable pictures of a baby and children slaughtered.Plus, rushing to fight militants, hand to hand with a pistol. A retired Israeli general tells us what he witnessed. You'll hear his incredible story of taking on the attackers. And deception overdrive. Rockets said to be fired by Hamas actually footage from a video game. Israeli jets bombing Gaza actually video from fireworks in Algeria. We fact-checked the viral videos that are masquerading as facts. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a special addition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett live in Tel Aviv tonight. And we begin with the breaking news, ready to invade. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unleashed a large scale strikes on Gaza. Even over the past 90 minutes, we've heard more than 15, 16 explosions there. At this hour, we are told more than 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up, and are at or heading to the Gaza border. We can see that influx today. Netanyahu making his case for retaliation to the world, meantime releasing horrific new images of children, of a baby. Now, CNN has decided to only show one of these images. And we are only doing one because they are horrific, but we want to warn you this is very graphic, we do believe that it is important to if you choose to take a look at it, that you do that you see what took place inside Israel up and down that Gaza border, now seven days ago. And this one image that we are going to show you, it is a tiny body, bullet holes wriggling the onesie. The other photos, I can tell you also show tiny mangled, bodies, one is completely charred. They are horrific. And it is why Netanyahu is going after Hamas with fury. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Part of Israel's massive military buildup since Hamas's attack Saturday. Many of the 300,000 reservists called up already deployed ahead of a highly anticipated ground offensive, into Gaza. These are exactly the same gun positions the Israeli defense forces used in their last major confrontation with the Hamas back in 2021. The question now, will this confrontation be different? Will Israel actually be able to crush Hamas as the prime minister says he wants to do? The military offensives (INAUDIBLE) before and won't be easy now.

In a sense, it's essentially closed off, but the Red Cross is warning that Gaza's hospitals risk turning into morgues to use their exact words. The entire territory is running out of fuel, the U.N. says that food and water supplies are running low as well, and obviously, that's going to continue because when we say this is getting worse, it is. Israel has said it will not allow food and fuel into Gaza until the 150 hostages are returned, and there is no word of them tonight, except that they are in Gaza. The IDF spokesman tells us that they are likely underground, scattered locations. And uncertainty about their faith causing Israeli forces to pause a full-on assault, but not the strikes that you hear, of course, happening where Nic is this evening. We've heard nearly more than a dozen now, just joining from Gaza where we are in Tel Aviv. I counted about 16, 17 sort of lost count, to be honest with you. Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on Earth. So, every one of those things that we hear is life and death for someone a few miles away. Gaza has nearly 2 million people living in 88 square mile piece of land and Matthew Chance is here with me tonight. Matthew, it's a place you know incredibly well. You've covered this region for many years, from various places.

We have to investigate it. We have to learn very seriousness. By the way, none of the scenarios, where the idea that Hamas formed from terror organization would act as an army. What we think today is that Iran is behind it. Their plan is copy and paste of Hezbollah. They have a similar plan in the north and take over, exactly the same thing we have seen here. But then again, we should guess or learn or take under serious assumption such things could have happened. And we didn't. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

GILAD ERDAN, ISRAEL'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  I don't think it is so important to discuss thoroughly whether they are exactly, exactly like Daesh or more similar to the Nazis. The fact is their charter calls for the total annihilation of the Jewish people and the state of Israel, that they should butcher every Jew that they encounter. For many years, we've seen them preparing , turning the whole Gaza Strip into a war machine. They tried many ways, indiscriminately to fire thousands of rockets and missiles at our towns and cities. They failed only because we developed defensive, you know, missile system to protect and defend our children. So, then they dug terror tunnels into to try to infiltrate our territory and then we built the underground wall. So now, unfortunately, sadly and tragically, they succeeded and they did what they wanted to do which means to butcher, to slaughter every civilian that they saw. And you described it, I don't intend to repeat the terrible atrocities that were committed. So, that's why we believe that they should be treated exactly like Daesh.

But now, the Biden administration has apparently agreed with so many others that $6 billion could be fungible. If the Iranians get the $6 billion through Qatar, through this program, they could free up $6 billion that they have to use for food and medicine in other areas and free it up to do other things.And I think the Biden administration now realizes that is a mistake. Given what they see as Iran's complicity in this Hamas attack on Israel, they say there is no direct evidence that -- there are no compelling evidence that Iran was directly involved with Hamas in this war, but they think over the years, the support that Iran has given Hamas and Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations makes them complicit in this, and so, they don't want to be seen as providing any money for whatever purpose to Iran right now.
