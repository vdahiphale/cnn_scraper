Close races in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Nevada could alter the balance of power. Voters know this and are motivated. More than 9.2 million early and absentee ballots have already been cast. That's on par with the midterms of 2018 which had the highest early voter turnout in recent history for midterm elections. And these are the main issues driving voters to the polls. According to a recent survey by Monmouth University, Americans want the federal government to address inflation and unemployment. Crime is also a top concern. Economic issues are getting a heavy play in Pennsylvania where the country's highest stakes Senate race is underway. Republican celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz faces off against Democrat John Fetterman on Tuesday during their one and only debate.

MEHMET OZ, REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATE NOMINEE FOR PENNSYLVANIA: I want to bring civility, balance, all of the things you want to see because you've been telling it to me on the campaign trail. And by doing that we can bring us together in a way that has not been done of late. Democrats, Republicans talking to each other.

The U.S. Justice Department is trying to break through Donald Trump's attempts to avoid scrutiny of his actions of the day of the Capitol riots. Sources tell CNN they're trying to get additional testimony from Trump. White House lawyers Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, as CNN's Evan Perez has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: The Justice Department is asking a federal judge to compel the top two lawyers from Donald Trump's White House to provide testimony to a grand jury about conversations with the former president. Former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy Patrick Philbin are among the most important witnesses for the Justice Department's criminal investigation looking into Trump's efforts to impede the transfer of power after the 2020 election. The two men pushed back against Trump's false vote fraud claims and legal wrangling that is playing out in a series of court fights, one that the Justice Department has been winning. In recent weeks the Justice Department won a judge's order to obtain new testimony from top advisers to former Vice President Mike Pence. Greg Jacob and Marc Short were compelled to answer questions to the grand jury which has opened the way for the Justice Department's criminal investigation to reach further into Trump's inner circle. All four men previously declined to answer at least some questions about the advice and the interactions with Trump when they testified in recent months. Trump lost the battle related to Jacob and Short before the Chief Judge at the U.S. District Court in Washington DC last month. Now the disputes are likely to spawn several more court fights that will be crucial for prosecutors as they work to bring criminal charges related to Trump's post criminal efforts.
