They are at the table today.We learned that the big bosses of the studios, they were not at the table, so really, it's just the negotiators now working through those final details before they can strike a deal and sources telling my colleague, Oliver Darcy, that it could happen by the end of the weekend. So really, it could happen at any point. There are so many people here in Los Angeles and really, across the country who are waiting for this deal to go back to work. Many people who have struggled for months to pay their rent or put food on the table, because they have not been able to work due to the strike. I mean, there are many things that they're trying to negotiate, among them pay, the residuals when it comes to streaming, and also artificial intelligence. That has been extremely difficult because, really, we don't know a lot about artificial intelligence and these writers say they want to be the ones writing the scripts and not machines. Again, this has had a huge impact everywhere in the nation. And estimates are that the economic impact is more than $5 billion. So a deal is essentially a very big deal because many, many people are waiting for this -- Jim.",

If there are any updates, we'll bring it back in. Camila, thank you very much. Back here in Washington, there is a new deadline looming, and we're counting down to one week from today. Next Saturday, the federal government will face a midnight shutdown unless some funding bill can be passed in Congress and signed by the president. But with every passing hour, a resolution seems more and more unlikely. Now federal agencies have been told to begin their formal process of preparing for a government shutdown. That means that millions of federal workers and military personnel are getting ready, too. Their paychecks may be cut off for weeks. Today, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy conceded he has to win over some Republican hardliners who continue to defy him, but he says he is hopeful that they will fall in line and pass some kind of a stopgap spending measure to prevent the shutdown. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I think when it gets crunch time, people will finally that have been holding  off all this time, blaming everybody else will finally, hopefully move off because shutting down and having border agents not be paid, your Coast Guard not be paid, I don't see how that's a victory.

We're trying to be able to deal with problems in the economy because of the strikes that are taking place.If you have a shutdown, it's going to hurt the economy that much more, and so I think both the president and the leadership in the Congress have to focus on doing what's right for the country, which is passing a continuing resolution, fund the government, and then move on to negotiate on the budget in the future.",

And where there was an attempt at puppeteering Zelenskyy in trade, weapons for dirt on an opponent. And so that was enough to sort of get us looking at what's going on in Ukraine, because this president was a very engaging guy.

We got in touch with him through an intermediary, and then COVID happened. So our meeting with him was on Zoom. Travel restrictions disallowed us from visiting, particularly with a head of state for his health security, and so the can was kicked down the road. By the time we got to Ukraine, the first trip, it was November 2021 and the drums were fatally beating for this Russian buildup.

He built a newspaper that was left to him by his father into a global newspaper empire. He conquered the United Kingdom and then he came to the United States, where really his legacy is Fox News. And he built that into the biggest, most profitable, top-rated cable news network. It arguably launched Trump into the White House.In addition to that, he also bought the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal. So he kept his fingers in the newspaper world as well. But that's an extraordinary legacy. And him retiring now, or at least stepping back from the head of those two companies, it doesn't necessarily mean that he's going to be stepping away from his career entirely. So I think there's still another chapter in Rupert Murdoch's career. ACOSTA: But Oliver and Aidan, as you both know, I mean, Murdoch's network over there at Fox, they platformed lies coming from the former president about the 2020 Election.

But we know that in - within Fox News, there is dissent about this and I think - I've been speaking to sources all week - some of them actually hope that James Murdoch, who's Rupert Murdoch's other son, who has been harshly critical of Fox News, both behind the scenes and in sort of oblique comments to the press, they're hoping that potentially he comes back and rids the network of some of these more extreme voices that have really taken it past the point of being a sensible news network and closer towards a propaganda outfit.",
