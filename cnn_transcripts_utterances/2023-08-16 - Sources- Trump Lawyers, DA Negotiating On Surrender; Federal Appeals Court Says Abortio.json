Early indications are that, the former president will turn himself in sometime next week. And here's what the jail is having to say about the - those defendants turning themselves in: \"It is expected that all 19 defendants named in the indictment will be booked at the Rice Street Jail,\" that's the Fulton County Jail, \"Keep in mind, defendants can turn themselves in at any time. The jail is open 24/7.\" I did reach out to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office they told me that no one has turned themselves in yet. And just really quickly here, Jim. We know that Trump's team is negotiating with the Fulton County DA, Fulton County authorities won't just have to negotiate with Trump's team.

They are arguing that everything he was doing was done in his capacity as the White House Chief of Staff. And there is a federal statute that seeks to protect federal officials from state prosecutions. Now look, Jim, it's unclear if he's going to be successful in getting this removed or dismissed. But he's not the only one who's going to try. Rudy Giuliani has also said this week that he too, is going to try to get his case removed to federal court. We also expect former president, Trump, will try this as well. Now it's possible they could get their cases removed to federal court but not dismissed. So that would mean that this becomes sort of a quasi federal case. Because on the one hand, it would be in federal court, but the District Attorney, Fani Willis, her prosecutors, technically they could be sworn in as U.S. attorneys are still dealing with state law. And look, Jim, one of the big advantages, though, for the former president and his associates, if they can get this moved to federal court, would be the jury pool, because Fulton County is a heavily Democratic jury pool. And at the federal level, the federal jury pool there would expand to include a more diverse array of jurors. Now the big downside, though, I would argue for the country and for journalists is that there are no cameras in federal court. So the American people would not be able to see this process play out.",

There are possibilities that not all 19 defendants might go to trial, many people in the system do often choose to plead guilty at some point in their cases. But with this, we need to watch to see what the federal case does related to January 6, and see how the rest of those cases fall in line if they hold the dates that they're having.

The Special Counsel Jack Smith, one of the few things he's ever said publicly is that he wants a \"speedy trial.\" He believes that it is in the public's interest, as Katelyn was noting, for these cases to be resolved before the 2024 presidential election.Now just looking at the calendar, it's unclear if it's going to be possible for him to conduct two federal trials before the presidential election. The former president's attorneys - they have made many arguments. The first one is that they believe if he is a candidate for the presidency, that he should not be put on trial. He should not face criminal trial before the presidential election. They've argued that that would be unfair. In the Mar-A-Lago documents case, they have tried to delay. And look, little delays here, little delays there, that adds up. But some of these are not just delay tactics. Look, Boris, some of this is just the due process that is due in a defendant. And in that case, they've also argued, it takes time to go through the classified information. They have, as they've pointed out, a lot of legal cases they're working on, and they want to be given a reasonable amount of time to be able to serve their client. So, I think, we're going to see a lot of the same arguments here in Fulton County. They're going to argue that they're going to make challenges to these cases. They're going to also argue that they have a lot of cases right now. They've argued this when we were down in front of Judge Aileen Cannon in the Mar-A-Lago documents case. They just told her, they said, look, look at all the cases that we're working on. Look at how small our team is. We can't do this on such a tight timeline. Their strategy, their goal is to delay. But they also have some legitimate arguments that might be a really tight timeline, given the nature of this case, but also, all the other cases that are floating out there. And Boris, because the former president is once again running for the White House, his status as a candidate, it is a consideration. Though, I will say the judge in the January 6 case, Judge Tanya Chutkan, I was in court with her last Friday. Boris, she made it clear, his status as a candidate does not impact that case for her and it will not impact any of her decisions. So, look, they have a lot going on here.
