SECRETARY-GENERAL: We are playing Russian Roulette with our planet. And we need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell. Meanwhile, the godfathers of climate chaos, the fossil fuel industry, is breaking record profits, and trillions in taxpayer funded subsidies. We must secure the safest possible future for people and planet. That means taking urgent action, particularly over the next 18 months to slash emissions, to protect people and nature from climate extremes, to boost climate finance, and to clamp down on the fossil fuel industry.

Instead, things are just going to get hotter and hotter and worse and worse. And while this is easy to say, what are we going to do about it? Well,I, as you know was born in the U.S. I grew up in the U.S. and so my perspective may be strongly influenced by that. But I claim the United States has to be in the lead. The United States has to lead the world in addressing global climate change. In order to do that, we have to reduce our emissions and come up with new ways to provide electricity to more and more people around the world. These are easy things to say but difficult things to do. The longest journey begins with but a single-step. So let's go.",

The same states that are being -- being affected today by very, very hot temperatures and very unpleasant living conditions when it's hot and humid are the people that are going to vote.And so this will -- sooner or later, they're going to vote for people that are going to address climate change. It's especially true in the U.S. south, in the Sunbelt and in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, where you have these ocean states dealing with rising sea levels and -- and increasing hot -- increasingly hot and humid conditions. And big storms and, of course, now fires on top of all that. These are all things that have been predicted by scientists, you know, with today's climate -- environment. The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made these predictions. The predictions are coming true. So let's get to work, people. And as you point out, you wouldn't think it would be a political issue. You wouldn't think it would be a red or a blue thing. You think, right, like let's face this problem, people, and get to work. And so I think this election, this coming election is really going to be a turning point. We're going to have to decide what we're going to do as a nation to address climate change.",

Let's have the U.S. lead.You know, ironically, or a point of remarkable interest, China, the Chinese industries are leading the world and producing renewable electricity sources, solar panels, solar hot water systems, electric vehicles, and so on. And the reason everybody -- the reason we're advocating for electric vehicles is because we've created all these roads. We have all this vehicle infrastructure. So we got to use it. It's not that electric vehicles are some sort of panacea to the problem, but we have all these roads, we're going to use them. Let's use them as efficiently as possible. That's the whole electric vehicle idea. So the United States has to lead. And so let's get started. This -- with respect, whining about what other countries are or not doing is important, but it is not what will motivate global change. When it gets too hot, you can't live. You can't -- a human can't get rid of enough heat to survive. So we're going to have to make changes. And what we want to do is make changes as quickly as possible. So that as few people as possible have to move because we're going to have these displaced populations. Where are they going to go? What are they going to do? We've been talking about this for a long time. So everybody, two things you can do about climate change, talk about it, and I'm not kidding. We were talking about climate change. We were talking about these other important issues. We'd be getting to work. And the second thing, everybody, is vote. Vote with the climate in mind, with the environment in mind. This is true for people in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, people in North America. We can make these changes. Let's go.",

And Amanda Knox really went into that courtroom in Florence today believing that she would be vindicated.She was not. And in fact, was far too distraught even to speak to media, according to her lawyer. What did this entail? A reminder here, she was found innocent after being found guilty after spending four years in prison in Italy. She was found innocent in 2011 and then completely exonerated by an Italian court in 2015. That was in relation to the murder of Meredith Kercher. But there was that charge of slander against her former boss, Patrick Lumba. That charge of slander stood. And in 2019, a European Court of Human Rights said that, in fact, when she implicated this man, a man who was proven to be completely innocent, he was day in custody, but had nothing to do with this crime, when she implicated him, the European court ruled that, look, she did it under duress, under hours of questioning from police without a lawyer, without a translator. And for that reason, they reverted it back to Italian courts. Well, unfortunately, the Italian courts had their say today, that is for Amanda Knox. I want to point out here that many innocents were ensnared in this entire thing, but none more so than the family of Meredith Kercher, right? The exchange student, who was murdered. And every time this comes up again, her family really does not have any piece of justice. One man was convicted of crime, he was set free in 2021 - Brianna, Boris?",

He's also the author of the novel, \"The Defector.\" Thanks so much for being with us, Colonel. This is coming, obviously is a tremendous moment for spaceflight in general. We're seeing a lot of competition across different types of launches and different organizations. How do you feel about what we saw today? COL. CHRIS HADFIELD, RETIRED, FORMER ASTRONAUT: No, I think it's a great step of proven capability. And that's really important. I mean, as you say, it's been a huge week. China landed on the other side of the moon this week, and just blasted off over of the moon with a robot, which still, bringing a sample back. A rocket lab down in New Zealand just launched a NASA payload up into orbit to monitor the earths health. And tomorrow, SpaceX is launching Starship on its fourth test flight. So I mean, it's a huge week for what can happen when we all put our minds together and try and do hard things. But this, specifically, getting a new human-rated vehicle with two friends of mine onboard safely into orbit and on the way to the space station, that's a whole new kind of step of capability for the United States.

So this enormous pyramid of life, of them gaining skills and competence, building their own personal lives around being the type of person that could be trusted to fly a brand-new spaceship.
