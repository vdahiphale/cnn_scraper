      "sentences": "A huge legal smackdown for Donald Trump and the word he least likes to hear, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"That word is \"no.\" A federal appeals court ruling today? No, you do not have immunity for the crimes you allegedly committed during your presidency, no, you do not have unlimited power, and no, you are not above the law. I mean, the court could not be any clearer on this point. I'm quoting here, \"We cannot accept former President Trump's claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power -- the recognition and implementation of election results.\" And going on to say, \"Nor can we sanction his apparent contention that the Executive has carte blanche to violate the rights of individual citizens to vote and to have their votes count.\" The court throwing out Trump's arguments that he shouldn't have to go on trial on federal election subversion charges. Trump, as you would expect, vowing to appeal to the Supreme Court. But he really only has until Monday to decide whether he can do that. Let's talk about now with CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen and former federal prosecutor Joe Moreno. I'm so glad that both of you are here today. I mean, first of all, we have been talking about this for the better part of a month, Norm, right? The fact that it took this long perhaps is the surprising aspect. I mean, it was a 50-plus page opinion. But were you surprised that the outcome was this after this month?",

Do they say, we want to think about this, we want to consider this in the normal course of business? And then they have the issue of which way they want to rule on this case.In fact, I think the procedural is maybe more important than the substantive because if they grant a stay and decide this case at the end of June, at the end of the term, even if they decide against Donald Trump, that will effectively make this case impossible to try before the end of -- before the election. And that's why this is such a complicated and interesting question here because the procedural question about the stay, that requires five votes, but deciding to take the case to grant a writ of certiorari only takes four votes. So, are there five votes to grant a stay? That's the question. I think there are going to be at least two votes because Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito are -- have been with Trump down the line in virtually every case.

I think there will be definitely members of that court who say, look, the magnitude of this issue is such that this is why we have a Supreme Court. And if they get involved in that way, that will be very good news for Donald Trump, if they grant this stay, even if he ultimately loses the case. So, I think the institutional interest of the Supreme Court in resolving this question is something that Trump has going for him. Whether that's enough to get him five votes for a stay, I don't know, but the point you make about the Supreme Court wanting to address such a profoundly important issue is something that will push them towards taking this case, even though this issue is pretty easy, I think. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump can commit any crime he wants and never be prosecuted for it is a pretty crazy idea, but it's an important question, and that's something at least some of these justices are going to want to address.",

Now, on Thursday, as you know, the Supreme Court is going to hear arguments on the case about the 14th Amendment and whether Trump is eligible to run in the Colorado presidential primary. Now, there are sources telling CNN that Trump is not expected to be in that room. I wonder if that means he knows how serious it is or his presence is not in his mind necessary or won't be televised in some way because we know it's not recorded.

That's something this court has never addressed, never anything close. I'd venture to guess most of these justices had never even thought about Section 3 of the 13th Amendment because there hadn't been -- there hasn't been a Supreme Court case about it essentially ever. I mean, this is something that was really directed at the Civil War and its aftermath and it has not come up since.

And like we talked about with trauma, it doesn't respect time.And so, the good news is he's relatively shielded from this, but I believe, as he processes through his emotions and he really feel what the emotions come out from that day, you know, he was angry with the parents. Um, he shared that with us openly. And he didn't really lean into his anger as much before because he suppressed it. And I think we, as parents, hold all of this at a much -- we feel the gravity of it, where he's still working through what this really has impacted him personally and our entire family. So, you know, it's hard. And I think there's not closure right now, but it's one more step. It's one more accountability measure.",

It's how it has been labeled by certain people. These people, but in this case, Jennifer Crumley was found guilty by a jury of her peers in Oakland County or home county because of the things that she did completely wrong and the things that she didn't do completely wrong, one of which happened to be, obviously, supporting a gun being purchased for this young man, and she going to the shooting range days before and not telling and not ever telling the school personnel about that gun.

And thinking about how my kids and all of our kids are having active shooter drills as part of their curriculum. I mean, the way we used to have recess is pretty standard. They're having active shooter drills.And we look at other parents. We look at what could change. We wonder how this could have happened and it's continuing to happen. And when you look at this verdict and the implications of the possibility that this could send the message, that red flags could not and should not be ignored, what goes through your mind? M. GREGORY: I'm thankful for that. I hope that parents are paying attention and taking mental health seriously. Taking care of your children is so important. I mean, Chad and I are raising five children, and I'm not worrying about if I'm going to go to jail because I did something wrong. You know, our goal is to get our children to adulthood and teach them how to contribute to society. So, my hope is that people are watching. And if you see things with your child, do something about them. You know, our child told us he was having struggles. Like Chad had told you before, the survivor's guilt is a lot. And, you know, we immediately got him help. It wasn't even a question. C. GREGORY: I think the part that I would just add is we -- all parents have a duty and we're not all equipped. And so, you have to take a partner, you have to ask for help, and you have to identify the signs. And it is a sad, sad world right now that our kids have to grow up in, they're becoming conditioned for it, and the society and the public are becoming tone-deaf. And so, I think as uncomfortable as we are even saying what we do publicly here, it's important not to be tone-deaf. You got to take this very serious, mental health.

And just last month, he settled a civil lawsuit with the city of Concord and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations for $25 million.It is the second largest wrongful conviction settlement ever. Still, No amount of money can right this wrong. No amount of money can compensate someone for losing 44 years of their life. So, why was he even locked up to begin with? Well, let me take you back to 1976, when Long was convicted of raping a 54-year-old white woman. That conviction was handed down by an all-white jury. [23:45:00] But it wasn't until 2020 when Long's conviction was vacated. It was revealed that evidence had been suppressed, including semen samples and fingerprints from the actual crime scene. And those samples did not match Long's. And the courts said the evidence was deliberately withheld by law enforcement. Unbelievable to think about. Joining me now, Ronnie Long and his lawyer from the Wrongful Convictions Clinic, Jamie Lau. Mr. Long, thank you so much for joining us. Just hearing what has happened to you, it's unbelievable to imagine. You were released from prison on August 27th, 2020. And I hear that you bought yourself the car you always wanted. You're hoping to buy a home with you and your wife. And I wonder what was the first thing you did after regaining your freedom and knowing that it had been fully vacated. RONNIE LONG, SPENT 44 YEARS IN PRISON FOR CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT: First and foremost, I get praise and honor to a greater creator, to even be here to tell my story. I want to appreciate you. I appreciate you, people. CNN for having me on. First thing I did, I went to see my mother and father. You know, my mother and father are deceased. They died within 44 years. The first thing I did, I had to go visit their grave and let them know that I'm returning home. Even though I know my father and mother died with a broken heart, it was a pleasure to me to even just be there to say that because the things that I went through (INAUDIBLE).",

They were believed to be the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the crime, and he was excluded from each and every one. So, at his trial in 1976, none of this evidence was known to the jury, and law enforcement officers actually took the stand and testified that all the evidence in the case hadn't been tested, hadn't been brought to the lab, knowing full well that it had been brought to the lab, and it excluded Ronnie as the possible perpetrator in the crime.",
