The longest and deadliest battle the war so far, has seen a staggering loss of life. And now the head of the mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin says his private army has taken all of Eastern Bakhmut. And despite promises to defend Bakhmut to the end, Ukrainian forces are believed to have completed a controlled withdrawal from the cities east on Tuesday, and Ukrainian military officials acknowledge Russian troops continue to advance. Prigozhin appeared in this photograph standing in front of a tank a monument in the same area, which he says is now under the control of his private army. And in a video message, the head of the Wagner group had this chilling message for Ukraine's president.

That puts them in a stronger position to counter any further Russian advances which could occur.

I think what plays into this, obviously, is his assistance that he's getting from the likes of Iran, North Korea, and ultimately, potentially China in terms of military assistance from China. If that happens, then what you could see is the Russians recover fairly quickly, and be able to then search forward in terms of additional offensives.

The chairman of an Indonesian football club has been sentenced to one and a half years in prison over last year's deadly stampede by fans at the stadium.More than 130 people were killed in the crush after police deployed tear gas during the match last October. Now the chairman of the arena football club has been sentenced for negligence. Officials say that's partly because he was responsible for selling more tickets to the game then the stadium had capacity. Earlier investigators put most of the blame on police because of the use of tear gas, which is banned by world football. Weeks of angry street protests in Israel have failed to stop the government's plans there to overhaul the nation's judicial system. Now another group is during the protesters, a group that Israel depends on for security, for its very survival. Elliott Gotkine has details from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1991 and regularly hit Iranian targets in Syria. But even some of Israel's revered combat pilots are now firing warning shots, with reservists from one squadron skipping a training session and suggesting they may not heed the call of duty if the government rams through its judicial overhaul.

GOTKINE (voice-over): Neri Yarkoni was an Israeli combat pilot for 30. Years he's also a lawyer, who is that if the government continues with plans to neuter the supreme court and give itself sweeping powers, the country may be in trouble.",
