Now, this memo also said that the object that was down over Lake Huron on Saturday descended slowly into the water after it was shot. This memo that was gathered by my colleagues Jeremy Herb and Zach Cohen is giving us some of the slightest details about these objects. We also are told by U.S. officials that the object that was down over Alaska, that was the one on Friday, is described as a metallic object. So, we now have this metallic descriptor for two out of the three of these objects.

And then if there is retaliation, that that will be prosecuted. So that's the nature of the law that we passed. And so, Arrow, which is the department we created, has some of the smartest minds in our country working on analyzing this data and these videos and radar detections as scientifically and as thoroughly as possible to make assessments. And as I said, there are still many that are not assessed yet, and it takes time and resources. So, one of the things I'm going to be working on this week is to make sure this is fully funded this year and to make sure that this is a priority for the Department of Defense because regardless of how they looked at these things in the past, and I understand these are not threats from a military perspective, but we need to understand what is in our airspace.

But we also heard quite a bit during that week that shooting down the Chinese spy balloon would really pose a serious risk to people, to the American people as well as buildings. Is there not also a risk in shooting down these objects that are in the space where commercial aircraft are? GILLIBRANDminimize that risk, over Lake Huron, for example, in the Yukon, off the coast of Alaska. That's the three places where they shot them down. Interestingly for the first spy balloon, they had an option to shoot it down immediately just off the coast of Alaska. And one of their reasoning was, it's very hard to recover anything from that location which is now proving to be true for this shot-down device over the coast of Alaska. The cold temperatures, the roughness of the sea. It makes it very hard to retrieve. And so, I think the Biden administration made the right judgments and waited until it was in a safe place and they could also watch it and see, really get their own information about how does it move, what's it doing, and they can then take that information, as knowledge it's very important for defense.",

CNN analysis of multiple videos taken over the past fortnight show the Russians last at least 50 tanks and armored personnel carriers in this area alone, and it seems several hundred soldiers. These units seem without leadership or tactics as Russian soldiers scramble to take cover, they are mercilessly cut down. Russian tanks and fighting vehicles careened straight into well-placed minefields. At one point, the lifeless body of a Russian soldier gets entangled in tank tracks. These satellite images provided to CNN show the intense bombardment of the tree lines the Russian army tried and failed to take cover and a landscape littered with destroyed machines. President Putin's only comment on the fighting here, the marine infantry is maintaining the operation just fine he says. This very moment they are fighting heroically.

Maybe in hindsight Republicans don't think so. But -- and that is a negotiating position, right? They're not going to say, oh no, if it gets bad, we're going to go forward.

The College Board engaged with a -- in a war of words with the state of Florida and its Republican Governor, Ron DeSantis over its preliminary decision, the Florida's preliminary decision to reject a course on AP African American studies unless changes were made.In a statement, the College Board says, \"Florida is attempting to claim a political victory by taking credit retroactively for changes we ourselves made but they never suggested to us. We have made the mistake of treating the Florida Department of Education with a courtesy we always accord to an education agency, but they have instead exploited this courtesy for their political agenda.\" That prompted this response earlier today from Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: The college Board was the one that in a black studies course put queer theory in, not us. They did that. They were the ones that put intersectionality. They put in other types of neo-marxism into the proposed syllabus. And men, this is the proposed course. So our Department of Education looked at that and said in Florida, we do education not in documentation. So that runs afoul of our standards. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I will say I would have loved to take this class back in high school because we had American history in which slavery was barely discussed. And that's the broader challenge we're seeing. And DeSantis has really wrapped his hands around the K to 12 public education system and using name calling to his advantage, calling it racist or woke theory to even talk about the roots of American history. He's taken an autocratic approach to it. Education is supposed to be locally managed and he has managed to show an example of how a state can take over these local issues and now potentially show a path for how the federal government can do that as well.",
