But I think what the administration is trying to do here, they're not necessarily taking away yet their major capabilities, but they are sending a clear message in targeting a senior commander. The administration will try to degrade their capabilities as well, we would believe, as part of their ongoing efforts. But clearly the intention here is to try to deter.And actually, in the wake of those three American service member deaths, Kataib Hezbollah put out a notable statement in which they said they were standing down their operations, would no longer carry out attacks against U.S. forces. Now, remember, there have been some 160, 170 attacks against U.S. and coalition forces since October 7, since the war in Gaza began. Major question now is whether what we're seeing in terms of reaction or these strikes from the U.S. will actually serve to deter because we have seen a handful of strikes since that retaliation on Friday night.",

CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): NEGOTIATOR FOR BORDER DEAL: Who knows? I mean, this Republican Party is spiraling out of control as we speak. This is terrible for the country. It's terrible for the world. I mean, they told us back in the fall that they could not vote for Ukraine funding by its own, that they needed a bipartisan border fix. As you mentioned, the three of us who are very different legislators, very different priorities, we got a bipartisan compromise, a pretty conservative bipartisan compromise. They told us this week that they were kidding. In fact, they did not want to tie border and Ukraine together. And now we are back to where were last fall, offering them a vote -- a clean vote on funding for Israel and Ukraine by itself. Right now, as we speak, it does not yet have more than a handful of Republican votes and is about to fail. Time will tell. This is a Republican Party that has just become rudderless. And I guess to the extent they're tied to anything and anyone, it's Donald Trump who wants chaos, right? He wants chaos at the border. He wants chaos overseas because he thinks that will help him politically this November. And right now, Republicans are listening to anything he tells them, which is pretty awful. I was proud of my colleague, Senator Lankford. He stuck with this compromise even though all of his Republican colleagues abandoned him. He went to the floor today to explain why it was still the right thing to do for the country. And maybe once this Trump fever breaks, his style of leadership will come back into vogue.",

I mean, I know everybody wants to believe that this place is perpetually and fundamentally broken, but we actually passed a lot of good stuff for a two year period of time. And then Trump once again reasserted himself in the party.So, I am not of the school that we can never, ever find a path forward with some of our Republican friends, but on this issue of immigration, for the time being, they have very clearly decided they want chaos at the border.

We have some plans, some ideas, but you have this two state solution that remains out there, probably the best possible one, assuming you have a reformed or renewed Palestinian authority.But look, I think the politics internal to Israel within his cabinet are what's driving Bibi Netanyahu right now to take these hard stances with regard to, for example, the latest proposal that came back from Hamas and what the likelihood of a deal is.",

Now the state told the court that the terms viability and health care provider are not clear and overly broad. If 60 percent of voters approve it, the ballot amendment would rollback the state's current ban on abortion after 15 weeks to around 24 weeks. It would also block a six week ban that the Florida legislature passed last year that has yet to take effect.
