Less than 24 hours later, backing down. Walk us through what caused this change. LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera):  The simple answer is I don't know. Nobody knows, because around this time last night, President Ruto had a strongly worded national address where he called these young people treasonous protesters and promised the full force of security services to make sure that yesterday's violence does not happen again. And then less than 24 hours later, he says the people have spoken and he has listened, that he leads the government but also is a leader of the people. And he is conceding that, yes, they were right and life would become too expensive for them. This finance bill was supposed to raise an extra $2.6 billion for the government revenue. After public outcry, they climbed down a little bit and targeted $1.5 billion. There were advisers to President Ruto on social media calling these young people, protesting, rubbishing them, essentially just ridiculing what they were doing. And now President Ruto himself having to say that you were right after all. I want to remind everybody why the young people were protesting.

He looked, I think, quite, quite, you know, like he was -- I don't want to say gaunt, but he looked like he was, you know, he was he was worried. He had a lot of anxiety on his shoulders, understandably.

Brian, let's just talk about the nuts and bolts of this case in particular. It's a win for the administration, but, again, an issue, a ruling on standing.

But, you know, it's the ultimate takeaway being, hey, this information, misinformation, likely violates your own platform policies, and you may want to consider removing it, making a decision on your own to, you know, take this information that we're giving you so that you can make the right call as to whether or not it serves your user's interest.

We have two opinion days left this week, Thursday and Friday. But with about 10 opinions left, including three really big ones, everyone's sort of reading the tea leaves and thinking it is very likely that the Supreme Court will actually spill over into next week, which would be the first week of July. The last time they did that was during COVID, and that was extenuating circumstances because the Supreme Court term had really been paused at the beginning of COVID. They were delayed. So, this would be a pretty big deal if they go into the first week of July. We do have three big ones. You mentioned two of them. The immunity case, where the Supreme Court will decide whether or not former presidents, namely Donald Trump, have immunity from criminal prosecution. It's such a big deal because they've never decided that issue when it comes to criminal prosecution. It's also a big deal because it will determine the fate of Donald Trump's criminal trial here in Washington, D.C. Will it move forward before the election, or will a Supreme Court decision really push this past the election? And if Donald Trump were to win, he could just get his Justice Department to dismiss the charges. So, there's that one. There's also a case involving January 6th rioters, whether a particular obstruction statute can actually apply to them. If it didn't apply to them, it could probably erase the sentences of about 15 --or, sorry, 50 rioters and implicate maybe hundreds more. And then there's the big abortion case, Bianna. It involves an Idaho law. There are a half-dozen other laws like it around the country. It's basically a near-total abortion ban. And the Biden administration had said that parts of that law conflicted with a federal law that mandated that emergency room doctors give all the care necessary to women, even when their life isn't at stake. If they do come up against potential severe injury, they also need to be helped, even if that includes an abortion. So, we have a lot of big cases left, you know, about 10 total, three really big ones. We'll see what happens tomorrow and Friday. And it's quite possible the Supreme Court goes into next week.",

This is the first of what's expected to be about 2500 forces and police officers from a variety of other countries largely coordinated by the United States. First, let me ask you, given what headlines we're seeing specifically in Kenya itself, in Nairobi, the violent protests over that finance bill, do you think that at all will be a distraction here and demoralizing, for lack of a better word, for what this mission is supposed to ensure and bring? REP. STACEY PLASKETT, (D-U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS):  Sure. I don't think so. But of course, I'm not on the ground in Kenya to be fully apprised of that.

And I'm asking specifically regarding the politics here in the United States, given that we have an election coming up between most likely former President Trump and President Biden. We know given his past comments, how former President Trump feels specifically about Haiti. Is there any way for a Trump administration to walk back this verbal and financial agreement that President Biden put in place?",

However, it neededauthorization from the four corners of Congress in terms of the Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as others, Homeland Security, et cetera. And those were being held up by the Republicans. It was President Biden who did the work around himself using his executive power to be able to get that money to Haiti. And I think that given what President Trump has said in the past, his reticence and isolationism of the United States, not just in Haiti, but in Europe and other places as well, and individuals who are afraid to go against him, that should he become President, this will be a very difficult task. Things do not change on a dime. Ships don't change on a dime. And definitely the devastation that has occurred in Haiti is not going to happen, as you said, so rightly, not in six months or even a year. And we've got to be steady and be with them as they work through this to bring the country to where it can be. And I think that that's in the benefit of the United States. I think President Biden, as well as the Vice President, who has embarked on a real slew of initiatives in the Caribbean, whether it was to stop drug and gun trafficking in the region, as well as to support energy issues and stop climate change, and even supporting financial sectors and remittances that are of Americans that are of Caribbean descent going into the region, to support that with the banks that are there. And I think this wrap-around support that we're given, whether it's in trade preferences to the Haitian people, ensuring that their manufacturing that they have been doing can continue, as well as the support that we're giving for stabilization of security. Initially, these forces are going in there to make sure that aid can get to the people of Haiti, but then ensuring that ports as well as airports and important infrastructure is stable.",

Yesterday, the military says, they were able to get about800 pallets of aid off of this pier and into Gaza. But the problem now is the World Food Programme, which is supposed to be picking up that aid, they say the security conditions just aren't there for them to be able to pick up that aid and distribute it to the people of Gaza. DIAMOND (voice-over):  These are some of the now more than 6000 pallets of humanitarian aid the U.S. military says are sitting in an open-air warehouse across from the pier. The World Food Program paused its operations at the pier more than two weeks ago, citing safety concerns. Across Gaza, humanitarian aid groups say Israeli military operations and a rise in lawlessness and looting are bringing their aid operations to a crawl. And it couldn't come at a worse time, as experts say people in Gaza are once again at high risk of famine. The U.S. military invited CNN to the pier for the first time to show how it is ramping up the flow of aid to Gaza. And how it is getting this beleaguered project back on track after rough weather damaged and took the pier out of service for weeks. JOEL STEWART, U.S. NAVY CAPTAIN:  The sea is a difficult taskmistress. Unpredictable. Each wave is different than the last. So, dealing with that is a challenge, but we've adapted to that, and I think we're in a better position now than we were initially. DIAMON (voice-over):  About 40 truckloads are now arriving at the pier each day, still well short of the military's initial estimates of 90 to 150. A complex effort aid officials say would have been best spent pressuring Israel to get more aid in by land.",

The challenges we face in this space is that we are a very high-tech company that is working in a very low-tech environment. But we have found ways to work with our partners to bridge some of these gaps by creating platforms that work offline fast or lead little to no connectivity. We base our analysis of how much a farmer can borrow on the farmer's performance and production of their particular crop or vanditching. So, for dairy, how much they deliver in milk is what we use to create the credit limit for that farmer. Additionally, what we make easy is that the farmer does not have to worry about how complex it is to repay the loan.
