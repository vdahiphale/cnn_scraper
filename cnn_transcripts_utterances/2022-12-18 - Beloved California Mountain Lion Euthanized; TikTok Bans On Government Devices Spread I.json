The committee has been investigating, you know, the U.S. Capitol riot for over 17 months now. It's going to use its last public appearance where all the members are gathered together to really make the case that Donald Trump committed a crime. They are going to ask the Justice Department to pursue prosecution on at least three different criminal charges, including insurrection.Now, what that ultimately will mean remains to be seen. We know the Justice Department is already looking into Trump as part of its expansive criminal investigation related to January 6th but members have really told us of the last several weeks that they felt it was really important that they get their views documented for the historical record. And they made clear that they think the former president committed a crime. Now, we also know beyond former President Donald Trump that the committee is going to make referrals on at least a few others people that they qualify as central players in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. Now, it remains to be seen how they're going to handle, you know, issues like the five Republican lawmakers who defied their subpoenas. But here's a few options, you know, they have on the table in addition to criminal referrals. They can make complaints to the House Ethics Committee. They can put their discipline referrals to the bar associations and campaign -- and recommend campaign finance violations to the FEC. So, we're going to see a variety of different categories of referrals tomorrow. But really the criminal referral for Donald Trump is going to be the highlight.",

The people that you see around me mostly have not been able to get into one of the shelters that have been so overwhelmed by this latest surge of migrants in this area. This is all happening days ahead of the expected lifting of Title 42, that pandemic era public health rule that allowed customs and border protection and border officials to expel many migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border because of public health reasons. And many of these people really just trying to get through the night as they await being able to get on a bus or a flight to their final destinations elsewhere in the country.What you are seeing playing out is really people, kind of, desperate for whatever blankets and clothing, whatever they can get to get through these nights. We've seen the generosity of people who -- like this woman here who arrived a short while ago and was giving away blankets. Migrants who've lined up single file to be able to get their hands on a blanket or shoes or sweaters, sweat shirts, anything that can help them through the night. And they're camped out around these bus stations because they are waiting to either board these buses. But many of these tickets are several days out so they had to sit here. And that is really the main concern that local officials here in El Paso have and what they have been working to try to prepare for. And they've realized that at this point they just need to be able to manage this situation as best as possible. And the thing that they want to do, the best at is moving people out of here as quickly as possible because they know that behind them there are thousands more migrants possibly coming in the days ahead. So, they say the biggest challenge they will have is to get these people to bigger transportation hubs like Phoenix, Denver, Dallas and Houston so that they can then move on to their final destinations. And they hope that if they can move people out of El Paso quickly enough that will alleviate the pressure and the burden on a lot of the shelters and the charities that are really helping these people get through these initial days here in the U.S. But they are all bracing for large numbers of people. In the last week, El Paso has seen about 2,000 to 2,500 people per day. Local officials are now estimating that once Title 42 is lifted it could be anywhere from 4,000 to 5,000 people per day here just in the El Paso region alone. Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas.

And he was essentially a celebrity, a beloved mountain lion here in Los Angeles, with a Facebook page and Instagram page. But unfortunately, about a month ago, the experts that track him started noticing changes in his behavior. They say he was getting closer and attacking dogs, even dogs on leashes that were close to people. They also say he was getting a lot closer to urban areas and deeper into these urban areas. They believed that he was in distress, which is why they decided to capture him. Once they captured him, he went through a medical evaluation. They already thought that he'd been hit by a car, but the medical evaluation revealed that he had trauma to his eye, to his head and some internal organs. They also discovered pre-existing illnesses, including kidney disease, some infection in his skin, weight loss. And so, when they took all of that into consideration, they essentially decided that putting him down was the best scenario for P-22.

But in all seriousness -- in all seriousness, listen, technology and social media do play an incredibly important role in our children's lives and it's something that we need to be aware of. And hopefully, like any organization or individual, help them make better risk management decisions. Help them understand what information is being collected about them. Help them understand what vulnerabilities could be introduced, what these applications and what this software can do to their phone and on their behalf, without them knowing about it.So, this is a game of education for our children, for our youth. It's also a case where many adults don't understand the implications of installing a piece of software, and also something that needs to happen at the organizational level with our businesses and our government.",

But it doesn't begin and end with one app.I think the government taking action, whether it's against TikTok or any other company or organization sends a very strong signal to foreign actors, to foreign governments, about influence about data collection which may happen here in the U.S. against government employees or against other members of our population.

Minnesota had just a one percent chance of winning, but don't ever count out Kirk Cousins. You like that. The three-time pro-bowler leading the Vikings with four second-half touchdown passes, including this screen pass that went for 64 yards with just over two minutes to go. This one was all Dalvin Cook though. Somehow, some way, Minnesota tie the game at 36, forcing overtime after converting a two-point conversion as well. And in overtime, kicker Greg Joseph has a shot at the game-winner. Minnesota down 33-zip to Matt Ryan and the Colts and they go ahead and pull up the biggest comeback in NFL history. The previous record, Buffalo Bills 32 points in 1992 with Frank Reich at quarterback feeding the Oilers. Reich was fired earlier this season by the Colts. Vikings went 39-36 clinching their first NFC North title since 2017. Afterwards, Cousins had no idea what they had just done. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
