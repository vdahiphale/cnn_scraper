This is a game changer. We have to change the rules of the game, you just heard Lieutenant Colonel Lerner say that. It's the message from every single Israeli official that this is the objective now, to re- establish conventional deterrence because this is a complete and utter, you know, exposure of -- for this instance, on Saturday, a massive failure, as we've been told by many of the Israeli officials as well, which they will look into later. But, at the moment, they have to go in, they say, to re-establish deterrence. And to that end, we have heard the defense minister himself, Yoav Galant, and I'll read it, say that they have taken all restraints off Israeli soldiers. So, what does that mean? You are seeing what's happening in Gaza. You hear them say that they are abiding by the laws of war, that they're trying to protect civilians. They are correct that civilians are unfortunately embedded in the entire densely populated City of Gaza and in many, many other areas around the actual central city, Gaza City, in refugee camps, in all sorts of places. We have been speaking to Gaza residents on our program who, you know, know precisely, you know, how different this is to any of the other encounters between Israel and Hamas. And they are clearly the civilians in a desperate situation to this -- to the question of what would they say to Hamas for bringing this down on their heads? I tried to ask my interlocutor, a doctor, and basically, you know, the line went dead. There's been a siege imposed by the Israeli defense minister. And even President Biden, who stands full square with Israel, is trying to say to the Israeli Prime Minister that our democracies are only strong, and we can only avenge our dead if we abide by the rules of war.
