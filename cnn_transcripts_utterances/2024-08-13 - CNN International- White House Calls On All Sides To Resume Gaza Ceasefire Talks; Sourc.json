I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, as the Middle East braces for a response from Iran, diplomatic efforts intensified to try to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, as negotiations are set to resume. We are live in Israel and Lebanon for the very latest. Plus, a little policy and a lot of insults, Donald Trump dishing out attacks during a two-hour interview with Elon Musk. We'll get into it. And a key inflation report is out, and it's colder than expected, and clearly, the U.S. markets like it. We will look at what this means for the stock market and your pocketbook. Well, we want to begin with Israel on high alert, bracing for what the U.S. warns could be a quote, \"significant set of retaliatory attacks by Iran and its proxies\". A major strike has not happened yet, but a short time ago, a loud explosion did rattle Tel Aviv. The military wing of Hamas saying that it fired two rockets in response to Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Israel says that one rocket fell into the sea, the other failed to cross into Israeli territory. The IDF says that it is prepared for any scenario.

But, two diplomatic sources tell CNN that the last ditch effort is not expected to stop Iran from retaliating over the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. Hamas wants mediators to compel Israel to accept a U.S.-backed ceasefire deal that's already on the table. The White House calling on all sides to resume talks before there is no turning back.

      "sentences": "Well, there is no question that a retaliatory strike by Iran coming before those talks on Thursday has the enormous potential to upend the potential progress that could be made at the negotiating table on Thursday. It could even take those negotiations off the calendar altogether, or at least postpone those talks. But, all of that depends, of course, on the timing of an Iranian strike, as well as the scale and scope of such an attack. Will Iran go for something that will be symbolic but ultimately have very little real impact on the ground, or could this be a significant Iranian strike, more significant than what we saw in April, and one that could potentially result in civilian casualties? Either scenario is going to provide a very different timeline of what happens next.And so, that is what this region is currently bracing for. That's why we have seen diplomatic efforts over the course of the last few days, in particular from a number of European heads of states speaking directly with the Iranian Prime Minister, urging him to de-escalate, urging him not to deliver a significant retaliation before these ceasefire talks happen on Thursday. But, so far, the Iranians appear uninclined to heed those warnings. We heard earlier today from the spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry saying that Iran is \"firm and resolute\". That's a quote in defending its sovereignty and doesn't need permission from anyone to carry out any kind of retaliatory action. So, the Iranians seem very much inclined to carry out that retaliation. U.S. and Israeli intelligence sources indicating in recent days that an attack could be imminent, but we still don't know the exact timing, and again, that will be critical to seeing what happens next.",

      "sentences": "Well, as of now, the latest indications we're getting from the region are that both Israel and Hamas will actually be in attendance at these talks. Now, that doesn't mean that they will be in the same room together. [11These talks throughout have been mediated primarily by the Egyptians and the Qataris, who were passing messages between the Israeli delegation, which is typically led by the head of Israel's intelligence service, the Mossad director David Barnea. On Hamas' side, these will be the first talks that now happen with Yahya Sinwar officially in charge as the head of Hamas' political bureau, in addition to being Hamas' leader in Gaza. His representative on the ground is expected to be Khalil al-Hayya. He is the deputy leader of Hamas. These will be what are typically known as proximity talks, meaning that Israeli and Hamas representatives will likely be in the same building, but not in the same room, which will still allow for the rapid passing of messages from one room to the other. But then, of course, what will need to happen, at least on Hamas' side, is that those messages will then need to be delivered to Sinwar, who is believed to be in tunnels underneath Gaza, and sometimes that can take hours, sometimes it can take days for the messages to be relayed to him and for him to relay his position back to the negotiating table. So, even in a best case scenario, there is no expectation that there will be any kind of a ceasefire agreement on Thursday. But, there is, of course, the possibility of progress. We have heard in recent days that Sinwar is eager to broker a ceasefire deal. The Israeli Prime Minister's allies have been saying that he is also inclined to try and reach a deal, regardless of the consequences it may have with his right-wing governing coalition. But, of course, that depends on which deal, which version of this proposal you're actually talking about. And for now, we know that there are still significant divisions between Israel and Hamas over this deal. Rahel.",

I think intelligence gathered by satellite and whatnot might indicate preparations. But, in terms of sort of zero hour, nobody really has an idea except the very top leadership of Hezbollah and in Iran.And we heard multiple times from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah that the wait is part of the punishment. That's the phrase he used several times in the sense that watching the Israelis on pins and needles, waiting for this attack, presumed attack from Hezbollah and Iran is part of the warfare, the psychological warfare. He was open about that. And therefore, when is this going to take place? Nobody really has a clear idea. There were suggestions that it would coincide with the Jewish holy day of Tisha B'Av, which marks the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem. That seems to have passed. Now, they're talking about holding off on an attack in anticipation of perhaps the slim possibility of progress at these 15th of August talks. But, even that is just a supposition, not based upon any actual real fact. So, I hate to say it, Rahel, we're just going to have to wait and see.",

We are now learning just how far Ukrainian forces say that they have pushed into Russia, 1,000 square kilometers. That's how much Russian territory Ukraine says that its forces now control, one week into a surprise cross-border incursion, and these advances have sparked a large wave of evacuations. These images from Russia's Defense Ministry are set to show military hardware being sent to the Kursk region. That's where the Ukrainian incursion is happening. Around 180,000 people are being told to evacuate their homes from the border regions, and an estimated 121,000 have already left. That's according to the acting head of the Kursk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin promising to, quote, \"kick the enemy out\", but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy not backing down.

      "sentences": "Well, the Ukrainians do expect that there will be a strong response at some point in time. In fact, there are some in Ukraine who believe that a response probably should have already happened on the part of the Russia. They are expecting one to already have happened from the Russians. One of the things that we've heard from Ukrainian officials, Rahel, is that they expect some sort of massive, gargantuan missile, drone and rocket strike, possibly by the Ukrainians. One Ukrainian official saying that they believe this would be a very tough task for Ukraine's air defenses, but they do believe that their Ukraine -- that their air defenses will be up to that task. They believe the Russians could possibly target government buildings, even more so than they have in the past.Of course, one of the things that we do know is that the Ukrainians have been receiving additional munitions for a lot of their air defense systems, especially from the U.S., but also from other European allies as well. So, they do believe that they could withstand such an onslaught, but that it would certainly be difficult for them. At the same time, you also do have the Russians, and this is something that they've shown in some of the videos that the Russians have published, bringing in more forces into that Kursk region, obviously trying to hold up Ukraine's advances, but at the same time also, of course, in the longer term, wanting to push the Ukrainians out of that territory. That is something that Vladimir Putin has told his generals in a meeting yesterday, is absolutely necessary for them to do right now, though, and we mentioned some of that in the run-up to this report. It seems as though the Ukrainians are still very much advancing, and there is an additional region now close to the city, or closer to the city, of course, in the Kursk region, where the Russians have now also urged people to evacuate from that area.

Both sides are. I mean, you have the Ukrainians on the one hand stating that they want to win back all of their territory, including Crimea. The Russians, for their part, and this especially coming from Vladimir Putin, vowing that all of Russia's aims of what they still call their special military operation will be met, which, of course, essentially would amount to a Ukrainian de-arming to a surrender and ceding a lot of territory on the part of Ukraine as well.However, the talk of possible negotiations has certainly been getting a lot louder recently. It was indeed very interesting, you're absolutely right, to hear the Ukrainian President say that he believes that the Russians need to be forced to negotiate if Vladimir Putin does not want to. Of course, this coming less than 24 hours after Vladimir Putin himself had said that he believes that the reason why the Ukrainians are conducting this incursion into Russian territory is because they want to improve their position, as he put it, at the negotiating table. So, it seems as though that prospect might be one that seems to be more real than it was before. But, at the same time, you do still have both sides saying that they want the maximum. They want their things that they want to be fulfilled. The Ukrainians saying they want all of their territory back, including Crimea. The Russians saying that they want a lot of Ukrainian territory, and they want Ukraine to disarm and never be part of NATO.",

So, a DDoS attack means distributed denial-of-service. Essentially, someone tries to overwhelm your systems by flooding them with traffic. And so, in this case, it could have been a DDoS attack, but it also very well could have just been that a ton of people wanted to tune in for this interview. Now, we just have to take Musk's word for it, of course, although there has been some third-party reporting from inside the company to suggest that it wasn't an attack and that people were just flooding the system. Overall, though, Rahel, X sees this is a huge win. About 15 minutes ago, I just got off the phone with X CEO Linda Yaccarino.

Last week, Linda and X sued a bunch of advertisers and a big advertising trade buddy, arguing on antitrust grounds that they were colluding to go against X. There was actually a pretty big win for them. The big ad trade group that they were targeting decided to disband. Linda told me that they expect that lawsuit to continue forward, that they're still going to be moving.But, in addition to taking some of these legal grounds, they're also really trying to push on the technical and the product side. That's why this big spaces event matters, because they can go to market and say, we can create events where there is a lot of eyeballs. Same thing too with the Olympics.

So, that is another indicator that this storm is becoming a bit more vertically stacked, and we could see some strengthening here quickly in the next 24 hours before it moves offshore from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and into the open waters the Atlantic. One thing is for sure. It will bring a lot of rainfall to this area, localized flooding rains. Of course, a lot of people want to know, where will this system go from here? Well, we do have a trough that will keep it off the East Coast of the U.S. But, one thing is for sure. All of our computer models coming into an agreement that Bermuda will feel some sort of impacts from this system as we head into the weekend, and whether or not that's a strong Category 2 or greater is still to be determined. There is a lot of warm water, hot there, above average rain, excuse me, water temperatures. But, in terms of the forecast wind gust, if we time it out, you can see Saturday midday. If this does come true, this is just one forecast model, but that Eastern quadrant of a hurricane, that, of course, is where we have some of the strongest winds, some of the worst weather of a hurricane. And this particular model shows Bermuda putting it on the eastern side of that so that, of course, that could be quite impactful for that island going forward, something we will monitor.

      "sentences": "They do like what it says, and I'll get to that in a moment. So, Rahel, this is the two hands again on the steering wheel. Last week, the U.S. economy, when we had that unemployment rising to 4.3 percent, fewer jobs created than expected, that stock market swerved and a lot of Americans were wondering what kind of confidence they could have in their own economy. This gives them a little bit of confidence back. So, you were just showing the trend line there, 2.2 percent year-over year. That is in line with what most would expect in a healthy economy that isn't careening with inflation.I will look, though, if you go month-over-month, it was -- expected was 0.2 percent, and then you see there, it actually came in at 0.1 percent. A reminder again, Rahel, that this is producer prices, right? It's a wholesale price. All eyes and good indicator leading into tomorrow, which is the Consumer Price Index. And when we talk about inflation, look, everyone remembers about old days, post-pandemic, where we were dealing with consumer prices sky high, right, nearing well above 10 percent there for a little while. We have now come back down to where the Federal Reserve wants to see it, inflation in or around two percent. This is despite the scare, as I said, we were having last week, given the jobs market. This definitely puts the Fed on track to lower interest rates likely in September. The question now, Rahel, is, how many more rate cuts can Americans expect, and what kind of a jump start will it give to the economy? That's what's on everyone's mind. As you can see, the market is doing really well. We'll lean into the Dow there, really kind of hopping on these numbers, understanding that there is nothing to worry about. But, look, look at the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ, really leaning into these numbers. And I'll have to say, Rahel, the market is pretty much making up all -- for all the damage that occurred last Monday when they got that unexpectedly bad jobs number.",

As you pointed out, we get the July CPI. Any sense of what we can expect there? NEWTON: I mean, look, it's supposed to -- when we have this kind of indicator from the wholesale prices, right, it gives us the indication that we are likely to see a very good inflation number, getting very close to that two percent inflation target. I hate to be the bear of bad news, though. What the market doesn't want to see, Rahel, is the fact that we're actually seeing inflation much lower than that, right, because that's going to be a signal to some that the economy is slowing. What most people are worried about right now is that those high interest rates have slowed the economy too much, and that we're scratching way too close to no growth. And that's not an issue so far. But again, just like your 401(k), don't look at it too often. And even in numbers like this, they can really make your head spin, because you can come up with theories for almost any number.
