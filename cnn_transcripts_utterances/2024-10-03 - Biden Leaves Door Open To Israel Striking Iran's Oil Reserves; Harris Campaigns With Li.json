      "sentences": "The calm before the counterstrike. President Biden is refusing to rule out an Israeli airstrike on Iranian oil reserves in retaliation for the latter's historic missile attack on America's ally earlier this week. Those discussions are ongoing according to the commander in chief who told reporters today, nothing's going to happen today.And this less than 24 hours after Biden declared that he does not support an Israeli air attack -- Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Joining me now is Republican Congressman Brian Mast of Florida. He's a member of the house foreign affairs committee, a decorated army combat veteran, and a purple heart recipient. Congressman, thank you for taking the time and joining me. I really appreciate it. So I want to get your response to the president's position there about his concerns, about an air attack on, an Israeli attack on nuclear facilities in Iran. Would you support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities? REP. BRIAN MAST (R), FLORIDA: Yes, let me start by answering in the affirmative. Yes, I would support that. And let's use a term that a lot of people are throwing around that they're worried about. They're worried about the idea of escalation. But I would argue, you know, when you use that term escalation, there's good and bad escalation. And when we're talking about this, this is a good escalation when you're ally is escalating the attack and preventing your enemy from escalating because they're destroying all of their forces or they're destroying what we were very worried about Iranian nuclear facilities. If they're destroying those things, that is a good escalation for us.",

Are you talking about hitting a silo somewhere? Are you talking about hitting an air base where there might be something hanging in the belly of an aircraft? There can be a number of different types of targets that you might be speaking of. But again, I would go back to the point that if our enemy is degrading and destroying their capabilities, the -- if our ally is degrading and destroying the capabilities of our enemy, then that is a good escalation.

That was the words they used on his efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election.So here's how the then president allegedly responded when he learned that Mike Pence was in peril on January 6th. It says, quote, \"An unnamed White House aide, according to the filing, ran to Trump when he received a phone call that Pence had been taken to a secure location in hopes that Trump would take action to ensure Pence's safety.\" So, Trump, according to the prosecutors, looked at the aide and simply replied, \"So what?\" What is your response to the President's apparent reaction to his then vice president, his life being in danger?",

That's the point I would make, number one. This has political intentions. They want to affect November 5th, but you look at this and you layer it upon what's happened already this week. You had bureaucrats in this administration in the VA trying to unseal and illegally access the information of the vice presidential candidates like J.D. Vance and Tim Walz. We had this in the past when the department of defense did this in the last election, when they did it with representatives, Anna Paulina Luna and Zach Nunn and others, when the DOD unsealed their files. We've had the CIA go out there and say, hey, listen, these Hunter Biden things with the laptop, that's all false information, Russian disinformation.

I think that's why she's standing alongside Kamala Harris. And I think it degrades all credibility. I don't think she pulls one vote from the GOP or President Trump in any way whatsoever.

He refused to answer questions until this week as to whether or not he would veto a national abortion ban if he was reelected. He finally said this year that or this week that he would do that, but at the same time it's still Donald Trump and he has sought time after time to get credit while trying to avoid the topic for the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This was him at the recent debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: For 52 years, they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade. into the states and through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices, we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.
