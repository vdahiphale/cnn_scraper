But this certainly came as a surprise. It was an indication of his support. And him weighing in, of course, comes at a time where the vice president is trying to shore up votes with Latinos, especially Hispanic men, and also with black voters.

LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR GOV. BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  Well, Jim, I've said it many times in the show. I think it's best when Republicans stick to the issues because I think they're going to do very well next week if they stick to the issues. And, look, I don't think voters do the whole guilt by association thing usually with politicians, unless you're Kamala Harris, who's been V.P. to Joe Biden the last four years. I think that's the guilt by association that's been going on. But I would just point to the Kamala Harris super PAC over the weekend put out a memo saying to the campaign, you need to stop the attacks on Donald Trump's character because they're not working. And that got me thinking that Democrats don't have much of a leg to stand on when it comes to the heated rhetoric. Tim Walz himself, before this event even happened over the weekend, was comparing it to a Nazi rally that happened in the 1930s. The last several weeks of the Harris campaign have been spent talking about Donald Trump as a fascist, saying he's a threat to democracy, comparing him to Hitler.

He hasn't had one day, one day in over 3,418 days, one day where he's been over 50 percent. Why? Because the country just doesn't want him. They just don't. If the Republicans put up somebody sensible and nonracist and, I mean, non- fascist, they'd be winning this thing in a walk, just telling you candidly. But they, they have a cult of personality around a personality that the majority of the country just doesn't want. And I do think Kamala should point out not only the things his generals and staff are saying, but also the things that Mr. Trump has said, where he wants to cut taxes for the rich and put a sales tax through tariffs of $4,000 on the middle class. I think that is a wonderful contrast to Kamala Harris, who wants to help small business with a $50,000 deductibility, wants to help first time homebuyers $25,000 aid, who wants to help people stuck in that sandwich caring for child care and elder care.
