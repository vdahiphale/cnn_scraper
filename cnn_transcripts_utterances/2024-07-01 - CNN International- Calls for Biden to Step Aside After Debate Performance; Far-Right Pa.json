      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Rosemary Church.Today, President Joe Biden is mulling over whether to stay in the 2024 presidential race. This following a devastating performance at the first debate on Thursday, CNN is now learning from top advisers that Biden's family encouraged him to stay in the race during a trip to Camp David this weekend. And earlier I spoke with Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, and I asked him what he thinks about the pressure President Biden is facing following his dismal performance at the presidential debate last week.

Now if that happened, what is the process for replacing him at the convention in August, and who would be positioned to take his place? Is anyone able to take on Trump at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, the process could charitably be described as chaos. And again, you know, Democrats have had some experience with that over the years. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.But there is no plan. There's nothing in the party rules that contribute to the solution to this, other than the fact that Joe Biden would have to do it as soon as possible to give the party enough time to organize the selection of his substitute. And of course his vice president, Kamala Harris, is going to insist that she's next in line and certainly would be a candidate. But I think there would be others who would be interested. But who organizes this? Would it fall to former President Obama and maybe former President Clinton and Hillary Clinton and Speaker Pelosi? You know, you can think of a group of people that might be able to pull it off. But it would be difficult, and while the party lacks leadership for the presidential election, the Republicans aren't going to just be sitting there. They're going to be organizing, airing negative ads, raising more money, and probably moving up in the polls. So this is really hard to figure out. You know, both pathways could lead to destruction. So which one do you pick? (END VIDEOTAPE) CHURCH (on camera): Let's go to Max Foster now in Paris, where he's covering the French parliamentary elections. And Max, these snap elections were always a gamble for President Macron, weren't they? And that appears to have backfired.",

And they do show the national rally leading, just over 33 percent of the vote, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front coalition in second, with nearly 28 percent. Mr. Macron's centrist alliance is in third, with nearly 21 percent. I should say that 76 of the seats have been confirmed, which is very unusual for a first round. 76 candidates got absolute majorities. Very few of them, we're not sure if any at all, were from Macron's party. They were all from the left and the far right. The far right doing very well. So all signs are that the far right is coming on extremely strong. National Rally leader Jordan Bardella urged voters to remain mobilized, though, for the second round, which is next Sunday. He says it's clear the French people do want change.

The vote taking place next Sunday is one of the most decisive in the entire history of the Fifth Republic. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is extremely dangerous.

And I really believe in this idea that Macron had, which is the depassement. It's, you know, we're going to do politics differently.I think what happened over the past two years in the National Assembly is that you had a very radicalized opposition to the left and to the right. And they were all trying to make this unbearable. We had a number record of motion censure, you know, that's when you try to destitute the government.

And the Republicain, which was the central force to the right with whom we could have made alliances, and we tried, I mean, we tried to make alliances with them and with the socialists, and they said, clearly, we are going to have a motion censure that is going to make you, you know, the government down, and you're going to have to have a dissolution.During budgetary times, when times are tough in the European Union, I don't know what would have been the worst.

There's not a lot of rain at the moment, but the wind is terribly noticeable.At this particular stage, 12 hours ago, I think the prediction would have been that this hurricane, which like you said, has been downgraded to a Cat 3, that it would have impacted much deeper into Barbados. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Barbados is indeed getting a lot of outer bands from this particular hurricane. But it is moving closer towards the islands of, let's say, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and moving further south of Barbados. So it might not impact as we might have thought. However, there is still going to be some impact as the wind is terribly high at this particular stage.",
