      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, Trump's legal team just hours away from facing the judge in the January 6th case in court for the first time. This as the special counsel Jack Smith wants to start Trump's trial January 2nd.And the death toll rising in Maui as search and rescue operations are frantically underway. I'm going to speak to a woman who narrowly escaped a wall of flames. Her incredible story. Plus, all the Republican presidential candidates heading to Iowa, our John King just returned from there, talking to voters, and he will be at the magic wall tonight for us. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, face-to-face, Trump's team set to meet Judge Tanya Chutkan in the courtroom hours from now. Chutkan is the judge overseeing the January 6th case, and their meeting comes as the clock is ticking. Trump now on notice to reply to Jack Smith's formal request for the trial in the January 6th case to begin, January 2nd, 2024. That would put the DOJ case to hold Trump to account for trying to overturn the election ahead of all but one case that Trump currently faces. Only the civil case in New York alleging fraud is scheduled to start sooner. It is a bold move by the DOJ, and Trump personally tonight responding moments ago referring again to, quote, deranged Jack Smith, adding, quote, only an out of touch lunatic would ask for such a date, one day into the new year. Trump adding the trial should, quote, only happen, if at all, all caps, after the election. It was part of an invective Trump lobbied today in social media post, referring to, quote, fake indictments, saying prosecutors are trying to, quote, rig and steal another election. Now, Trump's lawyers no doubt don't want their client posting his usual screed of venomous accusations and threats, but they will almost certainly file a request for a much later trial date after the election, as he indicates. Well, that's what they did in the Mar-a-Lago case where team Trump, again, appeared to be dragging their feet. In Florida, Trump's co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago case, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira appeared in court. Now, Nauta pleading not guilty, but de Oliveira causing a delay, receiving a postponement because he still hasn't gotten a Florida-based lawyer. But even with the constant drumbeat of delays and hearings, the wheels of justice are turning. In Michigan tonight, all of the 16 people charged in the fake elector scheme have now pleaded not guilty. They each face eight felony charges including multiple counts of forgery, which I want to note are each punishable by 14 years in prison in Michigan. And in Atlanta, the courthouse tonight under tight security with blocked off streets as all eyes remain on district attorney Fani Willis, who is expected to issue more than a dozen indictments there including possibly another set of criminal charges for the former President Trump. Let's start with Katelyn Polantz tonight in Washington with all these developments. So, Katelyn, prosecutors have come out and they filed, they want a January 2nd start date for Trump's election interference case, as early as obviously the first day of the New Year you could have a case begin. Trump, of course, railing against that on social media. When do you expect his attorneys, though, to officially respond?",

As you said, quite plausibly, they would be asking for after the election. Now, whether the judge would want to do that, that seems pretty unlikely. This judge has indicated she wants to move things along in this case.But what the prosecutors are asking for here, it's not just a January 2nd start date of the trial itself, they actually want jury selection to begin just four months from now in December before the holidays, so a jury can be seated and then the trial can kick off right after the New Year. So that's a pretty aggressive time line, and the prosecutors say they want that because it's of public importance that this deserves a prompt resolution. He's running for president, and this is about a former president conspiring to overturn the legitimate results of the presidential election. Trump's team, they have their own arguments that they'll make, things about presidential immunity, First Amendment, those will come later. Tomorrow, there is a hearing in this case, Erin. It's not going to be about this. That's going to have to wait for the next hearing very likely. What tomorrow is going to be about whenever these parties do go before Judge Tanya Chutkan in D.C. for the very first time. [19:05:03] It's going to be about evidence handling, how much Donald Trump can speak publicly about what he's learning that the Justice Department has in their evidence before trial. We're also watching to see how the judge responds, not just to the legal arguments they're making and what terms she sets there on the edge, but also if she responds to any of these social media posts Trump has been making that are quite aggressive about both her and the Justice Department prosecutors and others in this case, Mike Pence, and also if she might be commenting on how many TV appearances that his lawyer has made, John Lauro, he's been on TV multiple times, and the prosecutors have raised that as well.",

That's just what we know about after extreme flooding near Beijing. The death toll is almost three times, a figure given by Chinese officials just last week.Ivan Watson is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A rare moment of defiance in China. Angry residents on the steps of a municipal government building in the city of Bazhou. Their sign says: give me back my home. The flood was caused by water discharge, not by heavy rainfall. At some point, men with police shields disperse the crowd. The incident took place after deadly floods caused by the heaviest rains to hit northeastern China in 140 years. A typhoon that killed dozens of people in and around the Chinese capital Beijing forcing the evacuation of more than a million people from their homes. Over the last two weeks, these three provinces all saw dramatic flooding, but we're learning that some communities weren't just damaged by a natural disaster. The small city of Bazhou, where the protest took place, was deliberately flooded by authorities following a government disaster plan aimed at protecting bigger cities like Beijing and Tianjin. At 2:00 a.m. on August 1st, authorities activated a flood control plan, releasing water from dams into flood storage and detention zones. They then had to evacuate more than 800,000 people living in those zones, which quickly flooded. State TV showed the communist party chief of Hebei province touring the disaster area, instructing subordinates to reduce flooding pressure on Beijing, and vowing to resolutely be the capital's moat. In the event of a crisis, experts say countries often plan to redirect rising water, but usually towards flood zones that are unpopulated.",
