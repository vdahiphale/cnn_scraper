We want to warn you that some of the video you're about to see may be disturbing. Now, this plane went down near Aktau, Kazakhstan, after a reported bird strike. Rescuers were there in moments, putting out flames and pulling survivors from the wreckage. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now from London. Nada, what more do we know about this crash?",

At this stage, according to authorities, the preliminary information that they have received suggests that the pilot may have attempted that emergency landing as a result of a bird strike.Now, as you mentioned, we have seen footage emerging from eyewitnesses from locals nearby who filmed the plane ahead of that crash circling the airfield somewhat erratically before crashing and bursting into flames. And we have seen distressing video emerging showing some of those passengers on board emerging from the wreckage, some of them injured and bloodied. But as you mentioned, it is remarkable that authorities have confirmed that at least 29 people survived the crash. There were, of course, 67 people on board, 65 passengers, five crew members, 29 are confirmed to have survived at this stage. They have been taken to hospital for medical attention. But of course, there are dozens feared dead and that investigation is still ongoing. Authorities are still working to confirm the status of those remaining passengers on board. And of course, this will be a deeply worrying and anxious time for family members and loved ones of those who were on board the plane. And we are tracking this, waiting to get more details. Of course, not only around the cause, but also the status of the passengers on board. But at this stage, that is the information that we have received from authorities and we'll be tracking this to get more updates as they come in -- Danny.",
