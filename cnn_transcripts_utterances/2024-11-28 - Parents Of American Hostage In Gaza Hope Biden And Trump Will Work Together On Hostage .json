Will the Israel-Hezbollah truce open up an opportunity for a ceasefire with Hamas? What are you picking up on?",

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden has made clear that he wants to spend his final weeks in office really drilling in on this issue, trying to secure the release of these hostages, returning them back to their loved ones, and also find an end to this war in Gaza. But there are very real questions about whether that could actually become a reality.But for the families of the American hostages who are still believed to be held in Gaza they are really viewing this Lebanon ceasefire as a potential opportunity. A hope that they could potentially have their loved ones return sometime soon. We have heard from senior administration officials that they feel that the Lebanon ceasefire really could potentially push Hamas back to the negotiating table. I know that we have both spoken with the parents of Omer Neutra, an Israeli American who is still in Hamas. His parents, Rona and Orna Neutra, told me yesterday that they really want to see President Biden and President-elect Trump work together to try to secure some type of deal. We know that President Biden and Trump spoke about the Middle East conflict -- and specifically, the need to get those hostages out -- when they met in the Oval Office about two weeks ago. And the White House team has kept the Trump transition team fully abreast of the developments, including on that Lebanon ceasefire. What remains unclear at this moment is whether there is any actual strategizing for how the two men could work together. They obviously have their own relationships and have their own leverage in the region. That is something that the family -- the Neutra family really wants to see both of them tap into. They told me yesterday that the hostages don't have until Inauguration Day to wait. That it's time for President Biden and President-elect Trump to work together on this. The White House team has said that they anticipate trying to keep the Trump team fully abreast of their moves relating to this Middle East conflict as they are hoping that somehow they can find an end to this war before Biden leaves office.",

She said in part, \"We reiterate that Mexico's position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples.\" Joining me now to talk about this is CNN's Maria Cardona, political commentator and Democratic strategist.

And what I mean by that is that today, Jim, border crossings are less than they were when Donald Trump was in office four years ago.And that is because of the diplomacy of the Biden-Harris administration. Because of the negotiations that they have put in place. Because of the two executive orders that they did over the summer, one of which was strengthening asylum requirements, and the second one was expanding legal pathways. We all know that is the path forward for fixing our immigration system. And President Sheinbaum -- la presidenta Sheinbaum is no pushover, and we are seeing that now. She understands that the negotiations that have taken place are what has minimized and diminished the crossings at the border. She's going to continue to work with this administration and with the incoming administration. She is not going to suffer any fools.

And like every year, the Lions are going to get things started.But as you just mentioned, these aren't your Uncle Larry's Lions. This is the first time ever on Thanksgiving, Jim, that the Lions are the favorites to win the Super Bowl. Detroit 10-1 on the season. They're tied with the Chiefs for the best record in the league right now. And they've been outscoring their opponents by an average of more than 16 points a game. They're huge 10-point favorites today against a Bears team that's lost five straight. But recent history kind of working against the Lions. They have not won on Thanksgiving since 2016. And quarterback Jared Goff -- he's been a part of the last three losses, and he says well, he really wants to get the win for the fans but also for his family. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In 2016, Wanda Dench accidentally invited Jamal Hinton to her Thanksgiving dinner. She thought she was texting one of her grandchildren. The text went, instead, to Jamal and he jokingly asked if he could come over anyway. Wanda invited him in and the two have celebrated every Thanksgiving together since.And this year Wanda has shared she has been diagnosed with breast cancer and is receiving chemotherapy, but she says she won't let that stop her and Hinton's annual tradition. Wanda Dench and Jamal Hinton join us now. First of all, Wanda, you know, my heart goes out to you and everything that you're going through right now. But this is such a special story and when I heard about this I just thought there's just no way this can be true, but it is true. WANDA DENCH, ACCIDENTALLY INVITED STRANGER TO THANKSGIVING DINNER (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes, it is. It came as a surprise to me, especially at my age. I'm 67 now. And breast cancer doesn't run in my family, so I didn't think that this was ever going to be an issue in my life. But it's here and I'm dealing with it, and it's been a journey and an awakening.",
