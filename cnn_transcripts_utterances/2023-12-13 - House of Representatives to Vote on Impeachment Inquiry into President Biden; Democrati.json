There's a big distinction between what's happening now and what the Democrats do. Those were rushed sham impeachments. They did it quickly. They did not follow any of the procedures that I just described. We have three committees investigating this and following the truth where they lead, and they have no option in doing anything else.

I want to start with what I was asking Lauren Fox about, because I do think it's a critical question. When Republicans say this is just opening and formalizing an inquiry, is there any way you see this not ending in a vote to impeach President Biden?REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, (D-NY) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  That remains to be seen. What we do know is that there is zero evidence that President Biden has engaged in an impeachable offense. There is zero evidence that President Biden has engaged in any wrongdoing whatsoever. There is zero evidence that President Biden has broken the law. The Republicans have now reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents, heard from many witnesses, and they can't find a scintilla of evidence to justify this impeachment inquiry. It is happening because the puppet master in chief, the former, twice impeached, so-called president of the United States of America has ordered them to launch this impeachment inquiry as a political hit job on President Joe Biden.",

The Inflation Reduction Act to strike a blow again the climate crisis. The largest investment in combatting the climate crisis by any country in the history of the world. We've lowered the cost of insulin to $35 a month, and we are bringing domestic manufacturing jobs back home to the United States of America.

Fifty percent of the territory initially captured by Russia has been recaptured. More than 300,000 casualties have been inflicted upon the Russian army. We have to continue that war effort, and, of course, make sure that we deal with our other national security priorities.
