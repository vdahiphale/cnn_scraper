      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Jess.And this is not the first time that the U.S. has actually struck facilities linked to Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq over the last month. This is a serious escalation, though, because while there have been over 100 attacks by these Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria over the last two-plus months or so, the injuries that they have caused to U.S. service members have typically been very minor, and they have largely returned to duty in a couple of days. But this attack carried out yesterday by this group apparently caused at least one service member to suffer a critical injury, and that is very serious. And, clearly, it made the U.S. believe that they had to respond in a very serious way. And so they launched these airstrikes against these facilities, the ultimate goal being to try to degrade the infrastructure that they used, right, to launch the drones, launch the rockets that they are using to carry out these attacks. And according to Central Command, a couple of those Hezbollah members are believed to have been killed. They say that at this point they don't believe any civilians were injured in this. But the Iraqi government, as you mentioned, there is not happy about this, especially because this is the second time in just over a month that the U.S. has launched these kinds of airstrikes in Iraq. And they say it's a violation of their sovereignty. But, if you ask the Pentagon, they will say, look, we are going to do everything we can to protect service members. We are going to retaliate. We are not going to just let this slide. And it raises a lot of questions about what the Iraqi government is doing, whether they are doing enough to protect U.S. service members who are in the country right now. Clearly, the Defense Department and the Pentagon don't believe so.",

Christopher, as Priscilla reported there, Netanyahu's confidant Ron Dermer meeting today with White House officials. And let's set the scene for this, because there's a chasm. Even as these two parties try to stress that they are united, you have, as Priscilla mentioned there, the U.S. saying Israel's promised they're going to move to lower-intensity fighting. But over the weekend, you have Bibi talking about a long fight, some time until the end, in intensifying the fight in Gaza over the weekend. Tell us about what they need to get past here this divide. CHRISTOPHER O'LEARY, FORMER U.S. GOVERNMENT DIRECTOR OF HOSTAGE RECOVERY:  Well, the White House is in a very difficult position. They want to be supportive of Israel, one of our closest allies in the Middle East, who were the recipients of a horrific terrorist attack on October 7. But at the same time, the way they have prosecuted this war is not effective at countering terrorism. For anybody who's worked these matters before, we're perplexed and frustrated. It's also not effective at finding and recovering hostages. So, the White House has got to wrestle with that, but also with the families. The American families have been very supported by the White House. And this administration and previous administrations hear those families all of the time. But at a certain point, they want action, and these families are seeing the way this war is being prosecuted, and they're being frustrated as well.",

I will tell you, the CENTCOM, General Kurilla, who I served with in Afghanistan, the number one priority that he has is the protection of his soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are deployed out there. But to be a professional in this business, you have to understand that this is a dangerous space you're working in.

This is within the rules of the game right now, this level of violence. If the U.S. was to strike Iranian interests in Iran or ships in the Gulf, that might escalate things, for sure.

So, it was a hotly contested question of whether Donald Trump is an insurrectionist under the law and can be on the ballot in the 2024 election. Four of the seven justices in Colorado ruled against Trump. And then, within two days, the Denver police had to respond to what they said was a hoax report, but a threat towards one of the justices, going to that justice's home in response there as law enforcement. And then we also are learning that law enforcement are picking up just a lot of discussion in extremist forums, pro-Trump forums online, talking about these justices by name. Those threats at this time are nonspecific, not saying:  I have plans to kill X. But, instead, they are more generally very violent language. And that is something that we have seen across the country, especially in response to political cases like this. It's something that law enforcement has watched very closely. There have been threats against many judges involved in cases related to Donald Trump, including someone who was arrested for a threat to Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's overseeing his criminal case. There's Supreme Court justices receiving threats. In this situation in Colorado, the FBI gets involved. And they say now they're aware of the situation and working with law enforcement. \"We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions, regardless of motivation.\" But there are thousands of threats a year that are coming into public officials. It's something very much on law enforcement's top of mind right now.",

I know this personally. I'm married to a judge. And so you sort of have a sense of sort of what that security apparatus is. And they take any threats, even if they're vague, pretty seriously at this stage, partially because the sanctity of the courtroom actually has to be protected when you think about all the cases that are going on right now. But these generic threats are very hard to not only find out who's doing them or who might be responsible for them, but they're very hard to prosecute. People have a First Amendment right to say, we don't like these judges, these judges shouldn't be judges anymore. It's when it gets to sort of specific violence against named individuals or even against just the Supreme Court itself in Colorado that an investigation can be started. But part of this also, I have to say, is what -- is incitement for others. So, when you see all this sort of stuff on social media that we have been seeing, partially, the fear for law enforcement is, who else is getting radicalized by this, right? So it's not the people that you're following. It's someone who's reading it, right? So, a politician or someone in a leadership position is sort of throwing out sort of -- as I say, just being very casual about violence, which we shouldn't be,and then someone who might be more inclined to take to arms or violence or threats.

One is, Trump isn't hiding it. And I don't need to pretend both sides here, right? I mean, there's the potentially the lead candidate for the GOP who's going to get the nomination is utilizing language and violence and the threat of violence as a way to rally his people, get support, and his party is sort of ignoring it. They're not sort of condemning it. And I think that then creates an atmosphere in which violence becomes more permissive. That's what's happening here is this permissive structure. The second is, if he gets the nomination, he could win. And then if there's a win at the end of 2024, that's when I don't know how to -- I tend not to have my hair on fire. I don't know how to explain or curb how the violence unfolds if Donald Trump does become president. And that's what I have been writing about, is just sort of there's -- there'd be no check on it. And so, in both cases, we need to monitor it. We need to call it out in the media. And, hopefully, people, members of the voting public will see the potential and condemn it in the way that the public can, which is through their votes.",
