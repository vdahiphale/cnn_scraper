First Ukraine claiming responsibility for an attack on the vital bridge connecting Russia to the annexed peninsula of Crimea. A source inside Ukraine's security service says it was a joint operation with Ukraine's naval forces. Russian saying the attack was carried out by two Ukrainian seaborne drones. Ukrainian intelligence says the damage will create difficulties for Russian forces who use the bridge as a, quote, \"major logistics hub\" for moving resources into the territory. And that comes as we also learn just a few hours ago that Russia is pulling out of a crucial deal that allows Ukraine to safely export grain to the world. Let's get straight to CNN's Alex Marquardt, live in Odessa, Ukraine, with more. And Alex, when it comes to the bridge specifically, tell people why this is such a critical hub for Russia.",

It really does symbolize the Russian annexation of Crimea, which Ukrainians very much consider to still be part of their country. It connects Southern Russia with the Crimean Peninsula. It's used for both civilian and military purposes.It is absolutely vital to carry people and products from Russia into -- into Russian-occupied Crimea. It has both a roadway, as well as train tracks that run both ways. Food supplies, fuel, military supplies going both ways. And what we understand is that Ukraine has claimed responsibility. That in and of itself is quite extraordinary. When we see these brazen attacks, both in Russian-occupied Ukraine and in Russia itself, Ukraine almost never claims responsibility. Usually, they're quite coy. This morning, they are saying very clearly that we were responsible for this attack. It was carried out, as you said, by the Ukrainian security services, called the SBU, in a joint operation with the navy. Russia, of course, calling this is a terrorist attack, saying it took place around 3 a.m. in the morning, so around 10 hours ago, by those sea drones. And so this will have significant ramifications. Just to talk to the symbolism a little bit more, this was opened back in 2018. It cost billions of dollars. And at the opening, Putin himself drove a truck across it. And last time this bridge was attacked, some nine months ago, which Ukraine, by the way, did not claim, we saw the biggest number of Russian strikes against Ukraine since the war began last February -- guys.",

As you said, five people were ultimately recovered and pronounced dead. And perhaps no one was more impacted than this family of six. And I want to tell you a little bit about what we know about this family. A family of six, including a mother, a father, a grandmother and three children. They were all here visiting from Charleston, South Carolina. Then that floodwater hit on Saturday evening. I just want to say, a father and 4-year-old son, they were able to escape. The grandmother also was swept away but was able to be rescued. But the mother, we learned yesterday, she was pronounced dead after being discovered by first responders. And then as you say, a 9-month- old boy and his 2-year-old sister both still missing at this time. That's what first responders -- that's who first responders, I should say, are going to be searching for all throughout the day. Take a listen also to what Governor Josh Shapiro said when he appeared at a press conference yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.
