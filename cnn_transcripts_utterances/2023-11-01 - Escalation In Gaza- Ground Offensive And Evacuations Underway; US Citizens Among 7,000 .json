Just short of the 491 that had been planned to get out today. What we've been hearing from Egyptian officials is that that may be because either some of those who were pencilled to come in, whose name was on the list, didn't make it to the crossing or simply refused to cross because their family members weren't on that list.I think that's an important reminder of just how difficult this process is going to be and full with chaos and complications over the coming days. Still those foreign nationals that first group that I mentioned of 391 include Australians, Austrians, British, French, Italian, Jordanian, Saudi citizens and as you just heard a moment ago. Apparently they've been joined by the very first American nationals to make their way through the Rafah crossing and really that's been a remarkable development when you consider that this group of some 7,000 by certain estimates of foreign and dual nationals had been trapped inside Gaza ever since Israel announced its total siege. Many of them had moved southwards when they'd heard the Israeli order to evacuate because of the bombing that was new in the north of the Gaza Strip. They evacuated, the gate had been closed and suddenly this breakthrough in these negotiations this morning. They've been mediated by Qatar and they've been extremely complex. I think it's important to remember that you're talking about negotiations between Israel, Egypt, Hamas, the United States, Qatar, essentially many different parties not necessarily speaking to each other and with many different conditions and difficulties and priorities along the way. Still for the families of those either still trapped inside or those who've now made their way-out. Tremendous news and really something of a breakthrough. We simply hadn't expected it earlier this morning. It's come very suddenly and what we see are very encouraging signs that this Rafah crossing will remain open. We understand that the deal will involve the extraction, the ability to leave for all foreign and dual nationals that are still inside. And I think it's important to mention also that a separate group of Palestinians this time have been allowed out of the Gaza Strip for the first time since the war began. Some of those most severely wounded that are now being evacuated to a field hospital and we understand that there will be more to follow.",

We understand that a small number of Americans could end up being processed and ultimately exit today. And that more will follow in the coming days. And ultimately, if everything goes well, U.S. officials believe that 5000 people or upwards of 5000 people could ultimately end up leaving. Remember the State Department had previously said that there are some 400 American citizens in Gaza trying to leave. And that there were an additional 5000 other foreign nationals that were also trying to leave the strip.This deal, of course, has been weeks in the making and has been incredibly complicated. Conversations between multiple parties. And one thing that we are learned today was that one of the demands that Hamas had made was for some of its own fighters to be released from Gaza as part of the group of injured Palestinians out that are going to be leaving the strip. And that that demand had been rejected. Of course, there were complications and complexities coming from the Egyptian side as well. Concerns about people, Palestinians being sort of permanently displaced and staying in Egypt. And we also know that as the process unfolds of people entering Egypt, authorities there are very keen on making sure that there is a thorough vetting of every person that is going to enter the country. So, needless to say, there is a huge sigh of relief that this deal has been struck. But one thing that this is not, just to emphasize, is a release of hostages. Those conversations are still ongoing. And obviously, there's not been a breakthrough on that front yet.",

What I can tell you is what the IDF spokesperson unit released yesterday, and that is that Israel targeted a top Hamas commander who was hiding, along with other many Hamas terrorists, in a massive terror tunnel complex in that area. This is the only reason why Israel operated there. We said that we will get to the perpetrators of the October 7th massacre, and we mean it.We will get to them one after the other. We want to minimize civilian casualties as we do that, but as you know, in every war since the dawn of history, there are unfortunately tragedies and civilian casualties. But I was listening to your reporting earlier and let me just ask you this. You know that there were more German civilian casualties in World War II than American or British? That doesn't mean that the Germans were the good guys, right, and that the allies were the bad guys, right? We're talking about a Jihadists Nazi ideology that has to be eradicated.

They're hiding underneath civilian urban structures such as hospitals and youth centers and schools. And of course, we're not targeting them. We want to minimize the civilian casualty, and Hamas are the ones who are putting them in harm's way. We called on them to evacuate from the north for this exact reason.",

So, we need to mount, to ratchet up the pressure on Hamas because it is working in that respect of the report that you just mentioned, and it is also working in the respect of the hostages.This is why they released 4 hostages so far.

Job gains have moderated in recent months but remained strong. That is a nod to some of the strong economic data we have seen in the past couple weeks. But right now, the Fed is in a rest and assess moment. They want to see what the previous 11 rate hikes are going to do to the economy.But as we know for everyday Americans, if the Fed raises rates, that increases borrowing. So, we're looking at right now mortgage rates nearly topping 8%. Any new car loans, student loans, credit cards, Americans are feeling the pain of higher borrowing costs. So, the Fed has obviously taken that into account, at the same time pointing to better than expected, better than expected data we've seen, like GDP, stronger job growth and continued consumer spending. Taking those together, they still feel like this is a moment to pause. Now, consumers, though, have how they're feeling about the economy, which may look a little bit different. We know that despite the fact that consumers are spending, they're putting a lot on credit cards. And that is one of the ways that folks are still grappling with this high inflation. And also, for three months in a row now, Boris, we have seen consumer confidence fall. So those are indicators that Americans are still grappling with these higher prices. Now, the Fed is going to be meeting again in December. In their September meeting, they have explained that they are going to bake in another hike at some point this year. That December meeting will be the last opportunity, Boris, for them to do that as they are trying to hit this soft landing and get inflation back to that 2% target that they're looking for, Boris.",
