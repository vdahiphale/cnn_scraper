CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz is joining us right now. Katelyn, once again, this is regarding the criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election here in the United States. What do we know about this letter?KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Wolf, this is quite the development coming from Donald Trump himself announcing that the Justice Department is essentially telling him just a few days ago, on Sunday, through a letter that he is very likely to face a criminal charge in the ongoing investigation into what he and others were doing after the 2020 election to hold on to his presidency even though he had lost. Wolf, it is quite significant for the Justice Department to take a step like this. It is the sort of thing that happens at the very end of a criminal investigation. And with Donald Trump, it is the sort of thing that you do when you are formally giving him the opportunity to come to you and potentially make your own case or speak to the grand jury in your defense. That is what happened before he was indicted in the Southern District of Florida for the documents case. A totally separate criminal case as far as we know. But the special counsel's office is now telling him that their investigation around January six and the 2020 election appears to be at its very near end, Trump can come into the grand jury if he would like to by Thursday of this week. That's what he says. And they are indicating with this that he is very likely to be indicted. Now, this is a sprawling investigation that has taken place over many, many months, even prior to Special Counsel Jack Smith's appointment. But the Justice Department is very tight-lipped right now as to exactly what's coming in a case here if Trump will have any co- conspirators or if it will be a conspiracy case, meaning it would be against multiple people. What the charges might be? A lot of questions because of how sprawling this investigation has been. And we saw Jack Smith on the street today getting a sandwich at Subway in DC, and he had nothing to say. And so, we don't have much more than just watching that grand jury in and out doing their work in the federal courthouse in Washington, DC.",

But yesterday, the judge also notified the two sides that she wanted them to also discuss a potential trial date.This is something that the special counsel has been pushing to try to get on the books. They said that they could be ready to start a trial in December. The Trump team has said that they don't want the judge to even set a trial date just yet because they say there's a lot of litigation that is yet to still be decided. They say that they want to challenge a number of things, including the authority of the special counsel whether the documents are even classified. Of course, which is something that is not really an issue in this case. That said, the judge is expected to -- she could, for instance, decide that she can set a trial date at least one that could be moved later on. The other thing, Jake, that we're watching for, obviously, is the fact that this is Aileen Cannon who was appointed by the former president. She ruled very favorably to him a few months ago and got slapped down by the conservative 11 Circuit Court. So, the question we all are obviously watching closely here for -- from the judge is whether she is showing any of that deference to Donald Trump, the former president. It's something that the 11th circuit called into question. Said essentially, just because he's a former president, doesn't mean you should -- you should create new rules for him, Jake.",

But we've got a little bit of a traffic jam coming here when it comes to scheduling all of these trials. We know already that the Manhattan DA's trial is scheduled to start at the end of March 2024. That'll carry into April.So, the question is -- the first question is, can they try the federal Mar-a-Lago case in Florida before that? We could get a trial date, perhaps in January or February. Or will they try to -- try that case after that? But the problem is now you're into the summer of 2024, which, of course, is the height of the political season. And on top of those cases, we could well have a third federal indictment coming up for January six for Donald Trump. And I don't know where they fit that in.",

John Eastman's attorney obviously, has said no, sort of others.And so, I think that's the question they're trying to figure out the next piece of the puzzle. Because what they had been suspecting if Trump were to be charged in this, which of course he hasn't, so far, would that it be would surround potential conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding with his efforts, obviously, with what happened on January six related to the Oval Office meetings they had, trying to get Pence to do things that he didn't have the authority to do. So, we don't know what the charge is going to be. We do know -- I mean they know what it could potentially be because it's mentioned in the target letter. So, that's what remains to be seen here.",

And this is a Trump adviser that worked with Donald Trump in the White House and then continued to work with him after the presidency.So, there is a lot going on here. I'm starting with that because it's this point that allows us to see this grand jury is still active. They do expect testimony to be coming on Thursday. But, Jake, this -- the sweep of this investigation is so extensive. This is an investigation on so many fronts. It has looked into Trump's knowledge that he lost the election, it is looked into the fake electoral scheme that he used in battleground states, there's been grand jury testimony about and from even his vice president, Mike Pence, on the pressure surrounding him to block the vote and the result of the election. There's also information that the prosecutors have brought in related to what happened at the Justice Department using that federal agency to try and support Donald Trump even when he lost to give him cover for disinformation. There's also been testimony about threats, intimidation, outreach in battleground states, and a crucial December 18 White House meeting that really went off the rails with a discussion of a special counsel seizing voting machines. And then, of course, fundraising has also been part of this. And when you put this all together, you have a true laundry list of witnesses that have been before the grand jury in Washington, DC on this investigation or have already spoken to prosecutors. People who've testified to the grand jury, I mentioned Mike Pence. He's not even one of the most significant ones. He's pretty significant, but White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also testified to the grand jury. People from the White House Counsel's Office testified to the grand jury. Donald Trump's son-in- law, Jared Kushner. One of his closest advisors, Hope Hicks, who was telling him that he lost the election. And they had a very narrow window into what Trump was doing and was very dissatisfied with what he is doing. The grand jury has heard from those people on top of what they had already said to the January six select committee on Capitol Hill. And then there had been interviews. Interviews of state officials, secretaries of state in battleground states where the election was nearly going off the rails because of Donald Trump's efforts. Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Michigan, even Wisconsin, and Arizona. So, many different people that the special counsel's office has talked to get a full picture of not just what was happening in Washington and on Capitol Hill on January six, in the White House, on the mall at the ellipse, but what was happening across the country when Donald Trump was seeking to block his loss of the presidency. We don't know exactly how this case is going to turn out, Jake. We don't know when it will be charged, or who will be named in those charges if they do indeed come.

There's a broad scope of activity that we know have already come under the lens of the grand jury and multiple witnesses from Trump's inner circle have testified about it. But I think there are some basic charges that are more presentable, easier to understand to the jury.And those would, of course, include conspiracy charges on 18 U.S. C. 371. Those would be charges essentially committing -- conspiring to commit a fraud against the government in terms of undermining the election. There are also charges under 18 U.S. C. 1512, which is obstructing an official proceeding. We know that many other January six defendants have already been charged and convicted of 1512. And then finally -- or to -- is more of a reach and certainly more serious, there are charges around insurrection, 18 U.S. C 2383. Those are just three of the potentials I can think of about another maybe three or four that are also possibly on the -- on the radar here. So, we'll have to see if he's indicted, which it looks like he will be, exactly what that indictment holds.",

      "sentences": "The grand jury is one of the most significant and interesting and of course secretive processes in all of our legal system here. Why? Because remember, it's for probable cause.The job is not a trial jury. Their job is not to decide guilt or innocence. It is to figure out whether the prosecution has enough probable cause to believe that a crime has occurred and this person has committed that crime. Interestingly enough, unlike a trial courtroom, you don't get to have your lawyer in the room with you. Maybe coaching you, maybe telling you, maybe grunting and saying don't answer this question say this, objecting. You are on your own in front of that grand jury. And the prosecution alone is not the one who gets to ask questions. It's also the grand jurors who get to ask questions about gaps that might be there. Asking questions of that witness. They have corroboration likely from other testimony by the time you get to a very major witness. And you have the subpoena power of that grand jury. So, the witness is not privy to knowing what came before. There's no judge to figure out what evidence ought to come in, or later on. It is why people talk about a prosecutor being able to indict a ham sandwich. Having said that, a lot of the behavior we've seen here has been very public. We all watched what happened on January six, so a lot of the conversation leading up to that date. And so, we also saw the January 6 committee. A lot of what usually is behind closed doors has already come out in the light. So, I do wonder, what is additive to this now, perhaps a looming indictment. BLITZER: So, it's obviously a much bigger deal if the special counsel says you'll testify before the federal grand jury as opposed to just the investigators.",

And it's -- in many respects can be thought of as not precisely one and the same but everything you say before one will be talked about in a future proceeding as a subsequent prosecution, as different jurisdictions. That old phrase from law and order that we all know so well, everything you say can and will be used against you.And mind you. This is a man, former President Trump, who is on a campaign trail. He is actively with town halls. One is scheduled today. He's had rallies. He has not wanted to muzzle himself. That is salivating in many respects if you're a prosecutor.",
