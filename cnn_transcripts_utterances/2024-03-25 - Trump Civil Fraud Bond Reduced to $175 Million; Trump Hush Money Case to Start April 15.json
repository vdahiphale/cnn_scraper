I'm Boris Sanchez alongside Jessica Dean in Washington, D.C.We're tracking a legal doubleheader for Donald Trump in New York,a pair of cases that go right to the heart of the former president's campaign and business empire. We are standing by as the former president is outside of 40 Wall Street right now, set to make remarks to cameras. We're monitoring his entrance as we speak. You're looking at pictures of Trump in court today for his Manhattan criminal case centered on alleged hush money payments tied to his first presidential run. We now have a trial date set, because, in the last hour, the judge rejected Trump's motion to delay or dismiss that case, jury selection now set to start on April 15.",

But the appeals court trimmed the bill by more than half. It now stands at $175 million, and it gave him 10 additional days to come up with that money. Let's start first with the hush money case. That's the criminal case. CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Paula Reid and Kara Scannell are outside the courthouse. And, Kaitlan, just a reminder of how we got here.

And Trump's attorneys had walked into that courtroom today hoping to get that delay extended even further from what it was initially expected to be, which, of course, a start date of today that was delayed after some issues with the discovery and how documents were turned over to Trump's legal team. But the judge today rejected any effort by Trump to say that that warrants a further delay in this trial or even a dismissal of the case outright. And that is something that stands in stark contrast with what we have seen happen with every other criminal trial that Trump was facing, where the judges have gone along with delays on some of the issues. This one is different. This is going to be Trump on trial and three weeks from now with that jury selection beginning on April 15. And we have a team here with us. We have got Paula Reid and Kara Scannell. Kara, you were actually inside the courtroom as all of this was happening. And it wasn't clear that we were going to get this date from the judge while they were all still inside the room. How did Trump respond when the judge said, nope, you're going to trial April 15?",

And the judge at one point earlier, before he came to this conclusion, said he didn't even really understand why we were here today, because he felt like the facts were the facts and Trump's team was misreading these facts and was misleading the court about the actual details of this -- of the turning over of documents from federal prosecutors.",

Trump was criticizing that and criticizing Alvin Bragg, the district attorney who has brought that case. Mark Pomerantz, the person he was citing, is an attorney who used to -- a prosecutor used to work in that office and then detailed a book about the investigations that they had been potentially pursuing against Donald Trump, including that they once considered bringing a racketeering charge against him. Trump did not mention that part of Mark Pomerantz's book. But, clearly, his anger here is at the judge and the fact that Judge Merchan did not allow this trial to get delayed any further than what it already was, which, I should note, it was supposed to start today. So there is at least a three-week delay. He was saying the judge cannot move fast enough on this. What the judge has made clear here is something we have kind of seen in stark contrast to the other criminal cases that Trump is facing is that he does not play into this delay strategy that we have seen from Trump's legal team and said that what they brought today does not warrant any further delay from this court and that that case will go forward, Boris.",

      "sentences": "They're not supported by any evidence.So let's look at the two cases we're talking most frequently about today. We have the civil fraud trial, in which Trump needs to put up all this money. Well, that resulted from an investigation launched in 2019 while Donald Trump was still president, not Joe Biden, by the state attorney general of New York, Attorney General James. She filed a lawsuit that led to the trial in which he was found liable in 2022, before Trump even launched his campaign. So the idea that this was some Joe Biden-launched thing, that Joe Biden timed this for the sake of election interference does not hold water. Then, this case, the criminal case in which a trial date has been set, brought by a local district attorney, district attorney Bragg, over whom Joe Biden simply does not have jurisdiction. This is a local matter decided by a local official. But Trump tried to bolster his false claim by saying, oh, Biden put Matthew Colangelo there, an official from the Department of Justice. And, yes, a senior DOJ official did go work for DA Bragg, but this was his own personal job decision. He had a preexisting relationship with DA Bragg. He had worked with him in the state attorney general's office, decided to go over to help with the Trump case. There is no basis for the claim that Biden or other DOJ officials put him there. And I just want to add that I think we're so used to former President Trump making these broad allegations of, he said, illegality, criminality, and corruption, accusing specific individuals of corruption, calling the investigations illegal, criminal. There is no basis for any of that. And I think it's just what he does, so we tend to brush it off, but I think it's important to address it when he says it again.",

Jury selection will get under way. It's expected to last for around six weeks. That's getting into the heart of campaign season.

So he's either whacked out or dishonest, one or the other, or both, probably both. But he's a disgrace to the system. And I think that New York state was helped a lot today by the decision. I will give you an example. TRUTH Social is doing very well. It's hot as a pistol and doing great. And it's going public. And the New York Stock Exchange wants to have us badly.

As far as we can tell from every assessment we have seen of his finances, all the records that he's had, he has roughly $300 million to $400 million. A lot of that is still not completely liquid, but it would likely cover this $175 million. The other part of this is the underwriters who said that they would only qualify -- they would only underwrite a bond for $100 million, a lot of that because of precedent. People did not have or had never underwritten a bond that was half-a-billion dollars. That is an enormous amount. What I want to specify here and point out, one of the things we have been talking about, about this New York civil fraud case for the last several months has been how critical this is and how much this really plays to who Donald Trump is. The reason he's been there is because it goes to his identity, his core, his brand. You have never heard him be so personal, so angry, and so public about that until today, today over and over and over again saying that he was rich enough, that he built a great company. One day, someone will report great his company is, saying he had so much cash on hand, how good his brand was, several times saying how many different properties he had, how in New York he had built up an entire conglomerate. He is defending what he believes is the core of his identity and being. It is what he ran on in 2016. It is what helped propel him to the White House, this idea that he was this billionaire, this wealthy businessman, and you heard him tripling down on that today. That is the kind of stuff. We are reporting that he is privately angry, that he has been ranting about this. What you saw today was that. He just was so upset by the fact that people were talking about that he wasn't wealthy enough, that he couldn't pay that $464 million bond. And just to remind you, not only, as you said, did he come out and say, actually, I do have the cash, then his lawyers had to say, no, he doesn't, this is an impossible amount, no one is that liquid. But it was almost as though he could not stand the fact that people were saying that he didn't have that cash. Now, the other part of today, he is clearly very angry that this trial is going forward. You heard him saying that he doesn't even know if there's going to be a trial. There is no indication that there's not going to be a trial. And I will tell you, from talking to his team, they thought the trial was going to start today. They were surprised and pleasantly so that it was delayed even as far back as to April 15. They are planning an entire campaign around the fact that he is likely to be in court, meaning he's going to have campaign events on Wednesday and Saturdays. Those are the days he's out of court. But talking about that campaign, whether or not he's going to actually give money to his campaign, you heard somebody ask the question there. You keep saying you want to give that money to the campaign. Well, now that the bond is lower, will you give money to your campaign? First, he said yes. Then he said it's none of your business.
