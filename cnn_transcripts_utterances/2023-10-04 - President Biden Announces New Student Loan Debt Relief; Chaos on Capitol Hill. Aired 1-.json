Right now, candidates are vying for support behind closed doors and they will make their case before the full conference at the Republican forum next Tuesday, with a full House vote for speaker expected by Wednesday. Let's take you now live to Capitol Hill and CNN's Lauren Fox, who joins us live. So, Lauren, while Jim Jordan jockeys for support, he's downplaying concerns that he may be too far to the right to win over the moderates in his conference.",

That, in fact, was the message from Jim Jordan, but he is already warning that, on some issues, he is still going to be fighting for conservatives. Here he is on the issue of Ukraine funding.

McCarthy sold his soul back in January, as he went into a corrupt bargain that now was the one who isolated him and essentially delivered his debacle, because what he did was, he agreed to this ridiculous rule that anybody could come in and do a motion to vacate to kick him out. And everyone knew it was going to be Matt Gaetz, right? We all knew that this day was going to happen, as historic and frankly tragic as it is for the whole country. No one is celebrating this. No one on the Democratic side is celebrating this. This is horrific. It's embarrassing on the international stage, and it does not do any good for the American people. But it does give Democrats a chance to demonstrate how the extremists on the Republican side are the ones who are running their part of the party, and it does no good for the American people, and that they then, in fact, don't deserve to be given the power to govern as a majority.",

And the irony here is, Gaetz has been so frustrated with McCarthy for doing what you're supposed to do, work across the aisle, find bipartisan deals, which is what McCarthy did to keep the government open, working with Democrats to get a bipartisan deal. Gaetz was frustrated with him for working with Democrats. He only got this done because he worked with Democrats to get it done. And so that's the frustration. We need to look at the fact that bipartisanship is not a bad word, and we need someone that lead the Republicans, that can work with Democrats to -- A, to keep the government open, and to work to, in my view, reduce spending, focus on securing the border, as well as providing the necessary aid to Ukraine, which is top of mind.",

Lee is live for us at the White House with more. So, M.J., what are we anticipating to hear from President Biden? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Boris, as you know very well, student loan debt relief has been a huge focus for this White House. And you're right that the administration today announced additional cancellation for some 125,000 borrowers totaling, according to the administration, some $9 billion. And it really falls into several categories, including cancellation for borrowers who are public servants, debt relief for folks who have been making their payments for 20 years or more. And then there's another category of cancellation for borrowers who have disabilities. Now, the timing of this announcement is pretty interesting, because do keep in mind it was several days ago that a pause on federal student loan payments that had been in place since March of 2020 -- so, really, we are talking about the onset of the pandemic -- that ended up being lifted. So we are looking at millions of borrowers across the country who haven't had to make these payments in a number of years. They are now having to foot the bill and having to make these payments that they haven't had to pay for a number of years now. An additional piece of context that is very important, too, of course, is that, over the summer, President Biden's student loan forgiveness program that was going to offer up to $20,000 in student loan debt relief, that ended up being struck down by the Supreme Court. So we are seeing sort of a continuation of a patchwork of actions that the administration is trying to take to give some relief to people across the country. And according to the administration, so far, some $127 billion of loans have been canceled for some 3.6 million people. And officials here at the White House say that they will continue to look for different ways to try to offer more relief. Of course, after this summer when the Supreme Court ended up again striking down this program, that was a huge priority for this administration.",

And they have strengthened us across the board, not just as it relates to Ukraine, whether it's Japan and South Korea or whether it's what's happening in Europe itself. And so I think that it's clear to the vast majority of the foreign policy community on both left and right that this has been a valuable exercise for the United States of America to increase the support we have around the world. And what I don't want to do is -- we have put together our 50 nations, 50 nations supporting Ukraine. And we are the organizer of that. I met with -- don't hold me the exact number -- 16 or 17 yesterday in a long conversation and made the case that I knew that the majority of the American people still support Ukraine, and the majority of the members of the Congress, both Democrat and Republican, support it.
