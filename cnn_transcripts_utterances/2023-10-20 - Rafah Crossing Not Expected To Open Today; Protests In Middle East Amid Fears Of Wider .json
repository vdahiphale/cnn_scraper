They are on their way to an Israeli military base in central Israel and that is where they are going to be meeting their family who is waiting for them tonight.Now, Judith and Natalie many people are familiar with their story. We've been talking about it a lot ever since they were abducted by Hamas on October 7th. They're from Illinois and they were just in Israel visiting. Natalie had just graduated from high school. She was here with Judith, her mother. They were celebrating a relative's 85th birthday and also the end of the Jewish holidays in Ketura (ph). They were staying at a kibbutz just about an hour away from Gaza as this attack unfolded and both of them were kidnapped into Gaza. People had been waiting on words of their condition and now we have learned that they are being released. And of course, a lot of people are going to be asking why these two hostages? Why did Hamas decide to release them? Well, according to a statement that we've gotten from Hamas they say this is on humanitarian grounds. We are told that the mother Judith is not in good health that we don't have a lot of details. I want to stress about her condition. We're still trying to report those out. But obviously this is incredibly significant news. It's going to be bittersweet though for a lot of these families. Many of them that we saw earlier today here in Tel Aviv where they were doing a Shabbat dinner, which, of course, everyone in the Jewish faith does on Friday. It's a time for family and friends to get together and a lot of these people who've had their relatives, their family, their friends, their loved ones abducted, Shabbat dinner was the last time they saw some of them. And so we were at this ceremony earlier for the families and the relatives of those who have been abducted where they had set this table, a very long table that had over 200 empty chairs for those who are celebrating Shabbat dinner tonight without their loved ones. And of course, that was something that happened just hours before we heard this news that was confirmed that they have been released. And what we do know about the release is that it was something that was brokered by Qatar as they had been having these discussions with Hamas about getting these hostages released. There are still a lot of other questions though, Boris and Brianna, about what this is going to look like and who it's going to potentially be coming next, whether or not Hamas is planning to use this in other ways for their release. But it is significant news on that front of course.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it was quite noticeable, Kaitlan. Right as the news was beginning to break about the mother and daughter being released, that was when Hamas kind of broke the silence or one of the groups in Gaza broke the silence of the day. It had been so calm here up until then. And they fired out a huge salvo of rockets. The interceptor missiles went up and literally at the top of this hour, again, they did exactly the same.I think we have the video. You can see it there. A huge salvo of rockets coming out of Gaza. The Iron Dome intercepts as those missiles were headed north into Israel, their intercepts were plucking them out of the sky, if you will, knocking them down. I think if Hamas is trying to send more than one message today about why it's released these hostages, it is also sending a message that it clearly intends to continue its military campaign with these salvo of rockets. Again, I say it was noticeable earlier today that it was quiet. It was quiet. There weren't any Israeli missiles going into Gaza or artillery. And it created an impression, created, I would say, an impression. We can't say for sure that there were talks or discussions or something going on in the background because this was, until that moment, a far quieter time. There were a lot of drones in the sky at the moment and Hamas has now created the perception from where we stand that while Israel didn't have drones in the air and wasn't putting artillery and missile strikes into Gaza, they were using the opportunity, it appears, to line up salvo after salvo after salvo of rocket fire out. Our location here had a salvo of rockets shortly after the announcement about the hostage release. A five-sequence salvo of rockets, that's more, I think, than we've seen in even a couple of days before. And that came all within the space of a little over an hour.",

The first candidate to replace him, Steve Scalise, collapsed because of opposition within the ranks. Jim Jordan tried to go multiple rounds, and we saw today losing 25 Republicans, and then ultimately going behind closed doors and asking his conference if he should continue. His conference at an overwhelming majority vote said he should not continue. As a result, they are trying to figure out their way forward. Now, in talking to several Republicans, including Congressman Dusty Johnson in the aftermath of all of this, you could just feel the tension, the anger that is directed not just at everything that's gone on, but the initial - the eight Republicans who initiated the vote to kick out Kevin McCarthy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): Clearly, there is yet another void. We are going to have a couple more days of chaos as we try to get a sense of what's next. To me, it reminds me how incredibly irresponsible it was for 208 Democrats and eight Republicans to put this House into absolute chaos without any kind of a plan for how we were going to move forward.
