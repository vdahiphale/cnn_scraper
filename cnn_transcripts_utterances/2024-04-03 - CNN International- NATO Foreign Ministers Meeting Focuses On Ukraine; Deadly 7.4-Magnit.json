I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Dramatic pictures from Taiwan where rescue efforts are underway after a massive earthquake hit the island. Plus, NATO foreign ministers are meeting right now in Brussels. What this could mean for the future of Ukraine? And we are less than a week away from a total solar eclipse in North America. Let's see how eclipse mania has taken over. Well, we want to begin with America's top diplomat attending a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, but his trip to Brussels started out rocky. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the U.S. delegation had to drive from Paris because of a mechanical issue with his Boeing aircraft. Meanwhile, as Ukraine remains under Russian attack, NATO Secretary General is vowing that Ukraine will join the alliance. Jens Stoltenberg says that it's a question of when, not if, and he says that the alliance needs to give Kyiv a commitment to ongoing support. Let's welcome in our International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, who is tracking the story. He joins us live from London. Nic, always good to see you. Talk to us a little bit about some of the takeaways of what's been accomplished thus far for Ukraine.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. We've just heard from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaking after meeting with the foreign ministers. The big takeaway, he says, is that they've agreed to move forward on the planning for security for NATO to have a better involvement in the security assistance, planning and training for Ukraine. Now, this kind of fits into the picture that we were hearing before, which was $100 billion commitment over four years. And he was asked about over five years, and he was asked specifically about that financial commitment. And he said, look, we're working out the details. I'm not going to get into those details, to the journalists that asked that question. You've been briefed, he said, but not by me. So, no numbers, no timeframe, no specifics.But, this is sort of what we were expecting, because this is the foreign ministers meeting, and really what it does is push ahead to when the big final decision and the big final communique will come out when the actual leaders, the NATO member nation leaders, all 32 of them meet in Washington later this year. And this is what he is indicating that the plans are still moving forward for this mechanism that he says must change because until now all those sort of partner nations in NATO, 32 of them now, have been contributing from previous and existing stockpiles, and what is required now, those stockpiles have rundown. Ukraine needs more. In fact, Stoltenberg said, and probably not for the first time, he said Ukrainians are not running out of courage, because he commended their courage, they're running out of ammunition. And this is what that plan does. It tells armaments manufacturers, yes, you can go ahead and ramp up production. There is a commitment from governments, and yes to Ukraine. You can plan to be having x number of artillery shells on your frontline if you want to have a counteroffensive next year, because we'll put them into production. You can count on that. That's the plan. That's the picture. That's the vision and the details. The devil is in it. Still to be worked out.",

Taiwan's fire agency reports that the death toll stands at, at least nine people, with injuries nearing 1,000.

And Taipei, the capital, is about 160 kilometers away from the epicenter. And yet, my colleagues behind the camera, one of them shaken awake in bed and ran to hold the books up on his bookshelves, and another one ran to hold on to his children. And there was crockery that was shattering. A frightening moment for people who are accustomed to this.Meanwhile, the epicenter is in this kind of rugged, remote mountainous area on the eastern coast called Hualien. That's a popular area for tourists who go there for the typography. But, that makes them all the more vulnerable when you have a historically powerful earthquake. So, the roads south from here to there have been cut off by landslides and ambulant and avalanches. Some of the nine people killed around, they're hit by falling rocks. There are buildings that have collapsed there, though, we've heard about successful rescues of people from some of those buildings in the town itself of Hualien, also from some of the highway tunnels that had been carved through mountains to reach that area. There were dozens of people trapped in different highway tunnels. They've been largely successfully rescued. But, the authorities say there are still around 130 people -- 140 people that they're trying to rescue. We do not know what the circumstances are for those individuals. As you pointed out, more than 900 people injured as a result of this disaster. And then, there is the fact, the real frightening factor of the aftershocks that are still shaking Taipei here, as well as the epicenter area. The Taiwanese authorities are warning that this could continue for three to four more days, and you could have aftershocks as powerful as six and seven magnitude. Meanwhile, the U.S. Geological Survey, they have detected at least 29 aftershocks in the 12 hours after the initial quake, some of them as powerful as six and five magnitude. Back to you.",

And what we saw were many, thousands of people take to the streets on several nights in a row. Tents were set up. They've now been dismantled. The idea of this protest was to stay here, just outside the Knesset, until today because the protests were aimed, Rahel, at saying to the politicians who go off on their spring recess for several weeks this afternoon, don't go and not while our loved ones are still in captivity.In fact, what we saw are some family of the hostages (inaudible) the public viewing area of the Knesset there with yellow painted on their hands to urge the politicians not to go, with some of the opposition politicians joining in their chants. There is a great deal of anger and much of it has been expressed by family members of those who are still inside the Gaza Strip. We saw it again last night. There were thousands here outside the Knesset, again, Rahel. And what we saw were very angry scenes where some of those family members actually managed to make their way towards the residence of Benjamin Netanyahu, the residence also of the Israeli President, with really angry scenes between the police and the protesters, and this morning, Benny Gantz, one of the wartime cabinet members, urging unity after the extraordinary scenes that we've seen in these last few days, Rahel.",

They knew well the dangers. We've been hearing from their family members. And yet, they chose to go towards danger. These workers rather than shy away from any part of the world, that this horrible strike and this tragedy only reminds us of its dangers.And I think what you've seen as well is the Israeli military, the Israeli officials as well taking this extremely serious in the face of that international condemnation and outrage that's been so clearly expressed, not just by the family members and other people from the world of humanitarian care, but also from the American President, really a very strong language describing his outrage and his heartbreak. And I think in some of the most pointed language that we've seen on the part of the American President, an important reminder of the growing frustration in Washington at the way this war is being waged, and this is something that we're hearing and seeing in front of the Knesset as well in this country too, Rahel, despite that unity that we saw after the October 7 attacks. There is a growing anger, disgust, frustration with the fact that this government appears intent on waging this war relentlessly further into Rafah, we hear, to try and take out Hamas every time, linking very closely, it says, the eradication of Hamas with the rescue of the hostage. What these family members and protesters are saying is, look, nearly six months on, more than 130 hostages remain inside Gaza, and they have -- are seeing a dwindling hope that they're ever going to see these hostages come back.

While Florida in recent elections has been trending towards Republicans and you could argue that Trump's rather equivocating position on abortion might help him out further down the ticket, there is a very competitive Senate race. Rick Scott, the incumbent, only won by less than one percent six years ago. If there is even a small shift against him because of abortion, and he is quite a hardline conservative on abortion, his seat could be in danger. This is really significant because Democrats are defending a lot of vulnerable seats themselves in the Senate, most people think what's most likely to happen is that Democrats lose control to the Senate.So, if they can put one or two seats on the table, which probably weren't going to be competitive, that's going to help them. And the fact that this abortion constitutional amendment is now going to be on the ballot, it gives them a lot of hope that if they can't necessarily get to the 60 percent they need to enshrine abortion rights in Florida law, they will get so much turnout from Democratic and moderate voters that they could put that Senate seat in play.",

If you look at polls, abortion is one of the very few issues on which President Joe Biden polls better than former President Donald Trump on issues like immigration, the economy, even foreign policy. Trump tends to do better than the President. So, obviously, Biden has to bring those numbers into a little bit more equal balance. He has to address the issue of the economy. He has been trying to diffuse Trump's advantage on immigration by being willing to accept some rather harsh border measures of his own.And Biden, of course, has another problem. He has got this issue of the Democratic coalition that helps him win in 2020 not being that engaged. There has been a fall-off among black male voters, for example. A lot of progressives are very upset about the way he has handled the -- Israel's war in Gaza and the toll of casualties among Palestinians. So, Biden has an awful lot of problems.

That was August 21, 2017. I mean, a total eclipse connects people. Yeah. It gives me chills. I mean, it's just -- it's like I leave my normal everyday existence and I am suddenly transported someplace else. It's just all about appreciating being alive. It's just meeting new people and seeing new places, and experiencing something so rare and so brief. It just reminds me to appreciate that I'm here. It's as simple as that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Here at the venue that I'll be helping to run, it's about two minutes 30 seconds, I can take these glasses off. I could look directly and see the Sun's atmosphere. Otherwise, I have to have these glasses on to protect my eyes. We can really damage our eyes by looking at the sun without glasses. Please, everybody, get these glasses and you can view the total solar eclipse through these things.There are ways that we can project it.

We're working on a new telescope called the \"Habitable Worlds Observatory\" that uses a very similar technique as the eclipse to blot out the light from distant stars, see those distant planets. And this is NASA's mission to search for life, potential life on those planets. It's using a very similar technique.So, it's a wonderful way that we can say the eclipse happening on Earth like this, using the next generation space telescopes that we hope to build.

One lucky millionaire will soon get a chance to own some literary history. Fans of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes' stories can bid on an original manuscript at a June auction. According to Sotheby's in New York, the vintage work could fetch $1.2 million. It includes Conan Doyle's handwritten manuscript of his second novel, \"The Sign Of Four\", along with letters recounting a famous 1889 dinner where Doyle agreed to write the famous story, and Oscar Wilde committed to writing \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". All right. Before we go, one more thing, it just might affect your next trip to the grocery store, maybe. There are reports that the retail giant Amazon is scrapping the \"Just Walk Out\" technology from their Fresh stores. So, this technology allowed customers to skip standing in line to pay for items. Instead, they would scan their smart device, walk out of the store, and a receipt would be sent to them afterwards. Let's bring in CNN's Business Reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn, who joins us with more from New York. So, why? Why is Amazon removing this technology, Nathaniel, from what we know?",

It was supposed to revolutionize grocery shopping, get rid of the cashiers. You walk in the store. You don't have to wait on these long lines anymore. But, some customers found it a little bit creepy, the cameras, the sensors, they just did not -- were not able to get used to it. It reminds me a little bit of some of the backlash we've seen to self-checkout technology, another form of technology that was supposed to improve the grocery shopping experience, but that has not quite worked out.

It's still kind of -- it appeals mostly to wealthier shoppers. So, it's not been able to really make a dent in Walmart or Kroger, other rivals sales. They have Amazon Fresh stores.But, people are a little bit confused by that branding. They have -- now, they're reversing this \"Just Walk Out\" technology, about 40 Amazon Fresh stores across the U.S. And then they also have these \"Amazon Go\" convenience stores, which they're sticking with the \"Just Walk Out\" technology.
