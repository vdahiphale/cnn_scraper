Donald Trump personally confirming to me that he's in. Meanwhile, another epic showdown is just hours away from happening, not weeks away, because Michael Cohen will be back on the witness stand, at Trump's trial, tomorrow. We're getting new reporting, tonight, on the plan of attack, by the Trump team. And we have two inside sources. Michael Cohen's former attorney, Lanny Davis. And one of Donald Trump's attorneys. Both here tonight. And a big question. Where is Rudy Giuliani? Because that's what law enforcement, in Arizona, is asking, as they have been trying to find the one-time Trump attorney for weeks. Why they need to see him in- person, as CNN is learning where he might be. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Mark your calendars, because six weeks from tomorrow, Thursday, June 27th, it's Biden-Trump in a debate rematch, right here on CNN. And it promises to be epic, or at least dramatic. Hopefully, there's less shouting, this time, for all of us watching in the room, and at home. The only president in U.S. history, who has tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power versus the man who defeated him. The current President, who says that his rival is a dire threat to democracy, is facing challenging poll numbers, in critical battleground states as well. And this Trump-Biden face-off will be their first since 2020, also, their first time in the same room since then, which is remarkable in and of itself. Trump confirmed to me directly, this morning, that he had accepted CNN's invitation, which came after this direct challenge, from President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's what Donald Trump had to say about this agreement.

Because, you know, he also challenged me to golf. So I'm a very good golfer. He can't hit a ball 50 yards. I really think he has to debate, he might as well get it over with.

There's talking about jobs leaving America. There was talking about immigration. There was a balance.2020, he was just an angry guy. He was grievances. There was out of whack. It's all he talked about. In 2024, who shows up? Is it 2016? Is it 2020? Is it a hybrid? And I'm not so sure. Because, on certain days, if you listen to Donald Trump, standing outside of the courtroom, it's purely aggrieved Donald Trump. It's exactly what you're hearing him, saying crap about, excuse me -- about his golf game or about Stormy Daniels or whatever. On the trail, sometimes, he's talking about bringing back Master Lock, who has moved south, back to the country. I think that the lesson for Joe Biden. And look, he's got the best people around him. He's got Ron Klain, who is the master of this, running his debate prep. He's got to be able to -- to be able to see, or be ready for different looks, for different Donald Trumps to show up.

And I would remind everybody that it's not about Michael Cohen personally, even though that's the only thing the defense really has, is to attack Michael, personally. To change the topic is what the case is about are documents and other witnesses.So, the issue of whether there was a political motivation, in paying the hush money, which makes it a crime? That testimony came from Hope Hicks and David Pecker. So, you don't have to rely on Michael Cohen. You can rely on two people, who are close friends of his that it was about the campaign. Even more so is this not really newsworthy leak that they're going to attack, Michael, that there wasn't an arrangement for legal fees. You just have to look at Allen Weisselberg's handwritten notes that literally prove, the document proves, the jury is going to look at it. And it proves that they weren't about legal fees. It was about math. Allen Weisselberg wrote, in this document, that is in evidence, because it was verified to be his handwriting, that the money that Michael advanced for Stormy Daniels payment, which was 200 -- $130,000, another $50,000 for a bonus, and another $60,000 that he paid for the paper, the crowd when Donald Trump came down the escalator, and to pump up his Forbes 500 numbers. That amount was $210,000 on that piece of paper, multiplied by two is $420,000. Divide that by 12. That's the $35,000 check that a sitting President, in the Oval Office, wrote to Michael Cohen.

But that's the exact issue that the prosecution has. Because he's willing to do anything and everything for Donald Trump, is the same reason why he put out his money for Donald Trump, to try to save the campaign. As much as you dirty Michael Cohen, guess what, that's the same ride- or-die guy that Donald Trump wanted to be able to clean up his dirt, to be able to fight for him. So, I'm not concerned about that. In terms of what the defense has to do is what they should have been doing from the beginning, attack the inconsistencies, and that way you can sell it during closing argument.
