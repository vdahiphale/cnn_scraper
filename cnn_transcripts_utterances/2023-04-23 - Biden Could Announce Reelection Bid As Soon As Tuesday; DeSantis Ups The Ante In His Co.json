There isn't COVID-19 that has basically nixed all campaigning of the second half of the general election.Here's the New York Times editorial board basically telling Joe Biden he needs to talk about this more. They say, if Mr. Biden runs again as he recently said he intends to do, questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job. The president also needs to talk about his health openly and without embarrassment. And to the -- to end, the pretense that it doesn't matter. Only a combination of performance and complete candor will change the minds of skeptical voters. Does the White House agree, though? KANNO-YOUNGS: I find that when you ask the White House about this topic, in particular, his age, it's one of the issues that they are most sensitive about. This will absolutely be something that resonates going forward in the election. They are planning on sending him out on a travel blitz. I know that. They want -- they do believe that the president is best when he's in front of people, when he's traveling around, but we do know that this is an issue on the top of mind to voters. Just one more thing too, as we were talking about this theme of them talking about implementation and the benefits of their -- of their packages, there is a challenge of galvanizing voters based off of legislative packages, many of which have not really taken effect yet or do not impact people day to day yet. So that will also be a challenge for them. How do you talk about the sprawling bills in ways and convince them, this will benefit you even if you're not feeling it yet.",

There's a feeling that she's been effective on this issue in a way that she's had a very hard time being effective on other issues.

Because it's the same threshold, same margin for error and exactly the same problems, which are that, you know, the caucus does not see Kevin McCarthy as a sort of strong leader, that they are all sort of duty bound to coalesce around. They all want something from him, and they feel like by holding out, they can get it. And there's a precedent for that.At the same time, what we did see in the speaker fight is it eventually ended because it was worse for them not to end it than to finally find something they could agree on. Hopefully that's the case before we hit the default deadline. But there is a very hard deadline here. It could be sooner than anybody thinks. It could be as soon as early June. And this is still just the first red down. This is still just the opening offer. You know, the White House saying we're not going to negotiate, but if we were, we certainly wouldn't do it until you'd given us something to negotiate on. Now, they're saying, well, we can't negotiate on this until you've shown that you have the votes for it, so there's still --",

It is also to think about, beyond executive orders, what other authority exists within departments and agencies that the president is ultimately responsible for, that can call for a public health emergency, that can call for resources to go into communities that are feeling the harm of the epidemic of gun violence the most in order to get mental health resources in order to get gun prevention resources to those places as well.
