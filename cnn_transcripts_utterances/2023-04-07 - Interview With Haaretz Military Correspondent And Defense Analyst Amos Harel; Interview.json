I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour, who will be back next week. The Israeli defense forces are ordering the mobilization of some of its reserves as violence that began in Israel and Gaza has spread to Lebanon. Israel says it struck Hamas targets in Southern Lebanon and Gaza early this morning, just hours after dozens of rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel. The Lebanese foreign ministry now says that it will make an official complaint to the U.N. Security Council. Salma Abdelaziz has the latest details in this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  A day that began with rockets from Gaza that struck a home Sderot. No one was killed in the attack, the latest in a wave of missiles fired from Gaza and Southern Lebanon in recent days. Violence also spread to the West Bank on Friday. There, two Israeli sisters were killed and their mothers seriously wounded in a shooting, described by Israeli forces as a terrorist attack. Hamas praised the deadly attack as a heroic act of resistance. In recent days, a major escalation across the region has raised fears of a wider conflict. This is the latest catalyst, Israeli police twice stormed al-Aqsa Mosque Wednesday. Overnight footage showed the dramatic raid. Israeli forces hitting worshippers with rifle butts and batons. Israeli police say they entered the mosque after hundreds of rioters barricaded themselves inside and that their officers were attacked with stones and fireworks. Palestinians and the wider Muslim world see the raid on the mosque as a provocation, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan. Condemnation quickly poured in, as well as rockets from two directions, Southern Lebanon and Gaza. ABDELAZIZ (on camera):  It all begins and ends at the holy site you see behind me here, known as the noble sanctuary to Muslims or the Temple Mount to Jews, it is dictated by a decades old agreement that says only Muslims can pray at the site. Some non-Muslims are allowed at certain times at the complex, but any violation real or perceived of that so called status quo agreement could quickly ignite tensions. ABDELAZIZ (voiceover):  And many Palestinians fear that's exactly what's happening. There have been calls by Jewish extremist groups to slaughter goats at the mosque compound during Passover. And in January, an inflammatory visit by Israel's far-right national security minister, Ben- Gvir, drew international condemnation. He is convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. Prime Minister Netanyahu has insisted his government is not seeking to change rules at the holy site. On Friday, tens of thousands gathered at the steps of al-Aqsa Mosque after peaceful prayer service. Banners read, al-Aqsa is a red line. Another said, do not test our patience. The U.S., U.N. and other members of the International Community have called for restraint and calm. But with nearly two weeks of Ramadan left and the Passover holiday underway, it remains deeply sensitive time in a deeply sensitive place. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's quite apparent that since Ramadan started two and a half weeks ago things are moving towards escalation. We've seen the events on the al-Aqsa Mosque that your reporter has just mentioned. We've seen rocket fire from Lebanon, which is quite rare in recent years. Rocket fire in Gaza. And some Israeli strikes, air strikes in retaliation. But what we haven't seen is any attempt on either side to reach a full-scale military conflict. We saw that the Israelis, after the attacks yesterday, their strikes were quite limited, and they targeted Hamas and not Hezbollah. The IDF, the Israeli military, is saying that the Hamas is behind rocket launching from Southern Lebanon, and it doesn't blame Hezbollah directly, as long as Hezbollah is on the sidelines, but I think there's still a good chance of things the de-escalating and of preventing a widescale was.",

But what we saw in the past was that Hezbollah, at least during the last few years, has gotten more and more cozy with Hamasand other Palestinian organizations, and we saw Hamas leadership in Gaza trying to establish this network of terrorists of gunmen in Southern Lebanon. So, although they're not blaming Hezbollah directly, it seems as if there's some coordination or at least some consent from Hezbollah, because hardly anything happening in Southern Lebanon happens without Hezbollah approving it. I should also mention. I think, three or four weeks back there was an incident in Megiddo, which is Northern Israel, but is about 70 kilometers south of the border. There were explosives there, a rouge bomb that exploded. And apparently, it was Hezbollah terrorists who managed to cross the border and then, ride all the way down south, 70 kilometers to the south in order to operate those explosives. So, we see Hezbollah more daring, more willing to confront Israel, and this hasn't happened for quite some time. We also heard some speeches from Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, who seemed more willing to provoke Israel and was actually saying, again, he compared the Israeli society to cobweb, to a spider's web, and also, said that Israel would not live to see its 80th Independence Day in five years' time. Also, the Iranian supreme leader, Khamenei, talked in similar terms. So, this raises suspicions in Israel that some of this may be coordinated with Hezbollah and Iran and not necessarily happening just because Hamas felt like launching rockets to Israel from Lebanon.",

But the specific actions you've mentioned in recent days, the police have tried to prevent them, and I think that it's hard to talk of a general consensus now in Israel, considering the domestic problems right now and the political and constitutional crisis.

But what's different this time is that the Security Council is made up of two rather radicals and extremists who have caused a lot of the consternation now within the government, and that is Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and the National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both hardliners here.

But both Gallant, Netanyahu and some of the security chiefs are actually calling the shots there. It's Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, members of the security cabinet, I assume that they have their opinions, they probably push far-right positions or policies and they probably recommend more aggressive reaction from the Israeli side, but I think it's Netanyahu who is actually making the decisions. And as long as it's up to him, he will try to ignore them as much as possible. He needs them in government because he's trying to go for the judicial overhaul, and he's trying to move forward with all those laws he's trying to pass.

Hezbollah too knows its opponents very well, studies Israeli politicians very carefully. They both understand the limitations and the politics on the other side of the border and they both understand how not to cross into a territory where it's an all-out conflict. I agree. I think both sides don't want to bring utter devastation, do not want to see a repeat of an all-out war, as was the case in 2006. But what this allows Hezbollah and Lebanon to do is to begin to chip away at Israeli deterrence. Deterrence that was established as a result of the 2006 war and the utter devastation it inflicted on most Lebanese. It also, again, allows Bibi Netanyahu to rally Israelis around the flag without going for and conflict. So, I do agree that, I think, both sides want to keep this relatively contained. Now, in terms of Qatar and mediation, you know, Qatar has traditionally played that role. There are others too that are involved. The Egyptians are also very involved as far as Hamas and Gaza is concerned. So, I do think that, you know, the various parties will reach out to those actors in the region that have traditionally played the role of mediator, and Qatar and Egypt are some of the two that come to mind.",

And even now, Hamas in Lebanon and the Hamas' leader was in Lebanon on Thursday, which adds to the notion and the idea and hypothesis that this was a coordinated attack. I was struck by a tweet you wrote, and you said, I am from Lebanon. I am against firing rockets at Israel on behalf of anybody, Palestinian, Iranian and/or otherwise.

In particular, one video today and some fighting around the train station, that suggests it's really street by street in the very center there. But the U.K. intelligence report seems to suggest that some sort of greater cooperation between the Wagner mercenary groups fighting for Russia there and traditional Russian forces that they may be working better together now, and that may be behind some of the change in dynamic there. But putting aside who owns or controls which particular street on which particular day, more broadly, Bakhmut had been a bit of a disaster for Russia, frankly. They long extolled how they thought they might take it in a couple of weeks and how important it would be a symbolic victory. But Ukraine has frankly held on. And even if they are in their reduced presence in the west of the city, certainly, Russia has not achieved the swift victory it would need. And on top of that too, most analysts remind you that there's little strategic value to Bakhmut in itself. It may allow Russia further momentum in taking other parts of Donbas. But really, it's a place where they've expended thousands of their own lives to minimal territorial gain and also, possibly given Ukraine a bit of a break elsewhere on the front line ahead of this potential counter-offensive matter of days or weeks away.

And this, of course, Nick, coming as everyone is watching and anticipating an upcoming potential Ukrainian counter-offensive. Just curious to get the reaction there on the ground in Ukraine to this news of these documents from the classified U.S. and NATO documents that were providing some detail on plans to help Ukraine as this counter- offensive is approaching, the leak of some of these screenshots, the impact that is having and how is Ukraine is responding right now.",

And certainly, some of the versions posted on socialmedia appear to have been changed or altered over time. That's the ultimate question here, whether these are really something confidential, giving away secrets or not. But certainly, Ukraine, for their part, presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, making the point that really there seems to be a Russian misinformation game here, that really, they're desperate to get inside the minds of the Ukrainian general staff and documents like this are just a bit to try and thrown noise out there. But there's a real problem with this story, to be honest, in terms of sheer logic. If indeed it is Russia who managed to obtain these confidential documents, why would they then put them online to make the Americans and the Ukrainians very aware what confidential information they were now in possession of? We're talking, it seems, about numbers of troops, strength and losses, ammunition expenditure, right? That doesn't really stand up in itself, either. And so, I think we are certainly looking at somebody playing a misinformation game here to some degree, even if there is a degree of authenticity to these documents. But as you said, Bianna, the key thing it has done is heightened focus on who knows what about this forthcoming counter-offensive because it is, frankly, a key moment in this war. I think many observers see the western unity behind Ukraine is something that may not go on forever, despite the rhetoric, we're hearing to that effect. And also, both Ukraine and Russia, really running low on human, ammunition and supplies. And so, the need, I think, is certainly felt in Kyiv here to change the direction of the war in these months ahead. And certainly, these plans we've seen whether they are genuine or not have thrown further fuel into the fire of speculation here is exactly who knows what about whose plans and when indeed this counter-offensive may even begin, Bianna.",

DANIEL GOLDHABER, DIRECTOR/CO-WRITER, \"HOW TO BLOW UP A PIPELINE\":  Yes.

And I think that this is a really important conversation to be having, this question of, you know, we are looking at facing a climate apocalypse, and I think that we need to be asking the question of what kind of tactics and strategies are necessary for us to take to avert that.

It's given the scale of the climate crisis. The severity. Why has there been so very little in the way of sabotage to the infrastructure that fuels it?

You know, you have a situation in Atlanta, in Cop City right now, where you have peaceful protesters who were simply attending a concert who have been arrested, held without bail and charged with terrorism. And the evidence being presented is just that they crossed state lines and had dirt on their shoes. I think that the level of power and influence that the fossil fuel industry has in our government, the way that they have distorted the rule of law and use that to blunt the force of even the most tame forms of climate activism has been a real problem and has absolutely dissuaded an escalation of tactics. But I think that the consequences of not acting against climate change, in many ways, are so severe that we really need to question what will be necessary to, again, break that stranglehold over our governments.",
