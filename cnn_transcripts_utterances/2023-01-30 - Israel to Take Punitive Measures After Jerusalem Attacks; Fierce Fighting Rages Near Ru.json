What Israeli officials call terrorist attacks, have left seven dead and five injured.Among those actions are increasing the deployment of the security forces across the country, but especially around Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. They've also vowed to demolish the homes of the two attackers. This is a common tactic by Israeli officials that they see as their way to deter future attackers. They also want to expedite and expand the number of gun permits for Israeli civilians. And they also want to revoke the national insurance benefits for the families of those who Israel have accused of terrorism. And most controversially, they also want to push forward draft legislation that would possibly revoke the Israeli identity cause and residency of those same families who Israel accuses of supporting terrorism or having terrorists in the family. NETANYAHU (through translator): Our response will be strong, swift and precise. Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm then and everyone who assists them.

The prime minister's special advisor has denied accusations by the police union that the government is responsible for the deaths because it's arming gangs. And if the murders, rapes and kidnappings that come with gang rule weren't enough, the U.N. says gangs have blocked access to food and water in some communities, increasing the suffering of people affected by earthquakes cholera and rampant food insecurity.

You're asking guys who are ill-equipped, who have low morale to go out there and to battle gangs that are better armed than they are. And it is a very challenging environment for them to be working -- to be working in. And so, when they see their comrades falling like this, if we just take the last two weeks. You had one incident where there were four cops that were killed. And then you had seven police officers who died in an ambush while they were at a police station.
