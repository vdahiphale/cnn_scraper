And so, those that are trying to be a clone of Donald Trump are not going to be successful, because again, people recognize and the voters ultimately recognize and are concerned with the baggage that Donald Trump has, and they recognize that if we want to solve some of these big problems, we need something different. And here is -- you know, we need people that are actually looking forward, not looking backwards, right? When you look at the complicated times we live in, when you look at the challenges that we have in foreign policy, when you look at the Chinese government doing things like working with the Saudis and the Iranians to cause (INAUDIBLE), all of that impacts us here in the United States.

And I think that's a sign, again, with voters, like Mike Pence absolutely did the right thing on January 6th. There is no question about that. I've been very clear about that over the years. But ultimately, the voters -- you know, there's four years of entanglement with Donald Trump and things that Donald Trump did in office that Mike Pence is also going to have to answer to. And so, when you have both sections of the party, those that are pro Trump and those that are not, are not liking you or are upset with you, that's a very narrow path, ultimately, for victory. But I go back to this notion, like we need to win in November and we have that opportunity if we pick the right candidate. President Biden's approval numbers our super low.

That's a fraction of the country, obviously. And when you look at general elections, depending on the, year, you have about 67 percent of the population vote. And so, there's a lot of, why are those people not voting in primaries? It's because they may not like who the candidates are and people aren't talking about those issues. But again, do Republicans have an opportunity to -- within one of the three largest growing group of voters, and those are young folks, women with a college degree that live in the suburbs, and minority communities?

We had two major earthquakes, 2010 in particular was devastating. But what's particularly hard now is that we have a perfect storm. Because the political crisis as (INAUDIBLE), we had a president was elected, but this president had an opposition even before he got into power. With the country is being locked, that is closed for three months by the opposition at the time, where schools, even in the country, where 50 percent of people are illiterate, schools were forced to close, business is close, et cetera. So, this was very, very damaging to the country that could be related (ph) with assassination of the president this past to July 2021. And since that time, we have no elected person in government. So, this is the political part. Now, if you look at the economy, four the last few years the economy has been negative, just like the economies -- or country at war. We are not at war with any country. We are at war with ourselves. That's a problem. And, you know, the inflation is 47 percent, the local currency has been devaluated 50 percent in the last three years. Now, with this situation, we have a huge humanitarian crisis, because the price of food has increased a lot. But something new happened, and this is perhaps the most severe, the fact that gangs have taken control of the entry to the capital, both south and north. And because of that, you have crops being produced by (INAUDIBLE) in the countryside that are being rotten because they cannot bring them to the capital. So, that has also increased the price of food. And as a result, we have over 50 percent of people living in food insecurity. In our own center, as we are seeing more and more children, we've (INAUDIBLE) severe dehydration and severe malnutrition. With severe malnutrition, it's associated with all kinds of infectious diseases. So, this is horrible. This is something that we don't want.",
