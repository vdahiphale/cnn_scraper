I'm joined now by Kim Ghattas, a contributing writer for \"The Atlantic\" magazine, contributing editor with \"The Financial Times,\" also author of \"Black Wave.\" She joins us live from Los Angeles.Kim, it's great to have you. You have reported from this region for years. And I just have to ask: your surprise, astonishment. Do you have any to see how swiftly Assad, the Assad family, after decades of brutal rule, just fell to pieces, disappeared in a moment, it seemed? KIM GHATTAS, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Great to be with you, Jim. I think, yes, we're all transfixed by what happened over the last week or so in Syria and how quickly, in the end, the Syrian regime and the Ba'ath Party and Bashar al-Assad vanished after five decades of brutal, murderous rule over Lebanon [SIC] and for three decades, also until 2005, occupation. Sorry, murderous rule over Syria and also until 2005, brutal occupation of neighboring Lebanon. I think there was a confluence of events that made this possible so quickly. First of all, we must remember that Syrians fought Assad for 13 years trying to bring him down. And in the end, he ruled over a pile of rubble and a divided country, and his own army was exhausted. He could only survive the push against him. The efforts to topple him that started in 2011 with a civilian peaceful uprising. He could only survive that with the help of Iran, of Hezbollah, the Shiah militant group in Lebanon that is an ally and a proxy of Iran. And eventually, they also needed to bring in the Russians in 2015. Now, over the last few months we've seen Russia is busy with Ukraine. Iran has been shown to be very vulnerable to Israeli attacks. And Hezbollah in Lebanon has been decimated by the recent Israeli military campaign against Lebanon and Hezbollah. And so, I think it was clear for groups on the ground that, if they were to strike and try this again, this was the moment. And indeed, their bet paid off. But I think --",

      "sentences": "Until -- until now.I want to get to a question here which relates to what follows. But also, a basic piece of that is, is what follows better. Because you make a good point about how these regimes are fundamentally brittle, and there's so much historical precedent for it. The shah in Iran was untouchable until he fell, seemingly in a day, or weeks. Saddam Hussein was untouchable until he fell. Right? But in both those instances -- and there are other examples -- what followed was -- was not necessarily better. Right? And HTS has roots in violent jihadism; continuing ties, according to the U.S. intelligence, to ISIS. Is it better for HTS to be running Syria than Assad? Assad is gone. That is good, given all the mayhem and violence he has brought about on his own people. Will HTS be a fundamental --fundamentally positive move? [00:10:05] GHATTAS: I think it's hard to outdo Bashar al-Assad in terms of being bad for Syria and bad for the world. Half a million people, if not more, died over the last 13 years because of how he unleashed violence against his own people. And 90 percent of the people who died in Syria in that war were killed by the regime and its allies, Iran, Hezbollah and Russia. Bashar al-Assad encouraged jihadists to travel to Iraq after 2003 to thwart America's efforts there and to make life difficult and bloody and violent for American troops. His brutal clampdown on the uprising in Syria is what caused the refugee crisis. Millions of Syrians fleeing that country, going to Europe and beyond, which brought populism and the rise of the right wing in -- in -- in Europe. So, it's hard to see how much worse things can get. And one can only hope that things can only get better. Yes. You know, al-Jolani and HTS have a checkered history. They have moderated, but I think there are two things to keep in mind here. They're -- they're not the only players on the ground. There are other rebel groups that participated in this offensive, including Kurdish and Druze. Or the Druze also participated in -- in the push against Bashar al-Assad. So, that's one thing to keep in mind. Second, the Syrians are -- you know, have been dreaming about this moment for 13 years. They've gone through the intra Syrian fighting that a country like Libya went through immediately after deposing, removing Libya -- Libya's Gadhafi. So, they've been through the pain. And I think they have the ability now to come together.",

And they did it for a number of years. But now Russia, because one of the main reasons it's distracted with the war -- by the war in Ukraine.

The army says soldiers are set up along its Eastern and Northern borders to, quote, \"maintain security and protect civil peace.\" There are already some 2 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon alone. Many others around the region and Europe, as well. The prime minister says Lebanon wants to distance itself from the repercussions of the Syrian rebel offensive. I'm sure a lot of the leaders in the region want to. Israel's prime minister has ordered Israeli troops to seize the buffer zone that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from the rest of Syria. They've begun using heavy equipment to reinforce an engineering barrier inside that buffer zone. Also today, the IDF's Arabic spokesperson warned residents in Southern Syria to remain inside their homes because of fighting in the area. Netanyahu went to the Golan Heights and said Israel's presence in that buffer zone will be temporary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
