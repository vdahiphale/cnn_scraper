Then the five officers charged with the murder of Tyre Nichols appear in court and plead not guilty on all counts. Plus, two women football teams stand together for gender equality and equal pay. What their protests means for the game just ahead. Be prepared for a long war. Ukraine's allies are urging each other to commit for the long haul as Russia shows no sign of shutting down its war machine. Right now, hundreds of politicians, military officials and diplomats from around the world are gathering at the Munich Security Conference. Germany and chancellor -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated them, saying the West is putting on a show of unity like never before. And he's asking allies to act quickly to deliver the tanks they've promised to Ukraine. Appearing by video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed, telling the conference that time is of the essence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, in that regard, he did ask for all the help that he possibly could get in order to fulfill what the western alliance says, which is that Putin cannot win and Ukraine must win. So I asked Chancellor Scholz, of course, he is the host of this conference here in Germany about the worries about stockpiles for ammunition. And he portrayed it in a very interesting way. He said just like the car industry, which is always ready to ramp up its productions and have stockpiles, that's what we need to do to our arms and ammunition industry. This is what he said.

So in the last years, more and more we thought that the relation between the public defense department and the industry is something very similar to a company that is buying a car. So, there is always a stock of cars, there is a permanent production, there is always what you need for maintenance. The way we did it in the past in the last 20 years or so, is that we once ordered and we agreed that the production is stopping because we have already bought what we need. So we have to understand that, for our security, we have to change the way of dealing this fact. We need a permanent production of the most important weapons we are using, and this is also due to maintenance questions. And this is also due to the question of ammunition. And so this is what we are learning, but learning it means that we are now taking action in case of our old defense capabilities, but also doing it in supporting Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But then literally moments later, a Republican state senator went on Fox News and says I don't believe him because I get a sore throat every time I go back home. And so you can't blame folks in this region for mistrust. They actually live in a spot with a legacy of sort of coal runoff, and pollution, and very little political power. But as for the water itself, that is, you know, the Ohio River, the EPA has been watching that closely for years. It was used -- in my -- when I was a boy, it used to ignite on fire. It was so polluted, it's not clean enough, you could swim in it.
