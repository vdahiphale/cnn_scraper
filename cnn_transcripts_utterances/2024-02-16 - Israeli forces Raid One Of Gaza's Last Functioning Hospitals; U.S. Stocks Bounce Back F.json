Video shows the utter destruction as heavy machinery clears the rubble. People are sifting through the debris, hoping to find survivors.

And what you can see is that there is an extension of the buffer zone being built. The area between the Gaza border and the roadway in Egypt has been excavated. It is being extended. And we can also see multiple cranes working in the area to erect the border wall itself. Now, from the NGO, they have said that they were told by two local contractors that were working on this project, that it was commissioned by the Egyptian security forces, saying that they believed that these placards, that these concrete slabs were some five meters or 16 feet high. Now, Egyptian security officials had told CNN just a couple of days ago that they were beefing up the security in that area. They said it was a precautionary measure. That was when we saw extra security officials and machinery in the area. We have reached out to the government, though, after seeing this particular footage as to exactly what they are doing. We understand that the bulldozers arrived February 3rd. By February 6th, excavation had started. So, it's been underway for some 10 days now. And in the past five days, there's been an uptick in the activity. Now, clearly, what this shows is that Egypt is concerned about what the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been very vocal about, that he believes there will be significant action against the area of Rafah. So, with well over a million Palestinians living in Rafah at this point, there is serious concern that there could be a spillover of Palestinians across the Gaza border into Egypt, which is clearly why the Egyptian authorities feel the need to do this. Now, they have been very vocal as well, telling Israel that there should not be an invasion of Rafah, saying through the foreign ministry that there would be grave consequences if that were to happen. And they have been followed by countless world leaders around the globe that have said that this simply shouldn't happen, that there could be devastating consequences and many, many losing their lives.

The charges against Alexander Smirnov undercut a major part of Republicans' corruption claims against the president and the impeachment inquiry that they've launched against him.Smirnov was behind two FBI memos in 2017 and 2020. The latter one came after Joe Biden launched his campaign for president. And it included explosive allegations that a Burisma executives claimed that the company paid Joe Biden and Hunter Biden $5 million each during the time that Biden was vice president in exchange for assisting the company's business interests. The indictment in federal court says that Smirnov's allegations against the Bidens were, quote, a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that actually occurred. But at a later date then he claimed and for the purpose of pitching Burisma under defendants preprint services and products, not for discussing bribes to Joe Biden when he was in office. Smirnov appeared for an initial court appearance in Las Vegas, where he was arrested and CNN has been unable to reach an attorney representing him. Congressional Republicans have touted Smirnov's claims and they fought with the FBI to release the memos of his discussions with the FBI. The indictment against Smirnov cites those very same memos as proof that he allegedly made false statements and created fictitious documents. James Comer, the Republican chairman, who has been leading the investigation of the president, released a statement dismissing the importance of Smirnov to his inquiry and saying that there's more evidence that Republicans have uncovered. The case against Smirnov is being brought by special counsel, David Weiss, who is also prosecuting Hunter Biden on tax and gun possession charges. It's unclear why Weiss has taken nearly four years to bring charges on the allegedly false claims. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Prime minister hailed the legislation as a, quote, milestone for human rights, reflecting today's Greece.All right, turning now to the Caribbean where the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago is describing a recent oil spill as a quote, national emergency. He's promised to provide federal financial support to those affected. A ship overturned off the coast last week, officials say about 15 kilometers or nine miles of coastline is blackened. Residents report constant smell. Officials that they still don't know who owns the ship are exactly what it contains. As ice in the arctic melts, polar bears are retreating to land. Scientists with the Alaska Science Center confirmed this when they measured the movements and behavior of polar bears in a study conducted from 2019 to 2022. And on the study, researchers strapped cameras around collars of 20 polar bears. August to September is the ice-free period increased. Well, the cameras recorded 115 hours of footage and found the bears were indeed spending more time on land. The bears eight berries, vegetation and birds, with the findings, say there is still a risk of starvation. And joining me now is Anthony Pagano, the scientists behind that study. Thank you so much for being here with us. So if I'm trying to summarize the issue that was driving your study. Climate change means less sea ice, which means polar bears have less opportunity to hunt their most important food source, which is seals. And you will what to know if polar bears might be able to adapt and get enough food from eating land-based animals, birds, eggs, grasses, mammals. Is that right?",

Some of the historic cool documentation indicated that they primarily rested well on land. Some more recent observations of suggested that some bears are feeding on a variety of foods on land. But we wanted to actually study certain individuals and quantify what their behavior was using these video collars where we could document what they were doing on land, how active they were, what they were eating, and simultaneously measure their energy expenditure and their changes in body weight to determine whether or not those land- based foods might serve as a benefit to them.",

We were fortunate to be able to a, study these individuals that we were able to work with, they can be pretty intense on equipment. We had to come up with a collar and a device that we felt was durable enough that the bears wouldn't destroy it. And were very pleased when we were able to recover the collars and find that they recorded the data we hope they would.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, what we found was that some of the bears were resting -- resting up to 95 to 98 percent of the time but most of the bears were quite active looking for foods on land. And regardless of whether they were active and feeding on foods on land, or resting, they all lost body mass. Its similar rates losing about one kilogram per day, which highlighted that these land-based foods really aren't an adequate food source to prolong the period they can survive on land with future climate warming.And it's really the sub-adult bears that are going to be at greatest risk. Those smaller bears, the ones that have less experience that can accumulate as much body fat while they're on the sea ice before they come to land, are going to be at greatest risk of starvation in the future.",
