And therein lies some significant challenges for both. But in particular, President Biden, who is 80 years old and would be 86 at the time of his second term, coming to an end. (On camera):  According to an NBC poll, only 26% of American actually want to see Biden run again. If you look deep into the cross tabs of these polls, Democrats by a majority don`t want Biden to run again. And those are some of the headwinds that the President will face. Their headwinds, however, his team is confident he can overcome. Overcome in part due to the sweeping legislative agenda he was able to get past Congress in his first two years, an agenda he will spend much of the next year selling and able to overcome because of who he will be facing. Whether it`s Trump or some other Republican where advisors are very clear, they believe they will have a crystal-clear contrast message that will resonate with the American people. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

At more than 380 feet tall or one and a quarter football field, a tree named Hyperion is located in California`s Redwood National Forest. But its exact location? Well, that`s a secret. Close to visitors to protect the 800-year-old giant. Some redwoods, the tallest trees on earth, have lived for thousands of years. They breathe in the moist, humid air along the California coast, and they can actually help keep the air clean. A man from Michigan believes that cloning these enormous trees is key to fighting climate change. David Milarch co-founded the Archangel Ancient tree Archive, and he`s on a tremendous mission to save the earth with big trees. And some tiny helpers. CNN`s Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir, has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, David Milarch and his Archangel Ancient Tree Archive is trying to plant a new generation of giants. He takes clippings from the tops of the oldest and largest, some 400 feet tall, back to his lab in Copemish, Michigan. There, specialists use a technique called micropropagation to grow them into saplings. And he says that from a single sample, a team of scientists can grow an unlimited number of clones. The problem, how to get them all in the ground. It would probably take an army. That is where these little soldiers come in. They are tree-schoolers at the Cow Hollow School in San Francisco. You heard right, not pre, but tree- schoolers who attend outdoor classes to learn about ecology and sustainability at an early age by getting their little hands dirty.",

He hopes someday to replant millions of redwoods all over the world, using our littlest citizens to help sow the seeds for the biggest forms of life and a healthier planet. As the old proverb goes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now. The meaning may not dawn on these tree schoolers quite yet, but they are proof that you`re never too young or too old to have an impact. And even the tiniest of hands can make a huge difference.

As soon as there`s an empty box anywhere in a house, a cat`s going to jump in that thing quicker than a hiccup. Other animals don`t do that. I consider myself a cat person, so I`m really looking forward to this report. You`ve probably seen a video like this one, where the millions like it. The Internet is overrun by cats in boxes.

Nice place to hide and cozy up and take a nap. Also, a great ambush point. Cats are ambush predators and would much rather just sit under a shrub and slowly wait for their prey to just meander by so that they can successfully catch it. A cardboard box inside can serve a similar purpose and provide a place for them to pounce.",

It`s been proven that cats are far lessstressed and also less likely to break with illness in a shelter setting if they`re provided with a box, because they need a place to feel safe and to be able to hide. One of the reasons cats like cardboard boxes so much is because cardboard is insulating and helps cats not need to expel any additional energy to maintain their body temperature.",
