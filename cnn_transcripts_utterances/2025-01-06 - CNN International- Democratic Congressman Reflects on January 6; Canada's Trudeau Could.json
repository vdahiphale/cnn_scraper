Just ahead, exactly four years after demonstrators storm the U.S. Capitol, Congress meets today to certify Donald Trump's election win.And bracing for a snow emergency tens of millions of Americans are under winter weather alerts. We will have a full forecast just ahead. Plus, is at the end of an era in Canada, reports say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could be ready to resign. We are live in the Capital of Ottawa this hour. It happens every four years in the United States after a presidential election, each state's electoral votes are counted during a joint session of Congress. It used to be a procedural event, and then January 6th happened. Four people lost their lives on that day in 2021 when a mob of Donald Trump supporters overran the Capitol in a violent assault. And for the first time since that day, Congress will again meet to confirm a new president, but this time, we expect, with little or no drama at all. Just a few hours from now, Trump's election victory will be certified, and law enforcement on Capitol Hill is on high alert. President Biden, meanwhile, says he is determined to see a peaceful transfer of power, and here's what he told reporters about the incoming administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Today, we expect that the President of the Senate, Kamala Harris, she, will be presiding over a joint session of both the Senate and the House, and her job is simply to open each state certification then hand it over to the four tellers. That's the top Republican and top Democrat on both the Senate Administration Committee and the House Administration Committee. At that point, the tellers will read and record each state's tally of who their electoral ballots are going to. At this moment, we don't expect Democrats to be challenging any of the results of this election, and reforms to the Electoral Count Act that passed several years ago would make that much harder. It would really raise the threshold of how many lawmakers it would even take to challenge the election. All said and done, if everything goes according to plan, we expect that this would take under an hour to accomplish, and lawmakers are not expected to do any additional business today. So, this is it. They will certify the election, and then they will gavel out for the rest of the day.",

JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): It was a devastating day for our democracy, and what Joe Biden said, I think, are wise words. When George Washington first handed off power, it shocked the world, and when John Adams, after the -- after the country's first contested election, handed off power to Thomas Jefferson, it shocked the world and impressed the world all over again. And I grew up with pictures of those founding fathers in my bedroom wall. I swore an oath to the Constitution as a Marine Officer, and I came to Congress really worshiping those hallowed halls and to see them defiled by those insurrectionists was a terrible day. And now I'm back here four years later, on a snow storm because I want to watch Kamala Harris certify her own defeat in an act of patriotism that Donald Trump just could never understand.",

And yet, now at least the Globe and Mail Newspaper is reporting that he has decided to step aside. And Amara, this is where it gets into uncharted territory. Firstly, we don't know if he's going to stay on, as you know, Prime Minister temporarily, until his party can elect a new leader and then go to a general election sometime this year, or something that's never happened in Canada, which is that an interim prime minister would be appointed until the Liberal Party elects the leader. Though, suffice it to say, Amara look, this has been brewing for months in fact, in Canada. Canadians really dissatisfied with the level of inflation, certainly the high level of legal, legal immigration, which has put -- you know a huge crunch on things like affordable housing and other public services, including health care. You know, the polls right now show Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre perhaps somebody unknown to the rest of the world, but he's been at this a long time. He's leading the Liberal Party right now, but more than 20 percent and so the Liberal Party certainly decided it was time, after more than nine years, to as -- you know, gently as they could, although it's not so gentle right now at this hour to tell Trudeau to step aside.",

I mean, look Donald Trump saying that he had 25 percent tariffs on Canada coming into office. Justin Trudeau whipped down to Mar-a-Lago had a conversation with him. But the tariffs are still on the table, and many Canadians are wondering, given all the economic frustration right now, if Justin Trudeau is the best person to really fight for Canada in that situation.

      "sentences": "So, investigators here in Seoul did two major things today, and let's spend some time talking about the first thing corruption. Investigators asked South Korea's police force to take over to carry out the arrest warrant against South Korea suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol.He is suspended because lawmakers voted last month to impeach him after he declared martial law on December 3rd into the early morning hours of December 4th, he has not been removed from office. That decision is up to a court, and that decision could be made within the next six months. So why would corruption investigators here ask the police force to carry out this warrant. It is because on Friday, these corruption investigators tried and failed to arrest suspended President Yoon. They went to his home, but Yoon's Presidential Security Service and members of the military formed a human shield protecting Yoon from arrest. Now Yoon's lawyers say the warrant was illegal and invalid. So again, why move this into the hands of South Korean police rather than keep this with those same corruption investigators? Well, the police have a larger force, more people and more resources to carry out an arrest. But it is still anybody's guess if this will be successful, because Yoon has told his supporters he does not intend to turn himself in. Investigators are also working against the clock here. That is the second major thing that they did today. They have requested an extension of their arrest warrant because they were facing a midnight local time deadline. Now, even though suspended President Yoon has managed to escape arrest, at least up until this point, there is still the first trial session for his impeachment process that has been set for next week. And again, that process is what could remove him from office. Mike Valerio, CNN, Seoul.",

Thomas Gift is the Director of the Center on U.S. Politics at University College London. He's joining us now from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Thomas, appreciate your time.So, we were saying just about 4.5 hours from now, at 01:00 p.m. local time, we will see a joint session of Congress convene. They will be the newly sworn in members will be counting the electoral votes to certify President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. It sounds like a mundane event, but as we know, four years ago, it wasn't. If you could just spend some time reflecting on just how dramatically different the environment is today, four years later. THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR OF CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, thanks so much for having me, Amara. It's great to be with you. Trump really has all the political momentum right now. We're just in a totally different environment than we were four years ago, after January 6, 2021. Then Mitch McConnell had called Trump morally responsible for the Capitol Insurrection. Trump had just been impeached for a second time. Most experts were writing Trump's political obituary, but Trump has really defied the odds. [08:35:00] And I think the numbers that you just showed suggest just how much he has to scale going from negative 20 favorability to just negative one favorability, and just 5 percent of Americans saying that January 6 was the most significant memory from Trump's first term. That is stunningly low and sort of how Trump managed to do this, I think it's going to be the question for historians to write.",

And unlike Trump, you know, Harris is not casting doubt on the election.Obviously, she lost the election to Donald Trump, and we saw in a pre- recorded video that, you know, she's focused on ensuring that there is a peaceful transfer of power that is the expectation today, obviously.

I think the significance of Harris presiding over her own electoral defeat, it shouldn't be remarkable, but it is, because before 2021 as was noted, very few Americans even realized that there was a certification process by a joint session of Congress because it was so pro forma.But that's no longer the case. Trump has taken an ax to virtually every single democratic institution and norm, but Trump's biggest legacy has to be eroding trust in the legitimacy of U.S. elections. You know, after the 2020 election, more than half of Republicans thought that votes weren't counted accurately. Now that Trump has won upwards of a quarter of Democratic voters now don't think that the 2024 election was fair. So, this is a problem, and it's not clear you can put the genie back in the bottle.",

Meanwhile, there are a lot of Republican allies put allies in quote, who -- essentially their raise on -- is to lower governments funding. So, I think Mike Johnson is going to be put in a very difficult position. He's going to need to be both Trump's interpreter as well as his enforcer. But there are plenty of Republicans I think, that aren't four squares behind the Trumpian agenda and trying to get all of these items through one bill.

So, you know, we've heard so much about the fact that Donald Trump is coming in with a unified Congress and a conservative Supreme Court, but where the rubber really meets the road. That's going to be a big challenge for Donald Trump. I think he's got about 100 days to get through one major piece of legislation. That's what we've seen in the past with George W. Bush, No Child Left Behind, with Obama, the Affordable Care Act with Biden, the pandemic relief bill. So, Trump is going to have to prioritize and he's going to have to ensure that one allies on Capitol Hill can really help at least work through some of those compromises --",

The report says an exchange would depend on reaching a permanent cease fire agreement and a deal for Israel to withdraw its forces from Gaza.But Israel is casting doubt on this report and denying that there is any agreement with Hamas on hostages. Gaza's Ministry of Health is reporting another baby has died of hypothermia. They say a one-month- old child named Yousef died because there was no warm shelter as temperatures across Gaza plunged. The health ministry says he was the sixth baby to succumb to hypothermia in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Syrian officials met with Qatar's Prime Minister in Doha over the weekend and called on the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria. That's according to Reuters.

And going into the night, Emilia Perez had the most nominations of all with 10. And they fared very well, which sets it up very nicely for the Oscars. Then you look at the brutalist, which became a big winner last night and won more awards than Conclave, and both of those films were also leading the nominee list.
