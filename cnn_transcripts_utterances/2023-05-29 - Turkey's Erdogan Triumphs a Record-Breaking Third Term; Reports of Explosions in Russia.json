Here is more of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator):  It is time to unite and unify around our goals and national dreams.

U.S. President, Joe Biden, also said he wants to keep working together as NATO allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, congratulated Mr. Erdogan saying, \"France and Turkey have huge challenges to face together.\" Including the return of peace to Europe, the future of their Euro- Atlantic Alliance, and the Mediterranean Sea. He added that with Erdogan they will continue to move forward. And the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, wrote that the election was, \"Clear evidence of the Turkish people's support for Erdogan's efforts to strengthen state sovereignty and pursue an independent foreign policy.\" Putin also said he appreciates Erdogan's, \"Personal contribution to the strengthening of friendly Russian-Turkish relations and mutually beneficial cooperation in various areas.\" Joining me now, Soner Cagaptay is the director of the Turkish research program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He is also the author of \"A Sultan in Autumn: Erdogan Faces Turkey's Uncontainable Forces.\" It's always good to see Soner. Now, you said before the runoff that Turkey under Erdogan had been -- how you said it, was a democracy that had fallen under an autocrat rather than an autocracy. Now, this wasn't a crushing victory, but how will Erdogan's win change that phrase in your mind in terms of him feeling emboldened, perhaps? SONER CAGAPTAY, DIRECTOR, TURKISH RESEARCH PROGRAM, WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR EAST POLICY AND AUTHOR, \"A SULTAN IN AUTUMN\":  I think we're coming to an inflection point in President Erdogan's career. Elections in Turkey were free and are still free, but the race has become so unfair that it is really hard to speak of this as a purely democratic victory. President Erdogan benefited from the incumbency advantages. His complete control of institutions and information flow. For instance, in the campaign season, his -- Erdogan's campaign freely spread fake news, fake videos, and fake pamphlets alleging, of course, a lie that the opposition candidate Kilicdaroglu is backed by terrorists. Now, typically, a board in Turkey any such fake news spreading but the boards reporting to Erdogan, of course, did not take any action. That's the first part. The second part is Erdogan's complete control of information flow. Opposition candidate Kilicdaroglu was not allowed to make a case that, of course, he's not backed by terrorists. And I think that was a huge advantage for President Erdogan. So, I would say, whereas until recently, I was up the analytical view that Turkey was a democracy that has fallen under an autocrat. I think we can now say that Turkey's mood from being illiberal European democracy to becoming a Eurasian autocracy has upped these elections.",

That eliminated him and left Erdogan with a weaker opponent.Now, yes, President Erdogan has incumbency advantages, control of institutions, information flow. But opposition candidate Kilicdaroglu also did not really run an inspiring campaign. I don't think he put together a team to convince the voters that Turkey had problems and he could fix them.

      "sentences": "In some ways, it's changed quite a bit. The founder of modern Turkey, Ataturk, had a vision. He was also a Jacobean (ph) top- down politician who used his cache (ph) as Turkey's founder and liberator after World War I, of course, to shape Turkey in his own image as a secular Europe facing and western society.Erdogan shares none of these values. He wants Turkey to be in his own image, shaped as a socially conservative, politically Islamists, and internationally Middle Eastern nation. Now, we could argue that Erdogan has had some success in this regard. But while Erdogan, of course, is Turkey's elected president, he nowhere has the cache that President Ataturk had, who founded Turkey. And secondly, I think Erdogan, of course, has Ataturk's vision. He also believes in top-down social engineering. So, I call him an empty Ataturk, meaning he does not share Ataturk's values. He has the opposite values. But he leads in the same social engineering. But the problem with this kind of top-down Jacobean (ph) social engineering is that I think the time for that in Turkey or elsewhere has passed. And that is why President Erdogan has had some success shaping Turkey in his own image. He controls institutions, public policy, educational curriculum. But half of Turkey still does not want to be like him or fall under his power. So, I think that kind of leaves us in a country that is split, that has elected Erdogan for another five-year term. When he finishes his job in office, Erdogan would have run Turkey for 25 years, that is longer than Mustafa Kemal Ataturk or any other president in the country's modern history.",

Social media can pose a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. That's according to a 25-page advisory from the U.S. surgeon general. Earlier this year, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned of the unfair matchup. DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL:  You're pitting a child against the world's greatest product designer and that's just not a fair fight. YURKEVICH (voiceover):  Nearly every U.S. teenager is on social media. Up to 95 percent of kids, ages 13 to 17, report using social media with more than a third using it all the time. Kids must typically be 13 to register on social media apps, but nearly 40 percent of children ages eight to 12 use it anyway. DR. MURTHY:  I think that it's a time, you know, early adolescence where kids are developing their identity, their sense of self, and this skewed and often distorted environment of social media often does a disservice to many of those children. YURKEVICH (voiceover):  The advisory concluded, we do not yet have enough evidence to determine if social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents. Calling for more research. But it did cite studies which found increase risk of anxiety and depression, poor sleep, online harassment, and low self-esteem. JEROME YANKEY, DELETED TIKTOK IN 2021:  The time I spent looking at all these attractive people, doing amazing things in amazing places, getting disappointed by my own life is never something I want to be doing. Especially when I have the power to change it but I just wasn't because I was spending hours on this app. YURKEVICH (voiceover):  Some experts say, TikTok has the stickiest and most addicting algorithm, keeping people on the app longer. Last year, TikTok users spent an hour and a half per day on the app on average, more than any other social media platform. This, as Montana becomes the first state to ban the social media app on all devices, prompting TikTok to sue.",
