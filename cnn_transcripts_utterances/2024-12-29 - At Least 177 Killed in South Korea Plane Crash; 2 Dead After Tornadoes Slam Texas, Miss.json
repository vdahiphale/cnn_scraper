      "sentences": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Amara Walker in Atlanta. Victor Blackwell has the morning off.We begin with breaking news this morning. At least 177 people were killed when a South Korean plane crashed at an airport. 181 people were on board. Now, two crew members were pulled alive from the wreckage. Rescuers say the rest of the passengers and crew are presumed dead. Video into CNN shows the plane dragging on the belly of the plane on the runway with no landing gear before bursting into flames. Local fire officials and aviation experts say some sort of landing gear malfunction was likely. There's also speculation from officials that this may have been caused by a bird strike. The pilot also made a mayday call shortly after the control tower warned about birds in the area. According to Flight Aware, the Jeju airliner was listed as a Boeing 737 traveling from Bangkok, Thailand, before a crash landed at the Muan Airport in South Korea. That's in the southwest part of the country. This is the country's worst air disaster in decades. CNN's Mike Valerio has been following this breaking news story from Seoul. Mike, update us on the investigation and where things stand now.",

      "sentences": "Well, I would say that probably the most dramatic element, Amara, under the flood lights that are illuminating the crash site here, is just the urgent effort to try to find the two sets of remains that are of the passengers who are unaccounted for right now.I'll tell you, we've had such a whiplash, you know, chain of events as we followed this story throughout the day here in South Korea. And there was so much hope, Amara, as you mentioned, after the two people were found, the survivors in the back of the plane, the two crew members were rescued and made it out with their lives. There was hope from a whole host of emergency responders that perhaps a third or a fourth person could be found alive as well. But that hope quickly diminished after the noon hour here in South Korea. So what's happening right now the two survivors are being moved to hospitals here in Seoul. We don't know their exact conditions as of yet or if they've been able to speak to investigators. But what they have to say will be critical because the voice and data recorders that comprise the black boxes of this aircraft have both been found. So when you combine those two elements plus the two survivors that could paint a more accurate picture because there are elements that are in tension of just what happened here. And what we mean by that is we have a whole slew of people who were involved in the investigation from government officials that have come from Seoul and also more local leaders like the chief of the fire department who have mentioned that bird strikes, or a bird strike, I should say singular, could have played a role in a cascading series of events that led to the landing gear malfunctioning. But still, you know, from our analysts who we've spoken to over the past couple hours, it's unclear how a potential bird strike would lead to landing gear not coming down, would lead to the flaps on the aircraft wings not coming up to slow down the speed of the aircraft. It's not clear why exactly the 737-800 landed so far down the runway, very close to the end of the runway. And why there was all of this equipment near the end of the runway, which is what the plane slammed into when it met its cataclysmic end. So there are still so many unanswered questions. But, Amara, as you -- and, you know, so many of our viewers have been following, we're coming off a time of martial law, December 3rd into December 4th. We're now on our third person who's holding the powers of the president because of the impeachment saga that has been going on since December 3rd. So to say that this has cast a new pall over the country, I would say is such an understatement as so many people are in mourning here across South Korea. Amara.",

      "sentences": "Well, there are so many different aspects to this and unanswered questions. I don't see any connection between a bird strike and whether the landing gear was able to come up or down or not. I really can't see that those two things are related.However, what can be related is the response to a bird strike. So after you hit a flock of birds, you may have an engine out, you might have things going on, and that creates a lot of chaos in that cockpit as far as how the aircraft is going to land, where it's going to land on the runway, all of those things, you don't have a lot of options. If you overshoot a runway by a little bit, which appears this happened here, is that you're going to hit in the middle of the runway as you traverse down it. So that can cause that over speed condition at the end. But there's so many different unanswered questions and yes, flight data recorder will give us those answers.",

But there's no answer as to why that lighting facility, which is a large piece of concrete equipment, is -- is located exactly where it is. No reason in my mind for it to be there.

So even though you get those warnings, by the time you get the landing gear down in the position that they were in, you wouldn't have time to get them fully extended. So that -- that may be the problem here, is that they didn't have time to make a go around and assure that the gear had been lowered properly. WALKER: You know, David, it's remarkable that we're talking about survivors in yet another plane crash here. Two survivors, we understand they are crew members who were pulled out of this plane. They were apparently found in the tail of the plane. And I want to ask you this because we've been talking about. Wow, I think it was the Azerbaijan airline where you had survivors as well.

There was 39% fatality rate in those people that are in the front of the aircraft versus the middle of the aircraft, which was around 34%.

Weighing in for the first time on an issue that has really divided his supporters this week. I want to read for you what he told the New York Post in a phone interview on Saturday.He said, quote, \"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That's why we have them.\" He added, I have many H- 1B visas on my properties, I've been a believer in H-1B. I've used it many times. It's a great program. Now, to take a step back here. This is a conversation that has really come kind of shown a rift among his supporters this week. On one hand, you have kind of The MAGA faithful, the people who have been very loyal to Donald Trump and many of whom have been attracted to him because of his hardline immigration views. Then on the other hand, you have a lot of the Silicon Valley latecomers to this, people who have supported Donald Trump, but also really rely on these high skilled foreign workers for their own businesses. Now, all of this kind of started playing out when we saw Elon Musk, a close confidant of Donald Trump and also someone who is going to be running his new Department of Government Efficiency initiative, started weighing in on it on X this week, really defending the H-1B visa program. We also saw Vivek Ramaswamy, who's going to be running that initiative with him, defend that program as well. Now, to be clear, Donald Trump has been ambiguous on this issue in the past. I'd remind you that back during his first administration, we actually saw H-1B visas -- excuse me, H-1B visas declined significantly during his first-term and at one point his administration had even suspended them altogether. However, earlier this year, Donald Trump told a popular podcast that he actually believed that any immigrant who came to this country and graduated from a United States university should receive a green card and be allowed to stay in the country. All to say, Donald Trump is now saying that he supports this program. It's unclear exactly what this will mean for policies come his next administration. Now, one thing as well I want to note is going back to Elon Musk's support of this program. He weighed in again on Friday, something that drew a lot of ire from far right pundits like Laura Loomer and Ann Coulter. I'm going to read for you what he said. Musk said, quote, \"The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B. He added, I will go to war on this issue, the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend. So as of now, it does seem that Donald Trump and Elon Musk are aligned on this issue, despite a lot of the backlash we've seen Musk and others who have supported this program receive this week.

      "sentences": "New pictures released this week of Joe Biden when he was vice president, meeting with some of his son Hunter Biden's business associates in China. These images released by the National Archives after a lawsuit from a right wing pro Trump legal organization.And the photos show what we've known for a while, but we've never seen that there was at least one photo op between Vice President Joe Biden in 2013 during an official visit to China where he met some of Hunter Biden's business partners from the private equity firm DHR Partners. You can see the pictures of Hunter Biden introducing his father to these Chinese business executives and they all posed all smiles for this photo op. Now, not only are we seeing these images for the very first time, but we also saw pictures of Joe Biden introducing his son to top Chinese government officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, one of the most powerful figures in the world, as well as the Vice President of China at the time, who was also participating in some of those bilateral meetings. So this is important because these pictures of Joe meeting some of his son's business partners undercuts the unequivocal denials that President Biden has previously offered where he said that there was never any contact between him and his son's business affairs. Now, we've known for a while that those denials haven't really held up. They weren't true, they weren't accurate. Because it has come to light that there were some dinners, some phone calls and some meet and greets and some photo ops like the pictures that you saw here. That being said, Hunter Biden himself testified to Congress earlier this year and he said, yes, there were photo ops, yes, maybe I put him on speakerphone once or twice, but we never discussed any substantive business and he was not involved in the financial arrangements whatsoever. A former Hunter Biden business partner here in the U.S. testified that he thought Hunter was selling the illusion of access, but not actually selling access. Now, Republicans have argued that pictures like these and all of these contacts amount to a corrupt and illegal influence peddling scheme. But of course, I have to note that the Justice Department spent years investigating Hunter Biden and never charged him with violating any lobbying laws or any sort of corruption whatsoever. Hunter Biden's attorney released a statement about these pictures saying, quote, \"These attacks trying to twist these images into something they are not is just more of the same old tired, misinformation spin from some Republicans who can't let go of their ridiculous conspiracy theories.\" Marshall Cohen, CNN, Washington.",

Investigations are still ongoing, but nearby Ukrainian drone attacks in the moments preceding the crash have led some officials to believe that the plane may have been downed mistakenly by Russian anti-aircraft defenses, with officials in Azerbaijan saying that the plane came under external physical and technical interferences while in Russian airspace. Meanwhile, several aviation experts and U.S. officials have said that perforations seen in the fuselage are consistent with shrapnel damage from an explosion, but the cause of the holes in the wreckage has not yet been confirmed. Investigators are continuing to assess the evidence, including two black box recorders which were recovered from the wreckage, as well as, of course, eyewitness accounts. Remarkably, 29 people out of 67 on board the survived the crash, some of whom filmed their final moments on the flight, one survivor describing a loud bang being heard and felt before the plane began to descend. But it could still be a matter of days or even weeks before any final conclusions are made by investigators.

How quickly the airlines have been able to recover. We have seen over half the flights at Houston and Dallas get delayed because of thunderstorms. But overall, it's not leading to the catastrophic sort of domino effect that we saw in 2022. So that's the good news. I would tell people, though, knowledge is power here. You want to get to the airport earlier than normal. You want to know what's happening at both your home airport and the airport you're traveling to and have a backup plan.
