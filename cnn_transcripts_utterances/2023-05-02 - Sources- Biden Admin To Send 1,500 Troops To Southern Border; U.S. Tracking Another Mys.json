Sources tell CNN President Biden making plans to send an additional 1500 active-duty troops to America's southern border. This comes as the administration prepares for the end of the Title 42 immigration program which allowed the U.S. to bar migrants or at least delay them during the pandemic.CNN reporter Priscilla Alvarez joins us now live. Now, Priscilla, we should note that when President Trump sent active-duty military to the border, there was a great deal of outrage here. Now, we see President Biden taking a similar move, what first is the administration preparing for next week when Title 42 ends? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on camera): Jim, the bottom line is that the White House is preparing for an influx of migrants next week when that COVID era restriction known as Title 42 expires. And it will expire because that is also when the Coronavirus public health emergency ends, which is the basis of this authority. Now, as you mentioned, the federal government and the previous administration has taken this action before, to send troops to the border when they anticipate there will be a surge of migrants. And we know that there are currently 2500 National Guard troops that are already there. And the White House said that they're essentially there to free up resources for Border Patrol agents. So, some of what the (INAUDIBLE) do includes, for example, ground- based detection and monitoring, data entry, and warehouse support. They are not going to be interacting with migrants. And the White House press secretary also making clear moments ago that they plan to still maintain the safe and humanly -- humane processing of migrants. But all of this really coming to a head, Jim, next week as they see already that numbers are climbing. A Homeland Security Official tells me that they have more than 22,000 people in CBP custody. They are at 7500 daily encounters. So, all these numbers really starting to climb and indicate where things are headed.",

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says the U.S. will be out of cash in less than a month and that it's going to cause Americans \"severe hardship.\" The good news is the solution is easy or should be.Anyway, Congress and the White House just have to raise the debt ceiling. They've done it dozens of times over the decades, regardless of which party is in charge. The bad news is that this time, Republicans and Democrats are playing a very dangerous game of chicken and they may be putting all their eggs in one basket with a high- stakes meeting between President Biden and Speaker McCarthy next week. Let's take you now live to Capitol Hill and CNN's Melanie Zanona who's been tracking all the latest developments for us. Melanie, since this meeting was announced yesterday, it seems like both sides have just dug in their heels. MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, you're absolutely right. And despite learning that we now may be facing a June first deadline for a debt default, both sides are actually hardening their positions instead of softening them. Over on the Democratic side, you had Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reiterating his calls to pass a clean debt ceiling hike without any conditions attached, saying we don't have the luxury of time here. And Republicans, meanwhile saying well, that's why Biden should have agreed to sit down with Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the House much earlier. But there is at least one rank-and-file Democrat who disagrees with his party's position. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): It's unsustainable, the direction we're going now with 31 and a half trillion. And then basically saying that, well, we're going to do is not talk about it. But then come back and talk about it. Why not talk about it now, make sure that we have an agreement, that this is something we all can -- are concerned about? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But so far, Democrats are standing firm in their position. And in fact, in the House, the Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries took early procedural steps today to eventually potentially force a floor vote on a clean debt ceiling hike, but they would need the support of Republicans and they just aren't there yet. So, all eyes are on this high-stakes meeting between Biden and McCarthy next week. And the stakes couldn't be higher, Boris.",

They will not negotiate over this debt ceiling bill. And so that puts the White House and House Republicans in the same place that they were before we learned of this new June one deadline, which is essentially there is no overlap between these two positions.So, what's going to happen here? The White House feels like they do have the political ground as it relates to this. They are going to continue to insist that it is Congress's constitutional duty to raise this. They're going to point to the fact that Republicans have previously approved clean debt ceiling increases. But ultimately something is going to have to move. And the big question is whether or not next week, that meeting between President Biden and the four congressional leaders, if that can lead to any kind of sense that look, we're going to maybe be willing to do some kind of clean debt ceiling talk about spending on the side. That is where the White House is leaning right now. But we will see if and when that is possible next week, Boris.",

They say it's from intelligence that has been downgraded and therefore made public. It also says that 20,000 have indeed been killed, and half of those are Wagner serving probably in the area of Bakhmut where we know the Wagner has mostly been deployed. So, it's difficult to know exactly what the methodology behind these numbers were. Whether it's to do with the number of wounded. They would have expected to see compared to how NATO would function in their casualty evacuation operations but we do know that Russia has been particularly bad at getting its wounded to survive. So, a lot we don't really know about this number. One thing that's very clear about it, though, is it is startling, it certainly reflects some degree a reality of Russia's appalling management of its forces over the winter. They've thrown everything they can at Bakhmut. I've spoken to Russian convicts who were recruited directly by the Ministry of Defense, they said, who were in hospitals in Russia. I'm being told they'd have to go back wounded to serve at the front lines. So, they've really done everything they possibly can to try and take Bakhmut, they failed. And that's certainly I think, reflected in the catastrophic numbers that we're hearing from the Pentagon. Quite what their methodology is behind them, we don't know, Boris.",
