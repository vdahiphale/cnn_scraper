The brothers have been serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for killing their parents in their Beverly Hills home back in 1989. But their lawyers want the court to consider new evidence, which they say bolsters the defense's argument that the pair feared for their lives after suffering years of sexual and other abuse at the hands of their father.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, just to have it happen is a very, very significant factor here, because, just as you said, it's been over two decades, well over two decades, that they have appeared in court at all.And according to the upcoming district attorney, and George Gascon, who is outgoing as the district attorney of Los Angeles County, there are various roads to have them gaining their freedom. First of all, it's what is going to be the focus today. It's a habeas corpus petition that was filed in 2023 by the defense. George Gascon's office did not act on it, did not mention it, but now finally it has come into a courtroom. Now, this is a status hearing. And so a status hearing can be, let's just check to see where everybody is until we get to the main hearing, or it could go farther because it's up to the judge where he wants to take this today. But the habeas petition is really focused on two main issues, number one, a letter that Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin the months before the murders, according to the defense. That letter, they are alleging, was undiscoverable at the time of trial, so the jury did not get to see it. But in that letter, he says: \"I'm scared of my father. I'm scared he's going to come into my bedroom at night.\" Now, the cousin actually did testify in the trial, but the letter did not come into the trial. So they're saying that, if there was a new jury, that they could find them not guilty because of this letter. Number two, a member of the group Menudo has come forward saying that he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez, the father of Erik and Lyle, when he was a young boy, because Jose Menendez was a record executive. He dealt with Menudo. And they are saying once again, if a jury had known this, that there could be a different verdict. So that's what the issue is with the habeas petition, which we understand, according to upcoming DA Hochman, will be focused on today in court.",

      "sentences": "Yes, hey, Boris. Great to be with you.Look, what I think this judge is going to do is, he's going to consolidate the two matters that Jean just talked about. You have got a habeas corpus petition and then you also have what's called a request for resentencing. That's what she was talking about, where the Menendez brothers legal team has said to the judge, look, there's a law in California that says that if you commit a murder and you're under 26, that you are eligible for parole after 35 years, so 35 to life, not life without the possibility of parole. And the Menendez legal team is also arguing that the court needs to consider what Jean talked about, that note that one of the Menendez brothers wrote a month before the second trial happened, and that would be used then like a mitigation factor, right, to then have this judge eventually rule, yes, we will resentence. And then if he says yes to that, then it's got to go to a parole board then too. So this thing is not going to be wrapped up today or any time soon. I expect there to be probably a consolidation of both these hearings and then a new court date set probably a few weeks later to allow the new DA, Nathan Hochman, also to weigh in on what his recommendation is going to be.",

There were two trials, one that ended without a verdict, the second one that did, the first one that allowed testimony about the alleged sexual abuse.The second one, according to the defense, did not, and obviously a very different outcome. And then you also had just the time in which this was happening, of course, which was the proximity to the O.J. Simpson case in California. It's hard to overstate how much was going on and how much of a focus and how much drama revolved around these trials.",

We have talked about the new DA. We have talked about the old DA. We have talked about the fact that the lawyers for the families, members of the families want these two released. And this will be in a virtual appearance, what we understand, the first time the Menendez brothers have been seen together in public in decades. But we also have the overriding factor of Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been asked for clemency in this, has been requested. And he has said, as Deadline reported last week, he said, I'm not doing anything until the new DA gets in. So there's a lot of hurry up and wait here. I agree with my co-guest here. We might see a consolidation, but we are -- and I also agree with my co-guest here -- we are not going to see this resolved today.",

There's a new sheriff in town, figuratively, and Nathan Hochman has got elected on a be tough on crime in a city that's been greatly worried about crime rates rising. This was something that came up during the DA debates earlier this year, where the now incoming DA said to the incumbent, look, man, you're just doing this for P.R. You have had this on your desk for over a year. You have done nothing. And we have seen, we should talk about this, the power of Netflix in this. There was the Netflix series, the drama by Ryan Murphy, \"Monsters,\" that was about the brothers. There was a documentary on Peacock last year which revealed this new evidence from the cousin who got the letter. Who have now -- we have obviously, as Jean mentioned, seen the member of Menudo who talked about being abused by the elder Menendez. All those factors are important. And I have also -- as I mentioned earlier, there are members of the family who want the siblings released. But let's be clear. There are also members of the family who do not want them released. And, as Jean said, this was a double murder. To talk about Jose Menendez, that has been pretty strongly established. And we do live in a different time when it comes to talking about male sexual abuse. Kitty Menendez, on the other hand, let's be clear. Those boys -- and they were not boys at the time. They were young men. They followed their mother down the hall with shotguns. During that second trial, photos of her were shown in the courtroom day after day after day, photos that were a horrific scene of what had happened. That has to play a factor. No one denies these killings happened. We have to ask ourselves, in changing culture, in changing times and changing DAs, will those pieces of evidence sway either way?",

      "speaker": "REID",
      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, this must be devastating for the special counsel, Jack Smith.He was brought in to handle these two cases. But the fact is, is that there is internal Justice Department guidance that says that you cannot indict or prosecute a sitting president. And they had to discuss with the leadership of the Justice Department, well, what do you do with a pending case against a president-elect? And a source familiar with this thinking tells me, look, Smith is a rules guy. He wants to follow the procedures, the practices of the Justice Department, which is why he is moving to dismiss this case. Now, what's also interesting about this case is, this is the case where the Supreme Court had to answer the question of whether the former president at that time, former President Trump, had any immunity to shield him from some of the charges in this case, because his lawyers argued that some of the allegations were related to his official conduct. And the Supreme Court took roughly seven months to weigh in on that question. And, of course, they did rule that he had some immunity to protect him from prosecution. But if the Supreme Court had weighed in when Jack Smith initially asked them, roughly a year ago, last December, it is possible that the special counsel could have had time to bring some case, depending on what would remain after the Supreme Court's analysis. But the Supreme Court, again, waiting seven months to reveal the answer to that question making it virtually impossible that the special counsel could bring this case. And this was really the only federal case that they could have realistically brought against Trump before the November election. People on both sides of the aisle have told me that the classified documents case was going to take longer, no matter who the judge was, but, again, the special counsel definitely hindered by the Supreme Court taking so long here. But, look, the Trump lawyers, they also deserve credit. They have very aggressively litigated on behalf of their client. Pretty much every conceivable constitutional claim that he could make, they have made it. And they were successful even beyond their expectations with the immunity argument at the Supreme Court. But once he became president-elect, they made it clear they were going to press to have all of these cases tossed out. And if they weren't, Trump was going to have his attorney general do it once he or she got into office. So this is not a huge surprise, the special counsel moving to dismiss this historic case.",

They did not vote for him to dismantle our democracy, to attack the Constitution, to politicize all of our agencies, and certainly not as a referendum on his criminal cases. Those cases should have been played out in a court of law. I believe the attorney general should have started the investigation a lot earlier. I believe the Supreme Court should have moved much quicker in its opinion, and this shouldn't -- that Donald Trump should not have been able to run out the clock on these charges. But I certainly don't think anything that came from the election was a reflection of support for Donald Trump getting rid of these cases, largely because the American people, as you and I as well, we don't know what the actual evidence is.",

That can't possibly be. It's the same thing now. This is how Donald Trump operates. He floats it. He normalizes it. And then it just becomes part of the common parlance. And so we wanted to lay down a marker to say and put everyone on record, Republicans included, that the Constitution is very clear that he cannot serve another term. And what my fear is, is that, with him floating that, with some of his Cabinet picks, which clearly are prioritizing political loyalists, that Donald Trump is well on his way to dismantling our government and the way that it operates.
