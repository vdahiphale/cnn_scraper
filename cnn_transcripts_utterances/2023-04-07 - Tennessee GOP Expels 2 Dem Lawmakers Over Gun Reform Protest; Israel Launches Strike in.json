JEREMY FAISON (R), CAUCUS CHAIR, TENNESSEE STATE HOUSE: So that's an excellent question. More than just what America has seen that took place last Thursday, there's a history all year long of disrupting committees and the House floor. We've called them out. The chairmen of committees, the speaker of the House has been calling them out, time and time again, for grabbing the mic, sucking the air out of the room, making sure no other voice is heard. And finally, when they come and -- and act so foolish on the House floor -- this is a sacred place that belongs to everybody -- and literally start looking up into the gallery with a bullhorn, getting the protesters worked up into a frenzy. That is incumbent on us to say you've gone a step too far. And I'd like to add to you all, they've not backed down from that either. I told them earlier today, I feel like if they would have said, You know what? We messed up. I mean, what American, what human, won't bring forgiveness and redemption? But they doubled down and to which so far as to stand in the well today and said I'd do it again. That was their mentality.

They did it. They did it to the two black members and especially the two black men. It's like, usually, especially with something like this. The -- the way people think about black men in this society needs to really be examined, especially with protests, especially with how we express ourselves.
