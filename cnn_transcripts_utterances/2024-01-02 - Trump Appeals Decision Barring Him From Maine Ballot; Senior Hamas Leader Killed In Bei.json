Plus, Harvard's first Black president steps down amid allegations of plagiarism and disastrous congressional testimony. Was race also a factor? And an exchange student in the U.S. falls victim to an elaborate kidnapping plot, one that cost his terrified family $80,000. Tonight, a warning from the FBI that he is not alone. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news. Trump appeals. The former president's legal team appealing the decision that keeps him off the ballot in Maine, saying the secretary of state there had no legal authority to remove him from the ballot, calling her a, quote, biased decision- maker, who should've recused herself and otherwise failed to provide lawful due process. Trump's team is also expected to appeal Colorado's decision, which bans him from that states ballot. He's expected to appeal that to the Supreme Court at any moment, following in the steps of Colorado's GOP. Now, those decisions are based on Section Three of the 14th Amendment, which was, of course, passed after the civil war, and says a person is ineligible to run if they, quote, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion, against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. And now, tonight, another state weighing in. Oregon's highest court asking Trump and a liberal advocacy group for more details about the case, to block the former president from the state's primary contest. These cases involving the 14th Amendment could put the nine Supreme Court justices squarely at the center of the 2024 election, forcing them to decide, and decide quickly, by Supreme Court standards, whether to rescue or possibly sink Trump's 2024 political ambitions. Time is really a major factor here. The primaries for both Colorado and Maine are set for Super Tuesday in early March, just days before Trump railing against those Colorado and Maine decisions, calling them desperate attempts to rig the election. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT live in Washington tonight. So, Evan, so what more do we know about the arguments from Donald Trump's legal team tonight in this appeal?",

      "sentences": "Well, one of the first things that he tackles in this, or his legal team tackles in this filing today, Erica, is the fact that the former president said he's not actually an insurrectionist. Taking that on head on, which is the finding by the Maine secretary of state, it's the finding by the Colorado Supreme Court, and it's one, of course, that's going to have to be fought in front of the Supreme Court.And the U.S. Supreme Court, that is. And the fact that, as you pointed out, Oregon is now looking at a similar challenge, it tells you what the problem is for the former president. They're going to be fighting these types of battles in state after state, unless the Supreme Court steps in and decides once and for all what really is the law here? Does the 14th Amendment apply to the status of candidate for president, which is one of the things that Trump mentions in his brief today. He says that the 14th Amendment does not apply to the office of the presidency. So we anticipate that a similar argument, as you saw today in this main decision, we'll see a similar arguments in the case of Colorado, and we expect that because there have been some states that have decided in the opposite direction, Erica, that the Supreme Court will try to settle this once and for all, right? Because you have some states that have gone in the opposite direction, saying that these 14th amendment challenges don't really stand any ground. So we expect that the Supreme Court will have to make a final decision in the coming weeks. Of course, we also know the Supreme Court is likely to eventually have to consider whether Trump is immune in the other cases that he's facing in the Jack Smith investigation. So, plenty of action for the Supreme Court in the coming weeks -- Erica.",

      "sentences": "Erica, the Biden administration's position is they don't want to see a regional escalation. They don't want to see a widening of the war. Clearly, it's not just up to the U.S. to make a unilateral decision. In this case, the events that we've seen over the course of the past couple of days make a widening of the war and escalation a growing possibility. Not only, as you pointed out of the weekend, the U.S. military and U.S. attack helicopters seeking three Houthi attacks votes that were going after a commercial vessel and killing the crews of those for the first time since the war, but also now the killing of Saleh al-Arouri, a senior Hamas militant in Beirut.So the U.S. has to watch all of this, the U.S. does have the backing of the international coalition in the Red Sea, and that gives it essentially some weight here in its actions. The U.S. monitoring that Iranian Navy vessel that's in the Red Sea. For the U.S.'s position, it is an international waterway, a critical one at that. So they're allowed to be there, but the U.S. military will keep a very close eye on them as it watches where this all goes. For the killing of Saleh al-Arouri, who you saw there with the ayatollah, the leader of Iran, we've seen promises of revenge and condemnation from the Iranians, from Hamas, Hezbollah, and even some others. The question now, of course, what did they do? They have a lot of options, all of these Iranian proxies. Attack U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, go after U.S. vessels in the red sea with the Houthis there from Yemen, attack Israel, Iran doesn't see much of a difference between the U.S. and Israel. So these are all possibilities that we have to watch out for and that the U.S. is watching out for. Now, as you note, Israel hasn't officially taken responsibility for the killing of Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut, Israeli officials have been a bit coy about this, but it's worth pointing to this tweet from Danny Danon, a current member of Knesset and the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. He said on Twitter, I congratulate the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Mossad, and the security forces for killing the senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut. Anyone who's involved in the October 7th massacre should know that we will reach them and settle the account with them. So, Erica, pretty clear there. It's also worth noting that Benjamin Netanyahu promised Israel would go after Hamas leaders wherever they are.",

MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: This is what -- Oren's reporting, first of all, Erica, was phenomenal. But this is the kind of thing that the Biden administration has been worried about. They've been trying to repress any kind of expansion of this conflict, and this strike in Beirut against the Hamas leader is not going to help that at all. You also have to consider that Hezbollah leader Nasrallah has said that any strikes inside of Lebanon by Israel, especially in Beirut, will cause serious repercussions for the Israelis. This is the Hezbollah leader. What Israel has been trying to do is not allow this to come into a multi-front war. But we are already seeing that. They are fighting hard in Gaza, they have been fighting hard in northern Israel against Hezbollah terrorists coming out of the southern Lebanon, they have now struck in Beirut, they've had these missile attacks from Yemen, we have seen PMF forces in Iraq and Syria continue to try and attempt to influence this operation.

They are some of the types of missiles, the hypersonic missiles, are very advanced, but Ukraine has been very successfully shooting most of them down. Today's activity, Ukraine was very successful.But what I would say is two things are happening. First of all, Russia is continuing their strategic approach to try and affect Ukrainian infrastructure, to make it a harsh winter for Ukrainian citizens. To continue to say, even though the United States and others may be balking, we are still going to attack Ukraine. And what's happening from the Ukrainian side is they just don't have enough air defense to cover everything. Air defense are points weapon systems, Erica, that means they have to be paced in a location to guard a specific target. So that means you can't defend everywhere. So the reason Russia is attacking so many different targets is they are trying to figure out where Ukraine is soft, and where they have their defenses. And I think that's going to continue on for the next couple of days, and it just shows the importance of the United States getting the Congress back, and passing this bill which will give more ammo and arms to Ukraine during this period of time.

It is rampant, and it is coddled, and it is encouraged in some cases on these campuses. That's what was uncovered at that hearing. So yes, is this a good use of time? You're darn right, because those parents all of this country who need to understand what they are getting into when their kids go there, and universities need to take this as a learning moment and as a moment to say, let's have some introspection here. Have we gotten so far off the rails that we can't see the own problems -- the problems that are own policies are causing on these campuses?",

So the fact is when you look at this data, all you are really seeing is that the people, the voters, do not care that Trump is not participating.
