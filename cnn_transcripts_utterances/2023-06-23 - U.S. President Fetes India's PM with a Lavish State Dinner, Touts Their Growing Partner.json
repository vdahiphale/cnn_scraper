But he said I find that hard to digest because there's a reality here going back to Ukraine that the war is still going on. We haven't won the counteroffensive, yet there's this dichotomy of feeling. And I think we've got a sense of that when it comes to counteroffensive, not only from the prime minister, but also from Ukraine's president, who said just a couple of days ago that the offensive perhaps wasn't going as fast as people expected, and again made that Hollywood comparison, that this isn't a Hollywood event. I was in Ukraine speaking to officials a couple of months ago. And this is exactly what they were saying back then. Do people outside of Ukraine really understand what it is to fight a counteroffensive? This is really tough. The battle is against an enemy that's well-equipped and well-dug in. We're gonna win, it's our country, they say. But this is incredibly tough. So I think there's this dichotomy of understanding. And I think that's what Ukrainians are wrestling with. And one senior Ukrainian official said, look, you haven't even really seen the proper counteroffensive yet. Vladimir Putin made a reference to this a couple of days ago saying that he doesn't think that Ukraine has put everything into the fight so far that they can, that there is -- there are still counteroffensive operations to come. But I think you know that, perception gap is a thing that Ukraine is going to -- is going to struggle with because you know you heard from Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg a month ago saying we've given Ukraine all this equipment they should be ready. So there's a perception they have what they need. The reality is it's just a very, very tough fight. And I think we're seeing that reality gap being bridged by the statements we're hearing.",

Maybe somebody might start, you know, to try to primary him, et cetera.But what I would like to know is, many say that his policies and his legislatives and his wins, frankly, should speak for themselves. And yet, according to The Way to Win, it's a Democrat-leaning company firm. Only some 22 percent of Latino voters, 33 percent of black voters can actually identify something that they say he's done to specifically make their lives better. What would you say to that? And how would you advise him to connect in a reelection? BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I think Joe Biden has done an extraordinary job leading the country through some very difficult times. I do not think that there's going to be any kind of serious primary challenge to Joe Biden. I think the Democratic Party is unified. You know, there was a lot of talk. You'll remember when he was first elected because Bernie Sanders had run that somehow there was this huge split between progressive Democrats and more centrist Democrats. And the truth is, is that partly because of how Joe has governed, those divisions have been bridged. I think what's true in American politics generally is until you get to campaigns, people aren't paying much attention. People have gone through a difficult time because of COVID and the pandemic and lockdowns, because of inflation, primarily the result of both the war in Ukraine and rising energy prices as well as supply chain issues. And so people have memories about the, okay, eggs got more expensive and gas was more expensive. And they haven't been paying as much attention to the fact that, for example, the African-American unemployment rate is lower than it's been in decades. The campaign will allow President Biden to make those arguments. And I think that, you know, in an immediate environment that's so cluttered, it's very hard to break through until you get to election time. You'll recall when I ran for reelection in 2012, my poll numbers weren't that great. And we ended up winning comfortably. Part of that was just we started campaigning, and we were able to get a message out. And people said, yeah, you know, that policy or this policy or this thing left undone, that irritated me a little bit. But overall, I think he's done a good job. And I think that's what they're going to conclude about Joe Biden as well.",
