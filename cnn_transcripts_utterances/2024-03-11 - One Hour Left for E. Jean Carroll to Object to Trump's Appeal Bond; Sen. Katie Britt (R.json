      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.At this hour, E. Jean Carroll has just 60 minutes to challenge former President Donald Trump's most recent legal move. Last week, Trump posted a nearly $92 million bond to appeal a federal jury's judgment in which they ordered him to pay more than $83 million to Carroll for repeatedly making defamatory statements about her. But despite the multimillion dollar fines for defamation just moments ago, Trump once again made comments about Carroll on CNBC, calling her names, claiming he never met her and insisting her accusations are false despite a federal jury ruling that he's liable for sexual abuse. CNN's Marshall Cohen is following this developing story for us. Marshall, what happens next?",

As you mentioned, Donald Trump on Friday posted that $91 million bond. The judgment against him was $83 million, but he had to include some interest.So, if she has any issues, the judge said that he'll hold a hearing later this afternoon. If she doesn't have any objections, then the judge will still need to give his formal stamp of approval so that this bond can be posted and the appeal can move forward. Remember, Jim, we're here because of something that a jury concluded Donald Trump did in the mid-1990s. According to a jury in New York, they found that Donald Trump was liable for sexually abusing Ms. Carroll in a department store dressing room in the mid-90s, and that he defamed her when he repeatedly said that she made it all up. But if you were watching the campaign trail over the weekend, you would have seen Donald Trump in Georgia repeating some of those same claims. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I just posted a $91 million bond, $91 million on a fake story, totally made up story. $91 million based on false accusations made about me by a woman that I knew nothing about, didn't know, never heard of, I know nothing about her. And when I denied it, I said, it's so crazy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These new allegations, prosecutors say they tried to cover up their crimes, if you will, after they learned that they were under investigation, basically trying to say that these bribes that they had received, this money that they had received, for example, for a mortgage for a new home, to buy a brand new Mercedes, wasn't a bribe. They say it was a loan, prosecutors say not true. In addition to that, in this superseding indictment, prosecutors also allege that Nadine Menendez and the senator gave false information to their attorneys, and their attorneys, in turn, gave that misleading information to U.S. attorneys when they held meetings with them last year. Now, the senator and his wife again have pleaded not guilty in the past to bribery charges. And as you say, the senator has remained defiant throughout all of this. He released a statement about these new allegations, which says, in part, it says that the prosecutors are afraid of the facts, scared to subject their charges to the fair- minded scrutiny of a jury. It says once and for all that they will stop at nothing in the zeal to get me. And that's what the senator has been saying about these allegations all along, that this is just the government's efforts to try to get at him.
