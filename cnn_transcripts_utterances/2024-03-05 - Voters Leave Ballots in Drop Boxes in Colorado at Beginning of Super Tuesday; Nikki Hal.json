This is a county that leans Republican the last several elections, even as Colorado has voted Democratic. And as we've been saying, nearly a million people have already cast ballots in Colorado, largely at places just like this. There are more than 400 drop boxes scattered around the state. People drive up. We've seen them do it. They get right to this slot right here, and they take their ballot. And this is what the ballot -- this is what the ballot looks like here. They take out their filled ballot, and they put it in that slot.Now you can see in this ballot, Donald Trump's name is on it. Of course, there was that big Supreme Court ruling yesterday which determined that states do not have the right to remove him from the ballot for being an insurrectionist. His name was on the ballot anyway, because the previous decision had been stayed, so people have been voting here for some time, nearly a million, as I said. Now, there is also in-person voting today that will kick off in about an hour, actually two hours from now, where you will see people walking into polling locations, casting ballots in-person, but really just a few. [08:05:6] More than 75 percent, 85 percent dependent on the election, will cast their ballot either by mail where people would have had to sent them in more than a week ago, or at these drop boxes, which are extremely popular. That's a freight train driving past us right now. Again, we see eight people drive up to this drop box, which may not seem like a lot, but it's only 06:00 a.m. here in Mountain Time in Colorado, so people are participating on this Super Tuesday. Now, one of the states, or in this case, a commonwealth that we will be watching on this day is Virginia. Virginia is one of two states along with Vermont that doesn't have party registration, so they're open primaries. Could be a state where Nikki Haley fares better. That is what we'll be watching for.

That means Democrats, Republicans, independents, all alike can vote in this. And they can choose whichever candidate they want regardless of their party registration.I actually just chatted with two voters on their way out of this polling location behind me, their names were Lin (ph) and Steve (ph). And they're both registered Republicans and said they voted for Nikki Haley today. I asked why, and they said because as they do not like Donald Trump. And another question I asked them was if Donald Trump were to go on to win the Republican nomination as all signs are currently pointing to, who would you vote for in November, if it was a matchup between Donald Trump and Joe Biden? And they had a very difficult time answering that question. One of them said, Steve (ph) said that he would consider a third-party candidate, and Lin (ph) said she really wasn't sure what she should do. So that's just one sampling of how some people in this state are feeling. And look, I can tell you from my conversations with the Trump campaign, they do see Virginia as very crucial to their potential general election strategy, a battleground in their eyes, they tell me. And it's actually one of two states they visited over the weekend in the leadup to Super Tuesday. But really the only two states they visited were Virginia and North Carolina. And that's because they really are going to try and make a play for it here. Now, John, I also just wanted to give you a little insight into how the Trump campaign is viewing this day with Super Tuesday. They are very confident of their chances here today, and in this state, but across the country and about his overall performance. And what they really want to see at the end of the night when Donald Trump gets up on a stage at Mar-a-Lago is he wants to be able to claim victory. But also, he's really hoping that Nikki Haley drops out. They know that she has pledged to stay in through Super Tuesday, but it's unclear what she will do next. And that's really what they're hoping for, for him to be able to really solidify himself as not only the frontrunner, but the presumptive Republican nominee. John?",

That's what's going to persuade them.And by the way, donors, in my view, had been enormously generous to continue to demonstrate that it is worth having an alternative to Trump in this race. I mean, she has raised an extraordinary amount of money even after losing her home state of South Carolina. So there's an importance, I think, for Republicans who want to stand for something else to demonstrate the weakness in Donald Trump. There is this alternative to the previous, essentially an incumbent nominee. And yet, if there's not a path to the delegate count to actually winning it, it's going to be hard to see how donors continue to put millions of dollars the coffers of an effort that won't be able to simply hit the math.",

And all of that, I think, is going to be the focus of the Biden campaign.And I do think that today you are going to have more of a focus as to what the general election is going to look like. And I think that is going to help the Biden campaign. Right now. You have all of the focus on the GOP because they're the ones that are having this crazy primary, right? And normally, when you have an incumbent, a lot of the energy is with the opposition. Those are the two forces that were seeing right now in all of these polls. The Democratic coalition hasn't come home yet. They're not necessarily paying attention. And I also tell you another dynamic that were seeing in these polls. A lot of times what you're seeing in these polls is people, even Democrats, they are -- they're showing their frustration.
