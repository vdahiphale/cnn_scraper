The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak expressed solidarity with Israel but also stressed the importance of democratic values. He referred to the Israeli government's plan to weaken the courts.

You can just go to cnn.com/mideast newsletter, be sure and click subscribe. While you're there, it has fantastic read very insightful. Proportionate and deliberate action that is how the United States is describing airstrikes it launched in Syria after a drone attack killed a U.S. contractor there. Video posted on social media is set to show the aftermath of the U.S. strikes, five U.S. service personnel and another contractor were injured in the drone attack, which the U.S. says was launched by Iranian proxies. And it happened in Northeastern Syria in an area where some 900 U.S. troops are deployed. We have Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon for us, as well as Nic Robertson, who is back with us this hour from London. Great to have you both on the show! I want to start off with you Oren, just some of the feedback, the statements from the United States, saying they're going to keep a very close eye on what is going on. But also saying proportionate, deliberate, strikes, making sure that this isn't going to cause any form of escalation, but it's the messaging of by keeping a close watch, which becomes interesting?",

And as you point out,there are a large number of them about 900 spread across just a few different bases or operating posts as part of the ongoing campaign to defeat ISIS. And the Iranian proxies that are in the region that have been in the region essentially, under the watchful eye of Russia and the Assad regime in Syria. There has been friction in the past; we have seen the Biden Administration carry out strikes against Iranian forces in the past. In fact, just a month or two into the Biden Administration the first known military action was a similar sort of strike against Iranian proxies in the region following rocket attacks against U.S. forces. Of course, this attack with a one way UAV or a suicide drone had far different consequences. One U.S. contractor killed five service members injured and one more U.S. contractor injured. We have learned a short time ago that those five service members are in stable condition, two of them treated on site, three of them take into coalition medical facilities in Iraq. But this gets at the friction and the tension there between U.S. forces and Iranian proxies and how quickly that could escalate. The U.S. was not going to let this one go unanswered, carrying out what it called a proportion and deliberate response to this, but also warning that if there are more attacks from Iranian proxies that the U.S. can continue to attack. In terms of how frequently something like this happens we just got an insight into that. General Erik Kurilla the Commander of U.S. Central Command said just yesterday that there have been about 78 rocket and UAV attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East since the beginning of 2021. That works out to about one nearly every 10 days. So this is frequent but Eleni of course, not all of them have this sort of tragic result.",

His arrest happened the year before while he was traveling internationally, and what his family claims was a kidnapping. The 2004 movie depicts his efforts as a hotel manager to save Rwandans during the 1994 genocide of Tutsis by Hutu rebels. Larry Madowo is following the story for us.

And we have a confirmation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Qatar that he will then travel to Qatar before eventually going to the United States where he's a permanent resident. Even though President Kagame had initially said that they will not be bullied by anybody to release Paul Rusesabagina, because he was - Rwandan law and charged under Rwandan law and centers under Rwandan law. It seems to have kind of over the last few days, over the last few weeks, these negotiations have borne fruit. And I think one of the interesting things here is that royal Qatar, which has been an interesting player in this whole thing, President Kagame has just recently in Qatar, he's a close ally, and friends of the Emir of Qatar, and that appears to have worked here. Obviously, the U.S. Influenza and the U.S. power have also been useful. And so, he's getting commuted, he's getting the rest of his 25-year sentence commuted. But the Rwandans are very clear that if a sentence getting commuted means that if you repeat the same offenses, you're going to go straight back to jail to serve the rest of your sentence. So Paul Rusesabagina and 18 other people who he's accused of - that sentence were commuted. As useful background here for our viewers is that he went to jail for terror related offenses, because of his involved politically with the MDC. That is a Movement for Democratic Change in Rwanda. It's got an armed wing that Rwanda accuses of terrorism related offenses in the country. And that's how he ended up on trial and in jail, even though this trial was criticized as a sham trial by many international observers.",

How important is the report that you've conducted right now in terms of keeping people safe in terms of finally getting some kind of justice down the line? MATILDA BOGNER, U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING MISSION IN UKRAINE: It's very important, it's very important that we monitor that we document and then we publicly make known the findings that we have. In this type of situation where there are violations of international humanitarian law. In many occasions that war crimes, as well as other forms of violations of human rights, that people are aware of what is happening, as you said this can lead to accountability. So, we hope that it will lead to criminal accountability, but also other forms of accountability to ensure that victims receive reparations received forms of compensation and support for what they've been through.

One needs to look at each individual case very carefully. There are cases where children have gone to the Russian Federation that will not be deportation or a violation of international humanitarian law. But there are other cases where it is, sometimes children have been held in play. So, they have been in places where hostilities are ongoing, and they did need to be evacuated for their own safety. But under international humanitarian law, that should be temporary. And the power that that takes those children that evacuate those children should then bring the children back.

And we call on both parties to the conflict to improve that situation to prevent further violations as well as to open investigations and hold the perpetrators to account. We also look in the other report at a whole range of other violations, including enforced disappearances arbitrary detention. We have documented more than 600 cases of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention since the 24th of February last year, and until the end of January this year, which had been carried out by Russian Armed Forces or other security services. And we've documented over 91 cases that have happened within government-controlled Ukraine by Ukrainian forces. Again, both sides need to investigate these cases need to stop further cases from happening. We've also looked at conflict related sexual violence; we found that there are two main forms. One is sexual violence that happens as a part of torture. So, this can be against prisoners of war or against civilian detainees, those who have been often impossibly disappeared or arbitrarily detained. That is one group of people that have been subjected to sexual violence. On the other hand, it's the type that we've heard more about in the media, which is sexual violence that happened in areas that were occupied by Russian forces against women, and sometimes against girls. These are usually cases of rape, sometimes gang rape, or other forms of sexual violence. These are some of the worst atrocities that we've documented in these reports.",

He tried in 2019; Eleni by harmonizing what is a very complex pension system according to the different professions that hadn't gone down. Well, people have come out into the streets COVID, all of that had forced them to back down. Hence this new proposal, which really looks at rising that retirement age, and raising the number of annuities that people have to complete in order to qualify for that full state pension. There are those the unions at the helm, who say it is inherently unfair, and will be punitive for those who are the least well off the blue collar workers. And that is what made them so angry. And it's what you hear from the protesters. I think one of the striking things that occurred to me yesterday, but also on the eight other days of major protests, planned protests here in Paris, is how many young people are out there. This is a vast spectrum of the French public that is out there. And bear in mind that of course, it isn't just the fact of this reform the way it's been pushed through. But that reforming president himself, remember the - so much of that anger was still out there. And he's very much targeted on the French president himself, his manner, the nature of his policies. And the fact that a lot of French people, the people that you hear, I don't see on the streets, the placards speak to the fact that he's being referred to by many, as the president of the rich that there are those who consider there were other ways to fill the gaps in the pension system going forward.

And it is they say the simplest way of doing it but that disaccord, that fundamental disagreement and the crystallization of so much anger around the person of the president really driving those protesters to feel that this will be a key moment in trying to make the rest of his second term, as difficult as they can, Eleni.",

Some banks could spillover into the wider financial sector. It is not only that concern, you've had the European Central Bank as well as the Bank of England hiking rates by a quarter percentage point. So did the Federal Reserve as well. So, you've got interest rate hikes, you've got worries in the banking sector that spilling over into sentiment. DOW Jones in the U.S. is down slightly. But what we're seeing over in Europe, footsie 100, down 1.2 percent, DAX and Germany also coming under pressure, and the Paris CAC is down almost 2 percent. It's a stock share of Deutsche Bank that is really creating a concern that's reigniting investor jitters as well, with German lenders shares in retreat. We actually saw Chancellor Olaf Scholz very quick to say there's no reason to be concerned. Those were his words. But here's the thing. It's the credit default swaps that actually started to see a spike today that is insurance coming through on their debt. And that spite showing that perhaps there is concern about the health of Deutsche Bank; don't forget we had some worries about Credit Suisse last week. We saw the collapse of SVB in the United States. The question is not so much about a bank being too big to fail, but perhaps too interconnected to come under pressure. We've seen all central banks coming in and saying they are ready to create liquidity to help the banks. Anna Stewart standing by, Anna, what is going on, so much going on with the banks, it is worrying.",
