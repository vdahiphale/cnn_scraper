They're actually handing out the Times Square hats that we always see around the time that we start celebrating a little bit later into this evening. But people here get here very early, get excited about the New Year celebration. And of course, security here. Major issue that we got to talk about, Amara, because, of course, we know that intelligence has said there is a heightened threat environment right now. That means there are more security measures that are being taken to keep the people here safe and also all around this area. More streets are shut down. We actually have a checkpoint here where these people came in. They actually get wanted before they can come into these pens to wait for that ball to drop. And a major issue that the NYPD has really been paying attention to since October 7th, since the conflict in the Middle East, are protest, we saw some protests sort of trying to shut down the Christmas tree lighting at the Rockefeller Center, and so that is something they want to protect against happening here.

You can see the roads there are dry.And if you look in between the buildings, you can see some of that gray. It's mostly cloudy, but it's not going to really squeeze out too much in New York going into tonight's. So, you might have one or two snowflakes come down with the confetti, but expecting things to be pretty quiet there. We do have one storm system that's kind of swirling over the Great Lakes. It's brought some snow to Chicago this morning. Some pretty minor accumulations there. Cleveland, too. But, again, as the storm system kind of works its way east, you could see the accumulations for rain and snow are pretty minor, maybe an inch or two for parts of Western Pennsylvania. And then you could see there, in the spine there of the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia, maybe a few more inches in some of the higher elevations. But overall, not too bad for a holiday. We have this area of high pressure that's going to take over. So, there's that system I was just talking about, bringing some of those snowflakes, again, maybe the D.C. Area, the Great Lakes, but this high pressure takes over most of the country. So, that's going to leave us really quiet for most of the area. You're looking at temperatures, as you head out the door for New Year's celebrations, will be on the chilly side, around freezing in Minneapolis, 39 in St. Louis, some 40s from DC to New York. And if you're in Times Square, you're looking at temperatures at midnight in the upper 30s, low 40s, again with the clouds, but not squeezing out too much. A little bit of a breeze. We'll get those wind chills in the middle 30s. So, not overly bad, but kind of seasonal for New York. And I was curious about some of the warmest and coldest. We actually started to ring in this year, 2023, with the third warmest ball drop on record at 54 degrees. We also were the fifth warmest in 2022 as well in Times Square. But one of the coldest years on record was just back in 2018. We were rivaling that top spot, nine degrees at midnight, made it the second coldest ball drop in New York City on record. So, at least it's not nine degrees. We will have some of those seasonal 30s, but of course bundling up for New York. But again, at least not record cold. Happy New Year.",

And then, on the other side of the river, at the Lotte Tower, the fifth tallest building in the world, a dazzling light show. A show on a building that has 42,000 glass windows, a spectacular sight to see. And then, for the more traditional, a bell ringing ceremony to bring in good thoughts for the new year. I should point out it is already 2024 here in South Korea. And today, many families will be gathering to pay respects to their elders. And also, to enjoy a warm bowl of soup with rice cakes.

The concern that it's raising is that if you wanted to put some constraints on how those weapons are being used, the way we put constraints on the Ukrainians, right, because we say the Ukrainians can't use American weapons to fire into Russia, then that's being bypassed.

And at that moment, the helicopter commanders shot back in self defense, sank three of these four small fast boats the Houthis were using, and killed the crew in, in those three. The Houthis have since turned out an announcement just in the past few hours, saying that 10 of their fighters died in this and vowing to continue. There's been a lot of pressure, including from the Pentagon on President Biden to act more strongly against the Houthis here and to re-establish some deterrence. And I think people are probably going to sit back now for a moment and see whether the Houthis got the message from this or whether they continue the attacks. It's very hard to tell.

And I talked to a lot of activists who say, look, you have to look at these migrants as people who are struggling, people who are seeking asylum.Their hope is that humanitarian aspect will bring politicians from both sides of the aisle together to try to work on this problem, which continues to be a crisis in this country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERNAL (voice-over):  A breaking point at the U.S. Mexico border as preliminary Homeland Security statistics show authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants so far in December, the highest monthly total recorded in more than 20 years. And from the border to cities all over the U.S. struggling to keep up. Because this welcome comes at a cost. MAYOR MIKE JOHNSTON (D-DENVER):  When you're talking about 10 percent of the budget to allocate for cities on this, that's unsustainable. When we have every single hotel room in the city full of migrants that have arrived, that's unsustainable. BERNAL (voice-over):  For months, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has bused thousands of migrants to these cities, led by Democrats, resulting in turmoil and straining resources. MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON (D-CHICAGO):  You know, at one point in the summer, we had 25, 30 buses showing up every single day without any coordination or any notification. He is now sending buses outside of the City of Chicago, in some instances a hundred miles away, where people are being dropped off, they're being told that they are in the City of Chicago, literally dropped off in the middle of nowhere. I find that to be inhumane and unconscionable. BERNAL (voice-over):  Some smaller municipalities have passed ordinances to try to stop the drop offs, while the mayors of Chicago, Denver, and New York City are asking the federal government for help. MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY):  I think much more could be done with all of our national leaders from a decompression strategy to making sure the cost of this is not falling on the laps of everyday taxpayers in our cities. BERNAL (voice-over):  They are also demanding for coordinated drop offs with exact times and locations to dedicate the appropriate resources.",

We make too many of them, and therefore we tend to lose that energy and the focus. Prepare. Do the research. Find the best ways to make some of those changes that you talked about, such as cutting down on the drinking, or eating better, losing weight. Be more realistic in those approaches. Building incentives and rewards, Amara, that's so important because when we have positive reinforcement, it just keeps us moving forward in our resolutions. Buddy up with someone. Be with someone who's trying to do the same thing you're doing, such as wanting to work out a couple of times a week. And of course, we're only human.
