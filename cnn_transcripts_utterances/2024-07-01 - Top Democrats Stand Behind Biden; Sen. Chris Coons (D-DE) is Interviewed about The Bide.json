All the evidence we've seen after the very difficult debate performance on Thursday night is that the polls haven't moved, a few have moved in Biden's favor. We've had record grassroots fundraising and a record number of folks applied to work on the campaign.I spent the whole weekend campaigning across Pennsylvania and was very encouraged by what I heard from grassroots volunteers there. I also, as you can imagine, took a whole lot of phone calls from donors and supporters, from many journalists, and from other colleagues, senators, governors, others. There's a lot of conversation, but I do think it's important to reflect on how strong and how capable a President Joe Biden has been, and what a shocking and clear threat to democracy Donald Trump presented on that debate stage in Atlanta. If there's an editorial board out there, and I'm looking at you, \"New York Times,\" and you watched that performance, and you're going to spend all your time focused on why you're convinced that having Joe Biden step aside is the best path forward for the American people, and very little time on the performance of Donald Trump, a man who's been convicted of 34 felonies, of sexual assault, held liable for commercial fraud and faces dozens more charges, and who lied and lied and lied on that stage, if that's not alarming and concerning to you, then I'd like you to refocus your lens. Because what I've heard from all the other elected officials I've talked to is they have confidence in Joe Biden. They think he's our strongest candidate. And I'm looking forward to campaigning hard for him from now through November.",

She was - she covered his 1988 campaign. She opened her column this way, quote, \"He's being selfish. He's putting himself ahead of the country. He's surrounded by opportunistic enablers. He has created a reality distortion field where we're told not to believe what we have plainly seen. His hubris is infuriating. He says he's doing this for us, but he's really doing it for himself.\"And, I mean, look, the piece of this that I want to zero in on here is that we are told not to believe what we have plainly seen. I think for a lot of, you know, voters, you know, certainly the way that the White House talks to reporters in Washington, I think there's a little bit of this. But for voters who saw that on stage and then are told, hey, this guy actually has it all together, what do you say to people who feel like they are being gaslit or somehow lied to or told that what they seem to see with their own eyes isn't actually the case?",

I do think that part of the challenge of being president, and this is true for many presidents, is that the demands of the job mean you're often in small group settings. Very few of us got to see him in the room at the G-7, for example, just last week with world leaders. But I spoke to our ambassador to Italy, a dear friend of mine, the former governor of Delaware, who was in the room with him. And I said, did you see anything like that alleged moment of mental loss of acuity? He said, no. He was sharp, he was engaged, he was commanding. We don't often see him in that setting.What we may see, and you showed it, is a compelling speech on the beach in Normandy, or that engaging speech in North Carolina. But I'll - I'll share with you that criticism some have raised with me when I make that point. He's got a teleprompter. He's well-prepared. We do need to see more unscripted and off the record moments. That is something I'm encouraging, yes.",

And he needed to be better prepared for how to handle that. And to forcefully assert his own record and his vision for his second term. There's lots more good work to do. But for younger Americans, and I was speaking with some college students over the weekend, the contrast is sharp between Joe Biden, who's done more to combat climate change than any American president, more to make our country more inclusive and just than any American president, more to create opportunity in high-skilled, high-wage manufacturing jobs and the jobs of the future. And Donald Trump's record and values and priorities all stand in sharp contrast to that. So, I think the more he has casual and regular engagements with voters of all ages and backgrounds, the more likely we are to be happy with the outcome in November as Democrats.",

And like you said, this is a very tough day to be a surrogate for the president. And the simple fact is, they are coming up with virtually every excuse in many respects for a performance that was by any historical standard disastrous for a candidate.MOLLY BALL, SENIR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, and it's also the case that this idea that they should put the president out there more so that he can prove to the American people that he has what it takes. I've heard that over and over and over again for literally years from people close to the White House. And I think having seen the debate, people have a pretty good idea why that hasn't happened. Because he has good moments and bad moments, good days and bad days, and you don't know which Joe Biden is going to come out in any particular circumstance so they can't necessarily - they don't necessarily feel safe putting him out there on a more rigorous basis than they already do.
