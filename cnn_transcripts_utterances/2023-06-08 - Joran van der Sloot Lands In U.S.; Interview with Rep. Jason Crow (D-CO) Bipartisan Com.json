Because this is -- under the extradition treaties of Peru and the United States, he's flown in from another country. So there is customs in this country. And most likely someone will go on the plane and do the customs check that is mandatory of everyone on that plane. But I think it will take some time. And they may have more security checks.We do know that when he was taken into custody by Interpol this morning, which is the International Policing Agency, that they had doctors with them. And they did some medical tests including a COVID test. And the president of the National Penitentiary Institute in Peru spoke publicly and said that the FBI had doctors with them on board also. So we can believe that there was at least a medic or a physician on board this entire flight for any medical emergencies that could arise.",

Because when all of in came down, where money was exchanged, contracts were signed, John Q. Kelly, the attorney for the family, went over to Aruba, met Joran, traveled to this home where Joran said she's underneath the gravel. She fell and hit her head. I secreted her. My father buried her under the gravel. That was all recorded by the FBI, everything. There are still pictures. There are audio transcripts. There are emails which amount to the alleged wire fraud. So all of this forms the basis of the prosecution's case.But there's always a defense to something like that, and it is called entrapment. So there are other ways that are very crafted -- a defense attorney could go also in this case. But I -- SANCHEZ: Jean -- I want to interrupt you for a moment because it appears that someone has been removed from the jet and loaded into the back of an SUV surrounded by what appears to be armed officers. Obviously, you have a better vantage point perhaps than we do. You mentioned that there was going to be a process of customs and entering Joran van der Sloot into the country. Do we know if he has been removed from the plane? Are you able to gather anything else from your vantage point?",

And there he will be processed. Of course, this is his first time with American juris prudence, you're talking about a mug shot. You're talking about fingerprints, and the FBI will be there with all of this. And then ultimately we believe spending the night in this local holding facility. And by the way, in Peru you can wear your own clothes. As we saw in previous video, he had his own clothes, he had a warm coat, he cannot do that obviously in the United States. We are going to see him for the very first time in jail garb when we do see him in that court appearance which should be tomorrow.",

That is what a senior U.S. official is telling CNN -- two of them actually. This is coming just days after Ukraine's deputy defense minister said an offensive is taking place in several directions.[04:10:00] My next guest is part of a bipartisan coalition that just sent a letter to President Biden again urging the U.S. to provide Ukraine with fourth-generation fighter jets. That's a move that Russia says would bring enormous risks. We are joined now by Congressman Jason Crow, he is on the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees. He's also a former Army Ranger who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he is now the co-chair of the bipartisan four- country caucus. A lot of stuff, but I think all relevant to what we're talking about here today. This letter, you're putting a lot of pressure on the president. The president has softened on F-16s a little bit. He has softened on these attack guns, these longer range missile systems. So what do you want out of this? Just for him to move faster? And what is the difference between him going at the pace he's going and going at the pace you want him to? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO) INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Well, it's to be with you. And I want to be really clear that I think the president and this administration have done a remarkable job of building a coalition of over 50 countries, most of whom have actually contributed to the Ukrainian war effort. That is the world's largest coalition in support of a partner at war. We have moved a massive amount of arms and munitions and equipment. We have trained multiple brigades of the Ukrainian military. So this effort has been significant. But in war, no day is like the last one. Days change, weeks change. We have to evolve with the war effort. And what this letter is saying -- this is a bipartisan effort by the Veterans Caucus in the House, we're coming out and saying that you have the overwhelming bipartisan support of the House of Representatives to change the nature of our support, to move certain things faster, but also provide some longer range strike capability in the form of aircraft and long-range rockets to help Ukrainians win this.",

That we can't sustain the political support, and he can just grind this out. He's willing to send 100,000, 200,000 Russians to their death in hope that's he can win this in the long term. So, what we have to do is help the Ukrainians win this in the short or midterm. Help them destroy the Russian military and their capacity to wage war now.",

Because there's F-16ings throughout the NATO alliance in several countries that might be able to transfer them much quicker than we could. But also train the maintainers.These are sophisticated aircraft. That's why they're so good. They require a tremendous amount of back-end support and sustainment. So we're going to train the mechanics we're going to have to get the fuel supplies going. There's a lot of things that have to happen now so that six months, nine months from now these aircraft can be flying over Ukrainian skies. And that's what we're pushing the administration to do.",

We've been very cautious and deliberate every step of the way.But another really important point is we should never allow dictators in rogue nations to dictate the terms of what we're willing to do to defend our partners. Every time Putin or Lavrov has established some kind of red line, we have done things to support Ukraine, and they haven't escalated from that point.
