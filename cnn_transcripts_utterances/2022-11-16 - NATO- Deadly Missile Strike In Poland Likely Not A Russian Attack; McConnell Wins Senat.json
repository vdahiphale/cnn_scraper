And he insists that he's always been accurate in the past and he had no reason to doubt that information. Now, the information he's referring to was perhaps his initial statement yesterday when he said that two Russian missiles had penetrated Polish airspace and caused this tragedy.Now, it may be the case that he is going to have to revise his analysis based on what the Poles and what the United States, and others are saying. I mean, this ultimately is a Polish decision with the help of their NATO allies to work out who fired the missile that landed and killed two of their citizens. The poles, the Americans, NATO are all saying in one voice, that it is Russia that bears ultimate responsibility for this. And I think this just may be a case of the tail catching up with the head in terms of the information cycle with President Zelenskyy perhaps trying to justify having been somewhat embarrassed earlier on. They -- there are no indications from any of his other officials that they're out of step really, with the Polish findings. All of them pointing again, saying look, we've got old fashioned Soviet era kit here and inevitably, these kinds of tragedies are likely to happen if Russia flies cruise missiles so close to our borders with neighboring countries.

They actually summoned to the Polish ambassador here to Moscow. He was only in the Russian Foreign Ministry for about 20 minutes but the Russians accusing the Poles of what they call hysteria, jumping to conclusions. And the spokesman for the Kremlin also saying that he believed that the Poles should have come out immediately and said that it was, in fact, a Ukrainian surface-to-air missile that landed there in that Polish village and obviously killing those people. However, of course, as the U.S. has said, as the U.S.'s allies are saying they believe that Russia is ultimately responsible. Of course, one of the things that we do see, pretty much all the time from the Russians is they're also laying into the Ukrainians as well, essentially, trying to accuse the Ukrainians of starting a provocation and trying to drag NATO into some sort of open conflict with the Russians, which obviously, potentially would be an extremely dangerous situation. So, you certainly have some pretty strong words coming from the Kremlin and coming from the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian military as well, guys.",

Again, if they win any one of those four races, they have the majority, three of them are in California, including right here. I want to start by looking at all I miss. California got very small congressional districts if you have fat fingers. This is California's 27th district here. Mike Garcia, the incumbent leads Christy Smith by a sizable amount at this point, 13,000 votes, nearly eight percentage points 72 percent in. We're watching this closely as more votes come in.It's also up here California's Third Congressional District. This is actually Republican-leaning, R plus one. Kevin Kiley leads. He's got 10,000 -- 10,000 vote Lead, 56 percent in, either of these districts if they go in the next day or so, it would give Republicans the House. Also, I'll keep pointing out, Lauren Boebert's race here. This is a heavily Republican district, R plus eight at this point. She's 1000 votes in the lead. If we get the absentees and overseas ballots, this state could put her over the top. I do want to point out that if things were to finish where they are right now, you take everywhere where Republicans are ahead and everyone where Democrats are ahead. It will give Republicans 221 seats. How does that compare historically? It's tight. We haven't seen it much tighter than this. This last Congress was 222 D, 213 R. You can see from 1999 to 2003, it was pretty close. But this is tight. This is a very tight margin for the Republicans. It could change either way. And one other thing if you're wondering how does this last race compare for the Democrats, for Joe Biden in terms of his first midterm? On average, the president's party loses 31 seats in their first midterm, 31. If the Democrats go down to 214 that would be a loss of just eight seats, which you can see isn't bad. It's bad enough to lose control of the House, which is significant, but it's still a much smaller loss than usual, guys.",

The movement conservatives now in the party, like Hawley, they want the Republican Party to push this stuff a lot more.

And, Alisyn, I won't bet anybody on this but I wouldn't at all be surprised if Trump, in three months, announces Kari Lake as his vice presidential pick, super, super early. He loves her. She epitomizes his message, his election-denying attack on democracy. She's still saying the 2020 election was stolen. And she's very good and very smooth and very polished as to how she leads with this election denialism stuff. Look, don't write Trump's obituary yet, Alisyn.
