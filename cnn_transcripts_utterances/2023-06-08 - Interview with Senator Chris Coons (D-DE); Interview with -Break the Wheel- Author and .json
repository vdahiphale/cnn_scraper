Managing A.I. and the Ukraine war will also be front and center. President Zelenskyy is pleading with the International Community now for a swift humanitarian response to catastrophic flooding after breaches in a dam near Kherson. Ukraine is bracing for a massive environmental catastrophe there too. Meantime, the United States is in the midst of an environmental crisis, as heavy smoke continues to spread from wildfires that are raging in Canada.

It's a bipartisan group of 14senators, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, where, as a group, we agree that the climate is changing because of human activity, and we have to come together to do something about it. The bill you referenced that Senator Cramer and I just introduced has a bipartisan group of co-sponsors, and it would direct the Department of Energy, the U.S. federal government, to begin a mission standard testing so that we've got data on the emissions intensity of U.S. manufactured heavy industry products like steel and aluminum, glass and concrete, and to gather that data from our partners and allies, like the U.K. and E.U. and Canada, and our competitors like Russia, China, India, that's laying the technical groundwork or foundation for our carbon border adjustment mechanism. The E.U. is already well on its way to having such a mechanism in place that will impose tariffs on imported goods into the E.U., including potentially from the United States. And I've had several important conversations with national leaders, with climate advocates, with legislators from the E.U., U.K., Canada and other countries about how we could pull together and have a common carbon club of shared emissions reduction ambition. We can use trade and potential tariffs as a way to bring into compliance our closest partners and allies and to impose costs on the heavy industrial products of countries like Russia and China that do not reduce emissions.",

That's an important first step, to show the world that we're serious. But to your point, Christiane, I am not trying to impose a carbon tax. We are trying to measure the emissions reduction that have already happened in the United States because of our regulations, and then advantage cleaner or lower emissions, heavy industrial products. So, for example, American made steel and aluminum should not face any tariffs, whereas perhaps steel and aluminum coming from Russia or China that are intensive in their emissions would, and imports from the E.U. or Canada or the U.K. wouldn't because they have regulatory schemes because of their carbon taxes and because of their regulations that are comparably low emissions to ours.

That's part of the beauty of an approach that says, if you want to access the American market, you have to prove that you have low emissions heavy industrial products. The thing that is most likely to bend the curve of emissions in China and India is market forces through trade. So, again, Christiane, let's just imagine for a moment if the E.U., U.K., U.S., Canada, South Korea, Australia, all aligned around low emissions approaches to how we manufacture steel and aluminum, glass and cement, heavy industrial products and to access our markets, China and India would have to demonstrate, and Russia, that they are reducing their industrial emissions. That will drive them to change their emissions profiles, to slow down the rate at which they're currently building a record number of coal fired power plants. That's the thing that is going to drive global reductions in emissions more than any agreement, because I frankly think our relations may continue to be strained or even as you put it, frosty for years to come.",

There have been, as you said, a number of very near misseson the seas and in the air, and we are trying to reopen the lines of dialogue simply to deal with the potential for escalation in the event there were a midair collision caused by reckless conduct by a Chinese pilot, for example. Those Section 232 tariffs, the tariffs that were imposed by President Trump that are still in place on Chinese industrial products are also still in place on some imports from our close partners and allies. And Katherine Thai, the U.S. trade representative, is negotiating with the E.U., with the U.K., with other partners on potentially reducing or eliminating those tariffs and moving forward with something like an agreement on sustainable steel and aluminum. This bill that I just introduced with my Republican partner, Senator Cramer, would advantage the manufacturing of U.S. based low emissions, heavy industrial products and potentially, if we work this out, reduced tariffs on things coming into this country from our partners and allies in U.K, Canada, E.U. but retain high tariffs on high emissions imports from countries like China or Russia. That's actually similar to the trade approach of the former president, President Trump, but justified on different grounds and a way that reinforces our shared climate ambition and our alliances with the countries I've just been mentioning that are open markets and open societies.",

It's going to slow or thwart a potential counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops that would be seeking to cross the Dnipro River to its south side and to advance, to retake Ukrainian territory that the Russians currently hold. It's also going to have long-term consequences. It will increase hunger in Ukraine. This is some of the most fertile and productive land in all of Ukraine that's now flooded and won't be productive for several seasons. There's an environmental catastrophe at hand as well. If we look at history in the Soviet era, hunger was used as a weapon in a horrible way, in the Holodomor in Ukraine in the 1930s. This brings back some terrible memories of action by the Soviet state that led to the suffering and the death of millions of Ukrainians. I'm very sad to say, it's my view that history is repeating itself, that the ongoing war crimes being committed by the Russians in Ukraine are most likely being repeated here in this breach of a dam that is both -- that is tragically going to lead to lots of environmental and humanitarian consequences.",

So, I am optimistic about it because they have the weapons, the support and the will to fight.

Putin's plan is to simply continue to bombard civilians, continue to grind away at Ukraine's strength and resistance, and to hope, to plan on the West, on the United States losing interest. We cannot allow that to happen. Putin cannot be rewarded for his brutal invasion. He has already lost strategically because NATO is going to expand, he has already lost strategically because his standing in the world, the respect for Russia has fallen significantly. But we have to sustain our support for the brave Ukrainian troops who continue to fight and be willing to die for their country and to retain the sovereignty, to regain the control of territory that Russia's deprived them of.

So, we've been doing our work beyond this case. But I will tell you, you've got a point that we have not seen enough progress. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act has not passed. But Minnesota passed a law on police officer standards and training licensing. Now, if you're a police officer who does certain bad acts, you don't have to be convicted of a crime to lose your license to practice policing. That is a change. We also have barred a lot of the chokehold that used to be lawful and no- knock warrants, and we have made a number of other changes. We've gotten some new personnel. We change our police department from only police doing public safety to the entire or public safety division, which includes police fire, 911, also civilian violence interrupters and peer violence reducers. So, we've done a lot of things, but you are right, there's still too many problems. I mean, look, you've got Tyre Nichols in Memphis. What a tragic incident that was. There are many others.

And number two, that it's not accidental. You argue that this is really been a matter of law and custom in the United States for a very long time. As briefly as you can, would you describe why it's so important and why you say it's not accidental? R. ROTHSTEIN: \"The Color of Law,\" my previous book, demolished the myth of the de facto segregation, something we all thought existed, the fact, as you said, that the fact that every metropolitan area is racially segregated happened either by accident or because of private discrimination or bigotry of single-family home owners who wouldn't sell to African Americans, people (INAUDIBLE) the same race. It turns out that the reason we are segregated, we have an apartheid society. We are segregated by racially explicit federal state and local government policy. In the mid-20th century, somewhat before and somewhat after, that was unconstitutional, blatant constitutional violations. When the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration decided to suburbanize the entire white working class and middle-class population into single-family homes and all white suburbs, the white families who were subsidized to do this -- and these weren't rich people, these were returning war veterans -- the white families gained wealth because those homes appreciated in value over the next couple of generations. They used that wealth to send their children to college, they used it to take care of temporary emergencies, maybe unemployment. They used it to subsidize their retirements and they used it to bequeath wealth to their children and grandchildren. But then had down payments for their own homes. The result of the fact that African Americans were prohibited, by written federal policy, written federal policy, from participating in this subsidy program means that today, although African American incomes are about 60 percent of white incomes, African American wealth is only about 5 percent of white wealth. This wealth gap underlies the most serious social problems in this country today, it underlies the concentration of African Americans lower income communities where the schools are less well resourced, it underlines the fact that they have poorer health because they're living in more polluted more dangerous communities, it even underlies the police violence that we've been spending so much time paying attention to in the last few years, because when you concentrate the most disadvantaged young men in single neighborhoods, it's inevitable that they are going to be contradictions with the police. So, these unconstitutional policies underlie our apartheid system and they require us to remedy it.",

So, Leah, let me just start by asking you this, when you thought about this, geez, how do I -- how do you tackle this? Did you find it daunting yourself? L. ROTHSTEIN: You know, I did at the beginning. I have been a community organizer and activist, and I've worked in housing policies. So, I've worked on these issues a lot and I didn't know how to fix this problem when I started this project with my dad. I was overwhelmed by just the enormity of the issue, and it's right, you know, people live in the same place for a long time. The history my dad laid out shows us how, you know, the wealth gap between blacks and whites was created by housing policy. So, there's just so much to undo. It did feel overwhelming and rather daunting. But in \"Just Action,\" we outlined dozens and dozens of policies and strategies that a local activist group could take on, to begin to redress segregation in their communities. And for every one of those policies, we give an example from a local community group somewhere in the country that's working on this issue or has successfully implemented this policy change. So, I ended this project and writing this book feeling very hopeful, actually, that there's a lot that can be done. It's not one policy or one change that's going to fix all of this, but it's a lot of little pieces that will begin to undo different aspects of segregation, different segregation's effects, but all of these small pieces together have a huge impact.",

Once we understood that it was created by explicit public policy, explicit public policies can fix it. And as Leah said, there are so many local policies that sustain, reinforce and perpetuate segregation. It was created nationally, but its sustenance is local. If I can give you an example.",

So, African Americans are paying taxes at an assessed value close to the market value, and white homeowners are paying taxes far below the assessed market value. This is a purely local issue. But every one of the black homeowners in those communities is owed refunds for their excessive taxation. And activist groups could begin a campaign to win those refunds. They might not be totally successful, but they can make progress. And there are dozens and dozens of these kinds of programs and policies that exist in the local level that are accessible by local groups if they simply mobilize to take action to achieve them. And the reason we wrote this book is because, well, 20 million Americans participate in the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder. And most of them went home and they put signs on their lawns saying, black lives matter, and that was the end of it. But this is a base of support for a pretty large and significant civil rights movement of people who didn't know what to do next.

But those credit scores can take into account rental payment history, just as easily as they can take into account mortgage payment history. And that would go a long way to equalizing that system and not having a disparate impact on African Americans, and local bank branches and credit unions can start to do that. Individually, even if the national credit scoring system isn't adjusted yet, they can start factoring in rental payment history in order to determine someone's credit worthiness, and that would go a long way to opening up access to credit for African Americans.",

In our book, \"Just Action,\" we have a photograph, actually two photographs, of community groups in -- one in California and one in New York, that were picketing banks because it turned out that those banks were making mortgages to apartment developers, multi- unit apartments, and the mortgages penciled out only if those borrowers predicted a higher income stream than present rents would afford. In other words, the banks were being guaranteed that they would gentrify those buildings by evicting current tenants and charging higher rents. Well, community pressure can make sure, as those two demonstrations that we photographed in the book, can make sure that those banks don't follow that policy, that they don't subsidize gentrification in that way, by issuing mortgages to borrowers whose finances would only qualify them for a mortgage if they evicted present tenants and took in higher paying ones.",

This group that I wrote about, they started by learning about the history of their own community and how it came to be segregated. So, they developed a workshop that they did around their region based on \"The Color of Law,\" and applying it specifically to their city and identified the policies that created segregation in that region. And I think part of doing that, that kind of education, it opened up people's eyes to what they thought was just normal, what they thought they were entitled to in that community was actually intentionally created by prohibiting African Americans and others from living there. And once they reconciled with that history, they realize that that's not the kind of community that they wanted to live in. That they actually valued inclusion and they value diversity, and so they wanted to work towards that. So, that's the basis of that group. And then, when they started working on this, defeating this ballot measure, they realized that, you know, the exclusivity of this community hurt them, hurt the people who live there as well. Their children couldn't afford to move back home. The ballot measure was in response to some affordable housing for teachers that was proposed in a town because 30 percent of teachers in this town left their positions every year because they couldn't afford to live anywhere near the schools that they taught in. Their favorite cafes were closing because service employees couldn't find anywhere near there to live on a minimum wage salary. So, they saw how the exclusivity of their community and by keeping the home prices high, through maintaining single-family only zoning, was hurting them as well. And so, the values that they sort of developed and identified through learning about their history, along with the impacts that the affordable housing crisis and the exclusivity of their community were having on them personally helped them develop this really strong community group that defeated the ballot measure and are going on to work on housing policy in the future.",

R. ROTHSTEIN: The reason they should care about this is because we are all Americans and our constitution was violated by the segregation of African Americans. The policies we described were focused on African Americans. It wasn't the large Hispanic migration at the time that these policies were enacted. We have enormous economic inequality in this country today. There are many policies we need to follow that would benefit low income and moderate income, recent immigrants. That's a different issue. It's not a less important issue but it's a different issue from our obligation to remedy the unconstitutional segregation of African Americans. The discrimination, the exclusion that black families have faced in this country was far more extreme, more violent, more oppressive than what was experienced by other groups, even though those other groups did experience discrimination as well. But they're not comparable, and different problems require different solutions. What we say in our writing is that race specific crimes require race specific solutions.
