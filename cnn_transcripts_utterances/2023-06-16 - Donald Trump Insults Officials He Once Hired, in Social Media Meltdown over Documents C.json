Now, these have been stipulated between the defense counsel and prosecutors on how to protect sensitive evidence in this case. We're not talking about classified information, we will get to that in a second, but this is about the sensitive evidence in this investigation that will soon have to be handed over to defense lawyers as part of the discovery process.Now, among the things that they have agreed on are some rules for the defendants. Former President Trump and his aide, Walt Nauta. Now, they have agreed that the defendants should not be able to view the evidence without their lawyers. They should not be given copies. If they take notes, those notes cannot leave the room, they have to be left with counsel and securely stored. Now, the prosecutors also say in this request that they believe that if this evidence is not protected, if it's shared with the public or improperly used, that it could impact not only this case, but other investigations, witnesses and other people who haven't been charged, and that line is raising a lot of eyebrows. But of course we know the special counsel is also investigating the events leading up to in and around January 6th and any efforts to undermine the 2020 election and we know from our reporting, many of the witnesses who have been used in the Trump documents case have also been interviewed in the January 6th case. So there is a lot to still protect there. When it comes to classified information though, they are not quite there. Over the past week, the judge has told attorneys look, you've got to get the process rolling because defense attorneys, John, they need active clearances to view that classified information that's alleged here to have been taken from the White House, over 30 documents and they say, both attorneys for former President Trump say, they have reached out to the Justice Department and that process is underway.",

I mean, the question really is for Republican voters. Do they see these as individual charges against Donald Trump? Or do they see these as a continuance of a federal government that has been weaponized against conservatives? The answer that they would give you to the kind of question that Anthony is posing here, it is not that Donald Trump is unlucky, but that the federal government itself is targeting Republicans and conservatives. That's the built-in answer for a lot of Republican electorate voters. And so for them, it is very easy. You know, I was just in Iowa this week. I was in Iowa the day the federal charges came down talking to Republican voters, people who have been open to alternatives, people like Ron DeSantis and others. If you're in the camp of being open for alternatives, I think that this has pushed you a little further to that and there are some Republicans who really are. But if you're in the camp of folks who have supported Donald Trump, which remains a plurality in relationship to the other candidates, you're digging further in because you think this is just the biggest and deepest example of the federal government targeting Donald Trump.

You see my dear brother Biden expansion of military, cut back on poor people again. No, the legacy of Martin King can't stand by. We've got to be focused on poor and working people, no matter what color, no matter what gender, no matter what sexual orientation, no matter what region. That's why I'm going straight to Trump country, and I'm going to tell submitting, my brothers and sisters who are disproportionately vanilla, don't follow a nail fascist Pie Piper. Follow a leader, a campaign that's concerned about you, that cares about you. And when I call Trump that name, you know, I'm not saying that out of hatred. I don't hate brother Trump. I hate gangster activity. I hate neo-fascist policies. I don't hate Biden as a human being. I hate neoliberal policies that don't focus on poor and working people in militarism abroad that mistreat folk wherever they are. They could be on the West Bank. They could be in Latin America. They can be in the Caribbean. They have a dignity, just like you. And just like me, my dear brother.",
