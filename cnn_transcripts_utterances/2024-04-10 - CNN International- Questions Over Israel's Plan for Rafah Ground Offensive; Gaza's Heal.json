Now, we've heard from officials there that some 381 bodies have been found at this point in and around the hospital. They say some were buried, some left in the open, and they are having to exhume some as well so that they can be identified, so that those who have lost loved ones in that area can have some closure. Now, we've heard from the IDF saying that they killed what they call 200 terrorists. They say that they have arrested 500 more that they believe to be affiliated with terrorist organizations.

But the U.N. spokesperson says challenges remain once the trucks get through that crossing.

The U.S. Central Command says to date U.S. forces have dropped nearly 800 tons of humanitarian assistance into northern Gaza.

Making this Microsoft's largest investment in Japan in the 46 years it's been operational in the country. Now, this investment would also help open its first Microsoft Research Asia lab in Tokyo and further cybersecurity collaboration with the Japanese government. Now, on Wednesday, according to a senior U.S. government official I spoke with, we can expect Kishida and Biden to announce a joint defense council, which would explore further military exports. We've already seen Japan agree to send U.S.-designed Patriot missiles to the United States that were made in Japan, so this would be an expansion of such efforts. Now, the government official I spoke with also said we can expect Kishida and Biden to announce a joint operations command in Japan, which is a move that the U.S. government has long pursued. Right now, joint operations of U.S. personnel in Japan are directed by Indo-PACCOM, which is headquartered in Hawaii. So according to the experts I've spoken with, this would be much easier to coordinate military operations in real time. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
