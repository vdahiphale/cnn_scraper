      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Lebanon is reeling after another day ofIsraeli strikes. More than 500 people have died, thousands more are injured. Israel says its operations there will continue at full force. Then world leaders gathering at the United Nations headquarters this hour, are reacting to the deadly developments in the Middle East, we'll bring you all those developments and the details. Plus, new CNN polling breaks down the strengths as well as the weakness of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the presidential race enters its final stages. But first tonight, the U.N. Secretary-General says the world cannot afford for Lebanon to become another Gaza, warning that Lebanon is on the brink. And we begin tonight with the deepening crisis in that country as Israel unleashes a new wave of deadly airstrikes. The IDF is vowing to speed up attacks against Hezbollah. But ordinary civilians are also paying the price. Israel hitting an apartment building in southern Beirut today, saying it killed a senior Hezbollah commander. Lebanon says six people in all were killed. Israel also says it hit dozens of targets in south Lebanon just a day after blistering strikes killed at least 550 people including 50 children. UNICEF warns many children are still missing under the rubble. It says others are caught on quote, \"dangerous roads as their families desperately tried to flee the violence\". So, you can see there in that video. UNICEF says many children are forced to sleep in cars, on the sides of roads on Monday night. People who made it to make-shift shelters are recounting truly harrowing journeys. One displaced woman says some families spent up to 16 hours in traffic jams while under bombardment. Israel hopes the attacks will force Hezbollah to end rocket fire on Israel. But Hezbollah has vowed to continue hostilities until Israel's war in Gaza is over. The Israeli military says 215 rockets were fired from Lebanon at Israel and the Golan Heights today. Lots of threats for us to get into. Let's bring in our Ben Wedeman who is in Beirut, and Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv. And Ben, as we've just outlined here to our viewers, it's been pretty much another devastating 24 hours for the people of Lebanon. This as Israel claims, it has killed a Hezbollah commander in today's airstrike in Beirut. Just bring us up-to-date with the very latest.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we know from the IDF, or we've been told by the IDF that there have been 300 or maybe morethan 300 now incoming missiles across the day, sometimes in the space of a couple of hours, as many as 60 or so missiles coming into Israel. Now, according to the IDF and the police and the medical services here, they have either been falling in dead area fields or intercepted or occasionally hitting buildings. We were looking at some video a few minutes ago there of Kiryat Shmona where a missile hit somewhat looked like lock-up garages, not quite clear what the target there was, but their fire  service were there putting it out. We're only being told by the police about one injury, and that was an IDF reservist who was taken to a hospital that aren't the high number of casualties here in Israel that are being experienced across the border in Lebanon. And as for, will Israeli troops go into Lebanon? That remains an open question, but clearly, the IDF and the Ministry of Defense are trying to create that perception. And it may be a reality, but the Ministry of Defense was on the border today watching IDF troops training for an operation of crossing the border and combating Hezbollah face-on. The Secretary -- the Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, told them that they are the best force that the IDF has ever had, that they're well trained, they've had combat experience for the past year. He said that the Hezbollah that they face is not the same Hezbollah of a week ago, their command and control has been severely damaged. He said that morale is low, and that he indicated that there are -- their abilities are lowered because of it. He didn't say the troops were definitely going to -- going to cross. But I was very struck by what Ben was saying there very clearly, you know, there were 250 or so missiles fired by Hezbollah yesterday into Israel, 300 today, according to the IDF, that seems to be that Hezbollah is increasing the number of missiles that are coming in. It doesn't appear as if they are a broken force, and I think that was the point that Ben was making there as well. So, what the troops are being told by the Defense Minister may not match the reality on the ground, but he did give the troops this piece of advice, he said make no mistake. They want to attack you, they want to attack the country. But he said I'm confident in you, the troops, that if you face Hezbollah, then you will be able to -- you will be able to tackle them. And he also said there will be more airstrikes coming, which is what we heard from the Army Chief of Staff today as well.",

So, it seems as we played out there, despite the numerous crisis, of course, and the war is raging around the world via the Middle East, be it Ukraine and Sudan, President Biden, as we heard there still managed to convey kind of a message of hope, right? Insisting that a diplomatic solution is still possible when it comes to the war in Gaza. From those you've been speaking to, Alex, I wonder how realistic is this?",

I mean, this was already going to be the question that really hovered over this entire U.N. General Assembly. And now, really, the concern for what is going on in the Middle East has really consumed the vast majority of the conversations, and I think, Isa, what it also does is drive home the fact that the U.S. for all of its efforts over the past 11 months, has so far failed to get to a ceasefire both in Gaza and to a diplomatic deal in the northern part of Israel, and the southern part of Lebanon. The sense we get despite the optimism from President Biden there, is that for all intents and purposes, the ceasefire deal in Gaza is stuck, and is certainly isn't going anywhere as this escalation continues. So, while there is U.S. fear about this expanding war in the Middle East, expanding war between Hezbollah and Israel, it's not clear exactly what the U.S. can do to calm it down. And while we heard that concern and that optimism that the war in Lebanon doesn't need to expand, and that there could be a ceasefire deal, what we did not hear from the President, frankly, were solutions. So, it is unclear how the U.S. intends to move forward to accomplish those two things, Isa.",

Now, Mr. Biden's aides say the president is beginning to acknowledge that he's simply running out of time with only four months left in office, the chances of a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas look dimmer than at any time since Mr. Biden laid out a plan at the beginning of the Summer, and the risk of a wider war has never looked greater.\" I wonder there, Alex, whether you think this speaks perhaps to a loss of U.S. influence over Israel or does it speak more to Netanyahu's relationship with President Biden.

Meantime, the Israeli military said more than 300 rockets were fired at Israel, and the Israeli occupied Golan Heights from Lebanon on Tuesday. And the stakes really couldn't be higher. After events last week, when Israel injured thousands of people across Lebanon with covert attacks, detonating pagers, as well as walkie-talkies, it remains unclear whether Israel intends to launch a ground offensive, as we heard from our Nic Robertson at the top of the show.

We then saw one of the heads of Hezbollah, one of the operational heads killed in the capital, Beirut. And now, we're seeing a systematic attack across a lot of the Hezbollah positions. And it's no coincidence here, this is where all the attacks of Hezbollah using their relatively short-range rockets have been, and have continues to be for the last 11 months. Ever since that Israel went into the Gaza, what Iran's been doing is fanning the flames, getting Hezbollah to attack to try and create a two- front war, one down in the Gaza, one up here. Now, that Netanyahu's claimed that actually he seems to have finished in the Gaza, he's pivoting his forces up to the north. That's why we've seen this series of attacks.

The border was never actually agreed.
