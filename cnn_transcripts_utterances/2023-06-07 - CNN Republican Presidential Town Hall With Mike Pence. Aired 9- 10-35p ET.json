      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to Iowa, where the 2024 campaign for the White House is heating up.We are live at Grand View University in Des Moines for CNN's town hall with former Vice President Mike Pence. I'm Dana Bash. Tonight, we hear from a brand-new candidate in the Republican field. Former Vice President Mike Pence announced his run for the White House earlier today, a move unprecedented in modern political history, a former vice president running against the president he served under. Pence enters a race dominated by that former boss, Donald Trump. And he will be battling a growing number of rivals for the chance to take on President Joe Biden. This evening's event is about the voters and the issues that will help them determine who wins the Republican nomination. Tonight, Iowa voters will have the opportunity to question the former vice president directly, and I will have some questions of my own. This town hall is part of the Republican primary process. And so, by design, in the audience tonight are voters who say they plan to participate in the Iowa Republican Caucuses, both Republicans and also independents who plan to register as Republicans. The audience comes from all over the state and is representative of Iowa Republicans. To find tonight's questioners, we reached out to Republican-affiliated groups, as well as business groups, farm associations, parent groups, young professional organizations, religious groups, and advocacy organizations. In addition to the voters asking the questions, guests of the Pence campaign and the university are also in the audience. We have asked everyone here to be respectful, so that voters in the room and at home have a chance to hear from the candidate. Now please welcome former Vice President Mike Pence. (APPLAUSE) MIKE PENCE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)",

He went through Ellis Island. I was named after him. My dad was a combat veteran. My mom and dad built everything that matters, a family, a business and a good name. We really lived the American dream. And I was raised to believe you give back. And I had the opportunity to do that. We met in the years that I was in the Congress of the United States, when I was a leader among House conservatives. I was governor of the state of Indiana. It was my great privilege to be vice president of the United States.  But the opportunities that we have had to serve, the experience that we have developed informed very much our sense of calling in this moment, because I'm running because I think this country is in a lot of trouble. I think President Joe Biden and the Democrats have weakened America at home and abroad. Literally, we have a crisis at our border. We have inflation at a 40- year high. We have a crime wave in our cities. And, frankly, that disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has emboldened the enemies of freedom around the world. Now, more than ever, I think those of us that have the experience to bring back real change and to put America back on a track of commonsense, conservative principles have a responsibility to step forward. And that's why I'm running for president of the United States.",

And I will always believe that, by God's grace, I did my duty that day to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the oath that I had taken. But, as I said today in my remarks, I felt it was important, as we launch this campaign, to understand the president and I had a difference in the past, and that hasn't changed. But, also, there are profound differences about the future of this country and the future of the Republican Party that I articulated today. When the president asserted that I had the right to overturn the election, I said today that I felt that he was -- he was asking me to choose between him and the Constitution. I chose the Constitution. And I always will. It was a difficult day. I had, frankly, hoped the president would come around in the years since and see that we had done our duty under the Constitution to preside over the count of the electoral vote as dictated by our founders. But it's not to be. I said today President Trump was wrong then, he's wrong now. But I truly do believe, I truly do believe that it's important to remember that those of us that would take the oath of office to serve as president of the United States really make one promise above all others, and that is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. And I pledge to the people of Iowa and the people of America that, if you give me that great privilege, I will always stand on the Constitution of the United States of America, whatever it means to me.

And I said so on that fateful day. I had concerns that there were half-a-dozen states that had changed the rules in the name of COVID and that had undermined public confidence in our elections. But once states had certified those elections, once the courts had reviewed them, once the Congress had considered any objections, I knew my duty was clear. The Constitution states clearly that the job of the vice president, as president of the Senate, is to preside over a joint session of Congress, where the Electoral College votes are opened and counted. It says, they shall be opened and they shall be counted. And we did that. And I want the American people to know that I believe with all my heart that we did our duty that day. The Bible says, he keeps his oath even when it hurts. And I know something about that. I know the disappointment of the 2020 election. You remember, I was on the ballot, right? (LAUGHTER)",

But here, these Democrats came in and they just used the excuse of COVID for a gusher of spending and a wish list of liberal policy priorities. And American families have been paying the price, Scott, ever since. Well, the first thing we need to do, we need to get federal spending under control.

Our administration ended what was a ban during the Obama-Biden administration on any military resources at all. We provided Javelin missiles. All they were providing was military meals and blankets.

You know, I -- there are issues that I've served in, and I've spoke about one of them already tonight, about the sanctity of life that are deeply informed by my faith. Shortly after I made that decision to put my faith in Christ, I remember opening up the old book and reading, before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. And see, I've set before you, life and death, blessings and curses. Now, choose life so that you and your children may live. And that's when I knew that the cause of life was his cause and it needed to be my cause.But more broadly, I like your question because it speaks about a heart of compassion that we're called to have as believers. And it's one of the reasons why, back when I was in the Congress in the United States, and Dana remembers this, I was the Chairman of the House Conservative Caucus. But I looked at what was happening on our border, and I felt a moral obligation as the grandson of an immigrant, to try and come up with a no amnesty immigration reform proposal. Not comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty, but rather to create new system that would allow people to come into the country legally in an orderly way. There was strong border security in it, strong internal enforcement in it, penalties for employers that hire illegal immigrants, but it also created a guest worker program. I remember it was very popular among members of Congress, it was about 2005, and many members of Congress were fascinated by it. It was the idea that we would use private sector employment firms to work with the Department of Homeland Security and literally operate a guest worker program where people could come and go under the color of the law. Believe it or not, we used to have a guest worker program in the 1950s. It was called the Bracero Program, but the Labor Union shut it down under President Lyndon Johnson. And not surprisingly, a few short years later, illegal immigration started to happen at our southern border. And I truly do believe that we can fix a broken immigration system. We can build an immigration system that's built on the principles of merit and the needs of the American people. But we also can create a system where people that want to come and work whether it be in agriculture, where in other trades can come and for a short period of time pay taxes, participate in our economy and go home. But all of that was animated and motivated by my deep conviction that we can't walk by on the other side of the road. The truth is the crisis at our border today, there's suffering on both sides of the border. The American people are hurting, but the cartels are literally exploiting millions of people for the greatest, most appalling program of human trafficking in human history. 5 million people coming across our border in the last two years, all being driven by the cartels and the failed policies of the Biden administration. We can fix a broken immigration system. And I'm innovated by my faith. I'm innovated by being the grandson of an immigrant, to say that we owe the American people, we owe this generation and the next an immigration system --",

That's what she is. And I'm apparently her prize pupil, 38 years tomorrow, together. Look, we've got great challenges in education today. I mean, many of our most vulnerable populations are relegated to some of the most failing and dangerous schools in this country. And for a very long time, I have believed that parents ought to be able to choose where their children go to school, public, private, parochial or homeschool. We ought to get parents that. But let me say very emphatically, on behalf of your daughter, she teaches a public school, my wife that taught in public education for half her career. I think -- I think educational choice that's expanding around the country, my friend Governor Doug Ducey actually passed the first legislation in America for universal school choice in Arizona. In Iowa, you followed suit. In Indiana, I'm proud to say we followed suit as well, other states are following, and expanding the opportunity to choose where your children go to school, to every family in the state. Now, for my part, I'm someone that believes in competition. I actually think by letting parents choose where their kids go to school, all the schools are going to get better. I have confidence that our public schools can compete with our private schools, and they will be more responsive to the goals and the values of the people of their community when they have to compete for those students. So, you know, we're dealing -- in Iowa, we're dealing, and around the country, you're dealing with this issue of this radical gender ideology that's taken hold in a lot of our public schools. A group that I founded has been involved in battling against the Linn-Mar Community Schools case. It was a case literally where you could -- the viewers will have a hard time believing this, but a -- but a student would have to bring in a slip from their parents to get an aspirin from the school nurse, but they could get a gender transition plan without telling their parents. Well, we're fighting against that in the courts, but I really do believe that by giving parents the ability to choose where their kids go to school, we're going to drive a lot of this politically correct nonsense out of the schools, and our public schools will respond and start respecting the value of every Americans.",

And under the law, there will be mandatory cuts in Social Security and Medicare. That's why it's incomprehensible to me that Joe Biden refuses to even have a conversation with members of either political party about some commonsense reforms that would put Social Security and Medicare back on a solid foundation and end this avalanche of debt that we're bequeathing to our children and grandchildren. It's also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency. And the truth is, not only are we looking at mandatory cuts in these programs if we don't reform them and improve them, but, frankly, Dana, the $32 trillion national debt that we have today, which is the size of our nation's economy -- first time since World War II that we have debt the size of our economy -- that is actually set to grow, largely driven by the cost of entitlements, over the next 25 years from $32 trillion to $150 trillion. And if we reach that point, by the time my three perfect granddaughters are in their early 20s, all of our choices will be bad. We will either be faced with cuts in these programs, which we would never want to allow, or we will be faced with having to raise taxes on the American people at a level that would never be imagined. It's one of the reasons why I know it's not -- a lot of people say it's not -- it's not political to do it, but, for me, I think we have got a moral obligation to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare. And that means saying to Americans over the age of 40, we're going to keep the system that we have. But, for Americans under the age of 40, we have got to work on the kind of reforms that will lessen the burden of debt and change these New Deal programs into a better deal for younger Americans.

We raised the penalties on serious offenders.

That shooter was brought down because of the courage of law enforcement that ran in without regard to their personal safety and took him down. But apparently, he had a list that had my friend's daughter's school on it. It was just a couple of miles away. I think the time has come for us as a country to end the discussion about school security and if it takes federal legislation and federal funding, we ought to fund and arm and train security guard at every public and private school in America.

And by God's grace, we haven't seen an incident like this in our state. But they've got to be trained. I mean, this is the reason why -- if it takes federal funding, Dana, let's do it, right? I understand state resources. I balanced four budgets when I was governor of the state of Indiana, okay? I understand there are limited resources at the state level. That's why -- I just think we ought to end the conversation, and Washington, D.C. ought to just step up and make sure that there's funding available, not just to have an armed guard, but a trained guard who can also be a part of the school community. I mean, the fact is, having somebody that understands who the kids are, they know who they are, they can pick up a sense of where they are.

And anyone who has anyone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president again. I had hoped that President Trump would come around on our difference about that tragic day and about my role. And I still hope he does.I mean, we'll have differences that are worthy of debate, but at its very core, it's important to remember, the President of the United States takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and faithfully execute the laws. But at the core of that is a willingness to submit to the collective wisdom of generations of Americans enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. And I hold the view that it should be a prerequisite of any man or woman that would ever hold the office of president that you would agree to never put yourself above the Constitution. My son is a Marine. He flies -- the Joint Strike Fighter in the Marine Corps. And around the time of that fateful day, I'll never forget, my son looked at me and he said, dad, you took the same oath I took. Nothing else matters. I mean, the men and women of our armed forces take the very same oath to support and defend the Constitution. We don't give them the option to decide whether it's in their interest or not. We give them the assignment and they go without regard to their personal safety. And I think whoever is president of the United States, that man or woman should have no other view. But let me say that with regard to supporting the Republican nominee, look, I started in politics as a Democrat. But as soon as I heard the voice and ideals of the 40th president of United States, I joined the Reagan revolution and never looked back. And I've always supported the Republican nominee for president in the United States. And I'll support the Republican nominee in 2024, especially if it's me.",

Look, I said before, I think democracy depends on heavy doses of civility. And over the last 20 years of my career, we've always tried to aspire to that ideal.My faith requires me to treat others the way I want to be treated. And while earlier in my career, the first time I ran for office, I didn't live up to that. Ten years later when the opportunity came around, we've -- we sought to do just that. And quite frankly, over the course of my years in Congress, and as governor and as vice president, I've always -- I've always tried to reflect that. You know, I think our politics are more divided than ever before in my lifetime, but I'm not convinced the American people are as divided as our politics. You know, Karen and I moved home to Indiana, we bought five acres and a pond after we left the White House. But I have to tell you, you know, one of the things I've learned and you get 15 miles out of Washington, D.C. The people of this country actually get along pretty well. Right? I mean, the American people show respect to one another. People here in Iowa, people in Indiana, people with whom we differ. We show civility and respect most days. I just think we need government as good as our people. And when I think of the challenges are facing America today, a world that seems to be more dangerous every day, inflation, crisis at our border, crime in our major cities, which seems to be an assault on our values, failing schools in so many of our major cities and towns across the country. And now more than ever, we need to create an environment in politics that allows us to talk to one another. You know, I wrote a book about my career reflected on this. And I will tell you, taking that approach in my career, I was able to forge relationships with people in Congress that I agreed with a nothing. One of them was the late John Lewis, an icon of the Civil Rights Movement and the right hand man of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. John and I differed on everything, except that I knew he was a great man. And we recognize the importance of our Christian faiths to both of us. And I'll never forget, when I was leading the House Republican Conference, John Lewis called my office and asked if Karen and I would co-lead the annual civil rights pilgrimage to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with him. The very bridge where years and years earlier he had -- he had been beaten to within an inch of his life. By his suffering and struggle, he'd advanced a more perfect union in America. It's one of the great privileges of my life that Karen and I and our three children walked across that bridge with John Lewis. And I mourn his passing. It's a sense of personal loss when he left us. But John and I, again, never agreed on much, but we can always talk. And I think that's what we have to get back to when you think about the challenges we're facing in America. I just think we've got to get back to the kind of politics that reflects the decency and civility that the American people show each other every day. And I believe we will, and I hope to be a part of it.",
