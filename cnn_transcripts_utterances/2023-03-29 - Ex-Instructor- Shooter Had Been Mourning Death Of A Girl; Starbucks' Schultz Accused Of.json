And the chief initially said that because of actions that happened when they first arrived there on scene Monday morning because the shooter began shooting through an upper window on another story at police when they arrived. But it was the actions of that shooter that led them to believe that perhaps they had some kind of weapons training. Today, Nashville police told me they still do believe that although they are working to determine when that training may have taken place, and where and to what extent as well, whether it was just basic firearms training, or something more. Look. Remember, they found seven different firearms in the possession of this shooter. And they noted that they had all been purchased between October 2020 and June of 2022. We have talked about the fact that police say that the parents of the shooter said that they were being treated for emotional disorder. I asked police if they could describe or explain when that treatment began. They told me they could not talk to me about that at this point.

And to make his case, he pointed to a ruling from just a few weeks ago from the National Labor Relations Board, which accused Starbucks of \"egregious and widespread misconduct in its dealings with employees, were trying to unionize in Buffalo in New York.\" And for his part, Schultz, he stressed that Starbucks has not broken the law here.

Sara Murray, thank you.Well, joining us now is Tom Dupree, former Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Bush, and CNN chief national Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Welcome both of you. Jeff, let's start with you. And let's parse through this language that we heard from former Vice President Pence. He says he has nothing to hide, that he will obey the law, so from what you're hearing, do you think that this will ultimately lead him to testify before this grand jury? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Look, he certainly did not come out swinging, if you will, this morning. And the venue where he was speaking in Urbandale, Iowa, was at the West Side conservatives club breakfast. It's a place where presidential candidates -- potential presidential candidates come and speak. And if you wanted to sort of come out and attack the judge's ruling and, you know, sort of show some loyalty to the former president, he did not do that. And this is really what we've seen with the former vice president. He was complimentary, as Sara was saying to the judge's ruling, in a sense that did draw a distinction between his role as the senate president but he also said, look, I have nothing to hide. So, he is still consulting with his lawyers. But I must tell. Republicans around him would be very surprised if he would appeal this ruling. So, it certainly looks like he will comply with the law. Now politically speaking, we don't know really what the fallout from this is. His lane is very narrow in terms of the Republicans who certainly are interested in seeing him. He is essentially ruled out in most of the Trump base. But there is a wide sense of Republicans and others -- and other voters who you know were very happy with what he did on January 6. We will see what the politics of this are going forward. It's a fine line for him, no doubt. But I think his tone this morning show that he is certainly going to comply and not appeal this.

And now, he's got kind of a big catch, so to speak, the former Vice President of the United States.If I were prosecuting this case, I would be exceedingly interested in the conversations between former President Trump and Mr. Pence in the run-up to January 6. We know just from prior reporting, that the president was exerting incredible pressure on the Vice President often in caustic terms to basically overturn the election when he served as president of the senate and counted the votes on January 6. The Vice President pushed back. But I suspect we will get a lot more insight into precisely what former President Trump said to Vice President Pence and all the pressure that he attempted to bring to bear to get the vice president to do his bidding. GOLODRYGA: So, Jeff, on that note, have we heard any response from the former president's camp yet?

We were talking federal crimes potentially here.So, they may certainly complain about this. But the former president has been pretty quiet about this, which is unusual for him.

We do know that he gave the former vice president a victory of sorts and that he apparently upheld and vindicated Mr. Pence's claim that his conduct on January 6 was protected under the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause. So, it's very possible that you know, in the quietude of his home, the former vice president is actually celebrating this ruling and the vindication of his legal position.We don't know what this is that he is genuine when he says he wants to consult with his lawyers, make an assessment of the likelihood of success on appeal, and whether they actually want to challenge this.
