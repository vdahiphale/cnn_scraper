I want to read that to you.They say first and foremost, we care deeply for the four families who have lost their precious children. There are no words that can adequately express the sadness we feel and we pray each day for them. We will continue to let the legal process unfold, and as a family, we will love and support our son and brother. We have fully cooperated with law enforcement agencies in an attempt to seek the truth and promote his presumption of innocence rather than judge unknown facts and make erroneous assumptions. We respect privacy in this matter as our family and the family suffering loss can move forward through their legal process. And his attorney is the chief public defender for Monroe County, Pennsylvania. He tells me that when the arrest happened at 1.30 in the morning on Friday, that it was actually Bryan Kohberger's father that answered the door. The family is saying according to the attorney, about three o'clock in the morning, the middle of the night, he answered the door. We know it was the FBI, Pennsylvania State Police. We know Idaho State Police are here in Pennsylvania at this point. The father fully cooperated with law enforcement, I am told. He brought his son Bryan to the front door. That is when authorities arrested him. I am also told by the attorney that the family is not being allowed to visit him in this correction facility. They are not being allowed to talk with him, but the fact is, once there is that court date on Tuesday for extradition, it is a public courtroom and anyone can go inside.

It's another thing to misrepresent your sources of income, for where you got money for your campaign. And that I think is going to be the big question.

And then of course they have about 360 billion, in clean energy investments through the Inflation Reduction Act. And I think the biggest priority of the Biden administration is going to be to try to have the rubber meet the road on all of those bills and show and demonstrate an impact in communities around the country. You know, he may be cutting ribbons at new plants or new factories, literally every week between now and 2024. We know that he's going down this week and appearing, apparently with Mitch McConnell to talk about infrastructure. I think that's going to be the number one priority. And then the second, I think priority is going to be unilateral executive action, particularly regulatory action, where he can act without needing Congress's part.

The fact that you do have congestion, back on the streets of Beijing, people are still going and decided to go back shopping, and going around the town.

On the other side, you do see -- we're hearing from teams on the ground, and anecdotally, that there are full hospitals, that the hospitalizations have been significant. And you also hear, of concerns of those within the country itself, of even trying to go to a pharmacy and buy some medicine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): There is a shortage of all the cold and flu medicine, and fever reducing medicine. Including rubbing alcohol and thermometers, which have been out of stock. I think it's because we're in the countryside, and other goods are allocated to big hospitals and cities. But here in the towns and villages, we're more isolated, unless medicine is available. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They want numbers on the more genetic sequencing data -- for example. Of course, that is the concern around the world that variants may be created from such a sheer number of people carrying the virus at any one time. They want details on hospitalizations, on deaths, et cetera. It's not clear at this point whether they are likely to get any of that from Beijing officially. Rosemary?",
