Soon, though, it could be back to two sure things.John Berman here, in for Anderson. Today the Supreme Court dealt the former President a big loss, refusing to issue a stay that would have kept the House Ways and Means Committee from seeing the returns, and it wasn't the only legal hit he took today. Taxes first, though. Briefly, the law says upon written request from the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means at the House of Representatives, the Secretary shall furnish such Committee with any return or return information specified in such request. The committee asked for the return three years ago and keeping them honest, the only reason they had to ask it all, of course, was that candidate Trump and later President Trump, and like any other in modern history refused to make them public from the get go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit, and it'll be released. I've been ordered that I think for 15 straight years. When the audit is done, I will release them. I'm under routine audit, and I think it's a very unfair thing. As soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit. It's very simple. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So what I mean is, well, I could just say I'll release them when I'm no longer under audit, because I'll never not be under audit.\" He didn't tell voters that part.But when Democrats in Congress demanded the returns in April of 2019, he didn't try the audit excuse on them.

Quoting from the lead, \"Donald J. Trump paid $750.00 in Federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.00. He paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.\" Just today in the State of New York's case against the Trump Organization, an accountant for the company confirmed some of that story, admitting under cross examination that the former President reported losses on his personal returns from 2011 to 2018. And soon, the House Ways and Means Committee will be able to see what else the former President went all the way to the Supreme Court to keep private. But that's not all. Also today, his 2020 election sidekick, Senator Lindsey Graham, who also took his case to the Supreme Court and lost finally went before a Georgia grand jury investigating efforts to overturn the election there. And if that's not enough, an 11th Circuit Court of Appeals panel today cast doubt on the former President's arguments for why the FBI's search at Mar-a-Lago required a Special Master to review the materials that were seized there. All three Judges on the panel were appointed by Republican Presidents, two by the former President himself. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has much more on that for us tonight.

And the way that this case complements that or functions in what Smith is doing is it's just a part of it. Right? In the Mar-a-Lago case, the Justice Department's Smith's team is going to have access right now to all of those documents marked as classified, classified documents taken out of the Florida beach club. What they are not able to access just yet, and potentially, they could if the Court rules quickly, what they're not able to access right now, are all of the rest of the things, potentially more evidence. But it depends on how fast this Court could step in here, if they do rule in the Justice Department's favor, Smith would be back on track to do just what he is planning on doing when he returns to the United States from Europe.",
