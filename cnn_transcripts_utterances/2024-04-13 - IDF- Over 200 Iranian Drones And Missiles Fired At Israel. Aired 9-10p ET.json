A wide scale aerial assault is going on right now with waves of drones and missiles streaming into Israel from Iran.Our team is on the ground in Jerusalem. They've been hearing explosions, sirens going off as U.S. and Israeli forces have reported intercepting multiple Iranian attacks, but we still do not know what the ultimate impact of this barrage will be, not the immediate damage inside Israel, nor the response that it might bring next from the Israeli military. Our reporters and analysts are covering all of this. We have them located all over the region as well as here in Washington. I want to go to our chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward. She's joining us from Tel Aviv. First of all, right, now, we saw the sirens and the missiles being intercepted over Jerusalem. What are we seeing there in Tel Aviv?",

You could see that alert return, people being told once again, to be near to a shelter. But for the moment, it seems that the majority of -- the vast majority I should say, of the according to IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, 200 different the types of cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, drones, killer drones as he referred to them, have been intercepted, most of them outside of the country. There was some damage according to the IDF to a base in southern Israel. We know of one seven year-old Bedouin girl who was injured in the Negev. She is receiving treatment for those injuries that as a result of those intercepts that we have seen going on throughout the night but certainly feels a little bit calmer and a little bit quieter here as people wait to see what else may unfold throughout the night, Wolf.",

And as courses his said, ten cruise missiles and dozens of drones intercepted outside of Israeli air space.And as we're not hearing the intercepts here are the moment perhaps they are going on over the borders before they get to, before they get to Israel. But the fact that the home command has effectively put people on notice that they can be a little bit more relaxed. They can, of course, turn that around in moments. It is a very, very effective alert system here, not just with the sirens you here and here, another jet speeding through the sky that in a second one, directly above me speeding through the sky. It is a very sophisticated system that can pinpoint a thread, let the population in that area no very, very quickly over their cellular phones. That jet is quite low that's heading off into the distance above me now. So, what we heard from Daniel Hagari may still be playing out despite the fact that the population has been put a little more at ease for the moment, Wolf.",

He's done a lot of reporting from inside Iran. He's spoken to all the top Iranian officials over these past several years. There's a statement that just came out. I'm sure you saw it already Fred, from the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Among other things, it said this, and I'm quoting now from the IRGC statement: Any threat by the terrorist state of America and the Zionist regime from any country will be followed by a reciprocal and proportional response from the Islamic Republic of Iran to the source of the threat. A clear -- a clear warning to the U.S. if it helps Israel, deal with these incoming rockets and missiles, the U.S. will -- will pay a price for that.

And its a threat that we've been seeing from the Iranians really over the past couple of years and a threat that they've also made make good on a couple of times. If we look, for instance, back towards the Trump administration and even the months before the U.S. assassinated the IRGC Quds forces top general Qassem Soleimani, you had some incidents between the us and Iran in the Persian gulf for the Iranians, then shot down a U.S. Global Hawk Drone. That, of course, a Hawk Drone.That, of course, was the Iranians displaying that they are not to be messed with and that they also have military that is capable of hurting U.S. assets. There were very few people at the time who thought that Iran's own Iranian-made air defense systems would be capable of taking down U.S. assets. The Iranians proved otherwise. Then afterwards, after Qassem Soleimani was assassinated, they struck a U.S. base, the Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq where very few people believed that Iran's ballistic missiles were as accurate as they turned out to be. And now tonight, the Iranians have once again demonstrated that they've made a lot of progress, it appears, as far as their cruise missiles are concerned, ballistic missiles are concerned, but also the drones as well. And I think one of the things that we've seen in from the Iranians is that they've really put a lot of effort into that drone program. In fact, I was a couple of years ago at an Iranian drone show as part of one of their military days. And they were talking very openly about the fact that they believe that drones were one of those weapons that they could use to really take the fight especially to the U.S. in Middle East. So, clearly, now threats from the Iranians -- again, the Iranians are saying, look, the U.S. bases are there, Iranian proxy forces are there as well. But of course, drones are a big threat to those U.S. assets in the Middle East as well, Wolf?",

And that's a deliberate decision not to confront the U.S. directly now, despite the kind of rhetoric we're hearing from them. And this warning the U.S. away, let's be clear, the U.S. is highly involved in Israel's defense tonight, they moved assets into the region ships, et cetera, to be able to scan the skies for threats exactly like this and help Israel take them out before they reached Israeli territory.

And unlike with any attack like this, you're always concerned and about escalation ladders because one side attacks, you have this, what we presumed to be an Israeli strike in Damascus against the Iranian officials a number of weeks ago, you have this Iranian response, Israel response, and it's watching that escalation ladder to see how high each level goes, and that's the concern, right, is that that can easily accelerate.",

This is a video from earlier tonight that was unfolding in Israel. We're watching all of this unfold.I want to bring in the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton. He was also President Trump's national security advisor. As you know, Ambassador, Israel's ambassador is calling for the U.N. Security Council to immediately convene following these attacks. What's your assessment of what's going on right now? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Well, nothing's going to happen in the Security Council. That's for sure. I mean, what we had tonight was a massive failure of Israeli and American deterrence, massive failure -- a 200 ballistic missile, cruise missile, drone failure. And I think notwithstanding that, there appears to be very little damage fingers crossed until we get the final assessment and thank God if the death toll is lower, or nonexistent, and while we're at it, let's thank George W. Bush for getting out of the ABM treaty of 1972, unleashing American missile defense capabilities. But once we see what the damage is, I think its incumbent on Israel and the United States to re-establish deterrence in a major way. And I think that means by definition Israel's response and there should be a response, should not be proportionate. It should be far stronger because when deterrence fails to re-establish it, you have to teach the adversary that any gain they may help to get by any future attack will be more than outweighed by the damage that will be caused.",

So I think among the many targets Israel should consider, this is the opportunity to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program.

The Israelis clearly have thought about what to do to neutralize Hezbollah perhaps their response, which also would be a pretty big problem for Iran, would be to go after Hezbollah. Now, my point is there are a number of steps Israel can take passivity at this point for Israel would be a big mistake.

They did not count on the U.S. and Israel's allies, probably partaking as deeply as we did, been able to take out the drones that we have. But this was a significant attempt to kill Israelis. Israel has no option, but to respond and its important to keep in mind in all of this debate, too, because this is obviously happening today and something that were interested in. This is what Ukraine has to deal with every night, every night, they get Shahed drone sent by Russia supplied by Iran and ballistic and cruise missiles shot by Russia, in many cases, given to them by Iran.

We know they're very close to a nuclear weapon.And I remember all my time in Congress been promised by every administration that if Iran actually does get very close to a nuclear weapon, that will be prevented. Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. But we're at that moment now. So while I'm not sitting here saying that maybe the right response on this is to attack the nuclear program. The question is, we are on the edge of that moment and we have to accept as a country, we will either have a nuclear armed Iran or we won't, and we may have to do something about that, us and Israel, probably largely on Israel. So, is it the best response on this attack? I don't know. I'll leave that up to the Israelis, but I can tell you what certainly needs to happen. I think is going after Iran's -- but this is a very directly proportionate response is going after Iran's ability to make the exact drones they sent against Israel, and that they're supplying. This is a side benefit that they're supplying to Russia to attack Ukraine with.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. You know, Jim, it's a great question and it is really hard to tell at this point. I mean, you know, Hezbollah and Iran certainly do speak. They do coordinate their military activities. Hezbollah is one of Iran's most significant proxies in this region.But whether or not the barrage over rockets that we saw from Hezbollah earlier was coordinated with this Iranian attack on Israel, is hard to tell and actually, I'm seeing what looked like some interceptions in the other direction here, not hearing any sirens or the sounds of that, but I did just see some flashes in the air. And I would just note that this area -- I mean, they are used to having these interceptions now they are used to seeing these barrages of rockets coming from Lebanon over the course of the last several months. And they also are used to the sound of jets. And as I can here, here, jets just continuously flying overhead. And yep, I just heard the booms from what I thought were potential interceptions and so the delay there I don't know if you can hear that on my microphone, but those definitely sound like interceptions. The light obviously travels faster than sound, so you can see those first. And I'm hearing that's the third boom that we just heard. It must be at some distance, so there is a possibility that that could actually be intercepted in Syria rather than in the Golan Heights. We -- I'm just checking my phone to see up there were some siren alerts in northern Israel, in the Golan Heights indeed, not far from our -- not too far from our position actually, maybe a distance of ten kilometers or so. So, what's also interesting is that the home front command here in Israel, actually before this latest barrage that we had over the past hour, they had actually told residents in both northern Israel as well as southern Israel who had earlier been instructed to stay near shelters that they could return to normal, indicating that that large- scale attack from Iran, that the threat for now at least was over. And yet, what we are seeing instead is more rockets being fired from Lebanon likely by Hezbollah, indicating that this is going to continue on as it has for months now as you were just mentioning, Jim.",

Earlier in the day, Hezbollah said that it had fired multiple rockets in the direction of an Israeli military base in the Golan Heights, where it has directed rockets in the past as well.Again, the question that Jim raises is a good one in terms of how much is this part of that Iranian response? How much of this is part of what we have seen over the course of months now, which is Hezbollah firing rockets into the Golan Heights, into northern Israel. That that part is what's tricky to distinguish here. You know, there's no indication that even as Iran may, may suggest may have indicated earlier tonight that this was its response to those strikes in Syria, that the response was over as far as it was concerned. There's no indication that that means that Hezbollah is going to stop firing rockets into northern Israel, nor does it mean that Israel is going to stop conducting airstrikes into southern Lebanon, which we have also seen at a similar clip over the course of the last six months.",

It looks like Hezbollah is beginning to launch a lot of rockets and missiles towards Israel from southern Lebanon. We'll watch that unfold. This is quickly escalating, not just Iran launching rockets and missiles and drones towards Israel, but now their ally, their proxy in south Lebanon, Hezbollah doing the same thing. So it's clearly escalating. I want to bring in Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York right now. He's a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee as well. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. How worried are you that this could explode into some sort of full- scale war? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Well, Wolf, the world is a tinderbox, as we've seen, China, Russia, and Iran had been working together and then unholy alliance to destabilize and undermine the United States, Israel, and the free world. When you look at what is going on right now in the Middle East, Iran is the greatest state sponsor of terror. They have funded Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and other terrorist organizations as their proxies in their war against Israel. They want to eradicate the state of Israel off the face of the earth and obviously with this direct attack tonight, we see that they are finally putting their own missiles and rockets and drones behind this effort and that is deeply alarming. It's why I have fought to get at Iran's funding by putting secondary sanctions in place on the purchase of Iranian petroleum, which is how they are funding so much of their war against Israel. The biggest purchaser of Iranian petroleum is China. It's why we passed the SHIP Act through the House in November, and I'm calling on Senator Schumer to pass this through the Senate immediately. We have to crack down on their funding source. $88 billion increase Iranian petroleum sales since Joe Biden took office because they have weakened the sanctions against Iran. We have to crack down on this. So I'm deeply concerned about how this entire situation couldn't explode and how Israel is going to defend itself on multiple fronts.",

We obviously have to work together to get this done. So, yes, I'm calling on Speaker Johnson to bring a bill to the floor this week. I'm calling on Chuck Schumer and the White House to work with House Republicans. We are in a divided government. We have to work together. There has to be compromised. We need to help Israel.
