That is an urgent, new warning as officials tell tens of thousands of people to get out immediately, with wildfires ripping through Los Angeles County. We want to make clear, the situation at this hour is critical, with the explosive winds expected to make the fires even worse. The sun is about to rise there. We could get our first look at some of the devastation overnight. There's no real count yet of how many homes or businesses have been destroyed. Winds are too fierce to fight them from the air. There's really almost nothing that can be done with the fire. Zero percent contained. This was the scene in Pasadena just minutes ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we've watched that burn down.And then I know I keep saying this about palm trees, but palm trees, I love them, but they're scary in wildfire because they move so much in these winds. If they get caught in one of those embers and start to go up in flames, they can then throw that fire. This is part of the reason why I've talked to firefighters over the years and they say, don't put palm trees on your property. And this is the reason why. You see how they're blowing in the wind there. That is concerning. I can also see there's an equinox in this building here as well. So, I don't know what's behind the building exactly, but I can tell by the way the firefighters are responding and law enforcement is blocking off the road, they are concerned they're going into action to shut this down. But we'll keep watching it. Oh, and starting to blow up over on this side too a little bit. So, we'll keep our eyes on it as we watch this because sometimes it looks like things are done and they're not. They get smoky and then they build back up. The winds are not done here either.

The Pasadena area is one of the areas at this moment being hardest hit. You can see it's 6:17 a.m. in California. The sun, I guess, will come up soon there. People are going to be able to see it through the smoke. But we're really now just getting our first sense, maybe, of how much damage was done in this devastating, devastating night as these fires burn in at least three locations there. We saw some fire personnel in these pictures, as the camera pans around a little bit. You can see them there. There's not much they can do. The fires right now are zero percent contained. The winds are too fierce to fight them from the air. For the most part, the firefighters we've spoken to, and they're there. They're at the ready. They tell us it's just too hot, too erratic for them to get close enough to try to put them out. So, they're positioning where they can, preparing where they can. Very dangerous as those fires move near that car, and the gas tank perhaps in it as well. As we look at this, let's bring in CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam.
