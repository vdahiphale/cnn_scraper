Gaza Strip, of course, about 2.5 miles, 3 kilometers behind us here.And what we've seen at this point in the last hour or so, I think, gives us an indication of what we'll see going forward. We've seen the maneuver and movement of a lot of Israeli tanks, their main battle tank, on tank transporters, some going down towards Gaza, some taking another route around Gaza. That's been a change. That's the first time we've seen that more than a dozen, at least maybe 15 or so tanks coming through this point here, many going towards Gaza. We've seen as well civilian buses empty going into this area in the last 30 minutes or so. That's significant as well, because they can now get to Sderot and now help evacuate civilians who want to leave that area. The directions from the Israeli government, stay close to home, stay close to a place of shelter. Be ready to use it. You shouldn't be wandering around this area or until a few hours ago. The area behind me here was really cordoned off because it was an active military area zone where the Israeli defense force were trying to clear out the last of the Hamas militants. But you're hearing behind me explosions. We're hearing fighter jets in the air as well. A helicopter went overhead just now. All of this concentrating firepower on Gaza. So I think this is the tempo of what we're going to see build up here. Another truck going in here towards Gaza right now.",

People have built that into their lives where they need to. But the idea that Hamas militants could be storming into homes, rounding up and taking people away, capturing them, taking them into guards as civilians, or just shooting them in big numbers on the streets in their towns, not occasional shootings, but big shootings. That's something new and different, and that really has eaten into people's psyche.And I think we saw that in that clip there at Ben Gurion Airport, there were people there who were afraid. They were clinging to their loved ones. It's a dynamic situation that they're not used to. People lying on the ground crying in fear.

They've been canceled. We've seen all reservists show up for duty. And in that sense, the domestic unrest is put to the side for now. But this kind of day, what Israel saw the debacle, in many ways, is not going to be forgotten by anyone in Israel. And Netanyahu is in charge. And politically speaking, he's in very dire straits, if he has a reprieve now to conduct this war, which is widely supported in Israel, obviously. So we're seeing a reprieve of the politics. We've seen both sides of the aisle and leaders of the opposition, talk about possibly an emergency national unity government. But we're also seeing an Israeli public that is extremely angry at its leadership. The main goal for Netanyahu in recent months is to -- has been to try and achieve normalization with Saudi Arabia. That's something that here in Washington, the Biden administration has been very active exploring. It's, of course, put on hold right now. I've -- I'm not sure it's off the table completely. Many people have said it is. I'm not completely sure. We'll have to see after this war ends, whether or not it has changed fundamentals in the Saudi-Israeli relationship. That was never based on the love of the Arab world or the Saudi population for Israel. It was based on the interests of the leadership in Saudi Arabia and the desire in Israel to reach this kind of deal. It may be back.

More importantly, by doing this, all indications are that laid the groundwork for what came next. At 7:40, an hour and 10 minutes later, that's when armed soldiers, fighters started coming out of Gaza into Israel, some by knocking down walls and barriers here, some coming in by air with powered parachutes, some by boats going around here. This was something again, that indicated it was a very planned attack. And soon, you saw people with rocket launchers and rifles running in the streets.

If there was a dream or an illusion that the Palestinian issue can be ignored, I think the events of today prove that it can't be ignored, and can't be overlooked. And then something must be done in order to deal with the Palestinians, not with Hamas.We have to fight Hamas, but we have to reach out for the Palestinian Authority. We have to speak with those who are capable and are interested and perhaps may be ready to speak with us, which we didn't do up until now for many years already. And this is a tragic mistake. Now, we'll have to do it. We'll have to reach out for Abu Mazen and we'll have to fight the Hamas.",
