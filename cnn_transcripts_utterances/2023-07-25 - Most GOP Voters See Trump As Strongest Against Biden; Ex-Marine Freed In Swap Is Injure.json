Yet the most Republican voters now still think that Donald Trump is the party's best chance to beat President Biden. So, here are some of the takeaways from a brand new poll from Monmouth. Trump is still far ahead of his rivals. While it's early, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the rest of the field, they're essentially flat. They've been unable to gain any traction in this race. But here are the most interesting parts of all of these new numbers. Nearly 70 percent of Republican voters believe that Trump is the strongest candidate to beat Biden, and nearly 70 percent aren't concerned at all that the criminal indictments that he faces make him a weaker candidate. So, it's perhaps no surprise that since many of Trump's rivals spent the last few years building him up, the those numbers aren't likely to change. And they also aren't likely to make Senator Mitt Romney happy. He's doubling down tonight on his calls for lower tier candidates to get out of the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): I think Donald Trump is likely to be the Republican nominee, but I'm confident he will assuredly be the Republican nominee if it doesn't become a two-person race.",

He's also struggled with how he's going to take on Trump or how strongly he's going to take on Trump. That's something he is still wrestling with.Now, his campaign is promising a reboot and a new campaign, not totally uncommon to see those sorts of resets, especially in the summertime around this time.

But there is a realization starting to set in among Republicans that they're probably only going to have both the time and the political capital to do one impeachment.

So, that explains some of it. Also, listen, it doesn't matter what Americans were doing to get themselves into a troubling situation. We don't leave Americans behind. So, we always looked at cases at the State Department, and I've served in multiple administrations, in Barack Obama's administration, I was his attache, treasury attache in Saudi Arabia. And so when you're in these embassies, when you're in the State Department, it doesn't matter the administration, Abby, or what the individual did, we don't leave Americans behind. So, I'm confident that they are trying to do everything they can in this situation to get him the care he needs. Listen, he was held captive for three years.

But underneath it all, there is a deep insecurity that has to lie in these leaders to engage in this type of behavior, Abby. I see a lot of insecurity in their regimes. Remember, it wasn't long ago, it was just a couple of months ago that Putin and Xi Jinping stood before the world. And what did Xi Jinping say? And I'm paraphrasing this, Abby. He said that there was a no limits partnership between himself and Putin. And he said that the world was going to see a change in the world order that it had not seen in 100 years. So, instead of that actually happening, you see these weird attempts by Prigozhin in Russia. You see the foreign minister now just being wiped off like he never existed in China.

We think back to Hank Gathers, who began his collegiate career at USC, ironically, but then wound up with Loyola Marimount, and he was destined for NBA stardom. He collapsed in a game about two months before a second collapse led to his death on the court. Then you had Reggie Lewis of the Celtics in the midst of a fine NBA career, who collapsed and died during an off-season practice and he was only 27. Hank Gathers was 23. But as it turns out, both had pre-existing conditions that contributed to it. We don't know yet what the case is with Bronny.And even though it's fresh in people's minds, Damar Hamlin's situation in the football game between the Bills and the Bengals several months ago was an entirely different thing. That's Commotio Cordis, which is caused by a collision, some kind of contact to the chest at the exact wrong millisecond, and it disrupts the heart's electrical cycle. So, these are entirely different situations. But earlier tonight, I heard Dr. Reinhardt, and certainly his expertise exceeds mine thousands of times over, tell Anderson Cooper that it's probably not a good idea for somebody, if they have a pre- existing condition like this, that would predispose them to these sorts of episodes to play basketball at the NBA level with all of its physical demands.

The great Hank Aaron died about two weeks shy of his 87th birthday,and he had other medical conditions. He had been vaccinated. And I remember all the talk from certain precincts. Well, if he hadn't been vaccinated, he'd still be with us. You know, we live in a world now where anything you don't want to be true doesn't have to be true with a mountain of evidence and a choir of angels attesting to it. And anything you do want to be true, well, you don't need all that much evidence. Or you can say, I did my own research, which often means, not always, but often means you discounted everything that didn't match what you wanted to believe in the first place until you found something, supported it and there it is.

Now, this comes just weeks after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions.I want to bring in CNN's Chief Legal Analyst, Laura Coates. So, Laura, this lawsuit alleges that the students who receive this kind of preferential treatment are overwhelmingly white. They make up as much as 15 percent of Harvard's admitted students. And that's actually almost the same percentage of African-American students that Harvard admits. Are you surprised that it's even taken this long for us to get to this point?",

And so, many believe this to be a kind of a proxy for discrimination, as an advantage given to those who have had parents who have attended the university or otherwise, or grandparents and beyond.And it can trace back just maybe one generation to know how our society has been with discrimination. And so, this came up, of course, in consideration of the latest Supreme Court rulings about why it was that race-based or race-conscious admissions was under the gun, but not legacy, which had perhaps an even more greater impact on what was happening in admissions.",
