      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up. As a ceasefire deal stalls and fearsof an Israeli incursion heighten in Rafah, I speak to journalist Amos Harel. Then 11 years old and almost no family left. Correspondent Jomana Karadsheh meets orphans from Gaza facing a painful new reality. And UNICEF spokesperson James Elder joins me. Plus, Trump on trial. As Stormy Daniels takes the witness stand, we bring you the latest. And as Florida's six-week abortion ban takes effect, what does it mean for women there? I ask Planned Parenthood Dr. Chelsea Daniels. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour, who will be back next week. Well, hope turned to despair overnight in Gaza. What you're seeing now are celebrations that were held in Rafah after Hamas announced that they'd agreed to a ceasefire deal yesterday. But this moment was short lived. Israel soon announcing the terms of that deal didn't meet its demands and sending a delegation for further talks. This happens as the IDF is pushing into parts of Rafah, warning civilians to leave east of the area and taking control of the Gazan side of the Rafah Crossing into Egypt. Visiting border -- visiting troops near the border, the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said this operation will continue until Hamas is eliminated or hostages begin being returned. Meantime, Palestinians say more than 20 people were killed in overnight strikes, including six children. And many of Israel's allies and the United Nations are urging the nation to avoid a ground invasion. Joining me now on this is Amos Harel, long time military correspondent and defense analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Amos. It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. You heard the comments there earlier from Defense Minister Gallant, where he said the operation in Gaza will continue until either Hamas is eliminated or the first hostage is returned, and that seems to be supported by your analysis where you say the IDF's move thus must be seen as part of the ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release. Do you think the IDF's actions going in to Rafah right now is limited as this incursion may be will actually put more pressure and ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to finally agree to a deal or do you think there's a greater risk of sabotaging it?",

      "sentences": "I'm pretty sure that this is the intention. I think the scope of the operation has notbeen decided yet, and it will depend on what happens on the field. This is a rather limited operation. There are two Israeli brigades operating there since yesterday evening, they have moved ahead about two miles into Palestinian territory on a specific narrow corridor, which is called the Philadelphi Corridor and is on the border of Egypt. And they haven't taken full control of the corridor, just the first part of it. They haven't moved into the city of Rafah itself. So, this, to me, seems yet as a more of an Israeli threat, a military threat, but not the beginning of a major incursion. It will depend on what happens in Cairo. There is an Israeli delegation there discussing with the mediators, with the Qataris and the Americans and, of course, the Egyptians the outcome of a possible deal.",

I think the main issues where the sites have not reached an agreement yet have to do, as you said, with the outcome ofthe war will be deal itself lead to a full-scale ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. This is the main issue for Hamas, of course, because it would mean Hamas' continued survival. This is the big deal for Yahya Sinwar, the leader in Gaza. For the Israelis, and especially for Prime Minister Netanyahu, this could be quite an embarrassment because it would mean that we have not reached the pronounced goals of the operation after the horrific massacre of October 7th. Netanyahu announced that he was going to bring the hostages back, but also that he was going to annihilate the Hamas regime. This hasn't happened. And if he signs a deal now, it would mean he has to admit that he didn't achieve that goal. One more important point I think we should make has to do with the number of hostages being returned on the first stage of the deal. The number discussed is 33, but Hamas has been sending signals that it cannot actually reach the quota of 33 live hostages, and it might want to bring back some bodies of hostages that were either killed on October 7th or died while being in a Hamas captivity. This is something that the Israelis could not live with, especially because Hamas refuses to release the full details about what happened to those hostages, and this could be a major obstacle reaching a deal.",

It does seem like he's inclined to deny this deal as it's staged for a number ofreasons, perhaps his own political future and concern about his coalition and how some of the far-right members of his coalition will react to this. That having been said, some members of his war cabinet, including those from the opposition, and that is Gadi Eisenkot and Benny Gantz, have said from day one that the sole issue for them and that will keep them in this coalition right now is the priority being the return of the hostages. Have we reached a point where they are either left with not living up to their words, or do you think there will come a point imminently where they will be forced to leave?",

Benjamin's (ph) party and Bezalel Smotrich's party. On the other hand, Gantz and Eisenkot who are on the left side or the center side of the government do not seem too keen on leaving the government while the crisis is still ongoing. And they claim that in a number of occasions since the war began, they actually helped restrain some of the more dangerous trends among Israeli decision makers. And yet, especially Gadi Eisenkot who lost his son, Gal, during the war while fighting for the release of the hostages, feels a huge moral obligation to the families of the Israeli hostages. So, my guess is that if this does not move forward in the next month or so, and if Eisenkot believed that Netanyahu is to blame and not only Hamas, Eisenkot may decide to resign, may decide to leave the government and he could even force Gantz, his partner, to leave along with him.",

When Israeli politicians began mentioningthe possibility of pushing Gaza refugees towards Sinai, towards Egyptian territory, everybody from General Sisi to his ministers warned Israel publicly not to even think of going in that direction. However, my sense is that in recent weeks, there has been a more tight coordination and a better understanding between the Israelis and the Egyptians regarding Israel's actions. I don't think the Egyptians were surprised by what happened last night by the fact that the Israelis went into the Philadelphi Corridor and decided to take control of the Rafah Crossing. As long as this doesn't spill over, as you have described it, as long as there are not tens of thousands of Palestinians refugees storming into Sinai, I think the Egyptians can live with that. And I think Israel has a point in blaming Egypt for some of what has happened, because for years and years and years while Egypt declared itself as an ally and more or less of a friend to Israel, in spite of the disagreements over the Palestinian conflict, that in reality, the Egyptians were turning a blind eye to the fact that Palestinians, especially Hamas were smuggling thousands and thousands of weapons, rockets, mortar bombs rifles, anything you can think of through that same Philadelphi Corridor without Egypt actually intervening. And this is a very difficult point that the Israelis keep making. And I think that, in a way, the Egyptians should help correct that situation, considering what everything that has happened.",

You said, accepting the deal will not be an Israeli victory or a Hamas capitulation, but an Israeli recognition of the limits of power.

We have tried to correct that from our point of view. The IDF was quite successful at defeating Hamas brigades and battalions in the northern part and the central part of the Gaza Strip. But for the time being, it seems that it will take a very, very long time until we are able to defeat Hamas completely on the battlefield, and you can never defeat or annihilate completely an idea. And Hamas is about an ideology, a doctrine, a very aggressive ideology towards Israel. But this is not something that we can solve on our own quickly. So, under these circumstances, I think there's -- there are benefits in moving towards a deal, even if we don't reach a final victory over Hamas as Netanyahu keeps promising his political base. Will that actually happen in the next few weeks? I really hope and pray that this does happen because, especially, I think from an Israeli perspective, more than anything else I'm worried about the hostages lives and about the possibility of more Israeli lives lost. But I think that if the war goes on for a long time, it will create a huge international crisis for Israel. And this is something that we need to correct. On the other hand, I'm not so sure that Hamas would play along since it has been so cynical about the whole crisis.",

Firstly, it's the -- it attacks all the senses, when you see, it's the smell, Bianna, a child burning flesh is something that doesn't really leave and broken bones. It looks like these little boys and girls have been broken and badly put together. And then, of course, shrapnel. Shrapnel is designed to rip through concrete. It does horrendous things to a child's body. And I can't tell you how many times I was in a hospital seeing a child in surgery only to have an adult whisper, well, they also -- they don't know yet that their entire family was killed in this strike. I thought that's something I would never hear. It's now -- it's almost commonplace. In the same way, Bianna, there that that little girl, Darin, spoke of trying to, you know, keep picturing her parents and remembering to make a phone call, I spoke to a little boy, Omar, who lost his twin brother and his parents in a blast. And as I sat and spoke with him, he was very silent, but we spent time together. He just continually would shut his eyes. He'd close his eyes all the time. And I asked his auntie, why, why does Omar do this? And she said, he's just terrified of losing the image of his parents in the same way he's lost them here on earth.

The IDF saying they're doing all they can to drop leaflets, to warn people ahead of time to leave, that they're not targeting civilians, but it is very perilous and very difficult to get all of these people to move.

It's a population density twice that of New York City with no high- rises. This is people in tents who seven months ago were in family homes, three bedroom, four bedrooms, homes done like everyone around the world, save and put your money into brick and mortar. That's rubble. So, they live in that environment now. And the idea that they have to move somewhere in Mawasi is sand. It will be twice the population density again. We've seen the systematic devastation of the health system. So, they will move to a place with no hospitals at a time where children need healthcare more than ever before, Bianna, there. They simply won't have it. The European hospital is very near this area under fire right now, so named, because of the European donors that that put money into it. So, the safe zones and so on, it's very important we look at that because safety has a legal term as well. Safety is not just not to be bombarded, although that has sadly happened, safety must also mean sufficient food, water, medicines, shelter to keep someone alive. The areas they go to, I know these areas, it's just not there. Right now, in Rafah, it's one shower for three and a half thousand people, Bianna. So, you know, a 70-year-old woman, a pregnant mom, a teenage girl, they queue all day, maybe they get a shower. It is much worse in Mawasi. So, it doesn't have those qualities that make it truly legally and ethically safe. And at the same time, it's been bombed. I mean, we know of a little boy UNICEF spoke to, Mustafa (ph), or we encountered in an ICU. Mustafa (ph) was in our Al-Mawasi. He was in that safe zone. He was going to get some parsley for his family's dinner and he was shot in the head. Mustafa, like many others, is now -- is no longer with us. These safe zones is a very dangerous narrative.

So, here we are one week into this new law, and it's important to highlight just how draconian Florida's abortion laws have become since the overturning of Roe, because not so long ago, they were at 24 weeks and that went to 15 weeks, and then here we are at six weeks. It's a large state that typically performed, I think, about 80,000 abortions a year. That accounts for one in 12 abortions nationwide. I know we're just one week in, but give us a sense of what you've seen and what's happened in that state in those few days. DR. CHELSEA DANIELS, FLORIDA ABORTION PROVIDER: Yes. Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me on to discuss this. I cannot overstate the importance of having these conversations, because you said it, these laws are draconian and they are being imposed on patients and on communities by people who are not medical providers and do not have the medical or scientific background to be making these kinds of decisions on behalf of patients. What I have seen in the past week is terror and confusion and anger, all as patients are trying to access basic essential health care. We are unfortunately having to redirect dozens of patients.

Give us just any anecdotes that you can of what this experience is like, the real impractical, you know, ability for women to be able to go from Florida to North Carolina to get medical treatment. DR. DANIELS: Yes, absolutely, I think that that's a really good point you make. Florida is geographically isolated. So, to get to the next nearest state where care is available, that's North Carolina. And that's about a 15-hour drive. And North Carolina has a 72-hour waiting period and only provides care to 12 weeks. So, this is not an easy ask for patients. I see -- I saw a patient just yesterday, who was about eight weeks pregnant, was in a state of shock. She just -- she only had just found out that she was pregnant. She wanted us to remeasure and remeasure because she was like, I can't leave. I can't take off work. I have a newborn at home. I don't have the days off. I don't have the ability to get myself to North Carolina. What can I do? And we have resources and funds for her. But we can't ask her employer to give the days off work.

We have them under any kind of abortion ban because we know that all abortion restrictions do is marginalize or mis marginalized and make it more difficult to access what is basic essential health care.

Because we also have to remind people that it's not just women who are seeking to terminate. Some of these women just can't and they're facing challenges or health issues. What bind does that put hospitals and doctors like yourself in? DR. DANIELS: Yes, that's a great point too. And this is something we've seen play out in Florida already under a 15-week ban and we've seen play out across the country in places where there are restrictions. Anytime we put restrictions on abortion, restrictions on essential basic health care, and these restrictions are written by non-medical providers, it makes it impossible for a medical provider, such as myself to interpret the language and to try to balance, OK, on the one side, I know what is medically and clinically indicated. But on the other side, I have legal language that I am struggling to interpret that is trying to govern my care. And I think what we see is that that leads to devastating outcomes for patients. There are countless stories of patients being turned away for a medically indicated abortion procedure because doctors and hospitals and institutions are too fearful to act because of these draconian and murky laws. And I -- so I think we know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that what has played out in other states is going to play out in Florida and has already played out. I think we've all heard of the patient, Anya Cook, who had her water broke early in pregnancy and she -- until she was hemorrhaging and on the brink of death from infection, she was denied care.",

Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust, it didn't end with the Holocaust either, or after -- even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world, and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness. That hatred was brought to life on October 7th in 2023, on a sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. That's why I'm calling on all Americans to stand united against antisemitism and hate in all its forms. My dear friend, and he became a friend, the late Elie Wiesel said, \"One person of integrity can make a difference.\" We have to remember that, now more than ever. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I knew one day I will have to write and I didn't find the words. I was afraid that I will not find them. I'm not even sure by the way that I did find them. Maybe there are no words for what happened. Maybe somehow, the Germans, which means the cruel killers, have succeeded at least in one way, that means they deprived us, the victims, of finding the proper language of saying what they have done to us. Because there are no words for it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
