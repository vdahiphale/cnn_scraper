      "sentences": "Good evening.We begin tonight with breaking news. Tonight, for the first time, attorneys for Hunter Biden have publicly acknowledged that it was his personal data on a laptop that was left at a Delaware repair shop. It may also be a sign they are going on the offensive. As you know, the laptop has become the focus of President Biden's political opponents, the source of embarrassing allegations about his son's personal affairs, as well as a figurative side dish to a main course of what could be serious legal trouble for the younger Biden. In a moment, the potential legal and political fallout. First the news itself and CNN's Jessica Schneider. So for years now, Republicans have been going off about this laptop and Hunter Biden never publicly acknowledged that it was his. Why is he taking legal steps now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, they are really ramping up their approach here, Anderson, and it's really coming at the same time that they're girding themselves for this real fight with Congressional Republicans.So what they're doing tonight, they're fighting back against a number of people they say allegedly got into Hunter Biden's laptop that was left at that Delaware computer repair shop, and they are fighting back against the people who allegedly disseminated the contents of that laptop because these were contents that contained business documents, e-mails, and photos, and even some potentially salacious materials, all purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. So what Biden's team is saying is that this was all weaponized against Hunter Biden, and in turn his father, all in the lead up to the 2020 election. So tonight, what they are asking for is they are pushing for the Delaware State Attorney General, also the Justice Department to investigate and bring criminal charges against everyone they say was allegedly involved in going into the laptop and then disseminating all of this information. So this is what Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell is now saying. He is saying: \"This failed dirty political trick directly resulted in the exposure, exploitation, and manipulation of Mr. Biden's private and personal information. Mr. Mac Isaac's (he is the repair shop owner) intentional, reckless, and unlawful conduct allowed for hundreds of gigabytes of Mr. Biden's personal data without any discretion to be circulated around the internet.\" And Anderson, this aggressive approach, it really does signal what is a significant change in strategy from Hunter Biden. He has brought in new lawyers to help him defend him from this attack from Republicans -- House Republicans. House Republicans are probing Hunter Biden's business dealings. So now they're fighting back on this laptop issue. And of course, at the same time, Anderson, Hunter Biden is facing this ongoing, unrelated Federal criminal investigation into his taxes and also possible false statements while making a gun purchase. So a lot ramping up when it comes to his legal team.",

They wanted him to keep a more low profile. And I think that gets to the reality here. The President is deeply protective of his son, very empathetic to the recovery from substance abuse that he has pursued over the course of the last several years and obviously remains close and speaks often to his son. However, when it comes to White House officials, they make clear to the extent they can have bright lines, even if that means trying to craft agreements to ensure that there is separation between Hunter Biden's legal issues and the White House, that is where they weigh in.",

So you have Hunter Biden's lawyers bringing these claims to the relevant law enforcement, the heads of the relevant law enforcement agencies here, both the Department of Justice in the National Security Division, and in the State of Delaware, saying, hey, our client has been victimized by this trafficking of his material without his consent. This may have been, you know, exceeding the authorization that the repair shop had to access his files. He certainly didn't have his permission to share this information with anybody else, and you need to get involved and investigate what's happened to our client.

It's basically the Freedom Caucus, and a few others. This is, you know, political gold within the right-wing. This is what you need to lead on if you want to win a primary. But many in the GOP have long ago given up trying to, you know, attract the middle or trying to even win over some Democrats. I don't think it's going to change their fervency in doing this. It is not going to change the fact that that will be pretty much the sole focus of the oversight in the new weaponization committee. And quite honestly, I don't think it's going to move the needle one way or another. I don't think anybody is going to vote Republican that didn't or wouldn't have because of Hunter Biden's laptop. I mean, Hunter Biden is not the President of the United States, Hunter Biden is not a US senator or congressman, he is a private citizen.

We know that the FBI went and seized it from the computer shop operator with a subpoena, which they brought likely would have needed a search warrant to actually look at the thing. It's a little bit confusing to me as to how they would have predicated even a request for a search warrant. But nevertheless, this is Hunter Biden going on offense and saying, hey, I'm tired of being the target of all these attacks. In fact, I've been the victim.

There is no difference in having stolen the data. I mean, a computer shop owner, who Hunter Biden gave a laptop to, to fix, who stole his data, which to me has been incredible from the very beginning like that has not been a bigger story.
