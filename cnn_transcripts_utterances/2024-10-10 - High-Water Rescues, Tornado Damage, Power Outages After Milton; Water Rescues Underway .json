At least four people have been confirmed to be killed and that is what is happening on the eastern coast of Florida.Along the western coast of Florida where Hurricane Milton first made landfall, water rescues we've been watching them happen all throughout the morning. Now, Hurricane Milton is heading offshore, which also now means the work to fully assess the damage left behind is getting underway. Officials are right now urging people still to stay put and stay safe if they are safe, especially, of course. They say they need people off the roads right now. So first responders can get out there, clear roads and do these assessments to kind of get a true view of the scope of what they're up against now. Moments ago, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis gave this update. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: We will better understand the extent of the damage as the day progresses and you have people that are out there assessing damage right now. First responders have been working all through the night to help people who are in distress. And what we can say is the storm was significant, but thankfully, this was not the worst case scenario.

We are in a neighborhood just south of downtown Fort Myers where we spent all of yesterday and we saw some of the 3 to 4 feet of flooding there.This home here behind me, we believe, is one of the homes in this neighborhood that was hit by this tornado. The folks out here tell me that the wind yesterday really picked up at one point in the afternoon and that when they looked outside of their window, all they could see was what they thought was a tornado. You can see a good part of this roof is gone. It's a little bit difficult to make -- to see inside the actual house, but we did see someone walking in earlier today. You can see some of the debris that covers the front yard of this house here. This belongs to some sort of business. So it's not even from this area. And then if we go across the street, I'll show you one other house here because the guy that owns this house, he was on the roof just a few minutes ago, taking a look at the damage to his house. He said, look, we put up all this plywood yesterday, all in an effort to try to protect our house and the water and the rain, all of that damaged by this tornado. And so you can see what the folks out here are dealing with this morning. Kate, I cannot hear you right now. So that's the situation from here in Fort Myers. I know we've been reporting all morning long about the impact of this hurricane outside of the, you know, the gulf coast of Florida, the west coast of Florida, particularly when we're talking about these tornadoes. I mean, we had at least four that were confirmed. We know one out in the western part of Broward County, another one up in Clewiston which is right where Lake Okeechobee is. And then again, these two other tornadoes that the folks out here are pretty certain is what caused all of this damage. Kate?",

People woke up and were suddenly blindsided by this flooding. That's what he told me. I don't believe that this is an area that would normally experience something of this nature. When I was over in Plant City, folks who were stuck at a Holiday Inn over there, they told me they woke up and suddenly they were sloshing their feet on the ground floor there of the hotel.So they weren't expecting that. These were people who did, you know, everything right. They were not in evacuation zone A or B. They were further inland, never anticipating the flooding to reach them. And suddenly, they have found themselves in this situation. Now, with these cars, I'm with you, John. I don't know, you know, what led to this situation. If, you know, suddenly they saw the waters rise and they didn't listen to that old, you know, saying of turn around, don't drown. What happened here with these cars? I don't know. I'm supposed to meet with Sheriff Chad Chronister here shortly.
