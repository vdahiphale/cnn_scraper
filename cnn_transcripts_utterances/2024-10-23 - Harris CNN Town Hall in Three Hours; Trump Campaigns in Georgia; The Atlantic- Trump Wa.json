That could be the key to this election. This is going to be very interesting because during her fairly short campaign, Kamala Harris has not often taken direct questions from voters, especially on television and we've seen in some of her past interviews she has stumbled, she's got caught up on policy issues, offered Trump something that he could exploit. So, it's going to be very interesting to see how she responds to this. Having said that, the more interviews she does, the better she actually gets at this. So, I think we're going to see her talk autocracy and groceries, she'll definitely refer to the scandal that's blown up in the last few days over Trump's comments about the generals, but she has to address the things that people really care about.

We saw Liz Cheney, the former Republican congressman, campaigning with Harris, talking to Republican women specifically in those suburban areas, saying that they really need to vote even if they disagree with Harris on fundamental ideological issues. But can you imagine another country, another election, another political figure when the former top aide to that person comes out and effectively says he's a fascist, he admires some of the things about Hitler, and we're still asking whether that's going to affect the result of an election?

Ukraine is where South Korean intelligence says these soldiers are going. 1,500 now, as many as 12,000 could be deployed, South Korean media says. Some seen here, supposedly just days ago, getting their Russian military uniforms. The audio muffled, the language sounds like Korean.

Will, a fascinating report. 3,000 troops feels, in some way, symbolic, but when you start to talk about12,000 troops that the South Koreans are suggesting, 10,000 that we heard the Ukrainian president suggest there, then you start to talk about it having a dramatic impact, a truly dramatic impact if they end up on the battlefield. RIPLEY (on camera):  And the troops are one thing, but we know, Julia, that North Korean weapons, as you just saw, have also ended up on the battlefield. And so, what South Korea is concerned about here is that Russia may be sharing weapons technology with North Korea, and the North Koreans might be getting real-time battle data about these weapons that they've been selling to Russia now for well over a year, according to the U.S., South Korea, and others even though these two countries, despite the video evidence and satellite images, have continued to deny it. It certainly is an interesting moment here because South Korea now saying that they are considering a reciprocal response, whether it be diplomatic, economic, or even military actions. So, you could have a situation where now Seoul, which is one of the world's largest arms suppliers itself, it has held off on supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine for use against Russia. But now, they're saying, in Seoul, that lethal weapons are back on the table. So, you can imagine this scenario where you might actually have South Korean military personnel, you know, doing reconnaissance in the region. South Korean weapons being used and the North Korean troops and weapons on the other side. I mean, some are almost comparing this to a mini proxy war, if you will, from the Korean peninsula now to Europe and the frontlines of Ukraine. It is really quite an alarming development. And of course, analysts also saying that the lessons that Kim Jong Un could learn from Vladimir Putin's operation in Ukraine if, in the end, Putin is able to seize some territory at all of this, which of course, the U.S., Kyiv, you know, they've said that they're going to try to do everything to stop that. But if Putin is successful in the end, that sends a very strong message to Kim Jong Un when it comes to his own, you know, simmering and, in fact, even exploding confrontations with South Korea because Kim's been busy blowing up bridges and rail links with the South. He's basically listed South Korea as enemy number one, very paranoid right now, as you heard that analyst say, with those leaflets that were dropped on the North Korean capital, very close to these elite neighborhoods. So, it's a really pretty quickly ratcheting up situation. And then, of course, the other of course, country watching all of this very closely, Julia, would be China, and Chinese President Xi Jinping to see how all of this is playing out.",

More importantly is the fact that they guided to vehicle deliveries up slightly for this year, but 20 to 30 percent growth for 2025 with these new low-cost vehicles coming onto the market.

And so, that tells you how much pressure the current administration has put on him, which is also driven his political views to some extent, and you can't blame him. And so, I think if you have a change in administration, that's going to help tech stocks in general, because don't forget, pretty much all of the Magnificent Seven are getting sued for something by the Justice Department of the FTC. And obviously, Republicans are a lot more for, you know, lot less regulation, and that will help other sectors as well, such as banks, for example. So, this election is likely to be -- right now, if you look at the way stocks are acting, things like bank stocks, et cetera, they're discounting, a switch to more of a Republican led government, whether you, you know, like it or not, or believe it or not, that's what the stock market is discounting. So, if you end up with, you know, a disappointment in that front, Tesla stock will probably, you know, go down initially. But I think over the long run, it really doesn't matter, you know, who becomes president, because if you look at, you know, periods of time it shrugs that stuff off pretty quickly, and then you go back to fundamentals of how's the economy, wherever interest rates, where's inflation, and that's what you start to focus.",

Famine was declared in the Zamzam Camp for displaced people just outside of the besiege City of Al Fashur in Darfur back in August. It's the first time a famine has been declared in four years, and this is a manmade famine. So, we were really determined to try to get as close as we could to that story, to Darfur, where I must say, almost no international journalists have been able to get to, not for lack of trying, but simply because the two main warring factions have not allowed journalists access to Darfur. Our goal was to get to Tawila, as you mentioned, which is controlled by a neutral group known as the SLM, the Sudan Liberation Movement.

This is a challenge which can be addressed. If I have to think of it together with climate change and the loss of biodiversity, water should be low hanging fruit because the technologies exist -- the, we know what the policies required are, although by -- in large part, they have not been put into place. And we know that there's entrepreneurship and capital waiting on the side. So, we've got to bring that together, bring technology, entrepreneurship, and policymaking together to solve this crisis. And by solving water, we'll be helping to solve for climate change at this moment.",

So, we've got to value water. And the very few countries that currently price water properly and then subsidize the poor, subsidize small folder farmers, subsidize those who won't be able to afford the full price. It can be done. Singapore does it, a few countries in the developing world do it, from Chile to Kenya. A few of the advanced countries do it. But by and large, water is being grossly underpriced around the world. And that encourages its profligate use its waste. And most importantly, if you don't price water, you don't provide an incentive for innovation either. And innovation is half -- is the better half of the story. The first half is about the challenge, the scarcity, the droughts, the floods. The second half is innovation. You might have to also use the revenues you get to subsidize innovations because innovations, at the early stage, don't yet have the scale to bring costs down and make them competitive with the legacy systems. It's the same thing with climate change. If you want green technologies to be more widely used, we need scale. And that's why it needs both the public and private sector to be part of this.",

You've subsidized water saving technologies. I think two-thirds now Singapore's surface area is used for water storage. It works, to your point, if we go back to the money at the core of this for a richer nation, how do we scale this and create some degree of balance between richer nations and poorer nations?",

Some of the best examples come from the developing world, but they can be scaled up. They can be scaled up so as to may be made affordable everywhere in the world, including by small farmers, not just the largest. We know of new seed varieties, for instance, for rice. Rice cultivation, as we've known it for hundreds of years, has to change. You can no longer cultivate rice by simply flooding the fields. And we've got to also think very hard about switching crops and switching our diets, because we cannot reach net zero and we cannot achieve a water sustainable water ecosystem without shifting our diets. We've got to progressively reduce the share of our diets that is animal-based towards plant-based, fermentation-based, and all the other interesting ways in which alternative proteins are being developed.",

But Erling Haaland, we all know, he's kind of a freak of nature. So, we shouldn't be surprised when he's able to do things like this. But look at this, the ball was -- well, it was kind of too low for a header, too high for a volley. It was behind him as well but somehow, he kind of like pulled off this aerial back heel to put it into the back of the net. And, you know, even he afterwards looked a bit kind of sheepish, almost like, like I don't know how I do it, you know. But of course, nobody's really surprised. Just absolutely amazing. There are some kinds of goals that are unusual and quirky that have nicknames. So, we talk about an Olimpico if it's scored direct from a corner. A Panenka is an audacious penalty or a Rabona is a very, very creative and theatrical goal. I don't think we've got a nickname for something like this, Julia. So, I mean, maybe they'll call it an Earling or a Haaland. But just such a cool moment. Of course, as you say, a 5-nil win. He scored two. He's now scored 13 goals in 12 games again this season. So, Erling Haaland doing absolutely brilliantly. And by the way, this marked the 26th consecutive game that Manchester City had not lost a game in the Champions League. That is a new record. Guess who they were tied with on 25? Their local rivals, Manchester United. So, yet again, Manchester United have one more reason to hate the blue half of the city, just all in all, a great night for City and Earling Haaland.",
