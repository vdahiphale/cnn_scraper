Meters away, the alleged shooter immediately pounced on by the police, pinned down and arrested. Fico was initially rushed to a local hospital where a spokesperson said he was conscious. His life functions stabilized before being rushed by helicopter to another hospital about 30 kilometers away for higher level care. Fico's office says he is now in a life-threatening condition, warning that the hours after the attack would be decisive. The shooting occurred after a government meeting in Handlova, two hours' drive from the capital. This eyewitness says she was there to meet the prime minister, detailing there were no police checks for those waiting to shake his hand. But first, she thought someone had set off firecrackers.

It's very important that the state functions that President Caputova, who is from the other political camp, also called this an attack on democracy because Robert Fico was elected Prime Minister.

So, not only will that CNN debate at the studios in Atlanta not feature an audience, but the debate hosted at ABC News' studios in September will also not have an audience. It's important to note the dates that these are taking place because the campaigns and their discussions over the last few weeks have essentially suggested that there need to be an opportunity for the American people to hear from these candidates before early voting starts. And in some critical battleground states, mail in voting begins before that early September debate that will be hosted by ABC News. Now, despite the fact that Biden and Trump do not agree on much, if anything, the campaigns did agree on these two dates. Though notably, despite President Biden's jabs, they will be taking place once President Trump's trial has concluded. Certainly, both candidates are fundraising already off the back of these conversations, these high stakes match-ups taking place. And they have been both saying generally in recent weeks that they would be happy to debate each other multiple times. But now these firm details have actually come together. But there is still some that they disagree about. President Trump suggesting that he had accepted the invitation to a third debate, one hosted by Fox News in October, to which the Biden campaign accused Trump of playing games. Saying that there would be only two debates that would be happening. Certainly, normally, traditionally, here in the United States, these debates are hosted by or sanctioned by the official nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates that was established in 1997 to establish the parameters around these conversations. But the negotiated details of these two events that have now been put on the calendar happened outside of the commission and its rules. There's a statement from the commission now saying that it is prepared to host debates on dates chosen to accommodate early voters at locations of higher learning, and that the commission continues to be ready to execute this plan. Although, Isa, it does not appear at this moment, at least, that there is a plan to proceed with a commission sanctioned debate, although that could, of course, change.",
