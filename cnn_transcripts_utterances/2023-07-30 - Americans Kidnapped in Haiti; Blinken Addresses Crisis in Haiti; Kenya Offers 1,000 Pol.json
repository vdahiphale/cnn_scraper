An American nurse and her child taken near the ministry where she worked.Back on the campaign trail, Donald Trump lashes out at President Biden and the Republicans who he says won't stand up to him. And Moscow under attack. Drones target Russia's capital as the country prepares to honor one branch of its military. At this hour, the U.S. is working to free an American nurse and her child who were kidnapped in Haiti. That's according to the Christian Humanitarian Aid Organization she worked for. She and her child were reportedly kidnapped Thursday morning near the Haitian capital, Port- au-Prince. Alix Dorsainvil is originally from New Hampshire. She moved to Haiti after her husband invited her to care for students at a Haitian school. Now, her husband is the director of the humanitarian organization and said his wife and child were taken while serving in their ministry. A statement says in part, Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our schools and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering. Now, the abduction came shortly after a warning by the State Department for Americans to leave Haiti. Just yesterday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken meantime had this to say about efforts to end the unrest there. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have very deep concern for the situation there, particularly with regard to violence and the activities of the gangs. We are, as I think as you know, the largest humanitarian donor to Haiti, but we are also very focused on working together with partners to try to help the Haitians restore security, restore stability. That really is the necessary foundation for being able to make progress on a political way forward as well as making sure that the humanitarian assistance can actually get to those in need. So, we've been very focused on trying to put in place what's necessary for a multinational force, including finding a lead nation to take this on. And my expectation is that we will have some progress to report on that very soon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We will continue to have more on that developing story. Now, the imminent threat of more criminal indictments doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump very much, at least not when he's campaigning, appearing in Erie, Pennsylvania on Saturday, the president -- the former president was defiant about the legal peril hanging over him and claimed it was because he is a threat to President Biden's re- election. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  These are vicious, bad people. As you know, Biden has ordered his top political opponent to be arrested. I've got to be arrested. They want to arrest me. That's only because we're winning. But now, the Biden administration is trying to make it illegal to even question the results or the outcome of an election.

They include Trump's alleged efforts to get employees to destroy security video at Mar-a-Lago and his mishandling of a sensitive military document regarding potential attack on Iran. Meantime, Former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent now serves as executive director of the Aspen Institute Congressional Program.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ASPEN INSTITUTE CONGRESSIONAL PROGRAM:  Well, as long as he has these legal storm clouds over his head, I think he's got real problems. You know, I get it in the primary among the base this is motivating a certain element of it and he's certainly doing well in the polls. But among the general electorate, particularly in a swing state like Pennsylvania, this is going to be devastating. Erie is one of two of six -- is one of two counties in Pennsylvania, there's 67 counties. But Erie and North Hampton counties are the two counties that went for Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and then Joe Biden. These are truly swing counties. So, he's there for a reason. But, again, Trump's legal problems and he's, you know, never ending looking backwards and grievance politics about what happened in the 2020 election I think are not going to help him in these swing states in marginal congressional districts. It's a real problem for the party. They all know it. They want him -- they Trump to go away, but these leading contenders against him are afraid to say anything to him because fearful of antagonizing his base, other than maybe except for Chris Christie, Will Hurd and Tim Hutchinson and a couple of others.

I want to bring you one more piece of video. This is dashcam footage that, again, shows a moment that this drone strike occurred near this shopping complex. Again, you can just see that blast, see that explosion, understand how much that can affect families, residents, civilians who are trying to keep this special military operation, as President Putin puts it away from their homes. And on a day like this, of course, Naval Day, and we are bringing those live images when Russia is trying to show through pomp and circumstance the power of its military might, the power of its naval forces. I can bet you Russian officials are ringing their hands a bit, hoping there's no other Ukrainian interferences by drone or otherwise during these celebrations. As you mentioned, President Putin is set to speak during this event. So, we'll see what he has to say. But it comes amid other very bold attacks by Ukrainian forces. I want to also mention the Chonhar Bridge attack that occurred just yesterday. This is a bridge that of we have the map to pull up is a bridge that connects Kherson, Russian-occupied Kherson, to Russian- occupied Crimea. A very vital supply route that allows Russian forces to send ammunitions, troops, weapons, supplies up to that long land bridge. Again struck, the second time in just about a month that it's been struck by Ukrainian forces in an attempt, of course, to choke out Russian troops on the battle field.",

MISCOVICH:  Well, OK, so that's a very, very good question. And here's the answer we need to look at. Number one, one of the contributing factors to the now rise this summer is the fact that there are so few people that have been vaccinated recently. If you look back when the bivalent was available back in the fall, that's already well over six months for the elderly, and a lot people haven't had vaccine in a year. Well, what do we know about the vaccines? They're great for the first four months, for every age group, and then they start to slack at six months. The older you get, the less effective the vaccine is. So, that's why we're seeing some hospitalizations increase and why we're going to see the people of all ages are going to be more likely to be able to get COVID because they're losing their immunity.",

We now know the FDA has approved, the production is starting, there will be the upgraded vaccination that will be focusing specifically on Omicron and it's going to drop the original component of the vaccine that was in the bivalent, which is what we want now. And that vaccine will be available in September, probably mid-to- latter at the latest, and there's going to be a massive push across the United States to get your flu shot and to get your COVID vaccine updated.

And it just kind of just continues and lingers at any age, it's not specific to elderly, it's a little more advanced in people that don't have up to date or no vaccine is more problematic. And the good news is I'm seeing it does improve slowly. We have some medications that we're using that have been approved in some trials.
