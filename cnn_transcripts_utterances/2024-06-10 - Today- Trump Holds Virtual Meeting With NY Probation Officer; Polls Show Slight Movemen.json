That is going to form really the report that is sent to Juan Merchan that could impact how Donald Trump is sentenced or what his punishment actually looks like. So, Donald Trump will be down in Mar-a-Lago. They're doing this virtually, sitting with his attorney Todd Blanche, talking to a probation officer in New York as they put together this report before that July 11 sentencing. Now, the rest of his day looks like kind of a campaign trail. He's going to be delivering remarks at the Danbury Institute event. Now this is a bar right Christian conservative group who one of their goals is to quote unquote, \"eradicate abortion completely.\" Now, I am told Donald Trump's remarks are very brief. They don't touch on abortion. They just talk about religious freedoms and freedom of the press. This is more of an introductory video. But that really goes to show you how Donald Trump still continues to try and walk this fine line, talking to these far-right Christian conservative groups about being anti-abortion, but not really talking about abortion and itself. We know he wants to take credit for it, while at the same time trying to distance himself from it. Now, this is a pivotal moment for the campaign. They are trying to separate the legal from the campaign. We saw him on the campaign trail in Las Vegas over the weekend, making promises to voters. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips -- people making tips. We're going to do that right away first thing in office because it's been a point of contention for years and years and years. And you do a great job of service. You take care of people.

Nice to see you all. Happy birthday, birthday boy. Yes, absolutely. And since you are the birthday boy, I'll start off with you.One of the things that was interesting in this is -- in this, these numbers is about why people are supporting Joe Biden? Why his supporters are moving in his direction increasingly? This is a shift between March and now about why they are backing Joe Biden. His supporters back then to oppose Trump 47 percent. That is a seven -- now its 54 percent. Is 7 percent uptick about why they are supporting Trump? Is that the Biden -- is not because they like him. In fact, he's down among voters as they like him. But it's because they are out -- because they're supporting -- they just want Trump to lose. Is that enough for Biden to win the election?",

But look the -- this is what the Biden campaign has been hoping for, for voters to sort of pay attention to the choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, as opposed to having this election be a referendum on the Biden policies.But as I travel across the country and talk to a lot of voters, it's still very much a mix. One thing is constant on both sides, the exhaustion and fatigue factor with both candidates. But as we head into the summer here, the Republican convention is next month, the Democratic one in August. People are realizing that, you know, this is the choice that they have. So that's I think explains some of the top line number there. But look, these are on the margins. These are effectively just slightly outside the margin of error. But we know that this is going to be a extraordinarily tight race. But that's what the Biden campaign. That's why the president is talking about these convictions. That's why he is sort of going hard after Trump. But voters that I talked to still talk more about the economy. They still talk more about immigration, inflation certainly. So, it's not clear that voters actually want either of Trump or Biden to be talking about each other's problems.",

But minor factor, some effects are about not a factory, you see 25 -- 25 percent.Trump's comments have not really moderate. He's sort of been always all over the place a little bit of during the primary.

He said this should be left up to the states.We're also hearing that message reflected and what Republicans are now saying on Capitol Hill in terms of what they're going to pursue legislatively. But this is a big political vulnerability for Republicans. And we're getting a sense of how Democrats are going to message on this as well, because of the Senate, they're having a number of show votes, trying to force Republicans to take tough positions on issues like contraception, access to IVF, all those things. So, it is clearly going to be a big issue, and none of the Republicans frankly haven't figured out how to talk about.",

I mean, since after the attacks on January 6, how far he's really bought into these far-right conspiracies and perpetuated them.I mean, there was a time in which he was saying, he wasn't involved. Now he's saying that he's going to pardon everyone who was involved in January 6. So no, that's not really the rhetoric that they want Trump focused on. They want him focus more on campaigning on issues, like the economy that we've talked about, like immigration. But this is something he's doing throwing red meat subbase. I will say on abortion. I know that we're not seeing him moderate, but he's really been saying the same thing. He is not going all in on abortion. He wants, as Mel said, the credit for overturning it, so that he continues to have his base. But he doesn't want to talk about abortion because he believes that it's not a political winner. And so, that's why you see him kind of dance around this because he wants to take the credit for it. But then he also wants to be more moderate on it, but you can't have both.",

We saw that -- I mean, Trump has made immigration a big part of his campaigns, even during the 2018 midterms, when he was warning of a migrant caravan that wasn't coming to the U.S. It didn't work, then it worked in 2016. I guess there are some Latinos at the margins that are particularly men that are starting to move a bit more towards him and it tends to be on the economy. There are even some Latinos who are much more democratic traditionally, that appear to be curious about Trump because of how they're feeling about the economy, despite the fact that there are a lot of good economic markers. So, President Biden, his campaign hasn't cut out for them. They can't win states like Arizona and Nevada without turning out Latinos in similar numbers. If they don't grow, they're white or their senior vote. So, if Trump siphons off and off at the margins, it could be a problem.",
