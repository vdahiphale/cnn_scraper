Trump is planning to name longtime loyalist and partisan firebrand Kash Patel to be his new FBI director. Patel's selection means Christopher Wray, the current FBI head, would need to be fired or step down. Trump appointed him Wray, as his FBI director back in 2017.Patel is a divisive figure who worked as a National Security official in Trump's first administration and has accused the so-called deep state of targeting Trump. It's a controversial pick that almost certainly sets up another potentially explosive confirmation battle in the U.S. Senate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Kash Patel's only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple. The Department of Justice and the FBI is supposed to be there to go after drug traffickers, gun smugglers, to go after corrupt Wall Street financiers. Instead, the Department of Justice is going to serve Donald Trump's political interests. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's now naming him as ambassador to France.Kash Patel was someone that Bill Barr essentially, you know, laid down in front of the tracks as attorney general to avoid his appointment to the FBI in Trump's first term. And now, you know, Trump is basically daring the Republican Senate to say no. I think all of these reflect the same, you know, really twin beliefs. One, as I said, is that he views the entirety of the federal government as a means to advance his personal interests. And he also believes that there will, you know, that there is not going to be the resistance he faced. You know intermittent as it was in his first term among elements of the Republican coalition. And so we will see, you know, what boundaries if any, the Senate is willing to put, you know, Matt Gaetz was too far. Will Tulsi Gabbard be too far? Will Robert F. Kennedy Jr. be too far? Would Patel be too far? I'm dubious that enough Republicans are going to say no to Patel, but perhaps on Gabbard or some of the others there may be, you know, some restraint.

A grinding fight.And although the government really appears to have been caught completely off guard here, and even its forces sort of appearing to pull out of Aleppo without putting up a big fight, the indications are that they will fight back for it. This is what President Bashar Al Assad has been saying today, that they will -- that they will launch an offensive. He's been meeting with the Iranian foreign minister inside of Syria. The Iranian foreign minister saying that he's there to give support. And you -- Syria's other big ally here would be Russia. And they've been having joint bombing strikes today in and around Aleppo, in other areas in the north of the country, trying to beat back the rebels. So, I think all the indications are there. One of the big questions you have to ask, and, obviously, the United States is asking itself this question, because the U.S. has forces inside of Syria, are those forces in danger? And is what the rebels are doing on the ground going to be good for U.S. policy towards Syria or not? Well, Jake Sullivan had this to say on that question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACOB SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: It's a complicated question, because the group at the vanguard of this rebel advance, HTS, is actually a terrorist organization designated by the United States. So, we have real concerns about the designs and objectives of that organization. At the same time, of course, we don't cry over the fact that the Assad government, backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, you know, are facing certain kinds of pressure.
