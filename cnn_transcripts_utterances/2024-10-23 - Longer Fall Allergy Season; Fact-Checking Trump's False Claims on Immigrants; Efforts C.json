And, indeed, the next day, I was -- had communications with the directors of the prison system who had no problem with this and were even discussing with me ways to make Robert feel comfortable, getting him street clothes he could wear. But I learned Saturday night through media that apparently he was going to come via Zoom, which would have been completely unworkable because of multiple factors, the most prominent which is that he has severe autism, which affects his ability to communicate. He has a speech impairment. And he has no experience with Zoom from his years of being in solitary confinement on death row.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  So the Border Patrol, because they have had it, they have never done this before, they released a list of criminals in our country. We have 13,099 exactly, 13 -- during their term, they tried to sell as over 40 years. No, this is during their 3.5 year that they have been there, 13,099 murderers, these are murderers.

It's been released repeatedly over the years. More significantly, Jim, it is not true that all of the people on this so-called ICE non-detained list are roaming free in the country. Many of the people with convictions on that list are currently incarcerated in state and federal prison serving their criminal sentences for those crimes like homicide. They're considered non- detained by ICE in particular because they're not currently in the custody of immigration authorities. And then, third, Trump keeps insisting that all of these people, 13,000-plus people with homicide convictions, came into the country under the Biden/Harris administration. That is just not true. This list is of people who entered the country over the course of decades, numerous administrations, including the Trump administration. The list grew under Trump. He says they say it's over 40 years. Well, who is they? The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement debunking such claims from Trump and others. They said -- quote -- \"The data in this letter,\" this letter from ICE, \"is being misinterpreted. The data goes back decades. It includes individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years or more.\" They went on to say: \"It also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal, state, or local law enforcement partners.\" So Trump has made clear he's aware of these fact-checks. He's just flatly dismissing them, but there's no basis for that.",

Then he said that the Congo is deliberately emptying its prisons to somehow send people to the border as migrants. Now we have the Congo supposedly driving, taking these people to the border. There is no evidence for any of that. So I reached out to the Trump campaign repeatedly. They have never been able to provide even a shred of corroboration for this claim that the Congo is emptying prisons for migration purposes. I have reached out to experts on both the Democratic Republic of Congo and the smaller neighboring country called the Republic of Congo to ask them if they have seen any evidence. They say they have seen absolutely none. And I managed to get comment from both countries. So, a spokesperson for the Democratic Republic of Congo said -- quote -- \"Everything he is saying isn't true.\" I also spoke to the ambassador for the Republic of Congo, who said there is no truth or any sign, nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement. So, again, you might say, well, of course, they defend their own countries, but the Trump campaign itself cannot corroborate this.",

Mandy from Atlanta wants to know, what is the best over-the-counter option for treating allergies like this? Your thoughts on fall allergies and what you can use to treat them? DR.

Kind of makes sense.In the past, you had antihistamines would often be quite sedating, things like Benadryl. These medications now are much better at being non-drowsy. They don't cross the blood-brain barrier as well. Couple quick points. Typically, you release the most histamine between 4:00 and 6:00 in the morning. It's what helps wake you up. That's why taking these medications the night before is probably a good idea. And you can really take them, Jim, throughout the season. I mean, when it comes to these medications, there's no problem in taking them regularly. There are some people who develop a lot of stuffiness, a lot of congestion. And in that case, there's the decongestant version of these as well. Those are ones that you should really only take kind of as needed. They have different side effects, including interfering with your sleep. They almost have like a caffeine-like side effect. So, when it comes to decongestant sprays, which are quite popular as well, they can be very effective. Don't take them for more than three days in a row. Again, it's because of these side effects, but lots of options out there. You just got to stay on top of it, not waiting for symptoms to appear.",

And once you get that first frost, I think it's going to really cut down on these allergies for you as well, Jim.A couple points. One is that, when it comes to exercising outdoors, really, midday, early afternoon is going to be the worst time. So if you can avoid that time of day in particular, that's going to be helpful. Again, stay on the medications throughout the allergy season. People take them sometimes just sporadically. It can be a little delayed then in terms of you actually getting relief from those medications once you're exercising. And finally, Jim, something you may have noticed, since you're a runner, is that you probably start off with the most symptoms. But as you actually get into your run, the symptoms seem to go down. That's because your body is starting to make an epinephrine and adrenaline, which can actually quell some of those allergy symptoms.",
