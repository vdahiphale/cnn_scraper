European scientists confirmed the findings out in a new report today. They found the average global temperature last month was around 1.5 degrees Celsius, higher than pre- industrial levels. It is a crucial warming threshold. And if the trend holds, climate experts warn it could lead to extreme weather events served as a global tipping point and give us all a glimpse into what the future may hold. CNN'S Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir, joins us live now to break the numbers all down. So, 1.5 degrees Celsius, that was considered to be this sort of crucial tipping point. We're all talking about it, and we've been talking about it since 2015. Now that we've crossed it, now what?",

Four out of five humans on Earth felt heat in this summer that would not happen without manmade climate change. And either broiling from different continents and the ocean temperatures are off the charts. There's a map where you can see which areas are really cooking hot. The North Atlantic, the Southern poles down around Antarctica where sea ice is at record lows there. But in the words of Gavin Schmidt, a NASA scientist, he says, this is shocking, but not surprising. We've been talking about this. This has been the prediction of science for generations now, but nobody considered, if you look at that bar, all the way to the right side of that graph, no one considered how big that bar would be so fast, how it's breaking records by full degrees, especially in ocean temperatures now. So, all that pent-up energy is really becoming much more obvious, Zain, right now. The question is, will that move policymakers? Will that move energy companies who do not seem inclined on changing their business model despite the obvious result?",

Right now, given the targets, given the adjustments, given the wake-up call, now people are saying we're gonna land somewhere around 2.5, less than 3 degrees. That is still a different planet than we are used to, that we grew up on. We don't know where the tipping points are for sea level rise to leap at a certain dramatic pace. We don't know about methane bombs, you know, coming out of melting permafrost, what that will do long-term. We don't know where those are. We do know we have the power to dramatically change things, especially when it comes to, like, natural gas, methane. It heats up things much hotter in the short term, easier to control that than long-term, century-long carbon debt, as well.

The military juntadenied permission for a joint delegation of U.N. African Union and ECOWAS diplomats to enter Niger today. Their aim was to restore constitutional order. Following last month's military takeover, the junta rejected the talks, citing security reasons. Even top U.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland was snubbed. She went to Niger but could not meet with the junta's leader or the deposed president, although she did meet with army officers. And ECOWAS, the bloc of West African countries meets Thursday to discuss the situation after previously threatening the possible use of force. CNN's Larry Madowo is following the story for us from Nairobi. So, Larry, you know, it's really hard to sort of see at this point in time, at this juncture, some kind of diplomatic solution whereby President Bazoum is reinstated. So, where do we go from here?

Western allies are increasingly receiving sobering reports about Ukraine'scounteroffensive, specifically about Ukrainian forces' ability to retake significant territory from Russian troops. This is a marked change from the optimistic outlook at the start of the offensive. One senior U.S. official says the counteroffensive is going harder and slower than anyone would like. CNN Chief U.S. Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto joins us live now from Washington, D.C. So, Jim, is there any optimism at all that Ukraine actually does have the capacity at this point in counteroffensive to turn things around? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: I'd say pragmatism is the word that came across to me more often. There is some optimism. They could turn it around in the remaining weeks before the fall comes. The weather will change. Fighting will become more difficult. But the change I noticed over recent weeks was early optimism to what I might call cautious optimism now to a sense among many that they just don't expect major breakthroughs anymore. It could happen but they think western intelligence officials tend to think that is becoming less and less likely. And it's for a number of reasons. One is just how difficult it has been to breach Russian defenses in the east and in the south. Three defensive belts heavily mined, tens of thousands of mines. And to Nick's story, just before I came on the air here, showing those body collectors on the front lines, staggering losses for both sides but also for Ukrainian forces. And that's led to a tactical shift by many Ukrainian commanders to pull back some units to reduce those losses and understandably, so. But there's also a bigger issue here that many in the West are identifying, and that is that the time there was to train many of these units was just too short. A matter of weeks on some of these advanced new Western-supplied weapons systems, like the German Leopard tanks, and the ask, in effect, was to create mechanized fighting units. But in a matter of weeks, which is virtually impossible to do or to do with success, and we're seeing, we're seeing as we watch the slow progress on the front lines, the difficulty of that. It would have been difficult under any circumstances because attacking defensive positions always is, but given the nature of the battle, the limited training and also the lack of air cover, it's just been harder than really anyone imagined.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [12:22:25] ASHER: Blistering heat, record-smashing rain, catastrophic flooding and deadly wildfires from Africa to Antarctica. All seven continents on Earth experienced extreme weather events last month alone. And experts warn it may soon become a way of life. In a new report out today, European scientists confirmed that July was the hottest month ever recorded. And the numbers weren't even particularly close. Data from the Copernicus Program indicates the average global temperature in July was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than during the pre- industrial era. It's a consequential milestone that doesn't just mark the latest in a series of dire warnings for the planet, but one scientist considers it to be a key tipping point that could unleash a steady stream of climate-driven disasters with potentially irreversible results. Before the report even came out, U.N. Chief Antonio Gutierrez made this alarming prediction when he said the era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived. Joining us live now is Samantha Burgess, who is the Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast. She joins us live now from Reading, England. Samantha, thank you so much for being with us. Here's the thing. So, we sort of surpassed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold temporarily.

We know the warmer our planet is, the more likely we are to have extreme events and they're going to be more intense. The other thing that we need to do right now is that climate change can no longer be considered a future problem. It's here and it's impacting people all around the world. So, we need to adapt to the climate that we're facing now. This means making sure that we can cool down our cities as much as possible and adapt to the heat stress that people are now facing, make sure our coastlines are resilient for storm surges and the sea level rise that will come with increased thermal expansion and glacier and ice sheet melting and really ensure that we're doing everything possible to adapt to our current climate and mitigate those emissions to make sure we can get to net zero as quickly as possible.",

And climate is the long-term trends. With a warmer world, it makes extreme events like heat waves that you've just described, more likely and more intense and longer. And we've seen that this summer where we've seen temperatures that have never been observed before across large parts of this planet. And we know the extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have made these heat waves stronger and more intense. In terms of where the climate will be, it really depends on the ambitious action that is taken between now and 10 years' time. So, the World Meteorological Organization has come out and said that there's a, I think they said a 66 percent probability that within the next five years, one of those years will be above 1.5 degrees for the entire year. If we look at the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and extrapolate to where we'll see 1.5 over a long-term period, we're looking at the early 2030s, so, a mere decade from now. This means by that time, we'll have warmer summers with more heat waves leading to more marine heat waves, leading to less stability of ice sheets and glaciers, leading to more intense storms, more frequent storms, and also more energy available for hurricanes.

Generally, employers want 1.6 days at home per week. Now, it's weird, we don't take 0.6 days. So, basically they're saying two days at home a week is enough. Workers want a little more than that. So, basically three days at home per week. The workers have a really strong hand to play here right now because so many employers are still trying to find enough people. And interestingly, working from home, one study found workers equate that to an eight percent higher salary if they have the freedom to work from home a lot. So, you can see for employers, yeah, they want people back, but it's an uphill climb.",

And Morocco is now out of the tournament after losing to France. Morocco was the last African nation represented in this year's tournament. The team's unlikely journey to the knockout stage as an underdog is regarded as a success. For more on this, I'm gonna bring in CNN's World Sports, Don Riddell. So, Don, it was fun while it lasted, right? African teams all been eliminated, but I think a lot of the African teams or the three of them, rather, should really hold their head up high because they all did very well just to make it to the knockout stage in the first place.",

Morocco qualified from that group. And this team has just been so fun to watch, all of them have, they really have. And Morocco's progress has reminded me a lot of the men's team, the Atlas Lions, who surprised us all by making it to the semi-finals of the World Cup, the men's World Cup in Qatar, towards the end of last year. Morocco seem to be investing heavily in both their men's and women's teams, and it's showing. And yeah, just hats off to all three of their teams, Nigeria, South Africa, and Morocco. They've had a brilliant, brilliant World Cup. And a shame for them it's over, but they've left us all with some wonderful memories and so much potential for the future.",
