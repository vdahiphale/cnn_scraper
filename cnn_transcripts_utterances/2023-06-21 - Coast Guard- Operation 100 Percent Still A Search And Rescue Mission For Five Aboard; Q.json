Really important at this point in the equation, things like these probes that could drop down lower, much lower and give a sense of what's happening on the bottom. But you remember the search for the Malaysian airplane, they were using things like this, and it's a tremendous job to try to cover all of that space down there.

I mentioned that earlier, deepest rescue ever, they were on scene for many hours and the people were in the water at that much lower level for more than 80 hours before they were rescued.

It is in a very remote place 700 kilometers from Newfoundland where the Titanic lies. That's one. Number two: The noises came as we understand it on the half hour and on the hour, i.e. with 30 minute segments in between them, signaling that there clearly is a human watch behind it. It's quite inconceivable that nature would be so perfectly attuned to send banging noises on the half an hour. And in fact, it is common practice within naval distress situations that you bang on the hour and on the half an hour and the reason why you do that is because you allow three minutes of banging to make sure that people know you're there, you're in distress, and then another 27 minutes to be quiet, so that the expedition looking to find you can identify you and it's quiet around you, and then on the 30-minute again, you bang again.

So he would have the calm and I would have full confidence that he is a good player to have on board. Stockton, as well, experienced explorer as well would also help to keep the calm. But having said that, one thing is the oxygen side of things, and there is also the CO2 that is being breathed -- that people are breathing out and there comes a point obviously, where there will be too much CO2 and too little oxygen effectively. So it is really a race against time, and something close to, I wouldn't say miracle or something, but will have to happen pretty soon because we are really, really running a tight rope here.

It is made of carbon fiber and carbon fiber, as you know, is this, you know, kind of miracle polymer, it's what's in the Boeing Dreamliner, it's what's in the Airbus A350 and with it comes this lightweight machine. And because it's more lightweight, it could be made bigger. So when you see Titan up close, one of the things that really strikes you is it is fairly large. It can hold more people. All of the other vehicles that go down to Titanic can only hold two or three people. But because of this carbon fiber design on Titan, it can be made larger, and five people can go inside of it. And so -- but with that innovation, with that novel design comes a really important trade off, which is how much do we know about how this carbon fiber can perform at depth and in terms of the pressure and the temperatures and in terms of fatigue?

In the course, though, of going out on Titan and diving down inside of it. It just became clear to us at that time that there was a lot that still needed to be worked out with the sub. It had just come back from the East Coast where it had undergone some pressure testing, it had just been rebuilt effectively. And a lot of the systems worked, but a lot of them really didn't. We had issues with thrusters and issues with computer control and things like that. And ultimately, it was a challenging dive.

There were effectively at least to my understanding in 2021, there were four different ways that Titan could shed weight to come back to the surface. There was first of all a computer-controlled weight release system that could release weights. There was also a manual valve system where you could turn a valve and actually inject air into you know, exterior ballast containers and floated up to the surface. There was also a hydraulically-controlled system that could drop weights. And finally if you if you look at Titan, it sits on a kind of sled. That entire sled could be ditched manually, which takes a ton of weight off the vehicle and can help it back to the surface.

We want to warn you, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An unknown Russian soldier lost his life here on a dirt road in this small village of Neskuchne. He was killed in Ukraine's counteroffensive which has, at best so far, put a small dent in Russian lines, hardly the turning point so many had hoped for. WEDEMAN (on camera): This is one of the villages that was liberated by the Ukrainians, this one on the 10th of June. Clearly, the Russians were in a hurry. They left behind this blood-soaked stretcher. WEDEMAN (voice-over): It is still too dangerous for civilians to return to these once-tranquil farming communities. And there isn't much left for them to return to. The mortar crew of the 35th Ukrainian Marine Brigade has moved into a house recently vacated by Russian troops. This afternoon, they're busy piling up newly arrived American-made shells, far better than the old Soviet ammunition, says Andri. ANDRI, UKRAINIAN 35TH MARINE BRIGADE (through translator): That's amazing. They're just great, he says. They hit the bull's-eye. My favorite. WEDEMAN (voice-over): Throughout the day, shelling echoes around them. The Russians may have left the village, yet they're still nearby. Yuri's mortar training in Britain didn't prepare him for the front. This is only his third day in the line of fire. YURI, UKRAINIAN 35TH MARINE BRIGADE (through translator): There are moments when I want to hide, he says. But I have to stay put and wait.

And the Russians have throughout this war really used their superiority in just the sheer number of artillery pieces that they have to really unleash these punishing barrages. So there were high expectations before this offensive began, that it would be similar to what we saw last year in September in the Kharkiv region where the Ukrainians, in just about two weeks, took an incredible amount of territory, more than 4,600 square miles.
