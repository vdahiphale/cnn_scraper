      "sentences": "Ahead here on CNN. Yulia Navalny steps out of the shadows promising to continue her late husband's crusade against Vladimir Putin. The direct battlefield impact from Republicans stalling U.S. military aid for Ukraine. An escaping Rafah, a desperate scramble by Palestinians with nowhere to go ahead of an Israeli military offensive now 19 days away.For three days now, the mother of the now-dead Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny says she has tried to retrieve her son's body from a hospital morgue in northern Russia, only to be refused each time. Navalny's spokesperson says officials want 14 days for a chemical examination to determine cause of death, sparking accusations of a Kremlin cover-up. Yulia Navalnaya has released a video statement on Monday saying she will step in and lead her late husband's crusade against Putin, promising to fight for a peaceful, happy Russia. Forty-seven-year-old Navalny died suddenly on Friday in an Arctic penal colony, seemingly in good spirits just one day earlier in a video court appearance. More details now from CNN's Matthew Chance reporting in from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Despite the risks, Russians are publicly grieving at Alexei Navalny's death. In Moscow, a steady stream of mourners laying flowers for the late opposition leader. Across Russia, rights activists say hundreds have been detained for just this. My hero has died, this man told us. I grew up watching and learning from him, so it feels like a personal loss, he says. This woman tells us she desperately wants Russia to change, but now we're at a dead end, she says, with sorrow, grief, and pain. You feel that pain more than Navalny's own family and his widow, Yulia, here meeting outraged European leaders, is vowing to expose what she says are her husband's killers and to assume his opposition mantle. YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S WIDOW (through translator): I will continue Alexei Navalny's work. I will keep fighting for our country, and I encourage you to stand by my side, to share not only grief and the endless pain that has enveloped us and does not let go. I'm asking you to share my rage, anger, hatred for those who dared to kill our future.",

And I believe that Vladimir Putin is responsible for Alexei's murder, and the fact that his body will not be released to his family for two weeks, and the authorities actually don't even try to find a different explanation for this. They are saying that they're conducting a chemical analysis. Meanwhile, the two causes put forward by the Russian authorities, the two causes of Alexei's death were the sudden death syndrome and thrombosis, which, according to Alexei's doctors, was unlikely because Alexei was not suffering from any condition that would make it likely. So this was obviously a murder, and they themselves are not giving out the body to the family. But, you know, had they done this, wouldn't it be a great opportunity for them to prove that they had nothing to do with Alexei's death? Had they allowed the family to conduct an independent expertise to find that blood clot that they claim was the cause of his death? Would that not be the best option for them? Well, apparently not, because they know that they have to hide something, and they're doing it, and they're going to take two weeks to hide that. I believe that the fact that Vladimir Putin eliminates every single of his opponents is indeed a sign of weakness, because no strong leader would have to do anything like this. A leader who enjoys the support of his population, truly enjoys the support of his population. A true leader who knows that the country stands behind him will not use repression, will not use political assassination, will not subject people to torture in jails. Vladimir Putin is not a leader. He's a usurper. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And a lot of that is dependent upon the nature of the death. They have this man in a controlled environment. I would assume that he is being watched regularly. So, they have those kind of histrionics that come along with the events leading up to his death. The assessment itself, the physical assessment, can be accomplished, like I said, within a couple of hours.Now, as it applies to the testing that comes afterwards, that can take up to 14 days. If you start to get off into the area of these kind of exotic poisons or these agents, like a nerve agent, perhaps, it's going to take a bit longer because the testing has to be very, very specific. And you kind of have to know what physical characteristics that you're looking at an autopsy that might marry up with a symptomology that would correlate with a particular type of agent and then dig deeper at that point in time.",

When the family get the remains back, if they get the remains back, I would keep a very close eye on if there are any missing elements with the body. And I'm going to be very specific and blunt here. You have to think about these things. As far as the organ systems, will the body be returned with the lungs, with the heart, with the brain, because if you're talking about this organophosphate poisoning, you're going to want to look at the brain tissue microscopically. That's going to be important.But here's the big one. What is kind of attached to this particular agent in particular is the liver. It sends the individual into a hepatic failure or liver failure. Could that original exposure that occurred back in, I guess it was 2020, I think, could that have led to maybe liver failure? And let's keep in mind, he's in a penal colony, John, north of the Arctic Circle. What kind of medical treatment was he being given, even as a follow-up to that event back in 2020? VAUSE: Yeah, there were a lot of questions about the standard of care that he was or was not receiving, first in the prison outside Moscow, and now there's Gulag north of the Arctic Circle.
