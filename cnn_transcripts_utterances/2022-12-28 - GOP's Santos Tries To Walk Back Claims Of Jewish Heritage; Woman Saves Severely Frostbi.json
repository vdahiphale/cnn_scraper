Santos also continues to walk back previous claims about his Jewish heritage.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE SANTOS (R) NEW YORK CONGRESSMEN-ELECT: My heritage is Jewish. I've always identified as Jewish. I was raised a practicing Catholic. I think I've gone through this.

So, the fact that he considers himself Jewish is ridiculous, but more importantly, the fact that he would say something that would trivialize the Holocaust, that's more tragic.",

A massive flash event where everything melts.We do know that the National Weather Service in Buffalo and many other areas will put out advisories and statements for stream flooding. But they don't put out advisories for basement flooding, for business flooding. So, this is a wait and see kind of thing. Look at all these cities in the U.S. right now are all above freezing, with an exception of Minot at 25 degrees. The average high in Buffalo was 34. They're going to see temperatures are 20 degrees warmer than that. Look at all the snow, they're above freezing in Minneapolis. Now out West, it's getting bad. Now we need the snow but wait until I tell you what's happening in the week ahead. Now last year at this time in Buffalo, they had 9.3 inches on the ground -- they're up to 100. They are six feet above average. There's no doubt there's going to be some problems with the flooding. Now this is Watertown. This looks pretty good, and they're saying, well, watch your sewer drains, right. Keep them from getting iced up. How can you even find them if they can't find the automobiles? After the plowing, you've drifts 6 or 7 feet high. So, there is definitely going to be some flooding. We've got rain in the forecast. I mean that just aids in the melting and of course, accelerates it -- it's up to 54 in the seven-day forecast. So, this massive warmup across all of the Eastern U.S., it does come with rain from the Tennessee Valley to the south. But out West, sara, here we go. Not only are we going to see one system that's already moved in. We've got another one coming in later on tonight and tomorrow. Another one on Saturday into Sunday. Another one next week. Measuring the snow by the feet. The winds have been so strong that we have had category 1 and category 2 winds with this. So again, it's going to be one day after another. The massive rainfall, the flooding, and the mountain snow. It's going to be endless for days. That's the next story.",
