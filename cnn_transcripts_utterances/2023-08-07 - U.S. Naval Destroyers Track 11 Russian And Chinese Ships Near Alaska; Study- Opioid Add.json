In 2020, Thao and three other former officers were arrested for their actions or lack thereof when a knee was pressed in the neck and back of George Floyd for more than nine minutes while he lay handcuffed and died, Omar.

And we're still closing out legal proceedings all this time later.Now, I want to go elsewhere to a tense situation in the waters near Alaska. The U.S. military dispatched four naval destroyers to monitor 11 Russian and Chinese ships that were \"patrolling the area.\" Alaskan lawmakers say those vessels were operating last week near the Aleutian Islands. But a Chinese official says they were simply conducting \"joint maritime patrols in relevant waters in the Pacific.\" So to help explain, CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins us now.

But also based off of Natasha's reporting, how common is something like this? Can you just set the context for folks who may not follow this as closely as you were some of your colleagues may have? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK (RET), U.S. ARMY: Omar, thank you for having me. It is -- this is -- doesn't happen often, but it is not a one-off. But it seems like these types of operations, these exercises approaching sensitive waters, both by sea and there have been now as we've seen two in the last two years, but also increasingly by aircraft. Joint Russian-Chinese intercontinental bombers, for example, flying off through the Sea of Japan and up through the North Pacific. So, there is a trend here now where the -- and this -- the Russians and the Chinese know the world are watch -- is watching. Know we are watching. And I think that they're kind of putting their elbows out, pushing into international waters, but territorial as well, and making statements by doing.
