      "sentences": "It seems to be a way of putting pressure on Israel, and potentially putting pressure on President Biden and the White House, to put pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to make some compromises in the talks over Gaza, compromises that he hasn't been prepared to partake in before.And the reason for this pressure, and the reason for the positioning, and the reason that these talks on Thursday are so critical, because it's not just about Gaza, this was put into play, if you will, these talks on Thursday to try to convince Iran that there was a plausible Gaza ceasefire deal in the works and, therefore, not to retaliate at an escalatory-level against Israel. So -- but when you see, the U.S. Secretary of Defense moving additional military assets, speeding them into the region, moving a -- the USS Georgia, this nuclear-powered cruise-missile-firing submarine from the Mediterranean into the eastern Mediterranean. Those are signals that the U.S. believes that there is the potential that the talks won't go well this week and, therefore, that Iran may strike, or they may interpret the fact that the talks are really not going to be any different to anything in the past, and may interpret that as a signal that they may as well go and have their retaliatory strike against Israel. So, all of these features right now, I think, focus on how important those talks are, focus how tenuous they are. Diplomats that I'm talking to in the region, who had some hope late last week that a deal could be reached on Thursday, and now worrying that that can't happen. And part of it is, and this is Hamas position as well, that they are not clear what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to do, what he'll tell his officials to do at those talks. That's the concern. So, while Hamas says it wants a deal, it's also saying that it's not prepared to go to the talks at the moment. This is in a very, very delicate situation.",

      "sentences": "Well, what we saw yesterday was really just more of the same. There has been an incremental escalation or increase by Hezbollah, and the amount of attacks it's launching on Israel. Though, keep in mind that, according to one study, for every one attack Hezbollah launches, there are six Israeli counter-strikes.Now, today, so far, there have only been two claimed -- two strikes claimed by Hamas. So, sort of every day is different. But certainly, that's -- these strikes are really within the context of what we have seen going back to the 8th of October, when Hezbollah first opened fire on Israel. What, of course, everybody is anticipating, expecting, fearing, to some extent, is Hezbollah responding to the strike Tuesday before last by Israel that killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has said that that response to that assassination is coming. There's no question about it. The question is, what form will it take? And speaking to my diplomatic sources that they do feel that Hezbollah has sort of talked itself into a corner that it has to respond. But if it responds too strongly, the Israeli counter-response could be very destructive beyond simply the area along the border that has been steadily pounded now, going back to October. So, in terms of the atmosphere here, what we're seeing is that, out of the last six days, Israeli warplanes have broken the sound barrier four of those days. We're seeing that more airlines are extending their suspensions of flights to Beirut. The latest one is Swiss Air, which has suspended its flights to Lebanon until the 21st of August. But when you go out into the street, you go to restaurants, there are still people there, perhaps less than before, because many have left. But I think, as I have said time and time again on CNN, people here have been on this roller coaster, where we've seen escalations, de- escalations time and time again. So, in a sense, they're prepared for the worst, but they have no choice but to go about their daily lives as best they can.",

So, that is why they are essentially attacking as a defensive strategy, trying to stop the weapons from hitting them in the first place. So, that is one reason. But as to where this is headed, right? It's still not particularly clear.Ukraine seems to be still pushing forward. The Russian Ministry of Defense has admitted itself that they have advanced some 30-or-so kilometers, although they claim -- Russia claims that they are repelling Ukraine's advances, and attempting to push them back. They have not yet managed to fully stop this incursion from happening though. And we're now just about a week in, now, look, we now have two regions. As you say, evacuations have been happening in both, some 76,000 or so people evacuated from the Kursk region, where this all started. We're now hearing today about some 11,000 evacuated from Belgorod. So, if the aim is to cause disruption, then certainly it's working. If the aim is to draw Russian forces, though, away from vulnerable areas of the front line, that is less clear at this point whether it's working on Russia. It appears from accounts that we're getting from Ukrainian military bloggers are continuing to push on the eastern front, particularly around a strategically important town called Toretsk. And meanwhile, we're getting new comments this hour, Amara, from President Putin, who has been chairing a meeting of his top security officials on this. And we've just heard him saying, we're just getting the footage in, really in the last few minutes, that he believes that the Kyiv regime, as he calls it, is really trying to improve its negotiating position by doing this, and that he says there will be no negation -- negotiations, as he puts it, with a country that indiscriminately attacks civilians and has caused a provocation at a nuclear plant, referring, of course, to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. So, he attempting to appear in control will, of course, not wanting to overplay this, given how potentially embarrassing it is to Russia that it has not been able to defend its border.",

And so, the idea that the Pentagon has now come out and said publicly that this submarine, which is armed with dozens and dozens of cruise missiles, is actually going to be deployed now to the Middle East amid these very high regional tensions, is a clear statement to Iran and its proxies that the U.S. is prepared to defend Israel, and defend Israel in the face of a potential Iranian attack, and essentially trying to get the Iranians and their proxy groups, including Hezbollah, to back down here.Now, it remains unclear whether that's actually going to work the U.S. and the wider Middle East region. They have been bracing for a potential Iranian retaliation for several weeks now, and it remains unclear what that is going to look like, whether Iran has decided to actually move forward with a plan to attack Israel. But, you know, these announcements about the Pentagon moving these assets to the region, including the submarine, speeding the deployment of another U.S. aircraft carrier, the link in to the region, they came after Austin spoke with Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, in which, Austin reiterated that the U.S. is prepared to defend Israel in the face of an attack. And so clearly, you know, concerns are rising here that there is going to be some kind of attack by the Iranians or by Hezbollah against the Israelis, and that is why the U.S. is now positioning all of these very strategic assets in the area. They already have the USS Wasp, which is an amphibious ship in the eastern Mediterranean, which is accompanied by thousands of Marines that are capable of conducting special operations, as well as evacuation operations, if that becomes necessary, as well as several destroyers which are in the eastern Mediterranean, which are capable of shooting down missiles and drones that may come, you know their way. And so everyone right now is kind of bracing for what's next, but still unclear what it's actually going to look like.",

Police in Ferguson, Missouri say an officer is fighting for his life after being assaulted during protests marking 10 years since the death of Michael Brown. Michael Brown was shot and killed by an officer in that same department.Police say, Friday's protests were mostly peaceful until a group of people pushed down a fence by the police station. That is what officer Travis Brown was knocked over and hit his head, causing a severe brain injury. Stephanie Elam is in Los Angeles with the latest.

You have to keep in mind too that many of those officers don't even work at this department anymore. So, it's a different makeup than it was at the time. Still, this was the anniversary of it on Friday, and so there were protests out there, demonstrators who were outside of the police station, the police department, saying they were mostly peaceful, until some of these demonstrators started to go against the fence around the police station and started to destroy it and break through it. It was at that point when property was being damaged that the police chief, Troy Doyle then sent a group of police officers outside to make arrests. And then, that is when this incident occurred. What we do know is that 28-year-old Elijah Gantt has been charged with assault, and they also are alleging four other charges, resisting arrest, property damage, and two charges of fourth-degree assault, also related to officer Travis Brown, who is, as police say, fighting for his life. But, when you listen to the police chief talking about these protests outside of the police station, he's saying that people are still protesting the old department and not the current department. Take a listen to him here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, he's done it again. Londoners are reacting to the latest in a series of animal themed works. The anonymous artist known as Banksy has been creating throughout the UK capital, and speculating about their meaning. CNN's Christina Macfarlane has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT CNN INTERNATIONAL (voice-over): Banksy strikes again. An ordinary glass police box on a street in London has been re-imagined as a tank full of toothy fish that look like piranhas. The fish follow a stream of animal themed murals confirmed to be the handiwork of the infamous street artist that have popped up in London in the past week, drawing crowds, but in a good way. The fish are painted in translucent aquatic colors, a departure from the other works in the series that were done in black silhouettes, including a black cat stretching on a billboard, which has since been removed. Two pelicans perched over a fish and chip shop, a howling wolf on a satellite dish, which was quickly stolen, three monkeys swinging on a railway bridge, two elephants giving each other a trunks up, and a goat on a precarious perch. It's been a guessing game for Londoners to try and figure out what might appear next and what message Banksy might be sending.",
