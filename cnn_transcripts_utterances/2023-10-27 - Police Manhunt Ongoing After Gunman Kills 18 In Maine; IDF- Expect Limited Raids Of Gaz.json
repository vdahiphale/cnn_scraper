And we begin in Maine where police are in their second night of hunting for the suspect in two back to back mass shootings that killed 18 people and wounded more than a dozen others.Law enforcement descended on the suspect's last known address just a few hours ago. Authorities were later heard shouting, you're under arrest and come up with your hands up. Though it appears the suspect was not there at the time. Police are searching for this man, 40-year- old Robert Card. He is considered armed and dangerous. He's charged with multiple counts of murder. Officials are telling residents in the areas around Lewiston, Maine to stay vigilant, remain inside and lock their doors as their search for Card continues. That search now ongoing and there are other locations they plan to investigate in the coming hours. Now schools and government properties will again be closed on Friday while the suspect is still on the loose. Hundreds of local state and federal agents are involved in the search and that investigation into Wednesday's massacre. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year. It took place at two locations Wednesday evening, first a bowling alley and then a restaurant. CNN's Brian Todd breaks down how the shootings and subsequent search unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

TODD (on camera): A law enforcement source tells CNN that investigators found a gun in a car connected to the suspect, Robert Card, but it is unclear whether that gun was used in the shootings. Meanwhile, a former colleague of Card's who was in the U.S. Army Reserves with him told CNN that Card is a skilled outdoorsman and marksman and was one of the best shooters in their unit.

He was prepared for this. He knew how to make entry. He knew how to conduct the shooting operation.The fact that he is very likely on the run, my gut would say that he is in those wooded areas right there because he's familiar with that, for him to travel by vehicle, and to go to South Carolina and go to Florida, where he is in unknown territory is the least likely of the scenarios. But what's most important is law enforcement and the FBI, HSI, all these agencies are going to look at every single lead, every possibility they're going to talk to their partner agencies, in those divisions, Atlanta division, all the way up to 56 different FBI divisions across the country, everyone is prepared for leads that may be coming out at the Incident Command Center, which is set up there in Maine. If those leads come in, they're going to go rush it out. It doesn't matter what hour it is. I know FBI Boston. I know a lot of agents that are there. And they're very much working very diligently along with tactical operations specialists. And we understand that this is a very clear and present danger for the people of Maine right now.

His father, who you saw earlier says Joseph was killed when he tried to stop the shooter from killing others. Bryan MacFarlane was part of the local deaf community and usually went to the restaurant to play cornhole on Wednesdays. His sister tells CNN the 40-year-old was there to take part in a tournament when the shooting happened. And 34-year-old Tommy Conrad was killed at the bowling alley where he was the manager. Conrad leaves behind a nine-year-old daughter.

Video from the Israeli military shows a column of IDF tanks and heavy equipment during one targeted raid on Thursday.The IDF said the operation was large but limited and the troops withdrew from Gaza. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the group massacred more than 1,400 people in southern Israel with more than 200 others taken hostage. The IDF said an airstrike on Thursday killed a senior Hamas leader who was involved, they say, in planning the October 7th attacks. Meantime E.U. leaders are appealing for safe corridors to deliver aid to Gaza where basic necessities are in short supply. Red Crescent says another 12 aid trucks entered Gaza Thursday but didn't bring any fuel, which Israel has refused to allow in. Israel says Hamas has stolen and will steal fuel to use in its rocket attacks. We go now to CNN's Jim Bittermann who's live for us in Paris. It has been nearly three weeks now, Jim.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Paula, it's good to be with you. The big thing that they're trying to do is find out where Hamas fighters actually are. So we targeted raids, somewhat similar, I think in concept to reconnaissance in force, they're going forward. They're taking a look at what's out there. They also with targeted rates, they perhaps know a little bit more from an intelligence perspective. And they're going in and they're trying to find leadership elements, perhaps tunnel entrances, other aspects of house infrastructure that they could perhaps take advantage of. And of course, they're looking for any weak points that are out there. So that's what they're doing. Of course, as they move forward with those tanks, that becomes a very critical element for these days, because what they're trying to do is they're trying to find good ways to move their forces, their armor, especially in position so that they can actually use it to for maximum effectiveness.",

Because when you're seeing the kinds of things that could happen with this maximum type of urban combat that really awaits the Israeli Defense Forces, when they enter the populated areas of Gaza, that could be a real problem. That could really pull them in into a real quagmire.And that's the kind of thing that Israel should really try to avoid at all costs, they have to really play to their own strengths, as opposed to Hamas's strengths. If they went in and did a full force on force type invasion, that wouldn't really play to Hamas's strengths, because they'd be on the defensive, they wouldn't know what to expect from the Israelis. If the Israelis, on the other hand, go to a targeted type of Special Forces like incursion, then it would be much different and they would perhaps prosecute more high value targets, in other words, important people.

And it would be very important for them to try to do their utmost to get the hostages back. And also to not get caught in some kind of a trap that Hamas would be setting for them both figuratively and literally in the form of booby traps, and IEDs, and things like that.So it becomes really important for the Israelis to develop a more nuanced strategy. And that nuanced strategy should include something that, you know, perhaps uses the diplomatic channel, in other words, to work the hostage issue in a more coherent fashion, that would be the kind of thing that would really helped their case, and I think would make a lot of difference when it comes to the further movements on the military side.",

And that actually is true, because after a certain point, especially in a very narrowly confined area like Gaza, you're going to find that you're hitting the same target over and over again.Now, sometimes it's necessary to do that just from a targeting perspective. But in this particular case, when you're talking about hundreds of targets being struck every day in the 30 or so square mile area, that is, I think, really, really hard to justify.

      "sentences": "Yes, Paula. I think the list is long but probably the expectation is low which sometimes help things move along. And the key takeaway from all these meetings Wang Yi is having right now in D.C. of course, is it's increasingly likely that Chinese leader Xi Jinping is going to San Francisco next month to attend the APEC summit, and also meeting with President Biden there, because Wang Yi's trip is very much seen as hashing out the details to pave the way for his leader to visit the U.S. next month.Now this is happening right now I think for both international and domestic reasons obviously, as you mentioned with global conflicts growing and intensifying, there is this international expectation that the two superpowers, need to put a floor on their free-falling relationship because a lot of things simply cannot be done without the two sides at least seeing eye to eye somewhat. The Chinese, for example, recently vetoed a U.S.-proposed resolution at the U.N. Security Council regarding the Gaza conflict. And that's why one of the reasons why that issue remains very much deadlocked at the U.N. body. But also, I think the two sides see and agree on this very narrow window they can work off, between now and early next year when the U.S. Presents election season kicks off in earnest. So that is why a lot of these things are happening. The state visit by U.S. officials here to China, and also politicians, the latest being Gavin Newsom, the California governor for example, who's still here, but also of course, you know, you see tensions very much remain high with the two militaries for example releasing videos, that they say show the other side making dangerous maneuvers, putting their war planes and warships on a collision course. So I think this is the kind of dynamic we are talking about. And both sides see this opportunity right now, to somewhat stabilize, or even improve this relationship for Xi Jinping. Of course, there are also domestic reasons when he's still facing strong economic headwinds. So he needs to show this domestic audience that he is capable of managing and recalibrating international relations, especially with the U.S. But fundamentally though Paula, I think these are all considered tactical moves by analysts because fundamentally, I don't think Xi's rather dim view of the U.S. has changed. He still sees the U.S. is out there to continue (INAUDIBLE) to suppress Chinese interest. But according to him, the east is rising and the west is declining so he does see opportunities in the current world conflict. And his desire to change the world order very much hadn't changed, Paula.",

Now, in the last few hours we learned China's former premier, Li Keqiang has died. According to Chinese state media, Li suffered a sudden heart attack early Friday morning. Li served as the China's number two leader until last November, overseeing his country's for more than a decade. He was once viewed as reform-minded contender for the country's top leadership role. Japanese officials sent their condolences saying the former premier played an important role in Japan-China relations. Li was 68 years old. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he can see quote \"the end of the war\" in his country. This comes after new American and Danish defense support measures were announced on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State said his country's security assistance includes $150 million worth of arms and equipment. President Zelenskyy says Denmark's offering is over $500 million worth of tanks, drones and ammunition. Hurricane Otis has left its mark on the popular Mexican resort area of Acapulco, killing at least 27 people. A drone video shows the destruction the hurricane left in its wake. The storm surprised many by quickly reaching the powerful Category 5 status before making landfall, leaving little time for people to prepare. CNN's Patrick Oppmann has our report (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
