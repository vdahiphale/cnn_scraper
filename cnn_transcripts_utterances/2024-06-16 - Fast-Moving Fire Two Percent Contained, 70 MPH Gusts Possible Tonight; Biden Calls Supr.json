We're going to start with \"BREAKING NEWS\" in Southern California.A fast-moving wildfire has already burned more than 12,000 acres in Los Angeles County and strong winds are likely to keep stoking the fire, with the National Weather Service predicting gusts of up to 70 miles an hour. I want to bring in Camila Bernal, who joins us in Gorman, California where the fire started about an hour north of Los Angeles. I can see some of the wind in your shot right now. What are you seeing right now? What are you feeling right there on the scene?",

And you mentioned those 70-mile per hour winds, well, that's overnight, and that's the biggest concern for firefighters, because that fire spreads quickly.You can see here behind me this whole area was torched by the fire. And so, what they were doing here, the crews on the ground is trying to connect those areas that were not burned to the areas that were. And so, the flames in the smoke that you're seeing right now, that is from a controlled burn. So, it is a backburn that they did on purpose, hoping to increase that containment number that at the moment is still at two percent. We are still seeing a lot of water drops throughout the day. So many of those helicopters just circling this area. There is a nearby lake and that has been extremely helpful for air resources. But of course, the crews on the ground also working you know around the clock and they are in communication with the crews, and they are telling them exactly where to drop that water in this area. Take a listen to what the Forest Service is saying about their concerns. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, when the wind lines up with the drainages, and with such grip and right through them, it's definitely concerned. So, that's what we're looking at. If hopefully these winds that are forecasted tonight don't materialize to the extent they are supposed to, which is 60-mile an hour, and maybe tomorrow will be more calm day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Again, these crews are working around the clock doing everything they can to keep that containment going up and up. But again, the concern is the wind, that the overnight hours, it is hot, it is low humidity, and those wind gusts could make the situation a lot worse, Omar.",

The wind just picks up those flames and moves it so quickly that you may not have time to evacuate.And so, that's why there is this warning for people who live in this area to have things ready, because you just never know in what direction it could go, where and amber can just spread the fire, and so, you have to be ready in case that does happen, especially when you're around a fire like this one that continues to grow, and that firefighters are saying is harder to get a handle on because of the conditions and because of the terrain.",

Now, former President Barack Obama was seated right next to President Biden, and he talked about the values of candidates, and that it is important for voters to take that into consideration when they go to the polls. But of course, Omar, this was also a fundraiser. And so, this allowed them to rake in more cash. They want to keep a cash advantage over Donald Trump. This was an event with $30 million.

He is talking about things that matter to them, like reproductive rights. And I actually think if, if Joe Biden wants to been -- you know, beat Donald Trump, he really needs to anchor his criticisms of a second Trump administration in those realities. I mean, Omar, just a few minutes ago, you were talking about the wildfire in California. That's a perfect example. Because people like me have come forward to say that Donald Trump wanted to use disasters like that, to gain leverage over his opponents, to withhold aid. In the case of a wildfire. years ago in California, Trump didn't want to give money to California, because he didn't like the Democratic governor and the state. Those are the types of things Joe Biden needs to point out. And the Biden administration, by the way, has declared this wildfire a federal disaster area. But those are the things a future Trump administration might not do if it's a blue state that they don't like.

He made very significant moves at the southern border, which are moves that could have happened during the Trump administration. Some of them actually did happen during the Trump administration. And they are moves that Republicans in Congress should be happy about. But none of that matters if Joe Biden doesn't defend that decision, and talk about it in the language that will recruit independent voters. He needs to stand up for that he needs to say he took decisive action. He needs to be very, very bold on border security in the debate. And he can still do that while talking about the importance of a humane immigration policy and fixing our broken system. But he has to take the ownership of that.
