We are getting more details on tonight's breaking news about the FBI search for documents at the home of President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware.The search was overseen by the Office of Trump appointed U.S. Attorney John Lausch, who has been handling the initial review of the Justice Department's probe and declassified documents since Robert Hur is still transitioning to his role as special counsel. Arlette Saenz is back with us net now. Arlette, what is the latest? Arlette, do we have a panel? All right, and we're going to we're going to go to our panel of experts as we wait for Arlette. Shan Wu is here, an attorney. And Shan, I want to get your thoughts on this significant development. You know, look, there's the political aspect of this, there is also the legal aspect of this, but bottom line, it is significant that a sitting president's private residence was searched by the FBI and a fifth batch of classified documents was found in his house. Help us make sense of all of this and the significance of it.",

Biden, at this point, from what we can see, it doesn't look like anything's to be added to any criminal jeopardy here. And it is really significant historically, that there's been a search. And actually, it really goes to the cooperation and the transparency of the Biden administration.I actually quibble some with some of the headlines, including the New York Times it says this was a seizure. If I hand you something, you're not seizing it from me. And this appears to be a consensual search, the lawyers are inviting the men wanting to cooperate with them. And they are searching for the documents. And some of these are quite old. I mean, goes back to possibly when he was a senator, or vice president. So it's not as though people know these are missing, have been searching for them. And they haven't been cooperating with it. That's why the cooperation piece is really important here.",

It was a search that lasted nearly 13 hours. And what the White House and both -- and the personal attorneys are trying to stress is that it was done in full cooperation with the Justice Department. Now we've also learned specifically that this search was conducted by FBI agents, which really is just a remarkable scene to think about the fact that the FBI was searching the home of a current sitting president. Now, this search was conducted just yesterday on Friday, neither President Biden nor First Lady Jill Biden were there at the home. They're actually spending the weekend here in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where they also own a home. But Bob Bauer detailed a little bit of what exactly this search of the Wilmington house entailed. He said that he essentially -- they were able to search the living, the working, and also the storage areas at the home. And he specified a kind of the different types of searches that they were able to go through. And I want to read you a little bit of what he said that they looked through. He said that the, \"DOJ had full access to the President's home including personally handwritten notes, files, papers, binders, memorabilia, to-do lists, schedules and reminders going back decades.\" He added, \"DOJ took possession of materials it deemed within the scope of its inquiry, including six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials, some of which are from the President's service in the Senate, and some of which were from his tenure as vice president. DOJ also took for further review, personally handwritten notes from the vice-presidential years. Now, this covers the fifth discovery that is known to have been made both that private office and at the home in Wilmington, Delaware. Of course, the very first search was conducted back in November -- on November 2, and that was on the Penn Biden Center. But it wasn't until two months later when this was reported by CBS News that it came to light that there were any classified documents that had been tied to locations where President Biden has worked and lived. Of course, there was also searches done in December and January of the Wilmington residents, also here in Rehoboth Beach as well. But all of those previous searches had been conducted by the personal attorneys. It was not until yesterday that FBI officials, the Justice Department were on hand, did conducted those searches themselves. Now one thing that the White House has been facing a lot of criticism for is the pace with which they have revealed that these discoveries have taken place. November 2 was that very first discovery and it wasn't until it was reported in the media two months later, that these classified documents existed. And President Biden was asked on -- just on Thursday, whether he had any regrets about the way that the White House has handled, sharing this information with the public Take a listen.

It's -- from what we know, he's never even pack these or touched any of these documents.But it's a real question from tonight, Pam, is what took them so long. So to date -- and I think we probably know they were hoping by handling it themselves, as we're talking about Biden's lawyers, it would all go away quickly, because -- specifically because there's nothing criminal here at all. But now that a special counsel has been employed and they've been getting their brains beaten in by the, you know, accusations of drip, drip, they finally said at DOJ come on in. And by the way, we need another word than search. That's the constitutional term. A magistrate says there's probable cause. Nobody did that here. It was just a consensual come on in and look at anything you want. And they did it. And what it signals is the White House, I think, and Biden's lawyers are bowing to reality and saying, you know, this is now a criminal matter. We just got to let DOJ handle it completely.

And what they were doing was they didn't have to go to a judge and say, look, we have probable cause that a crime might have been committed so we need a search warrant issued.People do searches all the time. I searched my car keys, you know, things I've lost. This was a consensual search, and people can consent to the search. And that's within the concept of the constitutional notion of a constitutional search if you can consent to that. I think what's really particularly interesting here is Norm Eisen, Andrew Weissmann, Mueller's former deputy, did a piece in just security, making a comparison just before these new documents came to light, about a look at what Alberto Gonzales had done. And also there, the DOJ IG had looked at his situation and found that he had removed the classified documents when he was in the White House took them with him to DOJ. And interestingly, among those were handwritten notes he taken which Gonzales at the time didn't seem to realize if he was taking notes of classified information, that will be classified too. If you look at that comparison, you'll find actually -- to me looking from the outside in, a lot more damaging evidence. I mean, he personally was transporting information. He had taken these notes, and he did not really importantly, self-disclose. He didn't come to DOJ and say, hey, we found these, we want to turn them over. And repeatedly, the Biden team keeps doing it. And that's why the transparency is important. It doesn't excuse mishandling.

But there's something that really stood out to me on this one, and maybe nothing but how does he have documents from when he was a senator? Look, I'm not familiar with how the classified information works for a vice president or president, what those controls are. What I do know, in the Senate and in the House, all that information that's classified is highly controlled into it in a specific skiff that is monitored what you take in and take out.

Now, Baldwin has avoided reporters and he has declined to take reporters' questions. You can see him there entering his apartment in Manhattan yesterday. But he did speak to CNN several months ago back in August, and he told my colleague Chloe Melas how he viewed his responsibility in this incident. He told her that he did not believe his job was to concentrate on whether the gun was safe because there were other people on the set whose job it was to do exactly that.

The FBI conducted the 13-hour search yesterday with the consent of Biden's attorneys. The President's personal attorney Bob Bauer says the Justice Department has taken possession of six items.Bauer says some dated back to Biden's time in the U.S. Senate and others from his tenure as vice president. The search was overseen by U.S. Attorney John Lausch, a Trump appointee, who has been handling the initial review of the DOJ's new probe, while Robert Hur transitions to his role as special counsel. So let's bring in two CNN Political Commentators, Bakari Sellers, former state representative from South Carolina, and hosted the Bakari Sellers podcast. Also with us, former Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, Charlie Dent. Thanks for staying up late for us to talk about this breaking news tonight, gentlemen. Congressman, starting with you. The President's attorneys had searched the Wilmington home at least twice before this FBI search located more items. What is your reaction to hearing about this news tonight?",

And every time I viewed classified materials, I did it in a classified setting, usually in a skiff secure facility.And there was always someone there guarding the documents. That I couldn't even fathom walking out with them. So how does a senator do that? I mean, that's -- this is just reckless and careless. And I think that's a very fair question for Congress to ask of this President. How are you able to do such a thing? I think this is a terrible situation. I'm not saying this is about as Trump situation where there's criminal exposure, Trump was uncooperative. But I just think this is awful. And, you know, we've had now Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, all people that are president or ran for president, unable to properly handle classified material, and it was outrageous.",

But it was notable, right, that was many years ago. And they took these documents, at least six classified documents, including other documents and handwritten letters from Joe Biden. The FBI took that from his property, and now it's part of this investigation.I mean, Bakari, this is truly remarkable. The FBI searching the private property of a sitting president. How politically damaging is this to President Biden, in your view?",

I think that we vetted Hillary Clinton's, but her e-mails long enough to find out that was absolutely nothing.I think my good friend Charlie Dent did have some discernment between the obstruction of 300 documents stored in Mar-a-Lago. And I think we're up to maybe 20 documents at the President's residence. I think one of the things that the American people are smart enough to realize is that we have to have a better system, whereby we have document retention and tracking, so things like this don't happen. And I think that's first. The second thing is the Biden administration does have to do a better job of explaining the how and the why and what exactly happened. And I think a lot of it's going to come down to two legal principles, the intent of the individual when these documents went into a private location, one. And two, the substance of these documents. I think those are the things that are going to matter the most. And three, I think, again, we're doing a disservice to many of the people viewing and around the world were really, really smart people, by lumping them all in together. This is nowhere near the obstruction that we saw from the Trump administration. It's nowhere near the falsifying legal documents of Trump's lawyers. This is nowhere near the voluminous nature of those documents. Yes, the President of the United States, this President has questions to answer. But let's pause on setting our hair on fire.",

And now you have, you know, the fifth batch of classified documents being found, of course, a much smaller volume.There's the key differences with the no 30, approximately, 30 for Biden, more than 300 for Trump, right? I mean, it's like not even in the same realm. And that is true. And also, they have -- the Biden team has been very cooperative as they have said, transparent with DOJ reaching out, being proactive, taking the initiative. So some key differences, but from a PR political perspective, Bakari, can you concede that this is bad?",

I think that there could be a question about intent. We just don't know the answer. I think there has been bad plays by this administration coming forth, but being forthcoming to the American people.The documents were found on November 2, why do we find out about them so late? Why was he just responding to questions when he was in California visiting the floods? This White House has to own this. This White House has to tell us whether or not this is a mistake. We have to understand the intent. To Charlie's point, Charlie asked questions. I would push back on the questions and then look over my client and say, answer them, answer Charlie's questions. They're good questions, I guess, but answer him because inquisitive minds want to know. So is this bad? No, I do not say that. But do they have to do a better job of handling the fallout and being transparent with people other than DOJ with journalists and the American public? The answer to that question is yes.
