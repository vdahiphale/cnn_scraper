Truly, moving north at about two miles per hour, you could walk faster than this storm. And it's really not going to move all that much in about the next 12 to 24 hours. In fact, the Monday morning position point looks awfully close to where it is now. But by Monday afternoon, you're going to start to notice this thing really take off into the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. When it does, we expect it to strengthen rather quickly because it's moving into a much more favorable environment. So as of right now, the National Hurricane Center is saying this is likely going to get to a high-end Category 1, possibly maybe even a Category 2 Hurricane before it pushes into Florida's western coast, likely between Tampa and Pensacola on Wednesday morning. Then from there, it will continue to spread into the Carolinas. Now, the more widespread concern is really going to be rainfall because this is going to affect everyone from Tallahassee, all the way up to the Outer Banks. Widespread totals, four to six inches, but eight or even 10 inches, not out of the question with this system. Winds will also be a concern, especially as it sliding up the coast. Now that wind is also going to push that water so you're going to have storm surge. It's also a concern. Keep in mind, too, Wednesday, the most likely landfall is also a supermoon. That's going to increase the potential for flooding in these areas as well. But even once the storm moves inland, keep in mind you're still going to have power outages across Georgia and the Carolinas as well. Now another storm that we're keeping an eye on, too. This is Hurricane Franklin, sustained winds right now about 100 miles per hour. This storm is going to continue to move to the northwest towards the United States before veering back away, but still Fred likely to have some impacts in the form of rip currents.",

Now the special counsel wants us to take place on January 2, 2024, about four months from now, and has said that his expects the prosecution case would take about four to six weeks. The former president's lawyers, however, they have a very different idea. They have proposed a trial date of April 2026. That is more than two years from now. They argue that four months is simply not enough time to prepare for this case, and also that this trial date, it would interfere with all of the other trials, of course that the president has. So we're going to have to see how the judge handles those two very different requests. Of course, this all plays out with the electoral calendar looming. If a trial were to start in January of next year, it'd be happening as the Republican presidential primaries begin. Now in Georgia, we're going to have a hearing for Mark Meadows, who has made a request to move his case from state to federal court. He is one of five of the 19 defendants in this racketeering case from the Fulton County district attorney who has made this request and it's significant because the former president, he is also expected to potentially make this same request. And now, why does it matter which venue this is in? Part of the reason is the jury pool. If this is a case that stays in Fulton County, that is where the jurors come from, and that is a very deep blue county. If this case is moved into federal court, the districts, the counties surrounding Fulton County, those will also be added to the potential jury pool, meaning there could be more potential pro-Trump jurors. So we're going to have to stay tuned to see how both of these hearings play out and what that means for the president's legal strategy next year -- Fred.",

You know, these women the pinnacle of their footy careers now all the attention and focus on that kissed placed by the Spanish football Federation president, Luis Rubiales on the lips of star player, Jennifer Hermoso. Now, we learned Spain's entire coaching staff from that World Cup victory, they resigned earlier this weekend in protest that Rubiales' actions, though I will say the head coach, Jorge Vilda is not among them, Vilda calling out Rubiales, in fact, overnight. This is really significant because he's the head coach, basically employed by Rubiales, his boss. He said in a statement: \"I am deeply sorry that the victory of Spanish women's football team has been harmed by the inappropriate behavior that are until now, top leader, Luis Rubiales has carried out and that he himself has recognized.\" Now you mentioned the Royal Spanish Football Federation Sexual Violence Advisory Committee, officially opening an investigation into the incident.

This according to an update again shared by authorities just a few moments ago, but it extends far beyond Louisville, and then of course Florida as this is yet another weekend that has been plagued by gun violence.I covered just yesterday in Boston, Massachusetts, a Caribbean Carnival Parade event there that had to be stopped after shots were fired. Now authorities are quick to point out that the shooting itself was not related to the event, but nonetheless sending shockwaves through that community. Several people injured there. Fortunately, nobody lost their lives. One person did however die at a shooting at a high school football event just outside of Oklahoma City, the victim just 16 years old. Authorities still investigating that one. They do say that the 16 year old was not a student at any one of the high schools that were facing off on the football field and that it was likely an argument between a couple of people that resulted in that. But then also another sporting event, this one in Chicago at a White Sox game where we had two people that resulted injured after shots were apparently fired. Authorities still working this case and still investigating, not sure if those shots came from inside or outside the field, but look, we go down this list knowing that there are many others that we're not covering, at least not at this particular moment. But to remind viewers of how gun violence has really touched on so many aspects of life. Just this map alone is quite telling. Sporting events, a Dollar Store in Florida, a carnival in Massachusetts. So it's certainly affecting Americans' lives. In fact, when you look at some research from the health policy organization, KFF, research that they've done shows that one in three Americans that were surveyed said that they are avoiding crowded spaces like music festivals, crowded bars, specifically because of the potential for gun violence. And then another sobering statistics this past July, according to the Gun Violence Archive, we surpassed 400 mass shootings. This is the latest number now, 473 which is extremely telling. In 2019, before the pandemic, it took 356 days, so almost the entire year to reach 400.

Trump's fourth indictment capped off yet another historic and sad week in the United States.Trump is now the first president in American history to have a mugshot and an inmate number to go along with it. Trump and his 18 co- defendants have all surrendered at the Fulton County Jail, and tomorrow, the legal fights are over who goes to trial where and when? Joining me right now is CNN presidential historian, Tim Naftali. He is also a former director of the Nixon Presidential Library. Oh, so good to see you. So put this into perspective for us. It's been an unprecedented week. And according to Trump's campaign, it has been a moment that he has been able to cash in on to the tune of $7 million in fundraising by having that mugshot. So help people understand. Is this a humiliating moment, you know, to have an arrest? Or is it a gain for this president?",

      "sentences": "Well, let's look at this in two different ways. In terms of fundraising, the former president has preyed on a lot of small donors, who are basically funding his defense. That is sad for our country, and it says a lot about how strong the cult of Donald Trump still is.But in the broader perspective, and that's the one that ultimately will determine the significance of all that we're watching today. In the broader significance, Donald Trump is not where he wants to be. He is at the center of two very difficult indictments connected to an attempt to overthrow an American election, and connected to an attempt to prevent a peaceful transfer of power. This is much bigger than Watergate. This kind of alleged crime strikes at the heart of our system. No person who has occupied the Oval Office is going to want to be associated with an attempt to overturn the office that he was sworn to defend and preserve. So I think in the long term, this is very harmful to President Trump, to his legacy. And I in fact, suspect that in a generation or so people will study Donald Trump the way they study Joseph McCarthy today. There will be a national consensus on the damage that this man did. It may take a generation or two to happen, but I think that's the direction that we're headed, given the seriousness of the charges in Atlanta and in the District of Columbia.",

So I would say that we have a lot of time until the convention, the Republican convention next summer. A year is a long time in history. It's a long time, and it's a super long time in politics. I would argue that we haven't yet seen the consequence of the drip, drip, drip that these indictments are having on Donald Trump's credibility.Sadly, people are going to continue to give him money to mount his defense, but that doesn't mean that the 60 percent of Republicans who aren't diehard MAGA people, and the Independents are going to wrap their arms around a convicted felon.",
