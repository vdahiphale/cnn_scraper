      "sentences": "You know, it is, John. We have noticed some subtle jabs at rivals in recent days on the campaign trail. And it indicates he's more willing to take a confrontational approach. He poked at former President Donald Trump for his coziness with Vladimir Putin. He dismissed Vivek Ramaswamy as a good showman who wouldn't support America's allies.He swiped at Governor DeSantis, Ambassador Haley, Governor Burgum for failing to endorse a national 15-week abortion ban, which you know, of course, John, he supports. One person close to the campaign telling us he just plans to be more aggressive in the next debate since he sort of faded to the background in the first debate. Now, out on the trail he laughed this off, joking with his supporters that some of his rivals perhaps just don't have no home training. But one adviser says he may be failing to capture the frustration of Republican primary voters. And so that's why we could see him continue to engage more forcefully in this contest, even though this cantankerous style is sort of -- these debates are a bad venue for his style. And he has to sort of strike the right balance here, right, because he doesn't want to come off as inauthentic if this is not who he is naturally. One thing is for sure, John, though, all indications are he has enough money to go the distance. The campaign announced in July it has more than $21 million in cash reserves. So, he can continue to articulate his message out on the trail.",

So, let's start where Eva left off, Tim Scott. Do you think this more confrontational approach from the senator will resonate? I mean clearly he has the money. Do you think that this shift in strategy will resonate?",

      "sentences": "I don't know. I don't know because I think the point that Eva made about authenticity is key. It's key in politics. It's key in these campaigns. People know Tim Scott to be a nice, decent, well-raised southern guy who says ma'am and sir and I - I - and who is optimistic. I certainly think he needs to be more aggressive about getting more time at the debates. I think he needs to be more aggressive about getting his points out.But I think it's very difficult for him to portray himself as somebody who he's not. In the same vein that, you know, Donald Trump's never going to be a humble guy, Ron DeSantis is never going to be a sociable, likeable guy. It's hard to imagine an aggressive Tim Scott. I think his optimism, his decency, his vision for America in a positive light are things that are strengths for him. I hope he doesn't lose them. And it, frankly, sets him apart from an entire field of people who are far more dark and just nastier than he is. He's - you know, you've got Nikki Haley running around calling everybody except herself old. You've got Donald Trump talking about revenge and retribution and carnage. You've got Ron DeSantis at war with Mickey Mouse. For me, a Tim Scott is a refreshing distinguished person on that stage.",

      "sentences": "Ana, let's circle back to Florida. DeSantis will be back on the campaign trail after focusing on leading Florida after Hurricane Idalia. Do you think -- we know you think that he shouldn't be focusing on the culture wars and fighting Mickey Mouse, as you just pointed out, but should he be leveraging his disaster management skills that supporters of his say are quite effective. Should he be leveraging that more in the presidential race? Would that help?",

      "sentences": "I've always wondered why he didn't leverage that more. Listen, I don't like Ron DeSantis. It's no secret. And I think he has been an effective leader when it comes to disaster management. I think that through the hurricanes here, through the building collapse in Surfside in south Florida, he has been good at that. I recognize that. I like that from him. It's one of the few things I like.And for some reason, instead of focusing on the positive Florida story, he's focused on DEI and CRT and ESG. He's focused on banning the alphabet for God's sakes. That is ridiculous. That doesn't get your gas tank full. That doesn't let you feed your family. That doesn't help you pay your bills. That doesn't help you get health insurance. And that's what he's focused on. And he sounds like a broken one-song record. And it's not getting him anywhere. The greatest problem Ron DeSantis has, though, is not what he's going to leverage or what he's not going to leverage. The greatest problem DeSantis has is Ron DeSantis. And the same way Tim Scott is widely liked by his colleagues and by people, is seen as a good guy and a nice guy, Ron DeSantis is seen as awkward, anti-social, not really having friends, whiney and not any - not somebody anybody wants to go have a beer with, right? And that, I don't know how Ron DeSantis changes. Not at this point. You only get one chance to make a first impression and he's made that first impression as a guy who was anything but likeable.",

In some ways this was a little bit of an unveiling, I think, of what he wants his economic campaign message to be. He had a riff in the middle there when he said, when the last guy was here. He didn't refer to Donald Trump by name, but he went on and on about, when the last guy was here. And he made the point, he didn't talk about Donald Trump's trials, the criminal charges against him. He talked about his economic record. He said Trump is one of two presidents to have lost jobs, to leave office with fewer jobs than when he started. And then he had a few other lines right there. Very interesting to see President Biden leaning into this now.Labor Day is the traditional kickoff of the campaign season, although we're a year away from the general election campaign for president.

And Maryland officials here expect 350,000 cars to travel through this spot over the entirety of the holiday weekend. All really fits in with this theme that this weekend is so big. The latest numbers from AAA, when you factor in flights, cruises, rental cars, hotels, labor day travel went up 4 percent this year compared to last year. One of the biggest obstacles is the price of gas. The average price for a gallon of gas right now, $3.81 according to AAA. That's about where we were this time last year, $3.78. But it's among the highest gas price we have seen all year. And drivers have been pretty aware about this. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
