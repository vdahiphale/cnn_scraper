      "sentences": "Well, the outcome of Russia`s election is already pretty clear. Opposition to Vladimir Putinhas been silenced. His biggest critic, Alexei Navalny, was buried earlier this month after dying suddenly in an Arctic penal colony amid wide-scale repressions, even mourners laying flowers at his memorial, hundreds of them were dragged away by the police. Earlier this week, Navalny`s Chief of Staff in exile was attacked with a hammer outside his home. Well, this Russian election is also, of course, taking place against the backdrop of a brutal war in Ukraine, with huge casualties on both sides. Russia has been gaining the upper hand amid Ukrainian shortages of weapons and ammunition, but recent dates have seen Ukraine step up drone attacks inside Russia, hitting Russian oil facilities in a bid to cause economic damage. Ukraine-based paramilitary groups opposed to the Kremlin have also been staging dramatic cross-border raids to try and make sure that as Russia`s elections get underway, ordinary Russians feel the impact of the Kremlin`s Ukraine war.

Let`s take it back to the 80s, because on September 9th, 1982, the commercial space age began with the launch of Conestoga 1. It was privately funded by a small Houston-based company called Space Services, Inc. of America. On Thursday morning, SpaceX launched the most powerful rocket in the world. It`s called Starship.

      "sentences": "Hear that rocket roar as the company`s third attempted launch in about a year was considered a success for the company, even though theylost communication with the craft before it crashed back to Earth. That`s because the mission reached several milestones, including making it further into this test flight than ever before. The first attempted launch of Starship last April ended in a midair explosion, and a second attempt in November started promisingly, but ended prematurely with an explosion and a loss of signal. As these tests continue, the goal of Starship is to assist NASA`s Artemis program, where it hopes to land U.S. astronauts on the moon as early as September of 2026. SpaceX also believes Starship can be an integral part in the company`s aspirations to eventually bring humans to Mars. During the month of March, Women`s History Month, we are highlighting seminal women who`ve transformed the world in profound ways, and today we want to recognize environmental activist Wangari Maathai. She was the first woman from Africa to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She dedicated her life to advocating for the protection of the environment and empowering Africa`s most impoverished people. Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, which helped plant more than 30 million trees there, an effort that inspired the United Nations to start its own campaign planting about 11 billion trees worldwide. Maathai`s tree planting efforts weren`t just about protecting the environment, they also provided locals, especially women, with the ability to earn money by selling seeds and access to resources for cooking and clean water. Next, we want to recognize Lise Meitner. Her knowledge in physics changed the world. Meitner and her colleagues learned that splitting atoms releases large amounts of energy, and she was the first person to describe and name the process of nuclear fission in a scientific paper. Though, she first worked as a physics professor in Germany, she had to flee from the Nazi regime there because of her Jewish ancestry. Later, she was asked to work on the Manhattan Project, which was a program during World War II to help develop the first nuclear weapons. But Meitner refused to take part on any collaboration of this program and stated, \"I will have nothing to do with a bomb.\" Today, the scientific community continues to acknowledge her brilliance by naming multiple prestigious physics awards after her, and guess what? There`s even a chemical element named after her, Meitnerium. For today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, it`s been almost a week since we pushed our clocks ahead an hour, lost an hour of sleep, so are you still feeling a little tired with this time change? I am. And there`s also this groggy doggie who`s feeling our pain. If we`re all feeling not caught up on our sleep, the Internet sensation struggled to wake up and start his shift at work. He looks over sheep at a farm in Virginia. Our Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
