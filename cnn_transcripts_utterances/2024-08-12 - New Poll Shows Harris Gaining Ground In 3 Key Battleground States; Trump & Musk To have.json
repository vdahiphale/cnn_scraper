Both men are notorious for leaning into conspiracy theories.And Trump is back to using that playbook once again. Over the weekend, he falsely claimed a photo showing a large crowd at one of Vice President Harris' events was generated by AI. Meantime, Harris has seen a groundswell of supports since stepping into the race just three weeks ago. New polls have her ahead among likely voters in some key battleground states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. Now, still important to note, these are all margin of error races, so no clear leader. CNN's Kristen Holmes is here with more. And Kristen, the former president certainly seems unsettled by all of this. It has knocked him off his game. And we're seeing him go back to kind of his comfort zone, in a way, with these personal attacks. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Yes. There's a lot of concern. It's not just the former president. It's also allies, donors who I've spoken to, who don't know what exactly this race is going to look like. And they're concerned at the way that Donald Trump is handling it.What they want is they want to see Donald Trump out there on the campaign trail, visiting these crucial battleground states. They want to see JD Vance by his side and they want to see him focusing on a variety of issues that they think make the case for Donald Trump. And that's particularly about immigration and inflation. Those are the things they believe that Donald Trump could focus on. You even heard Kevin McCarthy today talking about that, that he should - he being Donald Trump - should not be focused on crowd size, instead should be focused on Kamala Harris' policies, particularly the fact that Harris hasn't given out a detailed plan on that. But Donald Trump seems unable, at this point, to do so. He has been putting up these conspiracy theories on social media. And it's important to note, this is kind of the behavior we see from Donald Trump when he is in a position of vulnerability. He starts to listen to the people who are on the outer fringe of his orbit, and there are plenty of them, who put these forward, and then he promotes them. So what he does in the next couple of weeks, that's what's going to be really interesting. Because if you talk to the campaign, they believe that Harris is still on a bounce, that this is her kind of honeymoon period and they think it's going to last past the DNC. Of course, she's going to get a boost from that, just the way that Donald Trump did from the RNC. But where does she land, and what does Donald Trump do in the meantime? Because again, right now, he's not doing the things that Republicans really want him to be doing, the reason that these people were getting behind him, particularly the donors. Instead, he's kind of peddling in these fringe theories, which is really reminiscent to Donald Trump around 2020, 2016, the kind of behavior that we see from him whenever he is boxed into a situation like he's gotten into now.",

But no, of course, no, that's not the case. The reality is Donald Trump's obsession with crowds goes way back, right? It goes back to the days of \"The Apprentice\" when he cared deeply about the television ratings and would send me messages with his handwriting scrawled in black marker, pointing out how high his ratings were for \"The Apprentice.\" It does seem to me that he spirals whenever crowds are an issue. And I'm out with a new piece of The Atlantic today about how he tends to tell people to reject what they see with their own eyes and ears when he feels the most vulnerable.

You know, it'll be interesting to see where they go, what directions they take this questioning.Elon Musk recently said that civil war is inevitable. What a horrible thing, I think, to imagine, but there's Musk saying it's inevitable. Is that the kind of place he's going to take Trump down those kind of dark roads or is he going to provide Trump a space to recite, you know, the most advantageous talking points for Trump's candidacy? Because that's what Trump is doing today back on the site formerly known as Twitter. You know, for the first time, we see his campaign using X to promote his border talking points and other messages. Now, it's clearly not in Trump's voice because the messages Trump posts on his own platform, Truth Social, are much different, right?

That, of course, is a policy that former President Donald Trump also endorses and has been talking about for weeks.Now, just from listening to her on the campaign trail, she's had so many rallies all across the battleground states. She does talk about other economic issues. They include taking on price gouging, banning hidden fees and surprise late charges, and taking on corporate landlords and capping unfair rent increases. So these are things that she talks about all of the time. I suspect that these are going to be part of that economic policy vision.

I think they know with certainty, were they to do that, there would be a punishing response by Israel against an array of targets within Iran. That's number one.Number two is they also have to spend time, which I think they have over the course of the last week or so, building up diplomatic support. So they're talking to Russia, they're talking to China, they're trying to make sure India's in support. Even our NATO partner, Turkey, has got a role to play in all this. So I think they're spending time ensuring they've really shored that up. And then also, I think there are two additional factors, one is they're probably trying to move strike capabilities, maybe that's drones, maybe that's additional cruise missiles, in closer proximity to Israel. If you recall what happened two months ago with the strike, long closure time of drones launched from Iran gave everyone in the region a sense of what was going to happen next and allowed air defenses to respond really effectively. And then the third thing is, what is the internal narrative, the domestic narrative that Iran must send to its own people, which says we are responding, we are a sovereign nation, we reserve the right to do this. So they're working through all of those, I say those four factors, pretty aggressively. But I think the most important thing, Jessica, is that Iran does not want to muddy itself. It doesn't want to get its fingers dirty in a direct engagement with Israel. We're talking about an expansion of a broader war in the Mideast. If that happens, it's going to be as a result of excessive efforts on the part of Hezbollah. The Houthis in the Red Sea may begin to try to distract and force other nations to move forces down there to try to keep the Red Sea open. But I don't see Iran directly engaging.
