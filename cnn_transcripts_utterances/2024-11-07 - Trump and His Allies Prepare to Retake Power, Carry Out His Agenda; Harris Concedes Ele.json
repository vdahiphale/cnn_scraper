It is day two of Trump's 2025 transition and the political laundry list of things to do is right now quite long.This morning, new cabinet names are being floated with almost everyone in the world wondering what will become of Donald Trump's day one promises, his legal cases and power in Congress. Balance of power in the House, still up for grabs. Will Republicans officially win enough outstanding races today? Will Republicans maintain power in the House, or something else? Will Democrats eke it out? We will see. Alayna Treene leads us off from outside Mar-a-Lago at this hour.

Very unclear what type of role he would serve, but I've been told that Donald Trump has said he wants someone like Witkoff, who has a vast business experience, to have some sort of role. We also, of course, know that Donald Trump has consistently touted wanting to have Elon Musk and RFK Jr. serving some role as well. Elon Musk has really committed himself to this government efficiency program. He's expected to do something like that, even though Donald Trump has admitted that he would like him for a certain secretary position. He has said that Musk is not interested in that. RFK Jr., for his part, is probably going to have some sort of role in health care. But we are told that as of now, a lot of people don't think he'll actually be the pick for the secretary of Health and Human Services. Kate?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this speech will really give President Biden the opportunity to reflect publicly for the first time on the results of this election, as voters decided to send former President Donald Trump back to the White House. The president is likely to talk about the need for the country to move forward. We heard from him yesterday in a statement where he praised Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that she ran a historic campaign under extraordinary circumstances. But certainly, this will give Biden the first opportunity to really present his thoughts to the American people.Now, last night, I'm told that the president did speak by phone with his staff here at the White House, where he had a message that they should be proud of what they have accomplished. The president, I'm told in this call, had said, quote, while I am sure you're all feeling a variety of emotion today. I hope there's one emotion you didn't lose sight of. That's pride, pride in everything we've accomplished. So, this could also be a chance for President Biden to tick through some of the initiatives that he believes could have lasting impact in this country. But we're told that the president will also have a big focus in his speech about the transition and the path forward. Advisers have said that the president is intent on ensuring there's a peaceful transfer of power, something that was not afforded to him back in 2020 when Trump was in the White House. President Biden has already spoken by phone with Trump to congratulate him and has invited him here to the White House. The two sides are working on trying to set a date for that meeting. But another big question heading into the speech is whether President Biden will acknowledge or try to address what exactly went wrong for Democrats here. There has been a lot of soul searching, a lot of questions about strategy over the past 48 hours within the Democratic Party. And there's been a lot of blame heading towards President Biden's way. There are some who believe he should not have sought a second term to begin with. Of course, there are his own advisers who may feel otherwise. But, certainly, this is something that Biden will have to face going forward at a time when he's facing this new reality that the man that he had once defeated is set to return for another four years here at the White House.",

They want to get more aid to Ukraine. They're also working to ensure they have rules and implementation for some of the laws that have been passed, things relating to climate and the environment as well as potentially trying to push through some additional judicial nominations. Now, President Biden next week is set to attend a pair of summits, the G20 and the APEC, which will put him right in front of many of the world leaders who are also grappling now with the future of a Trump presidency.

This is something that we did see coming as this case has long been known that it would never go to trial. But now, Jack Smith, with Trump's ability to fire Jack Smith, he is preemptively going to take this case, pack it up, and go home.

The future of them remains uncertain. In Georgia, that state level case revolves around the 2020 election and Donald Trump's alleged efforts to overturn his previous election loss.That case has been on hold for months now as an appeals court is considering whether or not to disqualify Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis. There will be a hearing later this year on that issue and whether or not Fani Willis is disqualified could impact the future of this case. If she is removed, we're told that it's unlikely any other prosecutor will pick this up. And even if she's allowed to remain on the case we're told that it's unclear if a judge will allow proceedings to continue while Donald Trump is president. So, this case really does look like it's going to remain in limbo, at least while Donald Trump is in office. And in the hush money case, where Donald Trump was set to be sentenced later this month, Donald Trump's team is going to argue that that should not happen, basically saying that a president-elect cannot be sentenced. So, all these criminal cases impacted by that strategy by Trump's team, the delay, delay, delay, clearly, that's been successful.",

But experts say some of those promises could make inflation worse, depending on if he carries out some of his plans. CNN's Matt Egan is joining me now with reporting on this morning. Matt, what can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, it looks like high inflation really played a central role in returning Donald Trump to the White House. Voters made clear that they are fed up, fed up with high prices at the supermarket, with high rates for car insurance, everything is else. A CNN exit poll found that about two thirds of Americans described the economy as not good or poor. Just 31 percent said excellent or good. And among those who gave the economy poor marks, they broke heavily in favor of Trump.Now, we know that the rate of inflation is down. That's what economists and the Fed look at, but the level of prices is not. And that's what consumers think about. Each month, the typical U.S. household has to spend about $1,100 more than they did at the start of the Biden administration to buy the same basket of goods and services. Wages are up but not enough for far too many people. Now, Trump has promised to confront inflation head on by really shaking things up. He's called for cutting red tape, tax cuts, mass deportations, and massive tariffs. The problem, though, is that a lot of mainstream economists, they warn that this Trump agenda is inflationary, perhaps very inflationary. In particular, deporting millions of undocumented workers, that's something that could end up depriving some industries of workers, causing them to raise wages and prices. And, yes, tariffs. I mean, tariffs are taxes on imports and often companies pass those costs along to consumers. The Peterson Institute has found that the typical U.S. household would face extra costs of at least $2,600 due to the Trump tariffs. And that doesn't even include likely retaliation from other countries. Now, it's too early to know how many of Trump's campaign promises will actually become a reality. Perhaps he doesn't really plan to put tariffs on all $3 trillion of U.S. imports. But, Sara, how this plays out in the coming months will be crucial, because we know that inflation really haunted Vice President Harris and President Biden, and it could cost Trump too if he's not careful here.",
