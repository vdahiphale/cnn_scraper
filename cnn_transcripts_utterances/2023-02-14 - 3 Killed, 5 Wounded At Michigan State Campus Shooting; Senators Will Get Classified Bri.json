The first 911 calls were made around 8:20 Monday night. Shots fired at Berkey Hall, home to the school's social science department and located on the northern edge of the East Lansing campus. As police arrived, they responded to a second shooting reported at the nearby University Union building, which is where the gunman was last seen fleeing on foot. A few hours later he was found by police on a nearby street, and it was then he fatally shot himself. At last report, his identity was unknown, also a motive unknown. When the shooting began, campus police sent an email alert urging students and staff to secure in place at this hour that lockdown has been lifted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I sprinted out there as fast as I can into the woods, and then from there I thought, you know, I thought the side of the campus would be safe. And then I got a text from my brother saying that they're over near that area. And then I entered Acres. When I came into Acres, people started running, telling me to run, that they came into Acres. So it was just a terrifying experience.(END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: Joining me now from New York, CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz, in Washington, seat and senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe and national Security analyst Sean Turner, who is Lansing at the moment, and CNN's Juliette Kayyem.

      "sentences": "Right, so we're about what? Five hours or so around, as you said, 20 after eight, there was a first call of shots fired. And what we've learned from police is that they went from that one location at one of the areas, Berkey, that building that the gunman then went to a second building, Union Hall, where he shot and killed one victim. Two others were killed at Berkey, so that's three dead, and then five are in the hospital, some with life threatening injuries.And then after the incident, police a short time after that released a photo of who they believed was the gunman. And then sometime after that is when they encountered him. A police officer encountered him and the gunman shot himself, according to police. So now the whole thing is underway to try and identify him to try and figure out exactly who he is, if he has any affiliation to the campus. So that is what the work that's underway now by authorities as they try and figure out a motive, any affiliation or any other information. Police at this point are not identifying any of the victims. As you can imagine, many of the family members are still trying to be notified. They have not been notified yet. And the other thing that's very important is that police are saying that it's safe now, they're on campus and that the threat is over. So students can go out, go about their business, be with their fellow classmates, students together, because this is going to just be a really rough few days for those folks on that campus.",

And so we can use those indicators to try to prevent acts of mass shooting in the future and also to understand whether or not this was an act that was motivated by individual grievances and, you know, kind of very specific motivations to this person. Or was it some act that was engaged in an act of allegiance to a larger, you know, ideology or political movement or something along those lines.So, yes, it helps us to understand why people engage in this terrible activity, but it doesn't stop it.

      "sentences": "Yes, in the midst of this tragedy right now in the community, there is a sense of relief that the threat has been neutralized. But as I've been saying throughout the day, East Lansing, the Michigan State University community is a very tight knit, a very close community. Most of the people who live in this community outside of the university have some affiliation with the university.And so over the coming days, it will be all about healing, it will be about working with each other to help everyone get through this. We've got a lot of students here on campus who will need help, to be quite frank, to get through this. But when we think about what happened here tonight, that union, that student union where the second incident happened, that is a gathering place for our students here on campus. It's a place where they go to be among friends and to take a break from academics and to be students on campus, to have a college experience. And so for that space to be violated, for something like that to happen in that space, it is really going to stick with these students. It's going to have an impact across this campus. But fortunately, as I said, this is a campus that loves Michigan State University. They love the students who are here. And so over the coming days, it's really just going to be about coming together as a family and making sure that everyone here gets through this. VAUSE: And Juliette, I've lost count of the number of times we've talked about mass shootings over the years, but yet another one here. So, when you look at the situation where these buildings were located relative to the rest of the campus, so the northern part of the campus, right by a road. And so, as far as security goes, as far as any deterrence to this government to actually gain access to those buildings. It doesn't appear that there was much. But they shouldn't be that kind of security on a campus. So it then gets to the question. Like, how did this guy get on? Why did he choose those buildings? Were they targets of opportunity? Was there something else there? You know, from what we know at this point, what do you think?",

      "sentences": "Right, so it appears it was a handgun. If you look at that photo, I think that's our probably our best evidence of the weapon that was used. You can -- the photo that the police released of the gunman, you see a handgun in his right arm. So that's what we believed was used, which you know, certainly so many of the mass shootings that we covered. We see long guns, rifles. And so in this situation it appears that it was a handgun.You know, your point about access to the school, it seems he was just easily able to open that door. We don't know which building this is. There are two buildings where the shootings occur. We don't know which building this is in. I mean, it just, you know, this is -- there's some public access here from my understanding, from some folks who've been tweeting at me who go there or are familiar with the campus. So they said that there was public access. So, I mean, that certainly struck me that he was able to open that door. And so I guess the other thing that they really need to figure out and hopefully we'll know here soon and may perhaps is whether or not he had any kind of affiliation to the school, because it does appear that this wasn't random. It does appear that there was some planning that went into this and he seemed to know, seem but, you know, of course that could change where to go. So --but yes, the handgun, it appears was used in this situation. And the other thing is that what's also interesting is the fact that the shooting stops in one area, in one of the buildings, the Union Hall, the Union Building. And we don't really know yet why it stops. So that's going to be certainly something that's going to be interesting to hear about.",

Police say a gunman suspected of killing at least three people on the Michigan State University campus is dead, apparently from a self- inflicted gunshot wound. They made that announcement less than an hour ago. At least five other victims were taken to hospital, some with life threatening injuries.Police released this image of the suspect. Still do not know his identity. They say the motive for the mass shooting is not known. Officials say there is no longer a threat to the campus and a shelter in place order has been lifted. Mystery continues to surround the three objects shot down in as many days by the U.S. Air Force. Senators on Capitol Hill will receive a classified briefing in a few hours. Publicly, though, U.S. authorities have been unwilling to say or speculate where all three objects came from. Unlike the suspected China spy balloon shot down more than a week ago. This is what we know right now about the three unidentified objects. The one shot down on Friday over Alaska has been described as a metallic object that broke into several pieces. It's believed to be carrying a known payload, just like the one shot down over Canada on Saturday. All three objects apparently look similar, but are different shapes, but none are as large as the Chinese spy balloon. And just off the coast of South Carolina, the U.S. Navy and Coastguard have almost finished recovering debris from what's left of the China balloon. But their search will now move further from the coast for any parts which may have drifted out to sea. And right now, there are a lot of theories about precisely what the mystery objects might be, but one possibility has been ruled out. The White House says there are no indications the objects are from outer space or are linked to extraterrestrial activity. Details are from Phil Mattingly reporting in from Washington.

But the judge says the introduction and the conclusion and another potentially important section of this report could be made public -- a section about whether any witnesses potentially perjured themselves when they came before the special grand jury.

We have health care and first responders from all over mid-Michigan, from all over Michigan who answered the call and rushed to campus to help. I've been in constant contact with Mayor Ron Bacon of East Lansing, who is at the police station. He wants to be here but he has been in the police station coordinating along with my chief, along with state police, along with the county and several others.

It's time for us provide the resources that our families need, our residents need. I've heard from residents and families all throughout the city of Lansing in addition to East Lansing and from all over Michigan.

Over my right shoulder is our vice president for public safety and chief of police Marlon Lynch.And I want to start by saying that we have been committed to being as transparent as possible and sharing as much information as we can since the start of this horrific incident. I stand before you with a few minor updates that will provide and then we will open it up for a couple of questions. Please keep in mind that there is not much new information that we have since we last had a briefing about an hour ago. I will start by sharing an update that the five victims that were transported to the hospital transported to Sparrow Hospital in Lansing. All five of those victims remain in critical condition. I will also share that the incident that occurred off campus with the suspect occurred in the city of Lansing, off campus. That suspect is, we now know, is a 43-year-old male. That 43 year old male is not affiliated in any way with Michigan State University. He's not a student, faculty, staff. And we have no idea why he came to campus to do this tonight. That is part of our ongoing investigation. As the president said, we know this news is so difficult for those in our campus community and beyond. It is important to remember that the grief some individuals may be experiencing is normal and there are a number of ways that individuals can seek support, including talking with friends, families, and colleagues. After this briefing we will be sharing supportive resources through our police and public safety social media pages that we have been asking people to follow, as well as the university communications, highlighting other resources that are available in addition to the event tomorrow at the Hanna Community Center.

We will continue to have these updates with our community as well as with media moving forward. It is the process, the answers will come, hopefully what has been shared to this point is enough to assist in what we are all trying to do, which is to recover at this point. The next couple of days, as you've heard from President Woodruff and also Deputy Chief Rozman, in regards to resources that will be available by those that are impacted. If you witnessed people that need assistance, please speak up. Encourage them to seek help. Sometimes they are just unable to do it alone, and sometimes they just need to have a little assistance to get them going with that. Those resources will be available. We will now take questions.",

We know that during an incident involving an active shooter that providing clear instructions to the community and in terms of actions sway is very important. And that is why we've pushed the information out very quickly that there was a incident occurring, to shelter in place; to run, hide and fight. And we implemented training we've had in place. the emergency plans that we have had in place. And we institute the training that not only the officers had but that we've trained our community how to respond to an incident like this as well.
