President Biden has been briefed on the raid which injured seven U.S. troops and killed 15 members of the radical group ISIS. The raid happened Thursday in Iraq. Two of the seven U.S. troops were evacuated from the area for further treatment. U.S. Central Command, which manages operations in the Middle East, they said that the operation targeted ISIS leaders in order to disrupt the group's ability to plan for their attacks. For more, we have CNN's Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh joining us from London. Nick, what do we know about this American operation?",

He referred to the two months that were spent gathering intelligence ahead of this operation and the four hideouts that were targeted that appear to be considered camouflage of some description, which would suggest a sort of camp of some description. This is Anbar province, desert, very sparsely populated the most of times. So we're sort of looking, I think, possibly at some kind of remote hideout here that was hit at 4But then at 4:00 this morning, local time Saturday, that area was indeed surveyed by the Iraqis who got to the site itself, able to survey the damage and arrested two other individuals on the site there. The American injured you spoke to, this is clearly a sign of an operation that did not go according to plan. Five injured it seems in the clashes and then two more by a fall. Two of those seven injured requiring further treatment out of theatre, so suggesting more severe injuries. But, Alex, I should point out, you know, this is part of a pattern of raids against ISIS happening in Iraq and Syria over the past years that have often gone unnoticed so much that by the administration's messaging now is that terrorism is no longer really a problem in daily life. And indeed, outside of some rare singular examples, it isn't the same sort of sense of heightened threat that we saw over 10 years ago. And indeed, in Europe, too, instances pop up, and these appear to be singular actors at times more horrifically in Europe, teenagers. But it's in places like Iraq and Syria, where there do appear to be legacy groups rebuilding in number. 2,500, according to recent U.S. official statements. And indeed, they've been warning how there appears to be some sort of regrouping devices, purely down to the fact that they appear to be seeing nearly twice as many missions in the first part of this year against ISIS. And they saw in the same period in the previous year, 96 in the early months of this year, resulting in 44 ISIS operatives being killed and 166 detained. That's in the first six months of this year. So stark numbers here showing the persistent threat. Now, actually, you've got to ask yourself, why is this still happening? Wasn't this all taken care of? In the defeat of ISIS in 2019, well, look, we are -- we're dealing with a group whose existence wasn't purely based on the sort of warped notions of Islamism. They often sprung out of parts of the Syrian civil war, the Iraqi resistance against the American military presence in Iraq, and melded into this horrific caliphate that we saw for a number of years. But there's not been the political solution to both of those particular causes now, and clearly the extremist elements have stuck around in the desert and begun to reformulate now into this threat, which today has in its confrontation resulted in seven Americans being injured, Alex.",

He will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies for any women, even though they are pregnant. And understand, he is not done.As part of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, threaten access to fertility treatments, and ban abortion nationwide, with or without Congress.\" She goes on to say, \"The choice in this election is clear.\" Now, the Vice President has been the leading voice for the campaign, even before it was the Harris campaign on this very issue. She kicked off her own reproductive rights tour at the beginning of the year. It was actually during that time that she coined the term Trump abortion ban. And that is what we're going to hear a lot more of especially next week. That is when the Harris campaign will be launching their own reproductive rights tour. This is going to be mostly surrogates. It kicks off on Tuesday in Florida. So they're clearly putting a big focus on that state as -- especially in light of what former president Donald Trump said. It'll include at least 50 stops.

There's a lot of details that will be trickling out about what exactly this will look like and where they're going.
