So low that a lot of them pay very little or almost nothing in federal income taxes, so they wouldn't benefit at all from this policy. That's why some of the experts I'm talking to, they say that yes, this is good politics, but no, it's bad policy.I talked to Steve Rosenthal at the -- he's a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

It's very easy to see how high earners could try to game the system.That's why the Harris campaign says they would have two safeguards here. One, there would be an income limit as far as who this applies to. And two, they say they'd have requirements to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers specifically from benefiting. Of course, implementing those safeguards would be tricky. The devil here would be in the details. One last point here, Dana, is this would be expensive. There are estimates that this would cost tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. By no means would this be a cheap campaign proposal or cheap campaign promise rather to keep.",

They are trying to win Nevada, those crucial six electoral votes that could swing the election.And they are trying to talk about the economy in ways that will reach people who have been concerned about the economy, who have been saying that they don't like the amount of inflation, who have been saying that it's been a stretch just to make ends meet. And so Kamala Harris has a very difficult task because she is the incumbent. She is the Vice President, but she's the part of the administration that is in charge while people are struggling. And so she needs to come up with new ideas, and she needs to compete with Donald Trump, who, so far, has been in a better position on the economy, and that's what she's trying to do. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: I mean, to steal one line from Matt, the goal here is simple. He said it's to increase take home pay for workers. No, it's not. It's to win votes in Clark County. Let's be candid about this. In the genesis of Trump coming to this, he actually told it at the convention where he was actually at a dinner in Las Vegas where he asked a waitress about this. That's how the topic came up. At least that's his version of how he came up with the idea. And to his credit, it caught on and it became -- despite he has a campaign with actually a lot of pretty detailed policy ideas, or at least they had them on their website to the extent he talks about them, depends on the day. But on this issue, he has talked about it constantly because he realized that it caught, and people paid attention to it, and it really kind of took off, and now you see the Democratic candidate feel like they need to co-opt it. I think the reality, though, as Matt laid out so eloquently, is from a tax policy perspective, it's a really terrible policy idea when you talk to economists because not only is it really, really complex to actually put into place, it would probably wouldn't hit the kind of the people that you're trying to affect here, but also just tax behavior in general. Every company is going to shift likely companies would actually end up doing better than workers. But it works on the trail and I'm thrilled and we're three former Bloomberg reporters here --",
