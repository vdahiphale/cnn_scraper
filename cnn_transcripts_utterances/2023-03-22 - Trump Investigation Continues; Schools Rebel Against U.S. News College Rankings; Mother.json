This is the investigation into the hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.And on Friday of this week, one of Donald Trump's own lawyers will have to testify to another grand jury that is looking into the handling of those classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago. So, how is Donald Trump preparing for the possibility of these indictments? Here with me, we have CNN political commentators S.E. Cupp and Van Jones. We have CNN legal analyst Elie Honig and CNN political commentator Scott Jennings. Guys, great to have you here. Okay, Elie, tell us the significance of the development today of Donald Trump's attorney and then Corcoran who now is being ordered by an appeals court to testify.",

So, DOJ questions Corcoran. He invokes attorney-client privilege. DOJ goes to the judge and says, crime fraud exception, meaning we believe these conversations between Corcoran and Trump were part of an ongoing crime, and the judge agrees. And today, a court of appeals panel, all three judges agreed. So now Corcoran has to go in and DOJ gets to say, tell us about those critical conversations you had with Donald Trump. CAMEROTA:  Scott? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDNET TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  Yeah, sounds great. (LAUGHTER) I mean, my legal opinion, uh -- I mean, I guess in the -- I mean, in the grand pantheon -- I mean, he's got two -- He's got sex paperwork in one place and he's got classified paperwork in the other. So, the classified paperwork sounds more important to me, particularly since his lawyers now got to go in and talk about it. So, I think that's probably -- you know, if you're an American person trying to figure out what's going on here, strikes me that that case, Elie, is the vital one here.",

I don't know that I've ever seen a witness grinding an ax more intently than Michael Cohen. And also, there is this notion that Michael Cohen says all the time as well. I turned this corner when I turned on Trump and I've only told the truth since then. Not quite true because since then, he tried to cooperate with my former office, the Southern District of New York, and they rejected him. They wrote in his sentencing letter to the judge, he tried to cooperate, he came in and told us some things, but we didn't sign him as a cooperator because we do not believe he was fully forthcoming, he wouldn't answer our questions fully and honestly.

There's a perverse logic here, which is, how do you know a school is great? How many kids you reject? If you have an acceptance rate that's very low, if you reject a bunch of kids, you're a great school. Now, if you accept them and make them better, if you reject them, that's sick. And then when they leave, not how much of a difference do they make? How much money do they make?
