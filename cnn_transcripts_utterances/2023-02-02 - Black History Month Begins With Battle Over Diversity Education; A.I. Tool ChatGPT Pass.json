They have already made it clear that they don't want to teach in Florida or send your students here to Florida. So, it is going to alter recruitment.I know the governor just put his budget yesterday, $115 million, as he has already just dissolved new college and their board and fired the president, and now they have to put money behind to recruit teachers and recruit students. That is not going to solve the problem. People come to the state of Florida for more than just the beaches and more than just our good weather. They come here for our education system also.",
