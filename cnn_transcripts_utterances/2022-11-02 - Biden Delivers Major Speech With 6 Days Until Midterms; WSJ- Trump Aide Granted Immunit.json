We're going to bring it to you live.Plus, desperate emails between Trump attorneys revealing they viewed Justice Clarence Thomas as key to stopping the certification of the 2020 election. And Russian commanders are discussing using nuclear tactical weapons. The former director of national intelligence is my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Biden's major speech this hour, with just six days until election day, President Biden any moment now will deliver a major speech. The topic is the threat to democracy, and it comes on the heels of a violent attack on the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul. Biden betting this will turn the tide of the midterms. But as he prepares to speak, only 9 percent of likely voters say voting rights and election integrity are the most important issues to them. Fifty- one percent say the economy is their number one concern, 51 percent. And today, that issue was front burner. The Fed raising interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point. Rates have been rising at an unprecedented pace with mortgage rates now above 7 percent for the first time in 20 years. And you can see the stage there where President Biden will be speaking in just moments from now. Phil Mattingly is OUTFRONT live where Biden is about to speak. And, Phil, this is obviously an important speech. They have put a lot of time into this.",

Al has been in the midst of this. He's experienced facing death threats and the political violence. Let me start with you, Al. He laid out here in detail what was at risk. At the beginning I was sort of sitting here with you watching you as he was laying out in graphic detail what happened to Paul Pelosi, right? He didn't mince words. He said he came in with a hammer to smash Paul's skull. He wanted people to understand the graphic nature of the violence. And that's something that you've experienced yourself. Did you think he met the moment with that?

As high-minded and high-brow and important ideologically, philosophically about democracy this was, this was also a speech intentionally given this close to the election because even though the threat against democracy does not rank even close to the highest on the list, which is the economy, people in the White House, Democrats who I talked to say that it matters as a base motivator -- particularly for what they see as the, quote/unquote, Biden coalition, people who came out, voted for him in 2020, may not be that excited about voting in a midterm but might actually listen to the stakes as he laid them out and say, \"Okay, fine, I'll go vote.\" It is very much also a get out the vote speech.",

And what Joe Biden gave tonight was a closing argument for all of those voters in the middle of the country who are not sure, they're not partisan Democrats, they're not partisan Republicans. But remember you're American and remember that this is the United States of America. And he's not talking about all Republicans. He's not talking about all Democrats. But what he is saying is that \"We are united as one, and democracy should matter\". And so in those elections where individuals literally despise both candidates -- and we saw that in 2016 with Trump and Clinton, but we saw that Donald Trump actually won those voters who disapproved of both candidates. I anticipate you'll see that in places like Georgia where there are some voters who disapprove of Warnock and some voters who disapprove of Walker. And what the president did tonight was put a pin and a litmus test and say, we're all Americans, vote for those who will stand for freedom and democracy. And he was strong and sharp.

The window was broken in by the attacker. Even the words there seem to me to be very considered.He then ended with: This is the path to chaos to America. It's unprecedented, it's unlawful, and it's un-American. Phil, how -- how bad are things in this country right now?

They assume that they can walk down the street and that their trip to the grocery store will be safe.Boy, I did not see that around most of the world. That's a thin line between safety and lack of safety. They assume that they will be able to vote in 2024 and 2028 without restrictions on their voting. I did not see that when I traveled the world. Let me cut to the chase here. When you have leadership, not just the population, but leadership telling you not to trust institutions and not to trust the vote, this -- and is why I'm surprised -- starts looking to me like some of the semi-authoritarian places I traveled around the world.

He said people need to be informed, engaged, and patient. And he did that in the context of explaining that 27 million people have already voted, and those votes will not start to be counted until after the polls close. So the results we see on election night may be very different than the results we see, he said, a couple of days later. That's what happened last time, and that vacuum, that change, right, because it was a change in how things looked, is where the conspiracy theories flooded in. Do people understand -- what more can be done for people to understand this, that what you see at 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday night may not be what you see at 9:00 p.m. on Thursday night? AL SCHMIDT, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, COMMITTEE OF SEVENTY:  And, you know, as soon as he said patience, I wrote it down right away and ended up scribbling \"patience is a virtue\", because when it comes to elections right now, it really is. There's a real vulnerability, I think, in the strength of our democracy in that window between when the last vote is cast and the last vote is counted. And the more expeditiously that gets done with maximum integrity to, in no way, you know, jeopardize the legitimacy of the election, I think is really important. And it's something that I think secretaries of state across the country have really stressed that you need to have patience, especially in states like Pennsylvania where we can't begin processing mail-in ballot envelopes until election morning in a state that's so evenly divided and with a very close Senate race on the horizon.",

So, what we're told is that Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is the head of that mercenary force Wagner Group, he actually confronted Putin directly last month about the war in Ukraine saying that he believes that it's being completely mismanaged and that the generals that Putin has put in charge are completely botching the war effort there.And this was deemed significant enough, this meeting, presidential daily brief. The reason why the U.S. intelligence community found this meeting so interesting is because it says a lot about Prigozhin's ambitions and also his standing within Putin's inner circle. It's not just anyone who can confront Putin directly on this kind of thing. Members of Putin's inner circle don't usually descent openly to his policies. But it also says a lot about Prigozhin's ambitions, because what we are told is that he has become more and more embolden in terms of challenging the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu for influence. And, of course, he's been telling people he wants more resources, more responsibility, more everything really for Wagner forces, who are notoriously brutal and who are operating in Ukraine at a large scale, upwards of 5,000 mercenaries now operating in Ukraine. So, the Kremlin is really walking this tight rope, Putin in particular, because it's not only Prigozhin who has confronted him. It's other senior officials who are saying you need to change something about the way this war is going. U.S. intelligence officials are concerned about that. Some of these officials are saying you need to do something more, potentially drastic. Erin? BURNETT:  All right. Natasha, thank you very much. And a significant detail there from Natasha, right, not confronting to say, oh, you shouldn't have done this, confronting to say, you need to do more, you need to up the ante, right? So, that -- that particular angle. I want to bring in now, the former director of national intelligence in the Obama administration, the retired Lieutenant General James Clapper. Director Clapper, so let's just start with that. Prigozhin's power, look, he's been a crucial player here. It has no doubt increased quite quickly. What does that say to you? Is that a threat just to the Minister of Defense Shoigu? Is he a threat to Putin? What's actually happening here?",

This is just what's visible to us.The other thing about it is I think it is a dramatic comment on the erosion of the prestige and stature of the Russian military. When someone like this, a private -- an oligarch with a private army gets direct access to Putin and complains about the performance of the Russian military, which is accurate. And the other thing about it is I think it does speak to the erosion of Putin's power and the fear and the intimidation factor that has prevailed with him for years. Now it seems to be dissipating.
