And he's the author of the upcoming book, \"How Medicine Works and When It Doesn't.\" Dr. Wilson, good to see you again. Let's start with this record number of new daily cases in China. Despite all of the lockdowns and the mitigations, why is this happening? DR. F. PERRY WILSON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE &amp; AUTHOR: Well, China's quite literally the last place on earth where the majority of the population has not been infected with COVID. And so there's a huge susceptible population. The vaccination program in China has been OK. But using vaccines that might not be as potent as the vaccines that are available in the West. And furthermore, and potentially more concerning, the distribution of vaccination in China is almost exactly the reverse of what you see in the U.S., where older people are less likely to be vaccinated than younger people. And that's a real recipe for disaster, because, as we all know by now, COVID is much more severe the older people are. So, I think there might be a lot of pain, a lot of hurt coming in the future.",

But I will say that they're really trying to hold back the tide here on two fronts.Number one, they're dealing with variants of the coronavirus now that are eight to 10 times more transmissible than the original coronavirus. So, maybe it would have been possible back when this all started years ago, to attain some zero-COVID. It's not now. The level of contagion is simply too high. The second thing they have to fight against is the will of the people to tolerate these policies. And despite, you know, conditioning by what amounts to a totalitarian regime, you can see that, you know, humanity can only be pushed so far before they start to push back. And I think this is a losing battle for the government of China at this point.",

The big question is, will our level of vaccination keep the people hospitalized and dying with COVID steady? If so, people will miss work and that will be problematic.

They accused the rapper of verbal abuse, bullying, offensive remarks, especially towards women. The letter also claims that senior leaders at Adidas turned a blind eye to the abuse. The company ended its partnership, you'll remember, with Ye after he made a series of anti-Semitic remarks in recent marks. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is with me now. So do we know yet how Adidas is handling these accusations that got in the letter? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: They are currently investigating right now. This is because a \"Rolling Stone\" report laid out that they received this anonymous letter from high- level employees at Yeezy that was sent to the executive board at Adidas, laying out this misconduct. And also encouraging the board to investigate Kanye West and address these issues and, quote, \"the toxic and chaotic environment\" that Kanye West created. Some of these alleged misconduct allegations include verbal abuse, bullying, offensive remarks, particularly aimed at women, and also sexual harassment. The letter, exclusively obtained by \"Rolling Stone,\" also lays out that Adidas knew about Kanye West's behavior, did nothing about it, and ignored it. Now we have Adidas coming out with a statement on this. And it reads in part: Quote, \"It is currently not clear whether the accusations made in an anonymous letter are true. However, we take these allegations very seriously, and have taken the decision to launch an independent investigation of the matter immediately to address the allegations.\" And of course, Kanye West and Adidas had a very successful partnership for about 10 years, until the company decided to end that partnership because of anti-Semitic remarks that Kanye West made. Also right now, Kanye West does not have a publicist, and he does not have a lawyer representing him in this matter. However, we did reach out to an associate of Kanye West and the brand, Yeezy, to try to get comment on these allegations. We have not heard back yet. But of course, Kanye West is back on Twitter. He can make a statement publicly on this, which he is known to do on past issues. But, Victor, we haven't heard anything from West just Yet -- Victor?",

There's a new study that says, no, somebody made that up.Let's bring in CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen. What are the facts around how much water we need? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, Victor, it's so interesting. No one knows exactly where that \"eight cups of day\" comes from. Some people think it was a 1945 government recommendation that got misunderstood. So it was ages ago. And it was misunderstood. So not clear where it came from, but it's basically sort of an adage at this point. When you go to the CDC Web site, they don't have any particular amount. They don't say get X number of glasses of water. And we don't get all of our water from drinks. We get a lot from the food that we eat. But this new study is so interesting. What these researchers did is they looked at 5,600 study participants from all over the world. They gave them water to drink. And the water had isotopes in it so that they could follow how much was being used by their bodies and how much was being excreted out. And they had some interesting findings. What they found was that what people used every day, it ranged from four cups a day for some people to 25 cups a day for others. That's a huge difference. That's why the CDC doesn't make a single recommendation. Everyone is so different. One of the biggest differences here is the amount of physical activity. That's going to make a big difference. Gender makes a difference. Men use up more water than women do. Size, your weight also makes a difference. And so does climate. If you live in a hot and humid place, you are going to need more water. So for that reason, the CDC doesn't make a specific recommendation. This study found human beings need such a wide variety, differences in amounts.",

Look at the color. The Cleveland Clinic does a wonderful job of laying out what color you should be looking for. If your pee is, like, a pale kind of straw color, that's great. You are well hydrated. If it's sort of an amber or honey color, that means you're dehydrated and you need to be drinking more. If your urine is more of a syrup color, the color of, say, brown ale, that's not good. You should drink more. If it stays that color, you could have a medical problem and you need to see your doctor. That's really the only way to try to get a feeling for how much you need.
