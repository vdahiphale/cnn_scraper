Recovery operations are underway in Florida as Hurricane Milton leaves death and destruction in its wake. At least 22 people are killed and more than 100 injured in Beirut after more Israeli airstrikes. And Tesla taxis. Elon Musk promises a game changing moment for the EV maker with self-driving cabs and private jets. And Rafa retires. One of the greatest tennis players of all time says that he'll play his final tournament this November. All that and a lot more coming up. But first, Florida begins the recovery from deadly Hurricane Milton, with officials warning that the danger is not over yet. Storm surge, riptides, even flesh-eating bacteria are just some of the threats. Residents are being told to stay put and let help come to them. U.S. President Joe Biden among those urging caution. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  There's still very dangerous conditions in the state and people should wait to be given all clear by their leaders before they go out.

And as humans, we try to use the past to figure out what's going to come. Hurricane Helene seemed too far offshore to bring a storm surge. People were wrong. They got devastated. So, everyone was focused on storm surge for Milton. But what instead came were massive tornadoes and relentless floods, almost a half a meter in 24 hours here in St. Petersburg, just flooding every river and creek. You can imagine flooding so many homes. So, right now, people are sort of grateful that they dodged the worst-case bullets, but they're trying to make sense of these back-to-back hits. and what comes next.

But as families reel in private grief, it's the material loss that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County. From the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings, to Tropicana Field, peeled like an orange by Milton's winds.

When -- in certain places throughout the Gulf states and places along the eastern seaboard, we preposition packs, hurricane preparedness packs that contain about 150 different medications, including mainly chronic disease medications. We preposition those in durable, ruggedized, waterproof tubs so they have sort of a pharmacy in a box for situations like this.
