She expresses her own emotional processing through things like dance and hosting dance classes for young Ukrainian refugee kids. Another of our subjects, she is a writer.

This war has ripped them from their homes. Their cities are often, in many cases, destroyed or severely damaged. They're splintered across the world. But there has never a bigger sense of we are Ukrainians, this is who we are, we are not going to be silenced and splintered, so we will go home. The question is just when. A recurring theme that we encounter (INAUDIBLE) kids saying things like, I want to take my new education that I am learning in this new country and I want to take it home with me, right?
