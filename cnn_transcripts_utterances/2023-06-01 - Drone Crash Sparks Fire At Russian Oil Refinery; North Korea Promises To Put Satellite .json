This follows days of attacks just across Ukraine's border inside Russia.

Emergency crews in southern Russia had extinguished an oil refinery fire that was started by a drone crash not far from Russian occupied Crimea.

The one interesting comment in there, I think, is the idea of a mechanism that's also been sort of kicked around for a while, but it's never really come through some kind of like local security forum or something like that. Some way in which the relevant parties up here in Northeast Asia would sort of sit down and meet and talk at least maybe, I don't know, once a year or something like that. Those ideas have been around for a while, but the North Koreans aren't too keen on it. And quite honestly, the U.S. and China haven't really made much of an effort on that either.

I do think that there's a great deal on for example, fuel, and other imports, most of which are illicit because of sanctions coming into North Korea, the Chinese helped for unsanctioned that may be able to make some progress.I do actually think that's an area in the U.S. and China actually share a lot, right?

I think, you know, on issues of surveillance, you know, the United States wouldn't respond particularly well if China was doing that near U.S. -- near the U.S. coast, so maybe the United States sort of like find some kind of way, where we can sort of pull back a little bit in order to get better Chinese behavior in the South China Sea, for example, where there's a lot of risk about sort of a collision. Again, there's some kind of deal that's probably doable there and send that both sides don't want these things kind of escalate out of control. And to be fair, though, to the Biden administration. I think they've actually indicated interest in this. And the Chinese have just not been picking up the phone on this. We know that, you know, there's been an effort to get the U.S. Secretary of Defense to talk his Chinese counterpart and the Chinese just haven't been interested.

The problem is that Serbia has never officially recognized that independence.It's also important to know the ethnic makeup of Kosovo, which is more than 90 percent ethnic Albanian with the exception of four municipalities right here. One of them is very small. It's about there. The Serbs who live in these majority Serb municipalities don't want to be ruled by the authorities in Kosovo. And this has caused all kinds of problems. So much so that in 2013, and entire decade ago, Kosovo and Serbia actually agreed on this text right here. It's called the Brussels agreement, it essentially gives some level of autonomy to these majority Serb regions or municipalities over things like education and health care and urban planning. It also ensures that the police commander in the area is an ethnic Serb, and that the force reflects the ethnic makeup of the local population, all with the understanding that neither Serbia nor Kosovo will block each other's route to European Union membership. The problem is that most of this has never actually been implemented which brings us to this agreement, which was actually agreed upon, at least in principle, in March of this year, it recommits, Kosovo and Serbia to the principal things that they have agreed on and also gives the express understanding that their failure to implement this will mean consequences from the European Union. The problem that we have run into lately is when it comes to local elections, because Serbs in these majority Serb municipalities boycott the elections, so much so that the voter turnout was only 3.4 percent. In fact, the mayor who eventually won in this municipality had only 141 votes. And so, there is a huge question of legitimacy. The Serbs in that area protested, they tried to block the mayor from -- the mayors from actually getting into the town halls, Kosovo police were sent in to forcibly make sure that they could and all of this escalated to what we saw on Monday, which was violent clashes between NATO peacekeepers, and protesters. Now, the U.S. has made no secret of the fact that it is blaming Kosovo very squarely for all of this. In fact, the ambassador said that this was a crisis that was unnecessary. He said that the operation that took place on Friday to obtain access to municipal buildings through forcible means was not coordinated with the U.S. When we became aware of it, we advise strongly against it, because we anticipated consequences that we are now seeing. So, the U.S. expects two things from Kosovo. First, that the mayors work from alternate locations, not the town halls and that police are withdrawn from the municipal buildings. They think that that will help lower the temperature and deescalate things. The trouble is that Albin Kurti, made very clear on CNN, that despite pressure from the E.U., and from the U.S., he is standing firm. Listen.",

Chinese Muslims clash with police outside a mosque in Southwestern China. For two days last weekend, residents of the village of Najiaying tried to protect their mosque from a Chinese government reconstruction plan. \"They want to demolish the roof of our mosque,\" an emotional local protester tells CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"This is our last bit of dignity,\" the protester says. \"It's like someone going to your house and demolishing it.\" CNN reached out to Chinese authorities for comment, but the only official acknowledgment of the incident comes from this local government statement, urging protesters to turn themselves in after \"disrupting social order\" and causing\" severe adverse impact.\"",

And there's also a very large presence of security forces in the village right now. Now in 2015 John, there were tensions between the Chinese government and Turkey amid reports that China was cracking down on Ramadan practices for Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region. And I was invited to a mosque in Beijing, a Hui Muslim mosque, to share in Iftar to see that, in fact, China was allowing Muslims to practice freely. At that time, the Hui Muslim community was viewed as far more reliable, I think, than Uyghur Muslims, more assimilated with the Han Chinese ethnic minority in China. So that's part of why this is so alarming to some people in China. And part of why we're hearing some Hui Muslim activists say, After the Uyghurs, it's us. We are the ones that are next for repression in China -- John.",

Thank you, Ivan.Well, a capsized boat on an Italian lake has left four people dead and a mystery in its wake. Officials say all 21 passengers had current or former links to Italian and Israeli intelligence agencies. More now from CNN's Barbie Nadeau. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A peaceful day on a picturesque Italian lake turns deadly. A deadly accident turns mysterious. Four people were killed, including two Italian intelligence officers and a retired Israeli defense official, when a chartered house boat sank in a sudden storm on Lake Maggiore Sunday. The captain said a waterspout appeared in a sudden storm. The Italian captain's Russia girlfriend also died. The Gooduria boat was listed on a boat-chartering website for 2,000 euros a day, with an advertised maximum capacity of 15 passengers. But on the fatal Sunday, there were 21 passengers, plus two crew members on board. All passengers, in some way tied to Italian and Israeli intelligence work, the prosecutor's office said. The survivors said they were celebrating a birthday. Italians Tiziana Barnobi and Claudio Alonzi were active secret service agents, the Italian government confirmed. The Israeli citizen Erez Shimoni was retired. Israel's prime minister's office called him a dear friend to the country's security forces. The Italian prosecutor said passengers are not under investigation and would not comment on what they might have been doing on the boat. The captain is under investigation for culpable manslaughter. Efforts to salvage the boat are being closely watched by Italian security officials and should provide more clues to the mysterious Sunday outing turned deadly. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.
