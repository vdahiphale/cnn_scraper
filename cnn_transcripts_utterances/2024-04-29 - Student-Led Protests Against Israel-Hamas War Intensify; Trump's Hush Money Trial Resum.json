      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.This morning, across the country, college campuses are bracing for more anti-war protests. Some of the images that hearken back to generations ago. The source of today's fury, the Israel Hamas war and the growing civilian bloodshed in Gaza. Over the weekend, more protests and more anger on UCLA's campus yesterday, demonstrators breached a security barrier meant to separate opposing protest groups. Police scrambled officers in riot gear. On the Virginia Tech campus, protesters were detained as the crowd chanted at police, shame on you. University officials say the on- campus encampment had worsened with the potential to become unsafe. Arrests have been made at campuses nationwide as more schools turned to police to rein in the demonstrators. Some schools are threatening to suspend students and could cancel upcoming commencement ceremonies. We have breaking news out of Columbia University to tell you about the epicenter of the college protests. A short time ago, school officials said talks with student organizers have failed to come to an agreement. Columbia is asking that protesters at the encampment, quote, voluntarily disperse, end quote. CNN's Omar Jimenez joins me from the Columbia campus. Omar, tell us what that means.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Jim, for starters, Columbia University said definitively today they will not divest from Israel, which, of course, has been at the center of the encampment led protests here. And the university essentially is indicating their negotiations with students are effectively over.Now, I want to read part of the statement released by University President Minouche Shafik, which says, in part, both sides in these discussions put forward robust and thoughtful offers and worked in good faith to reach common ground. We thank them all for their diligent work, long hours, a careful effort, and wish they had reached a different outcome. Of course, no agreement here. It goes on to say, we urge those in the encampment to voluntarily disperse. We're consulting with a broader group in our community to explore alternative internal options to end this crisis as soon as possible. And that falls along similar lines to what we're hearing from over 20 House Democrats now essentially urging the university to disband this encampment or essentially resign. Now, some key points here, because while Columbia said they will not divest in Israel, they did offer an expedited timeline for new proposals in front of their body that does consider divestments. They also offered to invest in health and education in Gaza. They also said that while they've worked hard to offer a constructive environment for dialogue and protest, the encampment has created an unwelcome environment for many Jewish students to the point so much so that many have felt unsafe on campus, which the president has described as a tragedy. And, of course, we're a little over two weeks from graduation and the university is saying definitively they will have a commencement in part because some of these graduating seniors started remotely. And we still haven't heard from the students on how they'll respond moving forward. But, clearly, they plan to have this encampment done or at least resolved by the time graduation gets here, whatever that may look like.",

And I know that, especially with outside protesters and police officers, I know that a lot of students feel really overly surveilled here.

I do know that there has been a lot of discussion on anti-Semitism within the protest.I think a large part like population of people who are in the encampment are Jewish. There have been, you know, Passover seders and Shabbat dinners and people have a lot of teachings about anti-Semitism and educating like what it is to be actively not anti-Semitic and stuff like that. So, I know that there is an effort to make Jews feel welcome both on campus and within the encampment. Of course, like there's no room for anti-Semitism on our campus.",

But the real event, as you mentioned, happened here on Thursday, where those ceasefire demonstrations turned very quickly into the violent arrest of 28 people, 20 of them with affiliations to the university.We were nearly arrested, but thankfully we weren't. We were allowed to bear witness. We want to warn you, this is what we saw, and we want to warn you here, the footage is very graphic. All of that happened just a few hundred feet from where I'm standing right now. All of that outrage has boiled over. And now university faculty will host a no-confidence vote against the university president here. We understand the faculty will be given balance today and that referendum will be tallied up on Wednesday. A symbolic move here by faculty to send a message to the university president that they don't have confidence in his leadership here in this institute of higher learning. Jim?",

And it seemed as though police, when they approach the demonstrators, they just really held everyone and sort of treated everyone with a heavy hand. That professor, Caroline Fohlin, she spent the night in DeKalb County Jail, along with 27 others. She was released on bond. And very quickly here, Jim, I spoke with some defense attorneys, and over the weekend, Emory officials are negotiating with defense attorneys and are considering dropping the charges against those involved on Thursday's demonstration.

So, I think this is just something he has to do. It's a building block as they think about, well, you know, how was this -- was this a dummy corporation set up? What kind of efforts went into making the payments to get in the account set up? These are things that begin to fill in pieces of the story. Certainly not the bulk of the prosecution's case, but they will likely intersperse some of this more dry testimony with things like Michael Cohen, but things like picks witnesses like maybe Stormy Daniels because you've got to keep the jury engaged. The fear is that you take a case that has a lot is sensational and turn it into something, as you say, that's dry, it can lose a jury's interest.",

The White House said Biden made it clear that the U.S. would not support a potential invasion of Rafah without an explicit plan to protect civilians.But a source says the primary focus of the call was a potential hostage deal with Hamas. It comes after the group released a video of two hostages on Saturday. On the left is Israeli Omri Moran. On the right is American-Israeli Keith Siegel. In the video, Siegel pleaded for Israel to negotiate a hostage release deal. It appeared he was speaking under some duress. CNN cannot verify where or when the video was shot. Meanwhile, the secretary of state is in Saudi Arabia right now, as Hamas is considering a new deal calling for the release of hostages held since October 7th in exchange for a pause in the fighting in Gaza. This morning Tony Blinken said, Israel has presented Hamas with, quote, an extraordinarily generous proposal, adding that the militant group is the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire. Let's get the latest from CNN National Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood, Kylie over at the State Department for us. Kylie, what can you tell us about this proposal?",

And he called on Hamas to accept that deal. He also said that they have to accept it quickly.And our reporting is that some of the demands that Israel had been making has been lessened. And so it appears that this could be a proposal that Hamas could accept. And the reason for him saying that Hamas has to act quickly is because the backdrop here is that Israel has been saying for some time they plan to invade Rafah and U.S. Officials are very eyes wide open about the fact that they are likely to go ahead with that invasion if there isn't an agreement here for a ceasefire and for hostages to be released.

There is a requirement due to a new national security memorandum that President Biden signed at the end of last year, For the State Department, for the secretary to provide an actual assessment as to if all of the countries using American-made weaponry are doing so in accordance with international law. These countries are supposed to provide their rationale, their explanations for the fact that they do believe they are in accordance with international law. The State Department assesses that, provides that to Congress.
