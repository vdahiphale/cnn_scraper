Israel claims it killed a Hezbollah commander in a rocket strike on Lebanon's capital. Power play. Opposition leaders calling for peaceful protests as hundreds are arrested in Venezuela following Nicolas Maduro's disputed election victory. Golden Girls, Team USA winning gold as Simone Biles becomes the most decorated American gymnast of all time. And a mochi moment, the Japanese American founder finding sweet success with a very traditional recipe. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, conflicting reports over the fate of a Hezbollah official targeted by Israel Tuesday in Lebanon. Israel saying within the past hour that the senior Hezbollah commander was killed in a \"targeted strike\" in a suburb of Beirut. Yet a senior Lebanese government official says he survived the attack. Israel calling the commander the right-hand man of Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah, and was responsible for ordering the weekend attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children. The region now waiting Hezbollah's response, an IDF official insisting that Israel is not looking for a wider war. Joining us now, Ben Wedeman in Beirut, and Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa, Israel. Jeremy, I'll come to you first. This is the targeted response that I think everyone was waiting for from Israel at this stage. They're saying it's a success, but clearly, we're hearing conflicting reports. What more do you know at this hour?",

And tonight, we learned what that response would look like with this Israeli strike in Southern Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon, where the Israeli military says that it was targeting Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander. In just the last hour, the Israeli military's top spokesman, Admiral Daniel Hagari, confirming that the Israeli military has indeed successfully killed Fuad Shukr in this strike, and they're really talking up the impact of this. They note the fact that he was a senior adviser to Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah. They also call him the most senior Hezbollah military commander, and they note his involvement in prior attacks against Israel, his involvement in directing Hezbollah military activity since October 8th, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel in what they say was in solidarity with the people of Gaza, and the war there following Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7th. We don't know yet to what extent Hezbollah will respond. They have also yet to confirm the death of Fuad Shukr, but there's no question that this is a region very much on edge at this moment, waiting to see what could potentially happen and whether or not, as has been feared for months now, this is a region that will tilt now into all-out war. A senior Israeli official who I spoke with this evening telling me that this was a serious blow that they believe that they dealt to Hezbollah. But at the same time in the same breath, indicating that they do not want to see all-out war, but they make clear they understand that that is now in the hands of Hezbollah. Julia.",

Incumbent Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of the election by an electoral body controlled by his allies, triggering allegations of fraud. So far, he's been backed by the nation's military.

He's a former Brazilian foreign minister. He's widely involved in foreign policy here in Latin America. He arrived here in Caracas last week ahead of the election to act as a monitor, to act as an observer. And after the fallout of that election, Brazil has become more and more involved in diplomatic talks in applying diplomatic pressure onto the Maduro government to release all the data. It's not just Brazil that has been asking that, it's a Columbia also, Mexico also, pretty much every Latin American country, the United States, the European Union. The message has been consistent that if Maduro really wants to get out of this impasse, the easiest way to do it and the safest and the most peaceful way to do it and the democratic way to do it actually is to release all the data. The Brazilians have been telling us that they have been able to speak with Maduro directly and that he responded to the request positively, pledging that he will release the data. Now, whether he will do it or when he will do it, if he ends up doing it, it's everyone's guess because right now, Maduro is still staying put, saying that he won that election that is so controversial, for lack of a better word.

And as a mother, I always felt guilty about giving them something that I knew was full of a lot of artificial flavors and colors and mainly made with gelatin, which is pork base. It's boiled pork skin and bones, and, you know, the origins are not really very clear as to where gelatin comes from a lot of times. So, I started to make these slabs of mochi cakes. Mochi is a Japanese confectionary, and I grew up eating it just as a cake with tea. But I kind of knew that there had to be some way to mimic the chewy candies that my boys are always asking for. And so, it started in my kitchen. It really started very naively and very simply.",

So, actually having something that does taste it, and I've tried it, and they're pretty yummy, I have to say.

It's a sacred food that's offered to the gods during New Year and celebrations, but nobody tried to sell it as a shelf stable candy that rivals jelly beans and gummy bears. So, finding a partner, finding a facility that knew how to make it was really, really challenging. And for the first order that we delivered to Whole Foods, I, together with my husband my kids and a few other factory workers, we hand slabbed and hand cut 3,000 pounds of mochi. So, it was a very difficult road. It was -- you know, everybody got tendinitis and we were all just -- afterwards. We cut mochi for three months over summer break. And that's how we did our first delivery. So, luckily, now we have a bigger facility, a bigger processing machine, but even that, once we got the machine, it had to be customized. You know, our starches are tapioca and rice starches didn't gel properly. It would just be like a big gooey mess like Play Doh. It was really a very difficult road where every night, you know, you're worried. You get up every morning with a knot in your stomach, you're bleeding money, you don't know if it's going to work. And you think, why did we do this? How did I -- you know, how did I get myself into this?",

There's first generation Issei. Nisei, second generation and on and on, Sansei, Yonsei. And we hold that very dear to our hearts. But for me, it was really a hope to elevate immigrant culture of everybody in the U.S. And what we bring to this country and what we bring to the table and the heritage that we have. And I think a lot of the memories and the experiences that we carry with us to this country share through food. So, the flavors, the textures, the meals that, you know, by breaking bread you become closer together and you bring the community together. So, I really saw a gap in, you know, many of the different segments of the food category where, you know, immigrant experience and immigrant heritage was underrepresented. So, definitely, the candy aisle, there's a lack of diversity and a lack of inclusion in terms of global flavors, you know, global textures. And I really wanted to contribute to that. And also, you know, have my kids be proud of seeing their culture reflected on the aisles. And we started with very familiar flavors, like strawberry, mango, vanilla, but we intend to really explore all the Asian flavors, Middle Eastern flavors, Latin American flavors, because there's so many beautiful flavors and textures and experiences that you can -- you know, you can provide and share.",
