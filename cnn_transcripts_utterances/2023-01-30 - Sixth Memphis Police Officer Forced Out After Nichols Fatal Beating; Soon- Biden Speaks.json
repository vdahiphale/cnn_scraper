And when the assault stopped, no one gave Nichols any medical attention for at least 25 minutes. Now, five of the officers seen in the video have been fired and charged with second-degree murder, and their unit to fight street crime and guns known as Scorpion, that's now gone. It's been disbanded, happened over the weekend.CNN correspondent Nick Valencia is with us now. So, what are you learning about this sixth officer, Preston Hemphill, and now being relieved of duty? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, the Memphis Police Department telling me that he is on administrative leave. That he was relieved along with the other officers. So, this makes six that were relieved as the result of their involvement in the incident that led to Tyre Nichols's death. We know Preston Hemphill, as he has been identified, has been in the Memphis Police Department since 2018. And according to a source with knowledge of Hemphill's involvement, we know that he was part of this so-called Scorpion unit. Also, according to his attorney, Victor, and Alisyn, we are told that Hemphill is the officer whose body camera we see in video one. You remember those four videos that were released on Friday showing the incident that led to Tyre Nichols's death? Well, Officer Hemphill, we want to show you in this video and warn you that it is graphic. We want to show you that officer Hemphill deploys his taser in this video. And we can hear him and see him deploying that taser. We also see him say -- one of them prongs hit the bastard. And just listen to what he had to say in this video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You'll remember that these negotiations, especially in the Senate fell apart in September of 2021 that was become between Republican Tim Scott and Democrat Cory Booker and then a representative Karen Bass, who's now the mayor of Los Angeles. And here we stand now where both Booker and Scott have said they are committed to doing something -- they both put out statements after that horrible brutal video was released, saying they wanted to do something. But the bottom line remains, what would that be? And is it at all what the other would want to do? We've heard calls from both the Congressional Black Caucus, from other lawmakers, and the NAACP to do something. I'll let you listen to the NAACP from Tennessee.

But his words were really been decommissioned, weren't they, to what we saw happen to Tyre's second encounter? So, when he said, let's hope they stomp his ass, that is something that we see, especially in the Civil Rights arena from a -- from a legal perspective, as a customer of tolerance. I guarantee this is not the first time that this Scorpion unit said let's go stomp somebody. This is -- this is multiple times. God only knows how many times. And so that's why not only there's there need to be accountability for this particular officer, everybody on that scene needs to be accountable.

The defense attorney for those Baltimore officers says that in the time between the death and the charges, there was no way that there could have been a comprehensive investigation.

Now, when it's done, it will be renamed for Maryland native Frederick Douglass.CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us live from Baltimore. So, what more are we expecting from the president? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, President Biden is about to step on stage here flanked by an Amtrak car, and these railway tracks leading into this 150-year-old tunnel, which is now going to be replaced with a new tunnel, thanks in part to the bipartisan infrastructure law. It's a $6 billion project, about $4.7 billion of which will come from federal funding. And it's expected to try and relieve this second-largest bottleneck between Washington, DC, and New Jersey allowing trains to go up to 110 miles an hour instead of the current 30-mile-an-hour that they go through causing massive delays. But, of course, this is part of President Biden's overall salesmanship effort a week out from the State of the Union address. This is one of the very events that President Biden is holding, touting some of these new infrastructure projects. He'll be in New York tomorrow and then in Philadelphia on a Friday. [14:25:05] And all of this, of course, leading up to a State of the Union address where the president wants to talk about what this next year is going to look like implementing these major infrastructure projects, all of course in the lead up to an anticipated 2024 reelection campaign announcing.",

And so far, all we know that there is agreement on is that the debt ceiling will be discussed. Whether or not that's actually a negotiation depends on who you ask. Here is Kevin McCarthy talking about it just yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): We're going to meet this Wednesday. Though I know the president said he didn't want to have any discussions, I think it's very important that our whole government is designed to find a compromise. I want to find a reasonable and responsible way that we can lift the debt ceiling but take control of this runaway spending. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Instead, what we heard from the White House just yesterday is that President Biden is going to ask Kevin McCarthy if he plans to meet his \"constitutional obligation to prevent a national default.\" Again, putting the onus back on Kevin McCarthy.I doubt that anything is going to be solved in this Wednesday's meeting. Instead, this is really about setting the table. Both sides trying to frame these discussions that will happen over the coming months up until this summer when we actually hit that debt limit.
