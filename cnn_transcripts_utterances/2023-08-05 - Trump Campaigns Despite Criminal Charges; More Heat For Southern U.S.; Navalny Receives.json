And Trump's appearance at a Republican event in Alabama Friday came hours after he pleaded not guilty for the second time in two days.That was for additional federal charges related to the classified documents case in Florida. Special counsel Jack Smith has asked a federal judge to set strict rules for Trump's legal team when they receive evidence in the 2020 election case. Smith wants to keep Trump from having copies of key evidence, particularly grand jury testimony, for fear that he'll make those details public. We'll get the latest from CNN's Jessica Schneider in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So the special counsel's team, they have to submit their recommendations for a trial start date next week on August 10th.After that, Trump's legal team will then have seven days to respond. And they've already said they will definitely be pushing back against any rush to trial. So the Speedy Trial Act, it does say that a trial should happen 70 days after a defendant appears in court, so 70 days from Thursday. But Trump's team really can move to have that date pushed back which is very likely. Trump's attorney, John Lauro, did tell the judge on Thursday that, in his view, there was just way too much evidence to sift through in this 2020 election case to move fast toward a trial date. And, of course, part of the Trump legal playbook has been delay, delay, delay. So we can expect that to likely continue. Now as for Trump, he did rail against the prosecution on the tarmac at the D.C. airport after his arraignment, saying that it was all political, part of the Biden administration's plan to thwart his 2024 bid. And he was back on the campaign trail just hours later speaking to Republicans. And we could see more legal trouble for the former president in the next couple of weeks. That's when we're expecting action from the district attorney in Atlanta, Georgia. It really could mean more charges against Trump related to his and his allies' attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia. So a lot that the former president is confronting on the legal realm -- Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
