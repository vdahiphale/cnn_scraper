Some of the things that he mentioned was he made fun of Vice President Harris' laugh. He also called her a lunatic and at one point, while discussing a recent \"Time\" cover magazine former president Trump asserted that he is better looking than Harris, which the crowd laugh at and applauded as well. He also spoke at length about debates both upcoming and former ones and then he still continued to speak a lot about President Joe Biden again, no longer his opponent in this contest. Now, the few points that did stay relatively on message on, he brought a young man from Venezuela to speak about the fears that he has of communism in the country. He also played an attack ad actually that ran on the jumbotron up hear above us at one point, painting Harris as an extreme liberal candidate. And there were a few new lines that we heard tonight, specifically addressing Vice President Harris' new economic plan that she released just in the past 24 hours.

They will use those large screens inside the United Center in Chicago where the convention is being held to broadcast some of his quotes including the \"history is in your hands.\" That's something that he said in his Oval Office address explaining his decision to withdraw from the race.

Great to have both of you here with does to talk about all of this as we head into this critical week in this race. Ashley, let's start first with you. We've got this new polling out from \"The New York Times\" showing Harris gaining ground in those key swing states in the sunbelt. It is a very tight race, no doubt about it. But she is the momentum does seem to be with her at this moment. Republicans have described these past few weeks as a honeymoon phase for Harris with all the enthusiasm and momentum we've seen.

It is not a sugar high as they've described it. She is trending up, consistently trending up. She has only been in the race for three weeks and continues to trend up. She has outpaced Biden with our core base, that 2020 coalition that he built. You know, there are other polls like CBS' polls that is showing that she is not losing any ground with White men. That's got to be making them completely afraid of the possibilities of Donald Trump. But if you look at -- if you look at former President Trump, he has actually capped out. He is not increasing his numbers. He doesn't have any more customers. It is great that he can fill a crowd there at this locations, but the reality is his target audience of people he needs to appeal to are not in those rooms and they are turned off by Donald Trump. They are over the Trump show. And that's what all this momentum is about behind Kamala Harris right now.

I mean, the list goes on and on and on, that almost overnight, there is a move to be 180 degrees different than she was three or four years ago. So once that starts coming out and once quite frankly on a campaign side of things, you look at after Labor Day is really when the campaign starts heating up because families, now the kids are back in school, families are back to work. There is no more vacations and they are really starting to pay attention to their pocketbooks through their daily lives and I think that is when you will start seeing some calmness in the polls and you'll see, this really was never going to be an outright winner heading into November.

I don't know if that is more of a firming up the base, to try and get the base out to vote.

These winds will also kick up significant wave heights as they've been doing. We've been seeing swells already cause some problems with erosion, even a home coming into the shore there over the coast of North Carolina on the Outer Banks. Rip currents are a huge concern from Miami up to Maine. Look at all the red for a high risk of rip currents. That means that we're looking at some pretty large swells, intense waves. And again, the water is just dangerous. A lot of beaches saying, please don't go in the water. So if you find yourself in a rip current, do not fight the current. The current takes you out to sea. You cannot swim directly to shore. You need to swim faster than an Olympic swimmer to do that. So you have to swim parallel to the shore to come out of the rip current. And then once you're out, then you can swim back to shore safely in a much better way. But things to remember, again, if you see red flags on the beach, just don't go in the water. Jessica.",

They've put enormous pressure. They've embarrassed Putin. They've put significant pressure on the Russian forces, drawing off forces in other parts of the Ukrainian battlefield, maybe not in this most critical area, but it looks like that's on the horizon. And they're going to - they continue to take territory. Even 12 days in, Russia hasn't been able to balance the equation and fortify its positions and prevent the Ukrainians from taking ground. If the Ukrainians are able to draw forces off of this most critical area in the southeast I mentioned, this will be declared a masterstroke with Ukraine having both a strong bargaining chip, a better tactical position, and really, frankly, a way forward that will allow Ukraine to be successful for the rest of this year and into next year.",

And this is going to put a significant strain on Russian forces than it already has. We've seen sort of difficulty in Russians responding. It's been 12 days.

I've seen some polling data as best as it's able to be collected on kind of social media platforms that shows a dip. And certainly it removes this idea that Russia remains invulnerable to attack, not just like an attack by, let's say, your peers, the U.S. NATO, but it's now suffering the consequences of its action reaping the whirlwind with regards to incursions onto its own territory.In a way, this is the first attack from a foreign power on Russia since World War II.",

Think about the fact that Russia is holding a frozen conflict in Transdniestria on - in Moldova. And that's adjacent to Ukraine. That may now be in play, too. Russia has to be concerned about its holdings there, too.So I think in general, it create - really complicates Russia. I wouldn't overstate the military dimension of it yet. It's really looking quite positive yet. But we won't know that for another, you know, several weeks until we see what the Russians have to do to respond to this incursion.

Participants catch and kill invasive pythons that eat Florida's native animals.And joining us now, Ron Magill, the Communications Director at the Miami Zoo. Ron, thanks for being here with us. This is kind of wild, I think, to a lot of people who've never heard of it before, who maybe don't live in Florida. How does this hunt work? It's a one week every year.

There's estimated to be 10s of thousands of them in the Everglades.And what they're doing is, you know, they're really depleting our natural environment. They are eating a lot of the small mammals, the raccoons, the rabbits. They're changing environments by doing so. They, you know, possess tremendous threats to other native wildlife, birds, roosting birds, nesting birds, even alligators. They've been seen eating alligators. So they present a big problem.",
