      "sentences": "John, the statement that conversations have begun with North Korea, a statement that came from United Nations Command, frankly raises more questions than answers because that's as far as they went. The deputy commander of the United Nations Command General Andrew Harrison basically said conversations have commenced under the agreements of the -- under the mechanisms of the Armistice Agreement. But he said he can't say any more because he didn't want to prejudice the outcomes of those conversations.The problem is, that's the latest update we have from U.N. Command. But there isn't an update from the U.S. side. That is to say, according to the U.S., there still has not been contact made or conversations began with North Korea when it comes to Private Travis King. So, we don't know yet who was involved in these conversations, when they began, or where they may lead. Tomorrow, it should be noted marks one week since Private Travis King got off of a tour of the Joint Security Area, part of the DMZ between North and South Korea, and then ran into North Korea. What's interesting to note is that the North Koreans haven't made any statements about Travis King, and that's left the U.S. wondering where he is, what his condition is, or what the intent of the North Koreans is here, especially as it seems difficult to move forward any sort of dialogue or any sort of diplomacy to try to resolve this situation with North Korea. We just have this statement from United Nations commencing conversations have begun. It's also worth noting, John, that this week marks what for the North Koreans is a major holiday, the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War. So, perhaps they want to use Travis King as some sort of propaganda coup ahead of this. But even that is pure speculation at this point, John.",
