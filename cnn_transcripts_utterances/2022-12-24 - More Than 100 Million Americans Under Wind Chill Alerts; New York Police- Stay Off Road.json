We begin this hour with some bad news, because there is a dangerous winter storm and it is blanketing the United States. At least 15 people have been killed due to the icy weather across multiple states. You're looking at a crash there. New York State Police are warning people to stay off the roads. Amid whiteout conditions. They say search and rescue. Obviously hard to move about is moving extra slow due to the blizzard. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, says first responders may not be able to reach you if you need help. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): It is absolutely dangerous for anyone to be out on the roads and that includes our emergency vehicles. So, our national guard our first responders, our ambulances, our fire trucks are all getting stuck in the snow as well. In fact, almost every fire truck in the city of Buffalo is stranded. It is stuck in snow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The arctic blast extending from Montana, all the way down to, yes, Florida.We're tracking the latest conditions across the country. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar joins us in just a bit. But first, let's go to our Polo Sandoval, who is still stuck in Buffalo, New York. Out, braving, the temperatures out there it is extremely dangerous. Can you just give us an idea of what it feels like out there? Because I know your face has to be frozen. POLO SANDOVAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, the South Texas faces not used to this, Sara. You know, is a picture just a 1,000s of needles just pricking you in the face. That's because those winds, they are still just pounding the region now. It is -- they're not as strong as yesterday when a wind measurement -- a wind gusts of 79 miles an hour was recorded by the National Weather Service, surpassing the historic blizzard of 1977. So this is clearly an extraordinary snow, wind, and storm event even for Buffalo. So, that gives you kind of a sense of what we're feeling here with a subzero wind chill that I've been feel --my colleagues and I have been feeling every hour when we step out, when we're hunkering down to give you an idea of the conditions that authorities want people to avoid. You see snow ploughs and public works officials just like what you're able to see here. They're finally able to get back out, they had to be pulled back overnight because there was zero visibility. And believe it or not, this is a considerable improvement compared to what we saw overnight. So, this is now allowing crews to basically carve a path on some of the streets and highways, to allow emergency vehicles to maneuver throughout the city of Buffalo. Because you just told our viewers, Sara about something really important, and that's emergency equipment, fire trucks, ambulance, police vehicles as well. Many of those about two thirds have been stuck in the snow. So, they're working to basically get them back into service. And that is why we heard from Erie County officials today, saying that emergency services in places like Buffalo, they cannot be guaranteed if somebody has a medical emergency. So, that's why officials are recommending that folks in and around Buffalo, stay at home on this Christmas Eve, potentially to tomorrow if they're safe. If they're not, they do have phone numbers and services available to them and they'll get to folks as soon as possible. And finally, they are bringing in the National Guard according to New York Governor Kathy Hochul, to assist those patients for their dialysis, for their chemo treatments. They're bringing in Humvees to be able to get them to their appointments today or tomorrow. Back to you, Sara.",

It's better than it was yesterday, but it's still horrible.It is, unfortunately, whiteout conditions still existing through much of northern Erie County and now into Niagara County, where Niagara Falls, New York is. The temperatures are very, very bitter cold. I think that the air temperatures only about seven degrees, the wind chills up approximately minus 20, and the problem is still white outs. Because of the strong winds, they're not 70-mile an hour gusts, but they're 50 mile an hour gusts, we're still seeing whiteout conditions, including in areas that are not receiving snow. You can have a blizzard in the areas where it's not technically falling snow, because it's blowing the snow that's already on the ground. We're in the town of Chico Wago (PH), which is just outside of the City of Buffalo line at our emergency operations center for the county. And I just look out the window, it is whiteout conditions, even though it's not supposedly snowing here, because it's blowing all the snow that fell in the last 24 hours. So, it's still very dire. It's a little better than it was yesterday. And last night, we are able to get a department of public works trucks on the roads. Emergency responders are getting out there. But first off, they're actually digging out the vehicles that unfortunately got stuck yesterday for emergency responders. And they're also responding to the people who've been stuck in vehicles for hours now. It's still a very dire situation.",

There's a driving ban that's going on for the whole county, and there's a reason why, it's because conditions are still so dire, that you could easily get stuck. And then you're taking resources off the road. There is really needed. So, it's bad. But it is at least better than it was yesterday. The problem is we're expecting these winds to continue throughout the entire day as well as the snow. And blizzard warning, according to the National Weather Service is still in effect until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. And then, we have about 30,000 of our residents that are without power.

So, I think it's going to be a little easier once the winds die down. But it's still, it's going to take a few more days to clean this up, and more importantly, we're spending this time trying to get to people who still may be stuck in their vehicles or in life threatening situations and homes without heat.

Several airports across the country have had to shut down runways because it's just too icy out there. That stranded thousands of passengers. In places like Atlanta, delays and cancellations are causing major terminal backups. So far, today, more than 2,000 flights have been canceled around the United States. That's on top of nearly 6,000 canceled on Friday. Let's head over to meteorologist Allison Chinchar, who is live in the CNN Weather Center for us. Allison, are these temperatures ever going to come down in the next couple of days? ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): Yes, I do have some good news for you. We are starting to see some of the temperatures begin to rebound and more of them will follow suit in the coming days. But yes, as for today, still dealing with those frigid temperatures and even the lake effect snow. The hope is as we go through the next 24 to 48 hours, a lot of that will begin to wind down. Here is a look at where we're seeing the snow showers now. Right now across portions of Michigan, areas of northeast Ohio, also into upstate New York. This is a live look at Watertown, New York. We've seen the ploughs coming through here, off and on. There is one right there. They are trying to keep up with the snow. The thing is, it's falling at time so heavily, it makes it very hard. They'll clear a spot, then, it feels right back up again. And that's going to be the case as much of this lake effect, snow is expected to continue through the day today. Then, you have this other little fast moving system that's going to slide through areas of the northern plains and into the Mississippi Valley region as we go into Christmas Day. So, yes, not that there isn't enough snow on the ground. But some additional snow just in time for a white Christmas is expected as we go through the day on Sunday. In total, through Monday, most of these areas likely picking up two to six inches of additional snow. The exception to that will be across areas of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Because of that lake effect, we are picking up an additional one to two feet is not out of the question. But temperatures are improving. Denver, Dallas, and New Orleans finally getting those temperatures back up above freezing. The rest of the country will see that, Sara, by next week. Allison, thank you so much.",

One of the most interesting things to come out of it was actually, a revelation that when Bill Barr went public in December 2020, refuting Trump's voter fraud claims that the Trump White House actually sprang into action and drafted a press release that they never put out. But the press release would have basically attacked Barr and said, \"Anybody that thinks there wasn't massive fraud in 2020, should be fired.\" Whoa. They didn't put that out, but the committee obtained it from the National Archives. And also, Sara, we learned from these transcripts, that the committee did get text messages from Ivanka Trump.

When they examined him, they found he had multiple medical issues and had also been hit by a car and he had to be euthanized. Now, lawyer and LA Taxi Commissioner Eric Spiegelman says he ran the Twitter account. He has been revealed for the mountain lion. He joins me now live from Los Angeles.
