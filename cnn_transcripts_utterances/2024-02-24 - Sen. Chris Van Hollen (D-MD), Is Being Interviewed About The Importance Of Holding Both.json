These are rape people. This is every apartment and house looted. This is the face of the Russian world. Father Andriy became known after the Russians were pushed back for revealing the side of a mass grave just here on his church grounds, filled with 160 people. He shows me the original posting about it on Facebook, March 12, 2022, when Russian forces were still occupying Bucha and from this memorial, you can see that red house, most of the family was killed as they tried to flee. When the Russians turned a heavy machine gun on their car. It still haunts and horrifies the grandmother, Valentyna Chekmarova. It's very hard for me to remember this, two years have passed, and it seems like it happened today, she says. I saw them off to get out of this hell, but they didn't. They were shocked. This is the fate they were trying to escape. The main street, Yablunska, in this residential Kyiv suburb, strewn with bodies, all clearly civilians. The discovery of basement torture and execution centers. People forced to kneel and lie with hands tied behind their backs, women and girls raped.

Because, because they want to stand up and prove that Putin is wrong, you know, when he says there is no Ukraine, there is no Ukrainian separate nation, there are no Ukrainian people, they are all part of Russia. So it's really interesting to see that cultural interlude there. Now with me now is Carl Bildt. He's the former prime minister of Sweden and now co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations. So you have a huge amount of experience in this -- in this kind of thing. You were a high representative in post-war Bosnia. And I just wonder what you make of the situation that the world is in right now, this two-year mark. But also, do you see it as a turning point? CARL BILDT, CO-CHAIR, EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: I started to say that's an important situation. Because, if Putin were to get away with what he's trying to do -- as you said, he's been very explicit -- is not a question of NATO, Donbass or whatever. It's a question of getting rid of Ukraine because Ukraine doesn't have a right to exist independent of Russia. He gets away with that, it's extremely bad for Ukraine. Needless to say, it's extremely bad for Europe. But also send full signals to thugs all over the world that, can Putin get away with this, we could get away with whatever. And then it has profound implications for global stability. So it's far more than just Ukraine that's at stake.",
