So essentially a man who's clearly rattled here. Is that because he's so distant from reality on the ground? He thought this unimaginable or did he think that you've gained a progression was a loyalist who'd never dare do something like this again?

But so far, Ukrainians are transfixed by what they're seeing happening as the troops who invaded this country in a full-scale invasion in February of last year are turning upon themselves and the Kremlin is gripped by chaos.Now, President Vladimir Zelenskyy has put out a statement on social media saying that Russia's weakness is obvious, full-scale weakness. The longer Russia keeps its troops and mercenaries on our land, the more chaos, pain and problems it will have for itself. Now, some Ukrainian officials are saying that this sudden breakdown in the Russian leadership is as a result of the Ukrainian offensive, which began earlier this month, and so far, has been by and large a fairly modest affair. But yesterday we were up near the front lines and what we saw were a lot of troops, a lot of equipment really poised to perhaps go into battle in ways we haven't seen so far. Most analysts believe that the Ukrainians have yet to commit the bulk of their forces to this counteroffensive and as this is going on what's happening in Rostov- on-Don where it appears that? Evgeny Prigozhin has essentially taken control that is where Russia keeps the headquarters of its southern military District that is a strategic command center for all Russian forces in this part of Ukraine And if that is no longer able to function in coordination with Moscow the question is how is it going to direct Russian military activities in southern Ukraine in light of the fact that the Ukrainians are perhaps on the verge of really ramping up this offensive that we haven't yet seen achieve too much.

But that's not just a problem for Putin in Russia and Ukraine Remember the Wagner group operates in 40 countries on behalf of the Russian state their extent essentially an extension of the Russian Influence operation in places like Libya and Syria and Sudan and Mali and the Central African Republic, et cetera, et cetera.

I think, you know, one of the things that intelligence officials are surely looking at is the control over nuclear weapons, which are spread all over Russia, by the way.Surely, Prigozhin knows where they are and how valuable they are. And you know, another thing to look for is the other types of biological chemical facilities. Again, this is a failing empire. This is a Russian state that is going down the tubes pretty fast, actually, before our eyes. That's not to say that Putin will be deposed. I don't think there's a very high chance, frankly, that Prigozhin is going to be able to march on Moscow with just 25,000 troops. But an increasingly desperate Putin is increasingly dangerous. Now, of course, we want Putin to lose, so it's not as if we're going to come to his aid or anything like that, but when these states collapse or when these governments come under pressure, they're likely to do a lot of crazy stuff.

It's a city halfway really, between the Rostov-on-Don southern military hub, the Wagner fighters first moved into this morning on the way north to Moscow. So, it is -- does appear to be growing evidence of at least Wagner fighter's presence in Voronezh. There's some other advocate suggesting they may have moved further north towards the Capitol. But Wolf, this is just utterly unprecedented territory, that we are in. The mere idea of armed insurrection unthinkable, frankly, for the two-decade Vladimir Putin has been in power. And this is indeed a man who has been, essentially, Vladimir Putin's bag man for a number of years. Doing his bidding across Africa, behind Internet trolling, influence of foreign elections, including that of the United States. Now, it seems pushed towards this clear march on Moscow. Perhaps, in the previous hours, Yevgeny Prigozhin may have managed to convince himself that he could launch what he said was an operation against Russia's military top brass, and leave Vladimir Putin to adjudicate afterwards as to who he'd like to see the winner. Putin was, it's fair to say, silent for the first hours of these extraordinary events. But what we heard from the Kremlin head in the past hours makes no mistake here, and Yevgeny Prigozhin is now a wanted man, as are the possibly 1,000s of Wagner fighters seasoned in battle on the frontlines of some of the worst places during the Ukraine war, they are now also targets of the Russian military. What level of response will be see from the Russian military is unclear. It is obvious at this stage that some kind of clashes have begun, it seems. And certainly, the governor of the Voronezh area has said that combat measures have indeed begun from the Russian military side. But the big question really, Wolf, in all of this, outside of the future of who is in charge of a nuclear power that's been frankly, torn down militarily over the past 16 months since the invasion of Ukraine, the ultimate question, of course, being where does this leave the war in Ukraine? Does Russia's military there, rivet internally, begin to collapse, or are we going to see this episode short lived, and a bid by Putin to try and salvage some sense of control.

Are the Russian soldiers who've been fighting there going to think it's worth putting up a fight in the days ahead, if they didn't even know who their commander in chief necessarily is. You can bet certainly the U.S. NATO allies are looking at satellite imaging, looking to see what this has done to the frontlines, and looking to see precisely where Ukraine can take the most advantage over the days and weeks ahead. But first of all, I think it's important to remember, we don't know the outcome of what's going to happen in Russia or even in Moscow. And it may not emerge that we are dealing with a more peaceful, potentially Russian state after this. This is going to be a test existentially for Putin's grip on power.

That Putin has only now decided to confront in the extreme situation, where Prigozhin has bought his troops, that -- unheard of situation where he's bought his troops onto the streets in Russia. That Putin has only chosen to deal with this now. So, Ukraine's allies and backers will be looking to see how Ukraine can leverage the situation. But they will also be looking to see what plays out in Moscow. Is Putin on the verge of being replaced? Who replaces him? What does that mean for the war in Ukraine? What does that mean for the -- for the potential threat against NATO? And I think it's very telling that we've heard from so many different governments, watch it same. They're watching the situation today. Indeed, the Latvians are saying, look, we're tightening security, our border crossing. We're not going to allow any Russians to cross out of Russia into Latvia. That shows the level of concern about what may precipitate on the ground inside Russia. So, I think these days, as we've all been saying, the 24 or 48 hours to Putin has this under control or not. And if he doesn't bring it under control quickly, that shows weakness, and that shows, therefore, the possibility that he could be replaced unclear by whom, in fairly short and an -- in an unorthodox way. And that, of course, would lead into concerns about what next from Russia.",
