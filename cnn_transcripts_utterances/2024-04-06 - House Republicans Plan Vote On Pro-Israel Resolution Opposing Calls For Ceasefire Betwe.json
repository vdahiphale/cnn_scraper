      "sentences": "Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with the growing crisis in the Middle East. CNN has just learned that House Republicans plan to hold a vote next week on a pro- Israel resolution that would oppose calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the very thing the U.S. has been working toward. The vote, which is symbolic, would put Republicans at odds with not just the White House but much of the world. It will come one week after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza, including a dual U.S. citizen. And with the U.S. now on high alert, a senior Biden administration official tells CNN the U.S. is actively preparing for a significant attack by Iran on U.S. and Israeli targets in the Middle East as soon as next week. Iran is blaming Israel for an airstrike in Syria this week that killed at least seven Iranian officials, including two top military the commanders. Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington. Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem. Let's get started with you, Priscilla, in Washington. U.S. officials believe in attack is inevitable. What is the administration preparing for?",

      "sentences": "Inevitable and perhaps on the horizon. The U.S. and Israeli governments working very closely to try to be in position for any potential attack by Iran targeting U.S. and Israeli assets in the region. Now, as you mentioned there, the U.S. is on high alert for what officials have described as quote, inevitable. Now, it's unclear how this would unfold. It could unfold in multipleways and multiple different ways. And it's also not quite clear when this would happen, though it is anticipated to happen as soon as next week. Now of course, this was a major topic of discussion between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they held their call earlier this week. And all of this stems from an Israeli airstrike in Damascus where several Iranian commanders were killed. Iran vowed to seek revenge over this. There was an exchange where the U.S. made clear they did not know of the airstrike ahead of time, nor were they involved. But the worst-case scenario you that U.S. officials are bracing for here is a direct strike by ran on Israel. That could potentially escalate what is already a very tense -- tense relationships across the region into a broader conflict. And that is something that the White House has been trying to avoid. It's a delicate situation. And that is what the U.S. officials and Israeli officials are working very closely on and staying in close touch over, because again, if there is a direct strike by Iran on Israel, it could very much escalate this conflict to be a regional conflict. That is something that the U.S. is very worried about.",

Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was here in February asked specifically for the Erez border crossing to be opened, and it hasn't happened since then.But under the extreme pressure of the events of last week of the World Central Kitchen seven workers being killed and the pressure in that phone call from President Biden on Prime Minister Netanyahu, there was an announcement that the border crossing will open. We understand that trucks will go across the border crossing tomorrow, Sunday local time. It's not clear to us how many, what will be on them, where they'll go, and how sustained this will be. We were at the border close to the Erez crossing today. This was typically a pedestrian crossing before. It can, obviously, handle trucks, but a lot of the roads on the Gaza side are broken, the tarmac completely destroyed on some of the roads in some places. We heard heavy machine gunfire around there today and the sound of heavy explosions not far away. So it's hard to know how safe and whether or not the vehicles will actually be able to get in and do their job. We do know that the IDF met Friday with World Food Programme officials. We don't know the plans at the moment, and we didn't see any signs of a big physical preparation at the border for this expected beginning. And I think the scrutiny, as the White House has said, will be on how much the Israeli government is able to or does keep it's word on this particular commitment.",

Bill Burns, the head of the CIA, David Barnea, the head of Mossad in Israel where there for that meeting. Hamas is saying they're sending their official back, but they're not changing their position. They say they're sticking with their position from the middle of March.And the gaps appear to be around the fact that Hamas is now saying that it wants a complete ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces, which is a hardening of a previous position which would allow for a phased approach. Six weeks of a temporary truce, and then meanwhile, in parallel with talks to get to a longer-term truce that could be agreed in a following six-week period. And another point that Hamas is really pushing for now, which is return of displaced people in the south of Gaza to be able to get back to the north of Gaza. The numbers that Israel has been saying that it could contemplate over the numbers of displaced that could go back over any specific date, that number is in dispute. And it seems that these could be the details that scupper any progress in the talks. And there's a real sense now that if there isn't progress in these talks, then Israel's desire, the IDF's desire, this government's desire here to go into Rafah where they believe there are still four battalions of Hamas holding out behind the civilian population of close to 1.4 million people, that we could be good without an agreement in Cairo, we could be getting closer to that. And nothing that we're hearing at the moment indicates it's getting closer. However, there is a possibility that the CIA director, or the Mossad chief, could go back to Cairo in the coming days. We don't have hard confirmation yet that definitely will happen.",

The top ticket price is $824,000 and -- $824,600, because he is raising money not just for his campaign, but for the Republican National Committee and dozens of state parties.And that allows them to sort of take one big check and distribute it among all of these groups. The entry fee, the lowest price is $250,000. At the highest level, there is a special perk. You get to eat dinner at the former presidents table, both he and former the first lady, Melania Trump, are scheduled to be there. And as you note, it is attracting a lot of folks. I mean, we're seeing big names, billionaires who are starting to rally around the former president now that the general election is sort of engaged.

It doesn't even apply to this case. This is a case under the Espionage Act. So the PRA says that presidents are to return presidential records at the end of their term, but they can keep personal records like journals. And Donald Trump is using the PRA to lay personal claim to these highly classified documents.The PRA was put in place after the Watergate scandal not so that presidents could unilaterally designate government documents as their own personal property, but for the opposite reason, to ensure government documents remain in possession of the government. So Judge Cannon initially ruled that Presidential Records Act did not apply. But within days of making that order, she reversed herself and she ordered the defense and the prosecution to send her proposed jury instructions that suggests that she's still open to the PRA defense, which again, has no bearing in this case. So why would she do this? She's doing this, one, it's delay. But secondly, she is sending a direct methods to Donald Trump that she's in his corner. She is basically saying I'm open to this defense, and you can -- maybe I'm going to bring it up during trial. So in response, what does Jack Smith do? He says, all right, give us a ruling now, a definitive ruling. Are you going to allow the PRA as a defense or not? And she has declined to do that. So if she waits long enough and they seat a jury and then she decides I'm going to allow the PRA, there's nothing the prosecution can do about it. WHITFIELD: Wow. OK, that's fascinating.

They incite the MAGA base to go after these people, to threaten them with violence and even commit violence.So yes, we are now -- this is the only case that's now proceeding to trial.

Everybody's life is determined by the rhythm of when those air raids come. Everybody is used to it, which does not mean they have accepted it andit does not mean that they're willing to give up. On one single night during a three-hour period between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m. on March 21, the Russians sent 31 ballistic and cruise missiles just in that three period to Kyiv. Air defense shot down all 31, which is quite spectacular. They've gotten very skilled. But they are almost out of ammunition. And that is a city that is completely dependent on air defense. If other cities like Kharkiv, like Odessa, had that kind of air-defense, we would not see these children being buried under rubble every day. Everybody is waiting on Mike Johnson. Essentially Mike Johnson is holding these people hostage. He's dependent on his MAGA base. He is beholden to Trump. Trump is beholden to Putin for whatever reason.

And there have been massive civilian massacres and torture chambers that they have discovered all over the place. You have these 20-year-old Russian kids going in and torturing with electric shocks middle aged women who speak their own language and could be their mothers, and they don't even know why they're there.

When other people's lives mean nothing to you, then you are not operating under constraints. Then you're in this Dostoyevskian world where everything is permitted. So whether it's alone, whether it's a gift, whether you're taking money that has been from frozen Russian assets, I'm not an expert on that. In some sense that could be decided later.

Today, more than 130 remain there, their families desperate to get them back.I traveled to Israel earlier this year to speak with four of these families. Fred, they are heartbroken, but they remain resilient. I met with Hadas Kalderon, who had been a resident at Kibbutz Nir Oz. Her mother was killed on October 7th, and her two children and their father were taken hostage. And yet she was one of the lucky ones. Her two children had been released during the one ceasefire back in November. But she's still enduring the pain and devastating impact from their ordeal and hers over those four months.
