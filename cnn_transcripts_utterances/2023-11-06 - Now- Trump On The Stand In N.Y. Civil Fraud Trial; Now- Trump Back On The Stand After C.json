Right now, former President Donald Trump is testifying in his own defense in his New York civil fraud trial. And within minutes of Trump taking the stand, a battle with a judge quickly unfolded. Judge Arthur Engoron accused Trump of making long winded speeches, not answered questions and even threatened to excuse the former president. The judge told defense attorneys, \"I beseech you to control him if you can, if you can't, I will.",

And what we've seen is that the judge has been one who has most notably changed his approach.For that first hour, every time Trump got off track, started pontificating. He would cut him off, which would then set off interactions between Trump's lawyers, the attorney general's attorneys, it didn't allow for much progress in the hearing itself. So, what we've seen since the break is that the judge is back in command of his courtroom. He is deferring instead to the attorney general's office with this questioning, saying that he is deferring to the questioner to allow Trump to either ramble off script or give more precise answers. Only one or two times have we seen the judge in the last hour, instruct Trump to be more focused and not to ramble and just answer the question. So, it has been a lot more productive for all the parties involved, does not appear, though, that Trump has really changed his approach. He has taken shots at this case at the judge. But overall, this has been more productive for more orderly than that chaotic first hour.",

And that's what's important here, that 15-minute break, nothing changed with how Trump was treating this and how he was responding to this. And instead, what we're seeing that's different is the judge himself, not speaking up as much.And as you noted, referring to the lawyer for the attorney general's office, who is conducting this line of questioning who has been pretty composed throughout this and he has not gotten as frustrated with the rambling. I think part of that is because that potentially helps the attorney general's office here. It may help them make their case if Trump is just talking, if he slips up, if he says something that instead of he's just answering short yes or no questions. I mean, he was at one point earlier, saying, you know, I wasn't involved in the 2021 financial statements, referencing what he was doing in the White House, even though as the lawyer pointed out very quickly, he was not president in 2021 and making that point as well.",

But we do have reporters inside briefing us repeatedly, very quickly on what's going on inside. Dana and Kaitlan, guys, we'll get back to you very soon.I want to discuss what's going on further with Laura Coates right now CNN's chief legal analyst. Have you ever seen anything like this before? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: You know, the idea that a former president is taking the stand in this way is very historic, but the idea of a bench trial where a judge is accustomed to the antics of defendant, not so abnormal, but here's a different issue here. This is not a legal defense that Trump is trying to put on. It is a political ones. He would like to have the cameras in the courtroom because he wants to send a message of defiance. Hopefully it will bear it and benefit him politically speaking in the long run. But this judge is very strategic. He knows full well that there is bait that is being put out in the line for him to take, hoping that maybe if I'm an appeal, they will say that he was bias and say against him. But in reality, what he's saying is, I'd like you to answer the questions. Why because I'm the fact finder. I have to actually hear your response, judge it against the way the Evan (Ph) is supposed to identify the prosecution and decide something from that. The more he attempts to meander and grandstand and make political speeches, the less inclined to judges to have an actual factual predicate to find in his favor. BASH: But you know, what, Laura, what's interesting about the point you just made is your sort of describing a scenario in which this is a normal trial. And I know normal is not the word we should use for any of this. But by that what I mean is that we have a couple of quotes, from Donald Trump this morning to the judge the first two that we have. One is, he said, I'm sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me. And the second one, this is a very unfair trial. Here's the first one. This is a very unfair trial. Very, very, and I hope the public is watching Elliot. I spoke to somebody in Trump's world about this going into today, who made very clear that what we might see is a aggressive request for a mistrial. Is it possible that, I don't know if we'll get it, but is it possible that the tact that the former president took this morning, these are two quotes that are examples is going for just that.",

There's a political strategy and a legal strategy. This is a political strategy playing to the folks in South Carolina and Nevada or wherever else, but not the judge. He could lose this trial on the basis of his conduct.There was a statement that the judges made, I'm prepared to draw every negative inference against your testimony, if you continue doing this. I can kick you out of this courtroom in a civil trial. And that may well happen, he could lose the trial and lose $250 million. Now, whether voters still vote for him is not the judge's concern.

I mean, it goes to his very core of who he is. And you know, even back in 2016, he went out on the campaign trail and said, you know, I'm very rich, and I'm a good businessman, and I knew how to take advantage of the tax laws, because I'm smart. And so, he doesn't want anybody to show that he wasn't in total control of things. Yet, in order to prove his case, he maybe should be doing what his sons did, which is to say, you know what, we didn't really pay attention to this, but he can't -- he can't do that.

He is attacking the Attorney General Letitia James, of course, brought this case and is seated in that very courtroom. He is calling the investigation disgraceful. He is attacking her as a political hack.And at one point, the judge was letting Trump essentially continue with these answers, because the lawyer for the AG's office was saying, I'm not going to strike that from the record, I'm going to let that stay in there because essentially, they believe it could potentially be helpful to them. The judge laughed at that, and said, OK, and then he continued, going on launching this attack on the attorney general for even prosecuting him in the first place. And so essentially, it was just a few moments where there had been no attacks per se directly from the former president. He was just exaggerating about his properties, talking about why the values were what they work. Now it has gotten back to where he is going after the judge, and he is going after the attorney general.

Trump himself has been fined by this judge $15,000 himself for going after that clerk.And when he took the stand today, he was certainly not trying to gain good favor with the judge. I mean, it was very quickly combative, with the judge being frustrated with how Trump was answering these questions. And the judge himself has noted that well, that he is the decision maker here. And yet, this is not something that Trump seems to be arguing that point. I think part of that could be a strategy that Trump already knows that he has lost his case, basically, because the judge decided beforehand that yes, he was liable for fraud. And what we saw is them laying the ground for an appeal. I mean, the Trump is clearly potentially trying to provoke the judge here. The judges' frustrations have been made quite clear in court. I think that's a question of how that would look upon appeal.
