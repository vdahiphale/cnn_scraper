And we're watching several big stories that are raising concerns across the globe.First, new signs of the Biden administration's frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to CNN contributor and Axios reporter Barak Ravid, the White House has canceled a high level meeting with Israel on Iran that was set for tomorrow. And this is a response to a video of Netanyahu accusing the U.S. of withholding military aid. And in North Korea, the U.S. is keeping a watchful eye on what is a deepening alliance between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. Today, those two leaders signing a major agreement pledging to help each other if their countries are attacked.",

The one official told CNN that that had everything to do with Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments. Other officials telling CNN that it was simply a scheduling issue. But either way, what we are seeing is that these frustrations coming from U.S. officials and Israeli officials are no longer just being aired in private as the war continues. The ceasefire deal does not appear imminent. And of course, both President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu are under tremendous pressure at home.",

      "sentences": "I think it could be pretty significant. I mean, look, I mean, it's a strategic partnership treaty that they've signed. It was the centerpiece of these lavish ceremonies, welcoming Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader to the North Korean capital. There's an important security dimension as part of that treaty.And so, we could see more of the kinds of things we have been seeing, which is North Korean ammunition, basically allowing Russia to sustain a massive barrage of artillery strikes predominantly on the frontlines in Ukraine. Of course, the Kremlin and Pyongyang deny there's been weapons exchanges or ammunition shipments, because that's in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions. But nevertheless, it's the assessment of U.S. officials and other governments as well, that that is what's taking place, it could be more of that. And on the other side of that equation, there is concern about what it means in North Korea, what North Korea will get in return for the supplying of that kind of military assistance to Russia. It needs a lot of help with its ballistic missile program, its nuclear program, both programs that have been used to threaten the United States and its allies in the past. And so, it could be a new and dangerous phase in military cooperation between these two countries. Vladimir Putin as well saying that one important aspect of this new treaty is mutual assistance, so much like NATO's clause five, if one side is attacked, the other side is compelled to sort of join in the fight as it were. It's not clear that would actually mean whether that would be a way of bringing North Korea even more into Russia's conflict when it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. So, a period of great concern with this emerging alliance.",

We do appreciate it.Let's discuss all of these international headlines a bit further now with former U.S. ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker. Ambassador, thanks for being with us. How significant do you see this agreement to be? And what are the possible implications as you see it? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Yes, well, I don't think there's a whole lot new in this that we didn't already know before. Russia has become dependent upon North Korean ammunition to continue its ability to continue to attack Ukraine. We knew that. And in exchange for that, Putin is granting Kim Jong-un a higher status. He's showing up there. They're signing this big agreement. He's making Kim Jong-un more presentable on an international stage by being with Vladimir Putin. Probably also helping with missile technology. All of this is stuff we've known, I think what it shows is that Russia truly has become dependent upon these systems, and then wants to try to build this anti-Western alliance with whoever it can grab. And so, working with North Korea is a -- is an easy one for Putin if he can get the weapons.",

We have had a difficult time over the last 2-1/2 years, people look at the Biden administration as having gone too slowly and not provided enough and still providing restrictions on the use of weapons. They look at the Trump administration and remember that it was Trumpthat reversed the arms ban on Ukraine and provided the first Javelin missiles and they fundamentally don't want to be a part of U.S. domestic politics. So, they're just taking it as it is. What the Ukrainians focus on is what the needs are. And the needs are for more reliable supplies of arms and ammunition quicker and without restrictions so that they can truly defend themselves.

And I don't think that serves U.S. national security interests. I don't think it serves Ukraine's interests, because Ukraine actually is facing a serious threat, a serious aggression by a much larger neighbor. They are fighting to defend their freedom, their families, their homes, they need help to do that. And it's, frankly, in our interest, and it's a bipartisan interest to help Ukraine, get what it needs and defeat Putinism inside Ukraine, so that we don't have to deal with Putinism attacking others.",

Trump has to be able to prove that he is still presidential in his approach. And his final debate against Biden, the series that we saw in 2020, it was an embarrassment for him and for the country, that women turned against him because they found him rude, they found him abusive. This is something that Trump voters don't want to hear. But the way Donald Trump acted in that first presidential debate with Chris Wallace, as the host, was vicious, personal, mean, and it turned voters off against him. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has to prove that he's still not only with it, but engaged and involved. And voters are not going to be asking him what he did over the last four years, they're going to be asking him what he's going to be doing over the next four. And it would be a mistake for him to say, hey, look, look at all the legislation we got passed, look at the compromise that we were able to do with Congress, because that's not what this presidential campaign is going to be about.

To me, it's not that Donald Trump is winning so big in Iowa. That's not the story. It's that he's making it close in Minnesota. Minnesota is a reliable democratic state and votes Democrat in every presidential campaign and poll after poll. I see Trump within two or three points in Minnesota. I don't think the media understands exactly what's going on right now. Yes, Trump dropped a few points after being found guilty on 34 felony accounts, but remember this, that would have destroyed any candidate as recently as 10 years ago. And the fact that Donald Trump is still even with or in some cases leading Joe Biden after being found guilty of 34 felonies? Oh, my God, that is so significant. And one more point, I'm watching the independent vote. I don't believe that they're swaying back and forth between Trump and Biden. I think that they decided that they hate both candidates. They hate both parties. And they're voting out of anger, out of desperation, out of resentment, that this is what our political system has gotten. So, be very careful on how you analyze what goes on from now to the debates, to the election, because I think there could be a hidden anger vote that surprises everyone on Election Day.",
