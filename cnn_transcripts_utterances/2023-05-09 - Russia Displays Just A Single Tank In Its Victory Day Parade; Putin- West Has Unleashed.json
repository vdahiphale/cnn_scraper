      "sentences": "A single tank, some very young-looking soldiers, not much else. That was Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow today. Usually, a massive event.No doubt, Vladimir Putin certainly would have liked to use the occasion to declare victory in Ukraine. That's not the reality. Instead, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, in his speech today, reminded Russia that it has not yet taken the city of Bakhmut by today, as Putin had vowed to do. And there's this new reporting today. Despite recent saber rattling by senior Russian officials, I'm told by multiple officials that the U.S. has detected no signs of movement or change to Russia's nuclear forces. Russian leaders, you'll remember, have repeatedly raised the prospect of nuclear war in recent months. And the U.S. and its allies have carefully monitored Russian's nuclear forces for any signs of movement or preparations to deploy them. A senior administration official tells me that, as a result, the U.S. has made no changes to its own strategic posture. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow. Fred, this was meant to be a big day for the Russian president. Not the day he imagined. Yet, he did deliver a fiery speech. What was his message?",

      "sentences": "Yes, a fiery speech, you're absolutely right. Certainly, a speech full of anger as well. It was about 10 minutes long.And you know, on the positive side, he did say that Russia didn't want bad relations with other countries, whether they were to the east or to the West. He also praised U.S. troops, other Western ally troops and Chinese troops who fought on the side of the Soviet Union in World War II, but that was about it as far as the positives are concerned. On the other hand, he accused Western nations, especially the United States, of essentially trying to oppress Russia, saying that they were trying to instill non-traditional values in the world community and obviously in Russia, as well. And one of main things he did is he essentially blamed the U.S. and its allies for the war in Ukraine. I want you to listen in to some of what Vladimir Putin had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): The Ukrainian nation has become hostage to a coup, which led to a criminal regime led by its Western masters. It has become a pawn to their cruel and selfish plans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's certainly something that we noticed that other observers noticed as well, that single T-34 tank. That is a model from World War II. Also, not really any other new technology. If we remember, back in the past, you'll have seen this as well, the Russians usually showcase their new weapons in a parade like this. None of that today -- Jim?",

And here's a look at some of the other headlines we're following this hour.An Army sergeant convicted of murdering a Black Lives Matter protester is being sentenced today, even as Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already said that he will seek to pardon him. Daniel Perry was convicted of a murder charge in the 2020 shooting death of Garrett Foster. This was at a racial justice protest in Austin, Texas, that followed the death of George Floyd. Perry's legal team argued that his actions were justified as self-defense. And officials in southwest Louisiana have just charged a 58-year-old man for shooting a group of children who were playing hide and seek. Authorities say that a group of juveniles were hiding on a neighbor's property when the homeowner fired his weapon and asked them to leave. A 14-year-old girl was shot in the back of the head. She was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Also, one of the country's largest military bases got a new name today. Ft. Hood in Colleen, Texas, which was named after a Confederate general, is now Ft. Cavazos in honor of General Richard Edward Cavazos, the Army's first Hispanic four-star general. The central Texas post is one of nine Army locations that will be renamed after a push from Congress to remove Confederate names from military bases. Boris?",

And this thing has been floating around in space that long. And the metal ones are very rare, because they are actually -- this is probably something that almost formed a planet, and so the metal sank to the bottom, just like we have the metal core in the earth.

Didn't tear all the way and blow a hole all the way to the basement, which shows that the air resistance actually slowed it quite a bit. Because these things are incredibly -- 400,000 miles an hour or so in space, but once they get to the atmosphere, the atmosphere really slows them down. So it landed and only punched through the roof and didn't make it any further. You really see the effect of the earth's atmosphere, which usually burns these things up.",

But you want to preserve that interior. So you want to keep them cold. So you can kind of cut them open and see -- these things have hints about the birth of the solar system. This is pristine material leftover from the assembly of the planets. So probably, you know, someone's going to want to cut these open and do some studies on it. But it may be that it comes back to the family. And sometimes these things can fetch a reasonable amount of money.
