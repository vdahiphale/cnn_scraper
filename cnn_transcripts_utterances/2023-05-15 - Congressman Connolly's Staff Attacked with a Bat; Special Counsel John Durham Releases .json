We're in Fairfax, Virginia just about 20 miles outside Washington, D.C. Now, police have identified this suspect as 49-year-old Xuan Kha Tran Pham. They say that he entered the office and then struck two staffers with a metal bat. One staffer was a senior aide struck in the head, the other one an intern, it was actually her first day on the job. Now, our Capitol Hill team actually did talk to Congressman Connolly on the phone. He says that this attacker really went on a rampage, smashing some of the windows inside in the conference room, also breaking computers. Here is more from the Fairfax City police sergeant.

In fact, he says in the past six years, the threat has increased 400 percent.

And the bottom line he says is that, you know, the evidence gathered in the multiple exhaustive and costly federal investigations of these matters including the instant investigation, neither U.S. law enforcement nor the intelligence community appears to have possessed any actual evidence of collusion in their holdings at Kremlin with -- of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. He's saying, look, he spent four years looking at this. He investigated a lot of different things. The FBI made a lot of mistakes. I'll read you just a statement right now just we got from FBI director Chris Wray who says that they made a lot of reforms at the FBI and he says had these reforms been in place in 2016, the missteps identified in this report could have been prevented.

I don't think this actually rises to the level of witch hunt, but this today kind of gives him a little credence on that. I think, you know, this report appears to be -- I haven't read the 300 pages, but appears to be kind of in the middle ground between it wasn't truly a witch hunt, but also there were some real issues here. So, I think each side kind of take what they want from it. But I hope we take from this.

But at the same time, he also has rejected this allegation saying that this -- the meeting that was supposed to bring this about had occurred between himself and the Ukrainian intelligence officers somewhere in Africa. He's claiming that he has never actually set foot in Africa during the whole period of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, so couldn't have been attending that meeting. It's a very murky story indeed. There is no proof positive one way or the other. This is U.S. intelligence that's been unverified. But I think it's also partly, potentially now, even if it wasn't designed as such, playing into the psychological operations ahead of what is assumed to be a major summer offensive from the Ukrainians, sowing discord and this certainly does just that in the ranks of the Russians.
