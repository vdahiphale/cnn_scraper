And more breaking news. We hear from the students who stopped the alleged Georgia gunman from entering her classroom. This as the suspect and his father made their first appearances in court. And the accusations tonight against a top New York governor's aide read like spy novel. Was she an agent of the Chinese government? Tonight, what the Chinese government does not want the world to know. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good Friday evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, another big Republican name backing Kamala Harris tonight. That's the former Vice President Dick Cheney, who says he will vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. The statement was just released from Dick Cheney in which he writes: In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence. He can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our constitution. And that is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. Obviously, Dick Cheney, I mean, was someone who was reviled by the left, reviled. I mean, he served as George W. Bush's vice president, George H.W. Bush's defense secretary, Gerald Ford's chief of staff, ten years as a Republican congressman, instrumental to the Iraq war. An even as Harris is hunkering down for debate prep in Pittsburgh tonight, she is on the airwaves, going up directly capitalizing on this moment, but going after Trump aggressively. So in an interview on Univision radio which we just 18 million people, she said this: (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You know, this, this person who has talked about how immigrants poison the blood of America, this person who seeks to divide our nation, belittling people, belittling members of the military for goodness sake.

In August, as we mentioned, he raised $130 million, which it sounds like a lot. It is though less than he raised in July and Harris raised nearly three times that during the month. So that is the context. According to her campaign, the vice president brought in 361 million in the same timeframe that Trump brought in 130. [19:05:094] And Harris's team is already putting that massive amount of money to work. They say they're planning 2,000 events across the country, their purchase right now in campaign ads already $370 million in committed money. MJ Lee is OUTFRONT live outside the White House. And, MJ, Trump off message today talking about Jessica Leeds. She wouldn't have had the chosen one the -- I guess if he were choosing who he was going to have a sexual relationship with I mean, this is where he was today.

So we've lost that. It takes a big thing off the table people for us. So, now, as the vice president, as you said, is hunkering down in Pittsburgh for the next stretch of days to really focus on debate prep. I am told by this source that a big mission for that team is going to be figuring out how to remedy for the fact that her mic is going to be muted. You know, when you talk to Harris allies, they will often point to moments in a hearing committees -- committee hearings, excuse me, when she was senator, when she would grill people, like Brett Kavanaugh, like Bill Barr, and really showing that prosecutorial side of her and this is exactly what they had hoped the vice president would be able to do on the debate stage with Donald Trump. That is responding to him questioning him, even interrupting in real time and showing that side of her that she now they believe can't do as freely given that the mics are going to be muted. The other piece of this, of course, is that they believe the -- with the mics now being off. That, that is not going to display sort of the more unhinged side of Donald Trump that they were hoping that they would be able to show the public next week. So, all of these things are things that they are trying to remedy for, again. Again, they've been very clear that this is not a rule that they are happy with. But again, they felt like they had to accept it for this debate to continue.",

He can ever be trusted with power again and I'm casting my vote for vice President Kamala Harris. Does it give you any pause? SCOTT TAYLOR (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  No, listen, let me first -- let me first say, I have respect for the former vice president and obviously Liz, we work closely when we were in Congress both of them, and they're entitled to their opinions and who they want to support and not support, and I just -- I've I disagree with them. I deeply disagree with what they're doing. I don't think it moves the needle at all to be honest with you. And it's, you know, Kamala Harris, vice -- the vice president, her policies and positions are in direct confrontation of the values that the former vice president and Liz have, 100 percent.

This money will allow Kamala Harris, who has a much bigger and larger, more advanced operation in terms of turning out the vote, than Donald Trump does, it will allow them to continue to power that operation in which is huge, it's a huge machine.And whether or not that machine is able to overcome the momentum that Donald Trump has not because he has a lot of offices are a lot of staff in these states because people genuinely decide that they want to vote for him. People think that he is their standard bearer. He is the person that represents them. They came out in large numbers in 2020 and in 2016, whether or not, you know, the machinery and the money behind Kamala Harris can overcome some of the momentum that Donald Trump has had over the course of his career.

But we know that means. I wouldn't actually grab her by the, you know, you know what. That's what he's talking about today. I think the reason that he did it is because he is desperate and he's trying to find any kind of hook, any kind of red meat for his base. He's literally throwing everything at the wall. So every time he gets up there and says, look, the Democrats are persecuting me in the court. It helps him with his fundraising and helps him with his base.

First, it was telling these freedmen, the newly freed slaves, who could vote for the first time that he was going to do everything in his power for them. And he won and he won in a big way. Well, then a few years later, when the Republican Party that he was a part of it in Louisiana kind of threw him to the curb, he changed, and he -- but he did so with a lot of people still following him. And there is a quote in here from our book -- I just want to read this to you in this really speaks to the parallels that you're talking about. The people who had allegiance to Warmoth defied description. It appeared there were willing to die or kill for him. The question was, why? In that case, they knew he was corrupt. People loved to love him. They loved to hate him. And he was a very charismatic figure who was all about staying in power. I mean, it is amazing when you think about that and just the power of personality and charisma, as you say, I mean that extremely loyal base that he had, that Trump has.

It is unclear what the FBI is exactly investigating with these raids and it comes as a former top aide for Governor Kathy Hochul is now accused of being a secret Chinese agent.Will Ripley is OUTFRONT with new details tonight. (BEGIN VIDSEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The dramatic downfall of Linda Sun, once a top aide to New York's current and former governors, now accused of secretly working for China, making headlines around the world. But on Beijing's tightly controlled state media and heavily censored social media, silence. China's foreign ministry refusing to even comment on what they described as a domestic U.S. case. Prosecutors say Sun was working overtime, pushing Beijing's agenda for years. She's accused of forging documents to help Chinese officials illegally enter the U.S., quietly removing references to China's human rights record from a lunar new year greeting in 2021 by former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. In July 2019, attending this pro-China rally in New York, coinciding with this visit to New York by Tsai Ing-wen, then-president of Beijing's arch rival Taiwan. Prosecutors say behind closed doors, Sun was coordinating with Chinese diplomats, blocking Taiwanese officials from key meetings and securing favors for China. This is just the latest high-stakes scandal involving Beijing's covert influence. Last month, this New York man, Shujun Wang, convicted of spying for the Chinese communist party, posing as a pro-democracy activists, Also last year, the Justice Department says it uncovered a secret Chinese police station operating in Manhattan, accused of intimidating Chinese dissidents living in the U.S. Reports at the time claimed more than 100 secret Chinese police stations in more than 50 countries and territories. China dismissed the claims as completely false, calling the locations, service centers, to help citizens abroad with renewing official documents like their Chinese driver licenses. This new 64-page indictment from U.S. federal prosecutors in New York reads like a spy novel accusing Linda Sun of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, conspiring with her husband, Chris Hu, to commit bank fraud, accusing both of money laundering millions of dollars from China, bankrolling the couple's luxurious lifestyle, paying cash for their nearly $4 million Long Island mansion and $2 million condo in Hawaii, buying brand new cars, like a 2024 Ferrari and range Rover, funneling millions to her husband's businesses, even sending her parents dozens of salted ducks at Chinese delicacy.
