Live pictures outside Trump Tower in New York where the former president will soon leave from there to go to court for his criminal hush money trial.The National Enquirer's former publisher, David Pecker, expected to face more questions during cross-examination today, and then the prosecutors will get their chance to go back at him and redirect. Stay with CNN all day for special live coverage of that trial. All right. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, insists it has no plans to sell it and calls reports indicating otherwise untrue. This week, as you know, President Biden signed a law that could lead to a nationwide ban of the app if the company continues to refuse to sell. It's part of a larger foreign aid package for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan. Lawmakers have security concerns about TikTok's algorithm. Despite the new law, TikTok's CEO says they're not going anywhere. And an emotional moment caught on camera. Supermodel Gisele Bundchen breaking down in tears during a traffic stop in Florida, telling police she's crying over the fact, she says, that paparazzi had been stalking and following here.

A new CNN poll finds only 13 percent -- just 13 percent nationwide feel that Donald Trump is being treated the same as any other defendant. And when you look within that number, most Americans, though, are divided over whether he's being treated more harshly or more leniently -- more leniently. CNN senior political analyst Mark Preston has been going through those numbers. Leniently is a really hard word to say on television, I'm just going to say, Mark. One question in the presidential election is whether or not voters are going to take this case into consideration when it comes to their vote. Yes, there's a lot we don't know yet and a far way to go. But what you're seeing in the numbers, is the hush money trial impacting how voters feel about him right now?",

So you have more than half of Americans don't believe that Donald Trump's going to get a fair trial up in Manhattan. Of course, we've heard him say that over and over and over again.But, Kate, I want to go back to something that's incredibly interesting because Donald Trump famously said back in 2016 -- in January 2016 in Sioux City, Iowa, that he could go onto Fifth Avenue and -- let me just give you exactly what he said. \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shot somebody, and I wouldn't lose voters.\" Well, you know what? This isn't exactly equivalent to that but it's kind of close. Let's take a look at this number right here because this really shows you where Donald Trump is with his supporters.

This is a standard course of business for the National Enquirer to kind of get this information and then use it for leverage for other things.

So that was certainly a headscratcher. Here was your top 10 picks. Half of them, again, were quarterbacks for the first time ever. The Vikings traded up to 10 to take Michigan's J.J. McCarthy. Quarterback Bo Nix also went 12th to the Denver Broncos. Now, the draft is going to continue tonight with rounds two and three. And just look at the crowd they had for night one in Detroit.

He has a presumption of innocence until the case goes to the jury, and that was gone, the appellate court said, before it went to the jury. And also, a right to a fair trial and his due process rights were violated. Number one: they said no witnesses are allowed in New York. Now, all across the country, they're called prior bad act witnesses. And in Weinstein's case, four of them took the stand. It was very difficult for them to testify as to sexual crimes they say Weinstein committed against them. Now, this did not go toward the charges. It was mentioned in the indictment. But prosecutors got those four in. And it is appropriate to show certain things like a pattern of conduct. But the appellate court said you had three accusers. Then, judge, you allowed four more to come in. And there were so many that there was no presumption of innocence when the jury got that case. He was guilty already. That was number one. Number two: if Weinstein had decided to take the stand, the judge ruled that only would he be cross-examined on all four of those, but he would also be cross-examined on things he did in the workplace. Throwing food in somebody's face. Bullying employees. The court said no relevance. And because of that, the jury was denied to hear his testimony because he stayed silent because he wasn't going to take the stand under those circumstances. And the difficult thing is, though, that these women that had to take the stand and they gave their stories -- Mirian Haley -- Gloria Allred represented the one victim. There was a conviction and she would have to take the stand again. And Gloria Allred said in a statement that she is -- she will try to take the stand again if there is a retrial. But obviously, this is difficult and it's a shock to so many. But he's not innocent, the court said. The blame is really on the judge allowing too much into the trial. BOLDUAN:  Yeah. We're seeing some of Glora Allred's statement there and what's she saying about what this does. Jean, it's great to see you. Thank you very much for that -- Sara.",

Everybody was shocked when that case got overturned but it's the same principle.Basically, prior bad act evidence, meaning uncharged crimes -- things that don't have to with a case in principle -- can only come in if it's to show a propensity and modus operandi relating to that conduct. It can't come into impugn the defendant's character. And so, it's a fine line as to whether or not that evidence can actually come in. Witnesses can testify. And in some of these cases -- Bill Cosby and, now, Harvey Weinstein -- appellate courts have found the judges went too far. They let too much in and ultimately, that impacted the rights of the defendant. Keep in mind, Sara, it's not just Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. It sets a standard for any other criminal defendant. And that's why the appellate courts are very strict about when this type of evidence can come into the courtroom.",
