They suggest that she was trying to convey information to the Russians about a likely visit by Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Mykolaiv in the past. That's the key port city down on the south and some of the messages that were exchanged. Apparently show them suggesting her interlocutors suggesting well, can you get a picture of where he might be going into the hospital? What time are we talking about that sort of thing? And another reminder, I think too of the daily threats against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a man who famously at the start refused to leave Kyiv saying I don't need ammo. I don't think they're right. I need ammo allegedly when asked if he wanted an evacuation. And so this information coming out I say as we hear a lot from Ukrainian security services about their activities in the Black Sea.

You know, China wants economic stability. India wants economic stability. Its economy has been hit by Russia's war in Ukraine. It considers itself neutral. But United States Ukraine, their allies and partners would say India is buying up oil and gas from Russia that European nations are not buying. And there are allegations that India is actually on selling some of it to European markets. But the point being that, because India's position is currently to buy products from Russia, it has an economic ability to either continue to sustain Putin's war in Ukraine, or to limit it if they were to stop buying some of those products. But that's not, you know, the economics of that for India don't really work out. They're having a tough economic time because of the war. So they want the war to end too. I think that's a commonality of most of these participants around the table, that it's having the wars having a bad economic effect on them. And therefore they'd like to also put pressure on Ukraine to get more realistic in their view, and buckle up and get some kind of peace deal that that's not everything that Ukraine wants. But the position at the moment is Ukraine was there to sell its 10 point peace plan. And a key part of that peace plan, as you said, is that Ukraine's territorial sovereignty and integrity should be respected in keeping with the UN Charter. And that does still seem to be the central tenet of these ongoing. And therefore it's important because Ukraine's position is continuing to be held as an important central point of the narrative going forward and that's a message for Russia whether or not they're at the table.",

And what happened were roughly 11, Russian and Chinese vessels were operating very close to the Coast of Alaska near the Aleutian Islands, according to the State Senators, Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski. The U.S. then chose to respond sending for U.S. Navy destroyers, as well as planes to monitor the situation and track those vessels movements. But ultimately, according to a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command, those ships did not pose a threat to either the U.S. or Canada. And importantly, they stayed in international waters now the Senators issued a statement that was a bit more concerned in its tone. And they said that this is really an example of Russia and China showing authoritarian aggression in the region. And they said that they had received a number of classified briefings by U.S. military officials about the transit of the ships near Alaska. Notably, this is not the first time that this has happened. Russian and Chinese vessels also performed an exercise off the coast of Alaska last year, and were met by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel that was just on a routine patrol, so Dan Sullivan, who is one of those Senators from Alaska. He did say that he appreciates that the response this time around was a bit more robust, of course, sending those destroyers as well as the reconnaissance aircraft to monitor the ship's activities. But we should note that the Chinese Embassy also released a statement telling CNN that the activity there was not directed at any third party and had nothing to do with \"The international or regional situation\". So obviously, they're trying to downplay it here, the U.S. reiterating the principle of freedom of navigation, emphasizing that they weren't international waters.

And looking at the pictures of the mangled wreckage of the aftermath it's not difficult to understand why. Yesterday the Hazara Express left Karachi, Pakistan's largest city at 8 am local with 950 passengers on board. More than five hours later, just after 1 pm the train derailed near the town of Nawabshah in Sind Province 170 miles from Karachi. Authority say the train was traveling at moderate speed 28 miles an hour when it ran off the tracks 10 cars derailed. This is a remote farming area. So the first people on the scene were local villages trying to pull survivors from the wreckage. Eyewitnesses spoke of people screaming and body everywhere, including women and children. Local media reports it took hours for emergency crews to arrive. They had to bring in heavy machinery to free passengers who were trapped the military also assisted. The injured were taken to local hospitals where an emergency was declared to deal with the influx of patients. Body bags lay on the ground next to survivors. Let's now have a listen to one of those survivors.",

They were very adamant in trying to stress the President that it was something that was likely to lead to, as you mentioned, humanitarian influx, very big issues in the region. So we know that domestic concerns are playing a very big role, and they're really trying to ensure that most regional powers are actively looking inwards to try to find more diplomatic ways to really deal with the situation.

And as the World Cup thrillers and upsets continue, the viewership is soaring in the United States alone. The group stage matches average more than 4.3 million viewers setting a new record. Nearly 6.5 million Americans watch the U.S.-Netherlands match that's over a 20 percent increase from four years ago. Great news for the sponsors and businesses, that purchased advertising space throughout the tournament. Marketing and sponsorship agency goals say sponsors of the women's sport reap better returns than sponsors of the men's sports. And joining us now is the GOALS CEO Caroline Fitzgerald, great to have you with us. So first of all, I just want to say commiserations for the U.S. Women's National Team exiting the group yesterday in heartbreaking fashion. How is that been felt there stateside?",

Our hearts are with theteam and incredible performance by them though, and kudos to them. The legacy of that team is not just this one game it doesn't come down to just a few penalty kicks. We know the legacy of that team goes far beyond that with four World Cups under their belt. So we're definitely feeling it over here. But honestly, I think that I'm leaving is a testament to the increased caliber of football that we're seeing in this world cup because of increased investment that's going into Federation's across the globe.",

But what we're proving here with this World Cup, and with the trajectory of women's sports that we've seen over the last few years, is that it's good business. So as more brand investment comes in we're going to see that pay gap equal out, because it's a business as more money comes in, more money is going to go out and that's going to return to the players.",

I mean, perhaps more than any othercompanies Zoom saw its fortunes just skyrocketed during COVID. Because its technology helped make remote work possible. Look at that stock chart, the stock was trading at around $68, late 2019. It got up to almost $600 at the peak in late 2020. And it's basically back to where it started because this remote work boom has unwound to some extent. And so Zoom is saying that its employees do need to be back in the office. If they live close enough. Here's what the company says in a statement, \"We believe that a structured hybrid approach meaning a set number of days, employees that live near an office need to be on site is most effective for Zoom. So you know, in some ways, this is the end of an era, because it's coming from Zoom, and it is symbolic of this broader shift. A lot of tech companies have been trying hard to get employees to come back to the office at least a few days a week including Meta and Google owner Alphabet. Obviously, this is disappointing to some employees who liked the flexibility of all remote work means less time commuting, maybe easier childcare, easier to get stuff done around the house, so disappointing to that extent. But it is noteworthy that even the White House wants employees back in the office just on Friday, the Chief of Staff of the White House sent in a note to agency chief saying that they want federal agency workers to be back at least a few days a week and they cited the benefits of productivity and Christina, at the end of the public health emergency.",

I think that this is a sign of a phenomenon. Clearly the marketing, all the marketing that went into this movie that was made by Warner Brothers' discovery, which is the parent company of CNN, really has paid off. And it shows that people still want to go to the box office, they still want to see these big stars. And that's translating into tremendous success for the movie and also the movie theater industry, which could use this boost as it tries to recover from the impact of the pandemic and also faces this writers and actors strike that could delay movies and new releases.",
