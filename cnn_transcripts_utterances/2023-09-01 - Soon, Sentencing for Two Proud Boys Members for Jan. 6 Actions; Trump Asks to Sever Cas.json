Trump is already making moves to try and push off the start of that trial, his trial, just as some of his co-defendants are asking to speed things up in Georgia. With all of that happening, I guess we could describe it as behind the scenes. Just yesterday, Donald Trump formally entered a plea of not guilty in that election subversion case. He also waived his right to appear in Fulton County for his arraignment, which was set for Wednesday. CNN's Zachary Cohen has very latest on all of these moving parts, and there's a lot of them, Zach, around this case.

These are former government officials who are arguing that their role -- everything they did around the 2020 election, they were doing under the auspice of their government job. Now, Trump has not formally filed a motion to try to get his case moved, and it's very likely his lawyers are watching and waiting to see what happens in Meadows' case.

So, first of all, as a starting point, the issue here is whether or not the crimes that have been charged were essentially for acts were under the color of his official duties. The bottom line is the judge has already signaled that the RICO crime that has been charged, the full scope of that wasn't part of Meadows' duties, but certain pieces of it, what was called an overt act, were part of the official duties of Meadows, or at least the judge hinted at that.There's really nothing like this in the past. There's been no case quite like this one. It will be interesting to see what the judge does. What I expect the judge to do is ultimately decide with the prosecutor here, because, you know what, the prosecutors are the ones who write the indictment. And so I think they wrote the indictment in a way to make it sound like it wasn't official. So, I think they have the upper hand here, and they have the better argument too.",

MARIOTTIIn this case, I think that the people who asked for a very speedy trial, Kenneth Cheseboro, the other Trump former lawyers who asked for a very speedy trial, I think they're going to get their own trial.

On the day of the first Republican presidential debate, the leaders of the super PAC backing Ron DeSantis made a big ask.According to the leaked audio obtained by CNN, the super PAC heads told donors gathered in Milwaukee they needed $50 million, and they needed it quickly. CNN Steve Contorno is part of the reporting team that obtained this audio, has this very interesting insight in reporting into this major super PAC leading the way for Ron DeSantis. So, Steve, what was the pitch? What do they need?",

And on days where he's indicted or going through to his legal troubles, that grows to $100 million a day. And so they told the room, we need resources to fight that.How much? Well, listen to what Chris Jankowski said. We just need your help getting $50 million more by the end of the year and $100 million more by the end of March. I'm not worried about the second 50. We need the first 50. And that is quite the ask, given that the super PAC had raised on its own less than $50 million from the time it entered -- DeSantis entered the race, and it created itself to the end of June. But the super PAC has built out essentially an unprecedented operation. We've never seen a super Pac essentially take on many of the aspects of a campaign. They are hosting DeSantis on the campaign trail. They're handling a lot of the logistics. But one expense they didn't expect to take on was advertising, and that is incredibly expensive. About $25 million of advertising has already been placed by the super PAC in Iowa, New Hampshire, for the fall. And so this money is going to help spread that message and keep that message going through in Iowa and New Hampshire through the rest of the year. I think elsewhere in the audio is really interesting, they talk about who a typical Ron DeSantis voter is. Jeff Roe, the chief strategist for the super PAC, said, if you have an education, if you have higher income, if you read the Bible and go to church regularly, you happen to be a DeSantis supporter.

So, they are taking on, as they call it, the weaponization of the Justice Department and these political prosecutions, as they are trying to portray the real legal peril that Donald Trump is in and sort of protect him from that with ad dollars, but they also have an ad up talking about Donald Trump as the extreme frontrunner in this race.Rahel, the spending, the $100 million mark is substantial.

But that is something that is going to have to get tested through the courts. And so what you're seeing here in some states, elections officials are like, well, let's get to that test.
