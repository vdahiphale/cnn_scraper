Now, in conversations with Israeli military, they are honest that they don't know how many of them are alive or dead. The most detail they've given us on this is to say that they believe some of them may have actually died as they were being brought from Israel into Gaza. But that's the most we've been able to get. While there have been reports that maybe a dozen hostages were killed in strikes, there has been no confirmation of that. We have absolutely no visibility on that, other than that we understand from the IDF that they're being held in tunnels sort of scattered around Gaza that Hamas has not been known to use before. That's still the very latest that we have on that. But as you point out, a very significant increase. And Poppy, it could point out more intelligence. It could point out more negotiations going on, that they actually have a real sense of the number. But it's impossible to really put -- put details around what it means.

He's been in Egypt with El Sisi there and having that conversation, as well. They want a humanitarian corridor. They want Americans out of Gaza. There are a lot of Americans and Palestinian-Americans in Gaza. And that is even separate, of course, from the broader humanitarian crisis you're talking about. Secretary Blinken, obviously, was here on Friday and then was -- I'm sorry, on Thursday, and then was traveling through the United -- through the region, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, desperately trying for some sort of diplomacy. Then coming back here, it was announced late yesterday. So he's here now in a meeting with the prime minister. There was a congressional -- I'm sorry, senatorial delegation here last night. Senator Romney was here. Senator Kelly and Majority Leader Schumer. And they told me -- I asked Senator Schumer why was Blinken coming back? Was the purpose of this perhaps to get Prime Minister Netanyahu to stall or to slow down, to bring this down a notch? His view was no. That's not the purpose at all, that secretary Blinken is here primarily to try to keep diplomacy in the region on track but not to try to influence, in any way, the decisions that Netanyahu may make on the timing of this -- this anticipated ground invasion of Gaza. And ahead of that, of course, you talk about the Gaza refugees and getting people out of there. There is, of course, a broader sort of evacuation going on in Israel itself. A flight with nearly 300 Americans on board who were previously stranded in Israel actually left overnight. That flight went to Tampa, Florida overnight. We're also aware that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order for charter flights for Floridians trapped in Israel. And DeSantis was then there. It was a real publicity moment for him on the runway. And the United States is helping more Americans evacuate Israel. As you all know, it's hard. There is no Lebanese border. There is no Syrian border that you can cross, or Saudi border, right? You've got to go Jordan or you've got to go by sea. And so they have a ship, 10 to 12 hours on this giant evacuation ship from the U.S. military, from Haifa, going to Cypress. Our Natasha Bertrand is live at the Pentagon.

And it is really a sign that the U.S. is concerned about the possibility that additional groups, additional actors will try to join this conflict. And so it is meant as a deterrent, primarily against Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that the U.S. has expressed so much worry about, the possibility that they could open a new front in this conflict. Of course, Iran, which backs Hezbollah and also backs Hamas, also very concerned that they could get involved somehow. So two aircraft carriers, strike carriers, in this region, really significant.

They know if Israel tries to take out Hamas's weapons, they're going to hit the U.N.-run schools. They put their command centers, the military command centers, in hospitals, because they know if Israel tries to hit a command center, they can say, Look, you hit a hospital. So the last thing they want is dispersing the Palestinians to other parts of Gaza, to Southern Gaza. That makes it harder for Hamas to use them as human shields. Egypt doesn't want all these Palestinians coming in over the Rafah border. They say that it's a humanitarian plight and that we should look after the Palestinians', you know, needs and their humanitarian needs. But the one easy way to do it is to move them across the Rafah border into Egypt, and they don't want to do that. Now, what Egypt is doing is trying to move, apparently, food and other healthcare supplies into Gaza. Israel is letting them do that. That's tricky, because you don't know who controls them once you send them into Gaza. Is Hamas in control of them? Are terrorists getting access to those supplies? So the Southern border is a mess. The single best move would be for the Egyptian El-Sisi government to say, We will take in Palestinians. We will create refugee areas. We will create tent cities. It's worked in other parts of the world. He says it's very costly, it's very expensive, but as we've seen from Ukraine to the war in Syria, international communities spent enormous amounts of money absorbing these people.",
