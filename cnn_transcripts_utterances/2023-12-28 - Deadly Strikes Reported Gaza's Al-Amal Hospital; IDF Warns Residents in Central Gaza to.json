I am Becky Anderson, it is 7 pm here in Abu Dhabi. Even as the U.S. calls on Israel to move to the next phase of its war on Hamas, the reality on the ground inside Gaza is as brutal as ever. Dozens are dead in the latest strikes. Lebanon-Israel border also heating up as the U.S. becomes increasingly involved in the region. How far will the Biden administration go to prevent a spillover? The U.S. has announced its latest and for now last package for Ukraine as Congress struggles to agree on the future of aid in the fight against Russia. And a bumpy landing in high winds. The storm system hitting the United Kingdom is the latest in a string of extreme weather events. We will look back on the key climate moments of 2023. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

Right now,just days before the end of the year, Israel suggests that there is no end in sight for this war. In the meantime, most international voices are calling for a cease-fire and continue to do so. The U.S. is encouraging Israel to shift to a new less intense phase. But the reality on the ground in Gaza is a rising death toll and more carnage. CNN's Nada Bashir is across all of this for us tonight. You're live out of London. You spent much of the last three months in Israel on the West Bank and in various other areas around this region. Even as much of the United States calls for Israel to enter the next less intense phase of this war, what we are seeing is the latest deadly round of strikes that at least seemed to show that things are as intense as ever, both from the air and on the ground in Gaza.",

As you mentioned, Becky, it appears to show dozens of men, teenagers and two children. They have been stripped to their underwear, hands above their head. Many of them blindfolded, others with their hands tied behind their backs. In part of the video you also see women who are clothed but blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs, sat beneath a football goalpost. The Israeli flag hanging above them as military vehicles roam the stadium behind. Now of course, we have heard those reports of mass detentions in this area. The U.N. Mediterranean human rights monitoring organization says this is a region that has been looking into as regard to reports of the detention of children as young as 12, the elderly and women who have reported abuse and harassment. This has raised concerns. The Israeli military says it strips detainees in order to ensure that they are not carrying explosives. Of, course seeing that these individuals have been stripped for prolonged periods of time, as it appears to show in the video and placed in stress positions according to human rights groups, humiliating and dehumanizing positions, this has raised alarm bells. But the issue of detention has been going on for some time now. Earlier this month we had a warning with regard to this issue from the U.N.'s own human rights office. Take a listen to the statement issued earlier this month from the U.N. human rights office, saying they had received numerous disturbing reports from the north of Gaza. Mass detentions, ill treatment and enforced disappearance of possibly thousands of Palestinian men and boys and a number of women and girls at the hands of the Israeli Defense Forces, most who were rounded up as they were attempting to move south. Again, where the Israeli military has told civilians to take shelter, or were taken during operations conducted on their homes, hospitals and schools and other places of refuge. The statement goes on to say that they've received numerous reports of the ill treatment of civilians, some of which they say, the human rights office of the United Nations, could amount to torture if confirmed. This video has certainly raised serious concern around the issue of detention, particularly the detention of children, who have already experienced so much trauma throughout this war.",

This is multi-pronged as far as the defense minister is concerned. One of the fronts is the border with Lebanon. Let's get the reaction to this from Washington. Let's discuss what it means in terms of the potentially widening conflict. CNN's national security reporter, Natasha Bertrand, and CNN Politics senior reporter, Stephen Collinson, joining us now. Natasha, let's start with you. We often say the U.S. is the only voice that can influence Benjamin Netanyahu; very specifically, the prime minister of Israel. What, if any influence, is Washington exerting when it comes, for example, to the situation on the border with Lebanon?",

This is something that the U.S., the White House, they have been sending emissaries back and forth to Lebanon, to Israel, to try to find a solution, a diplomatic solution to the fighting. But both sides of this conflict have not been helping matters. We see that Hezbollah continues to fire into Israeli territory, forcing the displacement of tens of thousands of Israelis who live there along the border. And we see the Israelis have been firing back, of course, hitting Hezbollah; in many instances actually hitting the Lebanese armed forces. That is a real concern for the Biden administration because U.S. officials believe that any diplomatic solution is going to need the buy-in and support of the Lebanese military. The fact that Israel has been striking them, we are told, on more than 30 occasions, has not been sitting well with the Biden administration. Which has warned the Israelis, look, we need things to remain quiet here. We need you to focus on the war in Gaza. You cannot manage a new front on the northern border, just given the level of intensity of the war going on in Gaza right now. So the U.S. has been telling them, do not hit the Lebanese armed forces. Sure, some strikes may be accidental. But don't make this any worse than it needs to be. Clearly the Israelis, they are getting extremely frustrated because there is not a diplomatic solution that has come to the forefront just yet. But the U.S. really making an effort here to try to prevent this from opening on multiple fronts because, as we have seen, regional intentions are extremely high right now. There are a number of U.S. coalition troops and forces throughout the Middle East being attacked. The Red Sea, of course, is on fire. And so the U.S. really trying to keep things contained in Gaza at this point.",

That have food, water and any items and medicines and medical supplies. But this is still not enough. It does not even scratch the surface. And it does not meet 10 percent of the needs. That is why we hope the U.N. resolution will allow for more aid to get in, more aid to get in safely and efficiently, as well as to have humanitarian aid access. Because basically the humanitarian suffering in Gaza is just unprecedented. The entire population is now lacking food, water, shelter and have no safe place to go to.
