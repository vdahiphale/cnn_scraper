That announcement came during Putin's speech in Moscow, though hours later, Russia's foreign ministry said that decision is reversible. Meanwhile, two U.S. officials told CNN that Russia carried out a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears to have failed around the time that Mr. Biden was in Ukraine on Monday.

And we received a photograph earlier, was shared by the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, who posted it on telegram showing the two leaders smiling and shaking hands.We were monitoring in the last hour opening remarks, and there was a bit of a repeat of previous talking points from China with Wang Yi sitting across from Lavrov, saying that he expressed his opposition to the Cold War mentality. Now, the Kremlin has said it does not rule out the possibility of Wang Yi meeting with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. We also heard from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier saying that this visit and this meeting is an opportunity for both sides to exchange views about the relationship and also about international hotspot issues, which would, of course, include the war in Ukraine. Now, earlier on Tuesday, Wang Yi met with the head of Russia's Security Council. There he expressed opposition to the Cold War mentality. A desire to strengthen cooperation between China and Russia. Ukraine was also discussed, but details were not revealed. And this meeting is being watched and monitored very closely by Western nations, in particular the United States. Just a few days ago, the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned Wang Yi of consequences if China proceeds giving material support to Russia, its ongoing war in Ukraine. China has fired back repeatedly and is now accusing the U.S. of sabotage. We have these comments from the Global Times, a state-run tabloid in which he said this, quote, \"The U.S. has been wearing thick tinted glasses to view China-Russia friendly ties from the very beginning. \"The suspicions, provocation and sabotage in Washington for China-Russia ties have never stopped, and now they have reached a peak because of the conflict,\" unquote. Now, Max, underscoring this no limits partnership is that meeting that you just mentioned.

From coast to coast, 65 million Americans are under winter weather alerts. A powerful winter storm is threatening to bring blizzard like conditions to parts of the upper Midwest and the High Plains.

If you're not under the blizzard warning, white out conditions are still very much possible. Snowfall from California all the way up into the Great Lakes in the Ohio Valley as of this morning. This is round two, round three expected later this evening. So a few more inches this morning and then we can expect additional heavier snowfall from Minneapolis later tonight. You'll see that heavy snow rolling in around 8:00, 9:00. And then you notice the pink, ice storm warnings are in effect. Nearly an inch of ice in some of these locations can cripple the city just north of Chicago. Detroit can be one of these locations where we have roughly about a half an inch of ice, if not a quarter of an inch of ice. Regardless, widespread power outages and tree limbs will likely come down with this. The whole area of low pressure then travels further east across the Great Lakes and into New England here in the next two days. Snowfall totals, this is on top of what we've already picked up. Purple showing you the 8 inches plus expected through Friday, and then again the pinks showing you 12 inches to 18 inches more expected again through the rest of this week. On top of the heavy snowfall, then we're talking about flooding through the Ohio Valley back into parts of the Southern Plains. Areas highlighted in orange, that's 4 inches plus of rain over the next few days. And also, the threat for severe weather, we're rarely warm, humid, plus we have the lift from the cold front, all the right conditions to bring in damaging winds. That's our biggest concern. Then, of course, large hail is also a possibility. That's more isolated and a brief tornado can't be ruled out, especially for areas highlighted in yellow from St. Louis back into eastern Oklahoma. It's hot. We mentioned the temperatures being contributing to the severe weather threat. 135 plus, record highs are possible through Friday for areas highlighted in yellow and orange. That includes the Carolinas back through Florida and Texas, where temperatures are expected to be pushing close to 90 degrees in places like Orlando. Max?",
