I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, along with CNN's Sara Sidner in Tel Aviv.After days of building up troops along the border with Gaza, the Israel military now says its forces are increasing their operational readiness for the next stage of the war. The region bracing for a possible large-scale ground invasion of Gaza by the Israeli military. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rallying his front line troops today and pronouncing them ready for what's next. A short while ago I asked a key Israeli opposition leader about the battle ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I was there covering a war a few years ago not in Tel Aviv, but along the border with Gaza in Ashdod in Ashkelon, and even when these rockets are coming in from Hamas towards Tel Aviv right now, as you correctly pointed out, and the Israeli Iron Dome anti-missile system goes up there, the interceptors go in, and they take out these rockets and these missiles, the debris that begins to fall down from these rockets, that could be very deadly as well.And that's why everyone, as soon as those sirens going off, they have to go into shelter, a bomb shelter, get into an area, a stairwell, anywhere where they can be away from the outside, because all that debris coming down from the intercepted rockets could potentially be very deadly. So I'm glad you've got that helmet on at a minimum, and watch what's going on very closely. It's a very, very, very dangerous situation that's unfolding.

The IDF in a statement today, as well as a briefing from its chief spokesman, making clear there will be a coordinated strikes from air, sea, and land in this next phase of this war. They say that they are increasingly getting ready for that next phase, that reservists have been positioning themselves in key locations around the Gaza Strip, and also saying this next phase of the war will, quote, have an emphasis on significant ground operations.And that is perhaps the most direct reference we have heard yet from the IDF about what everybody here expects, which is that there will be some kind of ground invasion of Gaza. We have been watching all of these pieces coming into place for that ground offensive to begin taking place, whether it is the IDF ordering Gazan civilians to evacuate southward, whether it is the armored personnel carriers, tanks, positioning of those hundreds of thousands of reservists in key locations around the Gaza Strip. Everything seems to be building up towards a likely ground invasion. What Israeli officials are still not saying, though, Wolf, is when exactly that will happen. They are making clear, though, that they are being very deliberate about these preparations, trying to be very strategic about exactly when they move forward with this next phase of the campaign, to make sure that those reservists, that the military is properly trained and prepared. And the national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, also talked about the objectives today of this next phase of the military response, and he said Hamas will not be the ruler, will not be the sovereign in Gaza after combat.

And certainly, this afternoon we heard a prolonged -- there was a prolonged period of thuds and whatnot coming from the direction of the Sheeba Farms which is a disputed area between Lebanon and Israel. In fact, we also heard volleys of rockets going out of Lebanon into Israel.Now, according to the Israeli military, 30 mortar rounds were fired into Israel. Hezbollah has said that it hit five positions in the Sheeba Farms area. The Israelis said that during this exchange of fire, they detected a team on the Lebanese side that seemed to be prepared to fire an anti-tank missile into Israel, and that team was hit in an air strike. Now, the Lebanese authorities are reporting that two Lebanese citizens, an elderly couple, were killed when their house in the town of Sheeba was hit, and Hezbollah is acknowledging that one of its fighters was killed in what they called the confrontations on the border as well. So the situation is tense, but until now it doesn't seem that either side is eager for another front to be opened up. I think Hamas -- Hezbollah is doing just enough to show a certain level of participation in this war, but avoiding going so far as to precipitate a massive Israeli response, and basically begin a repeat of what we saw in 2006 when, for 33 days, Hezbollah and Israel fought it out in southern Lebanon, causing massive destruction in this area and massive loss of life.

He served as deputy assistant secretary of state under President Obama. Joel, thanks very much for joining us. There are local media reports right now, as you know, that Egyptian officials are actually refusing to allow U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals to enter Egypt, the Sinai, from Gaza at the Rafah border crossing in the southern part of Gaza. Instead, they're insisting that the crossing must facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza instead of letting Americans cross the other way into Egypt. The State Department says there may be very little warning if the crossing were to open up by the Egyptians. Is there anything more the U.S. can do right now to ensure that that border opens and that U.S. citizens, many of them Palestinian, dual citizens, could get out of Gaza and potentially save their lives?",

And regarding Egypt, this discussion now and the humanitarian corridor, the proposal of one, this is really getting into a dicey situation for the actual American citizens who need to get out. The war is imminent. Certainly, Secretary Blinken and his engagements in the region is pressing for this. There's a lot of pressure now coming from Congress as well on a humanitarian corridor.And Egypt has been reticent to open up the gates, as I'm sure you're aware. They have their own internal reasons for why they don't want Palestinians to flood, potentially, into Egypt. But there is a way. They do have border crossings, and they just have to show the political will to actually allow the individuals who have the documentation to come through.

They know the military wing. They have pressured Hamas over the years in different manners, and they have to get the word out to Hamas that this is essential. This is not just Americans or Israelis, too. There are other countries that are affected by this. And our allies, we're looking at them right now. And they've been arguing for years that they have access to and influence over Hamas. Now it's time to show it. And if they can, that will be a significant win for everybody concerned.

The secretary, the president doing that in Ukraine and building an international set of allies. In this case, it's essential. We can't allow this war to expand beyond the theatre that we're currently talking about. It cannot include Lebanon. It cannot metastasize and potentially have Iran engage as well. It cannot destabilize countries in the region.So it's essential that this reassurance, not just be military reassurance as we're seeing in the eastern Med, looking at Hezbollah, quite frankly, and saying do not use your missiles, but also reassurance to our allies that there is an American program in place, and that as secretaries do by going to these capitals, saying that the United States hears you and is going to work with you collaboratively. That the kind of leadership, that's the kind of leadership that, absent that, things fall apart very quickly. So I applaud the secretary, I applaud the administration for leaning in right now ahead of time so that all of the pieces can potentially be put together, because this could flare into a regional conflict if it's not taken care of. And so that's why we see so much activity right now. BLITZER:  Yes, not only worried about Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, what they potentially could do, and obviously what's going on in Gaza. I'm worried about Syria and Iran potentially getting involved as well. it's a real concern that I have. Joel Rubin, thank you very, very much.

We're monitoring what's happening, obviously, but looking at the news that CNN is broadcasting, we had just over the past week, after Hamas slaughtered 1,300, took over 150 hostage, killed dozens of Americans, injured over 3,000, Israel has a right to defend itself. The president has been clear about that.What has the response been in certain places, Wolf? On some college campuses, we saw protesters standing on the side of Hamas terrorists. That, of course, puts the Jewish community on edge, Jewish students who are sitting in class next to their classmates who may be out marching in support of the Hamas terrorists who want to kill them. Around the world we've seen the same thing. We saw the protests around the world featuring hundreds, in some cases thousands of people, again, standing on the side of Hamas terrorists who want to kill Jews. That's why Hamas exists. And if you look at Germany, this is perhaps the most poignant of all, Wolf. In Germany there are those who have responded to these attacks on Jews by going to Jewish homes and putting Jewish stars on their doors. And when the authorities are sought out, their response is that they're too busy. And if you can just try to wipe those off with soap and water, that might be your best bet to stay safe. Of course, we're worried about rising antisemitism. It all started as a result of this brutal attack by a terror group bent on the destruction of Israel and the massacre of Jews.

You're looking at the carnage and chaos on Saladin (ph) Street, one of the designated evacuation routes. In the aftermath of explosions, families killed amid their belongings.

CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The victims are flooding into Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals, and, again, it's the youngest caught in the crossfire. Nearly half of Gaza's population is children. \"What did the children do to deserve this,\" this woman says. \"Did they fight you? Did they fire rockets? My niece and her whole family are dead.
