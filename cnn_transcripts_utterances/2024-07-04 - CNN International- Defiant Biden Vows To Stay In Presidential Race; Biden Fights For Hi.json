Plus, it is Election Day in the UK. We're going to take you to London where voters are casting ballots to choose their new leadership. And Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu will speak with President Biden later today. This as Israel and Hamas appear to be on the brink of a framework ceasefire and hostage release deal, though we have seen disappointment before. We are live in Tel Aviv and the White House with the latest. On America's Independence Day, it is Commander-in-Chief fighting for his political life, and time does not appear to be on his side. The White House tells CNN President Joe Biden was examined by his physician at some point after last week's debate. That, in contrast, contradiction, in fact, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre telling reporters Wednesday that Biden had not seen a doctor since his physical back in February. A group of Democratic governors emerged from a critical White House meeting Wednesday with the President saying resolutely they still have Biden's back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): President Joe Biden is in it to win it. And all of us said we pledged our support to him because the stakes could not be higher. GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): What we saw in there today was a guy who was the guy that all of us believed in the first time who could beat Donald Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Bush, also Senator McConnell. Good to have you both here on this Fourth. Let me begin by saying Happy Fourth of July to you, and I appreciate you squeezing some time out of the holiday to talk to me. Meghan, I'd like to begin with you, given your long work with President Biden himself, and a very basic question. Is it actually an open question that the President might step out of the race, or is this cable news talk? Right? I mean, is there an actual discussion? I mean, we're certainly hearing lawmakers on the Hill openly discussing it, but is the President, is the President's team openly discussing that? MEGHAN HAYS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC NATL. CMTE. CONVENTION CONSULTANT, &amp; FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: No. I don't think so. I think that the President has made his feelings known. He said yesterday he is in. He is not going anywhere. He made that very clear to the staff when he talked to the campaign and the convention and the DNC staff yesterday on a call with the Vice President. And I just -- I don't think he is going anywhere. Do I think that they probably discussed it? Do I think that they're looking at the polling? Do I think that they're having realistic conversations? Absolutely. But, the President is dug in. And I think the President is very smart. He understands that he made -- like, he did not do well, last Thursday. He did not reassure the voters that he can do the job, and he would have been spending that time since then reassuring voters. So, I do think he is trying to do and reassure voters that he is in it.

We're not focusing on what the realities of another Donald Trump presidency.

And more people said, Joe Biden's mental acuity concern them than the criminal issues going on with Donald Trump. In The New York Times story two nights ago, Jim, there were two diplomatic officials in the article, one American, one European saying they weren't sure whether you could put Joe Biden in the room with Vladimir Putin or another world leader right now. That is alarming.And so, I think when Americans are judging this, they're looking at a guy that they already thought wasn't doing a very good job, 38 percent approval rating. And now, on top of that, saying, oh, my gosh, and he is pretty compromised right now. It's pretty bad, and that's why the polling, by the way, is the way it is.",

We should note, we've seen hopeful signs like this before only to be dashed. However, an Israeli source says that Israel and Hamas do appear to be on the brink of a framework ceasefire and hostage release deal. We've just learned from an Israeli official that Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized a negotiating team to return to indirect talks with Hamas. That's a step. The Prime Minister is set to convene his cabinet tonight.Israel also focusing on the threat, though, now from the north from, Lebanon. Hezbollah, which occupies the southern part of that country, says it fired more than 200 missiles and explosive drones at Israeli military sites. This they say in retaliation for an Israeli strike that killed a senior Hezbollah commander. Israel responded to Hezbollah's barrage with new attacks of its own. That's how it tends to go with these things. The violence fueling concerns about a possible all-out war. Let's go live now to Washington and CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz. [11:20:00] Arlette, as I approach this, because you and I have been covering these negotiations for so long, we've seen signs of hope, and then the sides went their separate ways. This one does seem different right now. And I wonder what the White House view is of the situation now. Do they feel that they're on the brink of something?",

But, one U.S. official, I touched base with this morning, said that they viewed Hamas' response that was relayed to the Qatari and Egyptian mediators, they viewed that response as being constructive while also noting that there is still more work to be done.Now, President Biden is expected to jump on the phone at some point this morning, possibly soon, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to talk about these latest developments relating to a possible hostage and ceasefire deal. I'm also told by a White House official that Vice President Kamala Harris will also be joining the call. Another source noted that she has joined many of these calls between Biden and Netanyahu. But, of course, it's all coming at an interesting time, as you think about the political dynamics playing out back at home, especially when it relates to the 2024 election. Now, the U.S. recently had presented some language that they would had hoped would bridge the gap between the Israelis and Hamas. Last weekend, I had been told that that language specifically focused on trying to bridge the gap between phase one and phase two. So, phase one is when there would be a temporary pause. There would be with the release of some hostages. But, that would also set a time for negotiations to begin to try to get to phase two of the deal. That is the language that the U.S. had proposed in recent conversations. And so, we will see what exactly the Hamas response entailed, what the Israelis' response will entail going forward. But, President Biden, of course, for some time has been hoping that they would be able to work towards this deal to secure the release of hostages, including the Americans who remain in Gaza, as well as eventually a permanent end to the war. I will note that Vice President Harris and her team have been especially focused on what happens in the days after this war. So, that might be something she is bringing to the conversation today. But, it's all also coming at an interesting time as President Biden is fighting for his own political survival back at home, of course, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and his handling of it, is something that does not sit well with some Democratic voters, especially younger voters, voters and Arab American and Muslim American voters. And so, this is an area that the President has hoped to make some traction on. The White House always says it's not because of political matters. But, he does hope that this is something that they can work towards in the coming months, as he has been seeking it into this war. SCIUTTO: Yeah. And you might imagine, the President seeing a deal with U.S. involvement as a sign that he can still do the job, right, in the midst of all these questions. Arlette Saenz from the White House, thanks so much. I do want to go now to Tel Aviv where our Jeremy Diamond is standing by. So, Jeremy, I'm asking the same question of you that I asked of Arlette, because you and I have talked about other hopeful moments when a deal appeared close, this one does appear closer, I mean, even just to resume indirect talks between Israel and Hamas here. What is your best sense of how close the two sides are at this time?",

I'm Jim Sciutto in New York.The next few days maybe the most critical of the 2024 presidential election for Joe Biden, as the President decides whether to stay in the race. In a new interview, the President told a Wisconsin radio host that he, quote, \"screwed up in last week's CNN debate\" but says he will be the one to take on former President Donald Trump in November. The President will spend part of the July 4th holiday huddling with family members about his political future. His poor debate performance may already be having an impact on voters. Donald Trump widened his lead among likely voters to six percentage points in a new poll from the New York Times and Siena College. The Trump campaign responding to the debate over the President's future. Trump's senior advisors issued a statement saying, quote, \"Democrats, the mainstream media, and the swamp colluded to hide the truth from the American public - Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest, and not fit for the White House\" end quote. The statement comes after a secretly recorded video showed Trump trash-talking Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on a golf course, using some offensive language. It was shot after the CNN debate, obtained by The Daily Beast. In the video, Trump suggests President Biden will quit the race, not clear how he knows that, and that Harris will be the nominee. For reaction to that, we're joined by CNN's Steve Contorno from St. Petersburg, Florida. Steve. I mean, we've seen quite publicly the Trump team doing a victory lap here, enjoying the debate within the Democratic Party over steps forward.

They frequently occur when he is in larger groups. They're less likely to be noticeable when he is one on one, and that they were more frequent, and thus, more worrisome.And what they were seeing was wandering off the point of the conversation, or appearing to freeze up for a bit. And the question was, was this just the result of slowly advancing age, hits all of us, or was there something else going on? And on that, they were not at all certain.",

That's a different thing from saying that he is planning to. All of our reporting suggests that his family is urging him to stay the course, everything we know about Joe Biden's self-image as somebody who gets up, as he says, when he is knocked down, and move forward, would suggest that he would stick with it.I think in the nervousness you're hearing from the party, it comes from the uncertainty of whether they are better to stick with him and count on his ability to come back from this or change courses at the very last moment. I mean, we're only four months out from the election, and that's a really difficult time to run somebody who has never before run for President and see how they do.

Holness told CNN, storm surges have damaged coastal infrastructure in some areas. The Prime Minister also said that some 500 people have been displaced and are now staying in shelters. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center, the eyewall of Hurricane Beryl brushed the southern coast of Jamaica last night with hurricane conditions occurring throughout much of the island. It continued raining on and off overnight. We have seen downed power lines, boats that were not properly secured and were sunk, like the one right behind me, and debris all over the island.
