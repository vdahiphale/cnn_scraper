The chaos in Congress costing more uncertainty of aid to Ukraine with funds running low and the U.S. House now power lies without a speaker.Plus, Hollywood studios and actors head back to the bargaining table just as a major pain point in negotiations becomes personal for some of Hollywood's biggest stars.",

Well, we begin in Washington where the gears of government have essentially ground to a halt after the unprecedented ousting of U.S. Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Tuesday's extraordinary vote pushed by hardline conservatives makes McCarthy the first house speaker voted out of the job in U.S. history. His 269 days speakership is now the shortest in more than 140 years.And the Republican Party has now plunged deeper into chaos. Lawmakers will now need to elect a new speaker but there's no clear alternative who would have the support needed to win the gavel. And McCarthy says he will not try for the speakership again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I don't regret standing up for choosing governance over grievance. It is my responsibility. It is my job. I do not regret negotiating, or government is designed to find compromise. I don't regret my efforts to build coalitions and find solutions. I was raised to solve problems, not create them. So, I may have lost the vote today. But as I walk out of this chamber, I feel fortunate to observe the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: McCarthy was removed from the nation's number three job amid growing infighting in the Republican Party. And just days after McCarthy engineered a last-minute bipartisan effort to avert a government shutdown. Right-wing Congressman Matt Gaetz led the revolt against McCarthy and in explaining his rationale. Gaetz took a phrase right out of Donald Trump's playbook. (END VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Kevin McCarthy is a feature of the swamp. He has risen to power by collecting special interest money and redistributing that money in exchange for favors. We are breaking the fever now and we should elect the speaker who's better. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The House Majority Leader whether he decides to run for speaker. So a lot of questions in this tumultuous moment for the GOP. Can they pick up the pieces? Can they get their agenda going?

But that people like Matt Gaetz, you know, what's clear is that all he's interested in is getting more social media likes, raising money for his -- whatever it is he's doing.

He is going to be a leading candidate if he chooses to run.He is not committed to run yet, but he's an interesting candidate. It'll also be fascinating to see if a more moderate republican ends up getting into the race. Someone like for example, Don Bacon, the congressman from Nebraska. Again, not very well known, but he's known as somebody who works across the aisle. Part of the so-called problem solvers caucus in the U.S. Congress. Moderates working together to find solutions on issues like infrastructure. So, this could go in one of any number of different ways.

Particularly the EU which has some of the most advanced rights of privacy and personality usage in the world, are absolutely looking at how these things will go.But I think that groups like the Screen Actors' Guild and the Writers' Guild have a really important role to play, to shape the conversation as it emerges in these early stages and to really set a tone for what people find ethical, what concerns there are, and what potential, more equitable outcomes could be. But again I think that anybody who does any kind of work that is mediated through computers should be concerned, right? It's not just going to be writers and actors and other creatives, it's potentially anyone who communicates online will have to face some sort of or come to some sort of reckoning with these tools. Whether it is outright replacement or whether it's an augmentation of someone's work. And we need to make sure that the outcomes, again, that they're equitable for all parties.",

They took all sorts of copyrighted materials for use in their training sets and they didn't ask permission, they didn't get authorization.  And now we have to sort of try and clean up their messes.And I think that's what we should look at going forward, and thinking about how technology and technology companies are regulated, is to recognize that the way things have gone in the past has been, you know, has not thought about long term consequences. Has not thought about repercussions beyond the tech sector. And that has to be a bigger part of the conversation when we talk about digital innovation. CHURCH: Yeah absolutely, Gavin Mueller.
