Tom Carper of Delaware who reintroduced a bill recently that would grant Washington, D.C.'s statehood. Good morning, Senator, and thank you for being here. Do you agree with the president on this? SEN. TOM CARPER (D-DE):  Yes. The -- what needs to happen here is the Washington, D.C. Council and the mayor need to work together. Their criminal code hasn't been updated for something like 100 years. They didn't get it entirely right when they made some -- went through their exercises over the last year or so. They need to fix it, including the carjacking that's been mentioned in the -- in the course of this. They can do that. And once they do that we'll get -- the new criminal code will be in place. It needs to be put in place. The provisions in it that are 100 years old need to be updated.

EPA -- I will say this. EPA doesn't always get good credit for it but literally within hours they had a response team on the site -- on the site at the crash site.

That number fell to 190,000 last week, about 2,000 fewer than the week before. It means the labor market is still pushing along strong. It makes seven weeks straight of jobless claims under 200,000.

They never have, they never will. People keep saying oh, they're all going to come back. They're not. So when you're out there hiring now part of the negotiation is where they're going to work.

Some of them just got out of college and started working out of their homes. They've never worked in an office. Basically, what it changes is it's project management. You say to somebody look, you've got to get this done by next Friday at noon. You don't really care when they do it -- and they're not working nine to five -- as long as it gets done. So it changes the way you manage these companies. You're now project management on everything. It's not nine to five. However, there's probably less private time on weekends. I call my employees 24/7. That's the deal. If you don't work in the office I can call you at 2:00 in the morning if we've got a crisis, and they're going to answer. That's the way they're used to it now. And we have people working for us in India, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, in France, Switzerland, everywhere that have different skill sets. And here's the one thing that nobody saw coming -- and this is the competition of states. I don't put companies here in New York anymore, or in Massachusetts, or in New Jersey, or in California. Those states are uninvestable. The policy here is insane, the taxes are too high. We put them in Fargo, North Dakota because 40 percent of the people work elsewhere, including Boston. So I was in a bit of a debate with Elizabeth Warren about this but I say look, Senator, we've got to move the companies out of your state because you're not investible anymore. You're punishing people if they're successful. You overtax them. You hit them with a supertax. New Jersey -- what a mess. New York, uninvestable. And California --",

And California, out of business -- out of business -- el morte -- no business there. You can't do business there. I don't know what that place is going to turn into. Maybe a tourist zone, but no business. Imagine San Francisco -- you can't even walk at night out on the street -- sorry. O'LEARY:  So talk about what's happening though in other areas, not just on the coast. Because I'm from Alabama and hiring workers -- we were talking about a moment ago -- is a real issue. I have a feeling that we're -- they moved to paper checks that they distribute on Fridays because they were having difficulty getting people to actually come to work even five days a week. It's a real thing. But when we talk about layoffs in the tech sector, which we talk about a bunch here -- but that's not reflected in the economy as a whole. That seems specific to them.

And so you ask why do we still have inflation on core items like food and energy because there's a lot of money sloshing around the system. It's a remarkable time. Full employment. Rates going up at the fastest they've ever done since the '60s. And still, people are pointing to a lot of success in small business. Most of our companies are having very good quarters right now.
