In just a few hours, Donald Trump will hold a rally in one of the most heavily Democratic counties in the country. He's going to be in the Bronx. That of course, is in New York. He hopes to persuade undecided voters that Bidenomics isn't working, and that he would be better to lead the country. CNN's Kristen Holmes is traveling with the former president and joins us live from the Bronx. So Kristen, how much of this is he kind of expected to be in court today, and they wanted to squeeze in a rally? And how much of this is him actually thinking and his campaign thinking that this is an area where he can turn it red?",

Now for it to be an official address, it needs sign off from the other side of the Capitol.

Others who caucus with Democrats go further.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): You have a Prime Minister who has created the worst humanitarian disaster in modern history. Israel, of course had the right to defend itself against the Hamas terrorist attack. But what Netanyahu has done is gone to war against all at war against the entire Palestinian people, women and children. Why you wouldn't invite somebody who has done such horrific things to the Palestinian people is something that I think is a very bad idea. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He would not say that they were having discussions about it, although he has later privately indicated to Speaker Johnson that he would sign on to this as what Johnson himself said. Dana, but we have not seen this invite go out yet. This Schumer, of course, is the highest ranking Jewish Democrat, the first Jewish Senate majority leader, someone who has been in Israel hawk and defender for most of his career, but as you noted, at the top has gone been crosswise with Netanyahu putting them in a difficult spot here with his party at this critical moment for the -- in this war.

Then Donald Trump won in 2016 by eight points, the biggest winning margin in three decades. He did it again in 2020. President Biden now is unlikely to campaign in the Buckeye State at all.But Republicans in the state might not even let him on the ballot. That is because of an Ohio law that requires nominees to be set 90 days before the election. That day is October, excuse me, August 7th. Biden won't become official until the Democratic Convention and that is August 19th. Jeff Zeleny is back with me. What are you hearing? Are they going to fix this?",

Several other states have this as well, Alabama being among them. But they basically said both sides came together and agreed that, you know, the nominees of the parties should be on the ballot. So they just kind of let it go through. It did not in Ohio. It was caught up in other issues. So Republicans adjourned, they control the legislature.And Governor Mike DeWine was in favor of some type of a solution, if you will, a bipartisan solution, but it wasn't up to him. So now the Biden campaign has a couple choices. One they could sue. That is a risky gambit, because it could take a long time, or they could change the nominating calendar and formally nominate Joe Biden some other time or perhaps there's some other way it could work out. But the reason it matters is Sherrod Brown, of course, is running for Senate. You and I remember many Ohio races. Twenty years ago, when George Bush and John Kerry are running, it came down to Ohio. Things change. The population shifts in the country. That's why every presidential campaign every four years tells us something about the changing fabric of the country here. But Sherrod Brown, of course on the ballot in Ohio, desperately trying to hang on kind of running against Biden or away from Biden to touch.",
