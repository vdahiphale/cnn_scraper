It's incredible.I was watching the live feed from SpaceX just a moment ago. They have now started to initiate some of the propellant into the rockets. So they are really in that final stages here before that 5:23 launch. But the weather has to be picture perfect in order for that to happen. And the good news is, it has cleared up considerably since the 3:23 original launch window that we had just a couple of hours ago. This is really interesting as well. Some of our research finding these perfect weather launch criteria that they have to fit within. Of course, can have strong winds and we can have thick clouds overhead, but we certainly cannot have lightning in the vicinity. If they were to fly through what's known as a cumulonimbus cloud. They can create what is known as triggered lightning or artificially induced lightning as a space shuttle launches into the atmosphere, can react with cloud droplets and actually create its own lightning, causing some electrical failures on the ship itself. So, learning from past mistakes, we don't want that to happen. So this is the deal with the radar the lightning and thunderstorms are well off the East Coast, well away from Cape Canaveral. Earlier this morning, there were a few showers that popped up across the region. That's what prompted them to have another delay through this morning to about 5:23. We believe that conditions look favorable for this launch here within the next ten minutes as the rain moves and stays way from Cape Canaveral this morning. Of course, it's not just about what's going to happen now with the launch, it's about what's going to happen within five days because they have to have optimal landing conditions, splashdown conditions on the ocean, and in the skies above. And it looks like it could be a bit of wet weather on the return home to earth here, Kasie, so we'll keep an eye on that, too.",

And so she spent years training astronaut crews, NASA astronauts, private astronauts, but she's never had this experience herself. Same with Anna Menon, one of the other SpaceX engineers on board.

That's a really please significant milestone in terms of safety. It's a moment where things could go wrong.So far, it looks like everything went well there. But to answer your question, the other big thing that they're doing on this mission is they're flying this spacecraft into what's known as the radiation belt. It's a part of space where various particles from the sun congregate. And so it's a dangerous place to travel through. But in order to do it to get to Mars and the moon, you've got to travel through it. And so no humans have done that since the end of the Apollo program, back in the 1970s. And so not only are they testing their bodies being guinea pigs essentially to see how this radiation impacts their bodies. But they're also testing the Dragon spacecraft itself. And to make sure that the spacecraft and the avionics were going to survive this intense radiation, they strap the avionics -- SpaceX engineers strap the avionics to a gurney in an oncology lab, right?
