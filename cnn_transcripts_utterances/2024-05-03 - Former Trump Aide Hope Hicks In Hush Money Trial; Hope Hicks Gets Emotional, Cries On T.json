Welcome to our continuing special coverage of the Trump New York hush money trial. I was privileged to watch some of day 11 inside the courtroom today. It was both - it was fascinating to see up close. Hope Hicks, once a top advisor of former president testifying for the prosecution, recounting first the Access Hollywood tape coming out, then the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal revelations, finishing her direct testimony with a potentially damaging account of what the former president said in retrospect when the Daniels story finally broke in 2018. Then moments later, Hope Hicks started crying. Hicks in that final answer saying, \"It was Mr. Trump's opinion that it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\" Which could bolster the prosecution case that the former president was motivated by campaign and not necessarily family concerns and suppressing both that and the Karen McDougal stories before the 2016 election. Under cross examination, though, she did paint her old boss as a family man who was concerned about the impact on his wife. Her testimony and Michael Cohen also provided fodder for both sides, frankly, painting him as someone who would sometimes, in her words, go rogue, but also casting doubt on the defense theory that Cohen paid off Stormy Daniels on his own initiative. In general, the picture she painted was a hands on Donald Trump, deeply involved in the details of his business and his campaign, motivated largely by political considerations and that he was fully aware of what the payment to Stormy Daniels had bought him in 2016. We've just gotten the full trial transcript from today, including the context of Hope Hicks' final answer to the prosecution question about what then-President Trump said in 2018 when news of the Daniels payout finally broke. And I'm quoting now from that transcript: \"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story - a different kind of story before the election had Mr. Cohen not made that payment.\" Joining us once again tonight, New York defense attorney Arthur Aidala, CNN's Laura Coates, who was also in the court for - today particularly for that moment, CNN's Abby Phillip and Kaitlan Collins, also former Trump White House communications director, Alyssa Farah Griffin, and CNN's Kara Scannell, who was also in court throughout today. Kara, let's start with you. I mean, it is fascinating - this is my first time and you've been in there every day and in the overflow room as well. To see it all up close, what was your sense on how things went with Hope Hicks today?",

But I thought it was very interesting that her testimony is as she's recounting this, she is taking jurors inside the campaign and into some memorable moments, walking into the glass conference room where she's discussing the Access Hollywood tape with Donald Trump right when she found out that it happened. Also take them onto a plane when Trump was speaking at a campaign rally and she was contacted by the Wall Street Journal. They were going to go public with their story just four days before the election, saying that AMI had paid off Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels.So she's giving the jury memorable moments that usually underscore some credibility there because the person is remembering a moment in time where they were. And what she was also saying about Michael Cohen, that she didn't think that he would behave the way that Donald Trump was telling her, that he did this essentially out of the kindness of his heart.

It wasn't immediately clear the weight of that particular statement because she'd given other statements before to articulate that he was a family man. He was concerned about his wife. There was at least one point where she described that she - he did not want his wife to have the newspapers delivered to their residents in light of the bad coverage, which of course makes you think so the lion gets up in the morning and she's reading the newspaper, so that's what he was concerned.And that he was concerned about that. He valued her opinion, all these different things and then this moment hit. And then there was kind of the transition between counsel when she began to be answered questions with someone else. And then her body just changed. She's already very soft spoken. I had not seen her in person, had not heard her speak. She did fidget quite a bit with her necklace, with her earrings, with almost like a nervous tic touch her hair a lot. But her body language, even at that point, exponentially got more uncomfortable. And she began to have a shaky voice. Her lip was quivering. Her chin was as well. And then she's going to turn to her face for a second and began to have her voice break. At which point Emil Bove kind of holds his hands up for a second, just over - almost like a, I - I'm not sure what's just happened in this moment and she begins to sort of cry. And then he says, do you need a minute. And she turns her whole body away. And I remember Trump's over here. The jury's over here and she's turning her body towards the jury to realize they can still see her. And she's turning even more to contort herself. At which point she says, yes, I do. And she's visibly crying now. And there's a tissue box behind her. There's a bailiff next to her. And the courtroom is kind of trying to figure out in this moment, what was the initial trigger? Now there's the two schools of thought, either some would say she must have understood the weight of her testimony. Others can say, do you know - when you're talking to the prosecution and you're at the prosecution's witness, they're friendly to you. They are - they have prepped you in some way, not to lie, but to prep you to prepare you for this moment. They've talked to you through your nerves. So they're kind of your friendly person. When the defense counsel gets up to then cross-examine you and their client is Donald Trump, a man that you've called a master communicator, somebody that you are probably well afraid of their ability to make sure that someone knows your full history. I think the weight of the combination was what may have combined to have her be overwhelmed.",

So this kind of - the stark moment was when she acknowledged that he basically said it's better that it didn't happen during the campaign. That's probably the hardest piece of evidence she gave against Donald Trump, but there was a ton in there for the defense, and I think that was by design.
