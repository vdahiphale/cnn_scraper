Who are America's new leaders? Who will they be?Nancy Pelosi announcing that she is stepping down from the House leadership, after 20 years. Some of the most familiar faces in our politics, everyone from Joe Biden, to Donald Trump, to Chuck Schumer, to Mitch McConnell, there's a theme. Are you seeing it? Well, they've been with us, for years, decades. And so, is it time for the passing of the torch? And also, what sounds like a worker rebellion tonight at Twitter. Offices closed again, badge access suspended, again, all amid an apparent mass exodus of employees saying thanks, but no thanks, Elon Musk's ultimatum to work, quote, \"Extremely hardcore,\" unquote, whatever that apparently means. More to come on that in a moment. We have a lot to talk about, tonight. Here with me, CNN Anchor and Correspondent, Audie Cornish. Also, Liam Donovan, former National Republican Senatorial Committee aide. And CNN's Senior Political Analyst, Kirsten Powers. I'm glad you're all here, today. Look, every name I just mentioned, you were going back, probably to your college and high school days, and going \"Yes, I remember when they were in office, then.\" Here we are, a different time. Speaker Pelosi's saying that she is going to pass the torch. But do we have a sense of this move to welcome a new generation of leaders? Is it reactive, do you think, Kirsten, to the loss of the House or just the season that she spoke of as time being here?",

So it's like - so that's, on the one hand, how I feel. On the other hand, Nancy Pelosi was incredible Speaker of the House. And I find her to be almost irreplaceable. I think Hakeem Jeffries is an incredibly impressive person. And we'll see how he does, if he ends up in the job. But she really is a once-in-a-generation kind of politician, right? And she will go down in history as one of the greats and if not, the greatest Speaker of the House. So, when you look at it that way, you say, \"Well, it's good that she stayed as long as she did.\" And she did mentor these people that are coming up. So, it's not like they don't know anything, and they don't know what they're doing. I mean, these are people, who have studied under her.

Everyone, out there, it's phenomenal, because you always understand \"The Assignment.\" And we'll get more clear in a second what that means.But when you we think about that she understood the assignment and the idea of cultivating new leadership. At the same token, you remember quite well, when the likes of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would come in, and others, and many thought look, like I get that we need to have institutional knowledge in Congress. That's important to know the ropes. But it also can be a hindrance and an anvil to have sort of a notion of \"Look, we know we have to be here. We know how this works, as opposed to sort of blowing up the system, from within, and saying, here's how it should work.\" What do you see as this new generation of leaders looking like? AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT, HOST, \"THE ASSIGNMENT\": I want to come at it from a slightly different angle. First of all, I think President Obama was Gen X. So, he definitely had a shot. And the reason why I'm bringing that up is because you started with him, right? And under his sort of terms, at office, there was not necessarily a new generation of politicians, who rose, in his style. And in fact, you saw, I think, upwards of a 1,000 seats being lost by Democrats in State Houses, across the country. That sounds minor, but this is about the pipeline. And then when it comes to Pelosi, she herself says power has to be taken, and it's not given to you. People have talked about Steny Hoyer being next. Steny Hoyer didn't like step aside, because she's seen like a nice girl, from Baltimore. Like, she fought her way again, and she took it. And the reason why no one has come up since is because no one else has accomplished, what she could do, with the same superpowers that she has, so to speak. And these are powers every lawmaker has, but they don't have them in equal measure. Can you fundraise? Are you a legislative wiz? Or are you a really good show-pony? And I think that Pelosi is really good at like getting in front of the cameras, taking the fight to people. We know she's a super fundraiser, and she absolutely has proven 20 years of legislative wizardry.",

For 10 years, people have been saying she's too old. And then she was one of the only people, who could handle Donald Trump, right? So, it's not that there can be no people that are older.

It doesn't mean though you necessarily produce a John Lewis or something like that, because that movement was hierarchical, right, and patriarchal, as we know. And so, I think that we're expecting the old rules to apply, to a different generation.

Musk earlier this week gave Twitter workers, the people, who are remaining, after those mass layoffs, earlier this month, he gave them a choice. Work, quote-unquote \"Hardcore,\" or leave the company, with three months of severance. It seems like a large amount of people have decided to leave the company. They don't want to work hardcore. And that's thrown the future of this platform into utter chaos. I've been talking to people, all day. One former executive, who recently exited told me that with all these departures, it's going to be hard, just to keep the lights on, over there. And so, now, with all these departures, the people who are remaining, the Management has suspended badge access, into Twitter's offices, presumably because they're afraid that employees, who are technically no longer employed, at Twitter, could potentially sabotage things. I'll read you the statement, or the email, they sent to staffers. It says \"Effective immediately, we are temporarily closing our office buildings and all badge access will be suspended. Offices will reopen on Monday, November 21st.\" And it goes on to say, \"We look forward to working with you on Twitter's\" future.
