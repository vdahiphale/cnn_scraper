Well, the hard part comes when people realize how long it goes, when the weariness kicks in, and that will be hard for the president.And I do think there's always been something very particular about this part of the world, that it just makes it hard to look away. And it makes it hard to say even as an American, well, this somehow doesn't matter to our national politics that's just hasn't really been how it's played out. BARRON-LOPEZ: And Republicans in the Republican Party have often, especially in recent years, been very proud of their support of Israel. And we saw that they've been really -- they're in turmoil right now, not just with the House speakership, but also with their ability to show any type of support for Israel because the leader of their party, as you pointed out, praised Hezbollah, and also attacked Benjamin Netanyahu in a political speech.",

In the meantime, Israeli forces have been not just carrying out airstrikes in very densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip, but also carrying out incursions as well, in a much -- of a much smaller scale of the one of course that we're all braced for.And as you mentioned, the purpose of those limited incursions are to, first of all, eliminate areas that pose a threat to Israel to eliminate terrorists as the Israeli Defense Forces put it. But also to try and locate the areas where hostages may be held or to find evidence for where the hostages may be held. Because remember, as we all wait for what could be an absolutely devastating land invasion of the Gaza Strip, we have to bear in mind between 100 and 150 Israeli hostages are being held at unknown locations across the Gaza Strip, separately of course. And that will obviously complicate if not hamper the possibility of a big sort of all-out assault on the territory already. The Hamas militant group says more than a dozen. I think 13 is the number they've given of hostages, they say have been killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes. There's no confirmation of that from the United States or from the Israelis either. But again, it underlines the challenge facing Israel right now as it prepares to go into the Gaza Strip in a very large military way.",

It's that lone wolf person sitting at home who's viewing video, who's taking in all this information, and perhaps we'll react. And so, what law enforcement is doing all across the country is a lot of what we're not seeing. You know, there are reinforcement officers here in New York City, who are mobilizing at police headquarters, just waiting just in case if something happens. Here later in Times Square, there is going to be a much larger presence of officers here as they get ready for a rally that's supposed to take place. A pro-Palestinian rally at 3:00 just here in Times Square. And so we will see more law enforcement here. And really across the country, in LA and other parts of the country, there are law enforcement officers all just on standby just in case something happens. And one of the things that the mayor and the governor here in New York City are talking about is they want people to feel safe. And so that's why they're taking this these extra precautions. But as you can see behind me here in Times Square, people are route. I mean, there is a lot of concern. There is -- this is something that's on everyone's mind. But people are out living their lives. They're out shopping, there are a lot of tourists in this city. The other thing that's going on all across here and in also other parts of the country is that at every synagogue that you go to, you will see law enforcement. You know, I drove by a couple this morning, here in Manhattan and there are cops outside these areas. And it's not a large presence. But again, it's to make people feel safe. So later today, certainly, we'll see an increase. And the big worry for law enforcement and intelligence officials, it is what they don't know. Could there be some kind of surprise attack, some lone wolf person who tries to take out, some kind of attack, and that's certainly something that they're keeping an eye on. But there are no credible threats. And as the city and cities all across the country are urging people to go out, live your lives, do what you would do normally on a day like today.",

And it is very nuanced, it is very difficult because there is obviously room to protest.I mean, I've heard Deborah Lipstadt, who's a very well-known scholar on these issues say, you want to hear the biggest criticism of the Israeli government, go sit in a cafe in Jerusalem. So there's that, but it's the slippery slope from that to outright anti-Semitism. What are you seeing at Brown and other schools? JILLIAN LEDERMAN, CHAIR, HILLEL'S ISRAEL LEADERSHIP NETWORK: Absolutely. So it's been very difficult at Brown. You know, as the president of Brown students for Israel, I've talked to so many Jewish students on Brown's campus, every single one of them personally know someone, whether it's a family member, or a friend who's in Israel right now, who was fighting, who's missing, who has been killed or who has relatives who have been killed. So on an emotional level, it's incredibly difficult on a campus level, as we've talked about, you know, there are issues with the administration's responses. At Brown specifically, we have had an administration that has been supportive. They have condemned the terrorism. Our college President Christina Paxson spoke at a vigil that was held by Jewish students and by the Hillel. But the response by individuals and Brown's campus, by students on Brown's campus, particularly Students for Justice in Palestine has been horrendous. They have as many other student groups have done, compared the terrorism that is going on to a justified active resistance. They have attributed it entirely to the Israeli government. And it's made students on campus feel unsafe in a way that I've never experienced before that --",

We also need university leaders to show up. We've had hundreds of vigils, they've been beautiful, filled with prayers, with song, with solidarity. They need to be there standing with us. And finally, we need university leaders to protect their Jewish student and other communities. This Day of Rage, and it's a Fatah called for by a former Hamas leader is real.
