I think what people will see tonight when they turn into the special, these parents, in the depths of grief, harnessed their want to make change and spare the rest of us and other families from having to bury their 6-year-olds and having to go through that. What they've achieved is remarkable. These are extraordinary people you will be reintroduced to tonight. Part of what they've done is taught people at schools, students, teachers, awareness skills, for how to spot a future school shooter. And, according to police, and school administrators, they have stopped 11 school shootings from happening. So these were 11 school shootings you and I will never report on. These parents will never have to bury their kids. They won't become national symbols of more grief. That's just one of the things they've done in the past 10 years.",
