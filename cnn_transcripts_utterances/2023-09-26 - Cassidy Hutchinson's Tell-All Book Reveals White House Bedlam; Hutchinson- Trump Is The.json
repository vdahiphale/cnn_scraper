      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD.  I'm Jake Tapper.As the nation continues to head into an election, where Donald Trump as of now seems likely to be the next Republican presidential nominee, and according to polls has a decent shot of beating President Joe Biden in November, 2024, two pieces of news seem instructive. Now one you may have missed from last Friday when Mr. Trump took to his social media platform and responded to a profile of outgoing chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, in \"The Atlantic\" magazine called \"The Patriot\", describing the ways that Milley tried to guide the nation through the chaotic and dangerous period surrounding Trump's loss to Biden in November 2020. This included when learning that the Chinese military believed that Trump was going to order an attack against the Chinese, in a phone call authorized by the then- acting secretary of defense, General Milley sought to reassure the Chinese that no such attack was imminent. Trump took to Truth Social Friday and called Milley's action an act so egregious that in times gone by the punishment would have been death, unquote. Death. That's right. The former president of the United States who -- well, may be the next president of the United States suggesting in no uncertain terms that America's highest ranking military official, a veteran of multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, and in Iraq, deserves to be executed, a man whose followers have a troubling habit of flooding his perceived enemies with death threats. That happened. The second piece of news comes from the former top aide to Mark Meadows, Trump's last White House chief of staff, Cassidy Hutchinson -- the star witness in last summer's January 6th Committee hearing. Her new book \"Enough\" published today. In the book, Hutchinson paints a picture of the closing days of the Trump White House even more chaotic, even more lawless than described in her shocking testimony. For example, what was Mark Meadows burning in the White House office fireplace? What was her reply when Meadows asked her whether she would take a bullet for Donald Trump? Hutchinson, as you might recall, was thrust into the national spotlight with her bombshell televised testimony before the January 6th Committee. But that moment, that moment, her testimony, that almost never happened. She had already spoken to the committee twice behind closed doors, ultimately, it was her third closed deposition when she chose to come forward and actually testify fully and honestly and openly about what she really saw and heard in the West Wing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER (voice-over): Cassidy Hutchinson was a top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, working a few steps away from the Oval Office, and watching as her boss' reel from the 2020 election loss and fought it with lies and wild schemes.",
