As for King Charles, it was a busy day. He spent some of that greeting people outside the palace along with Prince William and Princess Kate. The King, William, Kate accompanied by the King's sister, Princess Anne also lunched with Britain's Prime Minister and other visiting dignitaries. Meantime, back at the Palace, some of the Windsor great horses pulling the Royal coach tomorrow got a bit of a workout in rehearsal today making their way accompanied by footmen through Hyde Park. In Hampshire, southwest of the city, members of the Household Division rehearsed for their role tomorrow. Like the Royals, this is a family business. Some of the soldiers here are following in the footsteps of parents and grandparents who marched for Queen Elizabeth and George VI. At Westminster Abbey today, a look at the coronation chair where the King will sit and be anointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury behind a three-sided screen. And you've heard the phrase, \"the crown jewels.\" Well, here they are, the St. Edward's crown which the King will wear then and only then along with other items used in the ceremony. And of course, here for all the Royal pageantry, thousands of his subjects, Britons from all over London in the UK, the Commonwealth, and even some of us colonials waiting for the moment when all their camping out pays off with a glimpse of Royalty and a brush with history. Joining us now CNN's Richard Quest who is down among some of those people who are camping out tonight hoping to get a great view tomorrow. What are people there in the crowd telling you -- Richard. RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\": Well, I've got to keep my voice down a bit because it is after one o'clock in the morning here and people are trying to get a little bit of sleep, but just look at the sheer number of people who are here. Well, that woke up anybody who wasn't here. Now, where do you come from?",

That's the one defense narrative, and that's what stands out to me, that they're protecting their client. On the other hand, you're going to have the narrative that you can't take the law to your own hands. The fact that someone may be verbally aggressive is not suggestive of the fact that they mean any harm at all. You have a mental health component where there was no weapon here that was recovered at all, just a person acting out and wanting food who did not deserve to die, and certainly there needs to be justice impacted or upon him. And so those narratives will battle together. Ultimately, it'll be up to the district attorney to assess the case, factually, interview the witnesses, bring the matter, Anderson, before a grand jury, and make an assessment as to whether there's criminality. And if so, there should be a prosecution. And if not, then there will not be. But it can't be predicated upon public opinion, politicians or anything else, it has to be supported by the facts.",

They have different points of view with respect to what they felt, what they believe, what they thought, what they saw. So that's certainly something that I think can be anticipated.The real question is going to come down to the following. Did the person who put Mr. Neely in a chokehold, did he act reasonably under the circumstances? Number one. Number two, was the chokehold that he put him in, proportionate or disproportionate to any threat that was posed? Number three, ultimately, was there imminent fear by anyone on that train that they would indeed die in the event that Mr. Neely was not restrained and subsequent lost his life? And so, at the end of the day, what the law looks to, and it says the issue of objective reasonableness. Did you act reasonably under the circumstances? And was anyone an immediate fear of death or serious bodily injury? If the answer to that question is no, then I think the defendant, who could be a defendant, not yet a defendant, would have a problem. If the answer is yes, he was protecting and other people really felt that they were in serious danger, then I think there would be none. But that's the purpose of a grand jury. Bring all the evidence in, bring the parties in, bring everyone who saw anything in. Let the grand jury of 23 people make an assessment, not proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But is there reasonable cause to believe a crime occurred? And if so, let's have a trial and let's then have a jury of his peers make a decision about whether he acted appropriately, lawfully, and reasonably under these circumstances.",
