Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us on this Monday. Hunter Biden pardoned in the waning days of his presidency. Joe Biden issued the pardon for his son. He was facing sentencing this month for federal tax and gun convictions. Now Hunter Biden won't be sentenced and won't go to prison. That was a possibility before. The President issued this statement saying, quote, \"the charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong.\" Now, both President Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have functionally accused the Justice Department of playing politics. The move comes despite President Biden saying repeatedly he would not issue a pardon or commute his son's sentence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, they're looking at the border.Obviously, on the southern border, they're talking about a wall, so this is a part of a negotiation as well I'm sure for Trudeau trying to avoid a war. So he's offering alternatives to that. So, it allows Donald Trump to come out of this, saying I got what I wanted, no, we're not going to do the tariffs potentially, but we are getting all of this. But I think Donald Trump's going to want to see actual results from this, want to see that there is a reduction in, you know -- there's an improvement in border security before he says no to the tariffs, because a lot of people in Washington have been saying, haven't they, Kasie?
