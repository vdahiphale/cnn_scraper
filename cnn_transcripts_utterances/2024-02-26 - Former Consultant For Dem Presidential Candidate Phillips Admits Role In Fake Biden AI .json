The tech companies say it is their right to set their own platform rules. CNN senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, is here to explain what's at stake. Joan, what legal grounds are Florida and Texas using to make this case?",

This case has the potential to really transform the Internet and what people can see on it, potential, I'll underscore there. Because there doesn't seem to be a majority that's interested in what the states are arguing here. And the states, Florida and Texas, are trying to deflect this challenge by saying there shouldn't be a First Amendment question here because we're not trying to regulate expressive activity here or any kind of message of these platforms. What we're trying to do is restrict conduct as if we would a common carrier, like a telegraph, telephone entity, rather than something that could be likened more to a publisher or a newspaper. And the justices seemed to really push back on that on two accounts. First, both of these cases are up there on what we call preliminary injunctions. These laws have been blocked in the early stage. And there was never a really detailed record, especially in the Florida case, to say, how broadly with this sweep? Would it involve just the big social media companies like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, those kinds of things, Twitter/X? Or could it go to all sorts of other commercial activities online, for example, like Uber or Etsy. Lots of questions from the justices. And the bottom line seemed to be that this is not going to be the case that has any kind of really potential sweeping ruling that will change the Internet.",

So it winds up being a very hard problem to solve. But as we go forward on the engineering portion of it, we're getting to see things like this. Pretend, if you look where you've never looked before, you're going to find what you'd never found. And this is an incredible find. I mean, like when I say cures, there are anticancer causing properties and Caribbean Sea squirts. There are antimicrobial things that are in a -- that are in some fish.

So the interesting part, depending on the exact depth, what we suppose at this point is that the water level dropped pretty significantly during the ice ages.When it did, entire ecosystems shifted down. So that's why there's differences between these two sea mounds, right, 2, 4, 6, 12 sea mounds in a row. And there's completely different ecosystems. Why? Because they developed in this line of -- well, the water level was low so they couldn't get between one another. So they just developed on their own little side. So it's really kind of a neat infrastructure where they have these little kingdoms or fiefdoms, if you will, of creatures that are just in a stack. Like I said, trust me, the naming and the taxonomy of creatures is a long process.
