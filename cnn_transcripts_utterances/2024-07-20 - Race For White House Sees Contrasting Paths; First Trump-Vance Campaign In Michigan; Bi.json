But one thing very clear, the contrast between the two parties could not be more stark at this stage of the race. Republicans in celebration over their nominee, while Democrats right now in desperation over theirs. Donald Trump just had his first trial event with his new vice presidential nominee, J. D. Vance. A smaller patch now covering the part of his ear where he was shot. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And together we will fight, fight, fight, right? And we will win, win, win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There they all are. It all began with his disastrous performance, though, at that CNN debate. But after nearly three weeks of pressure to exit, President Biden still not ready to throw in the towel. We will begin the hour with the Trump campaign. This evening, the official Republican nominee and his new VP pick, J. D. Vance, rally voters at an indoor event in Grand Rapids, Michigan. You know that is a big battleground state. It is the first on the trail test for the Secret Service since a gunman shot the former president at an outdoor rally exactly a week ago. CNN's Kristen Holmes has the latest from Grand Rapids. Kristen?",

      "sentences": "Sara, this is the first time we saw Donald Trump up there on a rally stage since that assassination attempt last week in Butler, Pennsylvania, and he seemed to be fully in his element. And he spoke for roughly two hours. He engaged with the crowd.At one point, he was pulling them on various aspects, saying who should he run against? Should it be Joe Biden? Should it be Kamala Harris? At other points, he was riffing on various things that happened while he was in office, completely off script. But again, feeding to the crowd, there were thousands of people in this arena cheering for him. He came out with just a small band aid on his ear. He has replaced that gauze from that shooting that happened last week. Now, one notable part about him being here in Michigan, obviously critical battleground state. He also appeared for the first time with vice presidential nominee J. D. Vance on the campaign trail. Vance introduced him, left the stage, then Donald Trump spoke. The reason why that is notable is that part of Vance's appeal, at least, if you talk to people who are close to the former president, said he might be able to help with voters, working class voters, particularly in areas like Michigan, like Pennsylvania, like Wisconsin. All of those being, again, critical states that Donald Trump won in 2016 and then lost in 2020. Now, I do want to point to one specific moment during the speech where he tried to distance himself again from Project 2025. That, of course, being the overall plan -- transition plan put into place or at least developed by the Heritage Foundation and a bunch of other conservative groups that would be a plan for whatever the next Republican president is. People who are authors of that plan, many of them worked for Former President Donald Trump's administration, are currently allies of his, but it has come under a lot of fire for how conservative some of those policies are. Take a listen to what Donald Trump said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Like some on the right, severe right, came up with this Project '25 and I don't even know. I mean, some of them, I know who they are, but they're very, very conservative. Just like you have -- they're sort of the opposite of the radical left, OK? You have the radical left and you have the radical right. And they come up with this, but I don't know what the hell it is. It's Project '25. He's involved in Project -- and then they read some of the things and they are extreme. I mean, they're seriously extreme. But I don't know anything about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN Correspondent Priscilla Alvarez is in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, following the president.Priscilla, you know there have been a lot of calls. I know he knows about this.

But there is no doubt, Sara, that this has been a deeply frustrating and challenging time for the president and for this campaign, because those calls for him to step aside from members of his own party have continued over the course of this past week, but also over the course of today, including from some members, who not long ago, and by that, I mean after the CNN Presidential Debate, were standing by his side at his rallies.And so, this has been a quickly developing story for the president and his campaign as they have sought to calm nerves, had the conversations, hit the campaign trail, and yet, continue to get this incoming from members of the party, from allies, from donors, who are just not convinced that President Biden is the best candidate to go up against Former President Donald Trump. But in the meantime, the president is stuck at home because he is -- he still has COVID. His doctor with an update today saying that he is improving, his symptoms are, but he is still testing positive. So, while the president had hoped to be on the campaign trail to do what the members of his party have asked for, which is to be out front, to engage with voters, he had to get pulled off of the trail to recover from his diagnosis. So, these frustrations and challenges are playing out behind closed doors as the president has sought to talk to -- with his inner circle and his senior advisors, many of whom often travel with the president along with his family as they grapple with this difficult moment that just isn't getting any easier.",

Appreciate it.All right. Let's continue the conversation now. I am joined by Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California. She is here on behalf of the Biden re-election campaign. Thank you so much Congresswoman Lee for joining us. I am a big fan of Oakland. I don't care what anybody says. Lived there a long time and loved it when I was there. So, I know that's one part of your district. I do want to talk to you about what we have been seeing, hearing, and what the President's been hearing, 35 elected members of your party think the president should exit the race, exit the campaign. Why do you think they're wrong? REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA): But first, let me just say thank you, Sara, for having me with you. And yes, I love Oakland we're doing a great job here. Lots of challenges, but moving ahead. The president is very clear that he is running in this race to win. First of all, let me just say this. He has a record to run on. He and Vice President Harris, they've delivered. They've lowered costs for people. They've been fighting for people, fighting for reproductive freedom, fighting to make sure that insulin is capped at $35. So, they have a record, and they beat Donald Trump in the past. Now, that only is an indicator of what they will do in the future. And so, I am one who -- if the president decides that he's not going to run, well, that's another thing, but believe you me, the Biden- Harris ticket has delivered and I believe that they will win this campaign. We've got a lot of work to do. They've been connecting with voters. You see what the president has been doing. He was in Las Vegas and Nevada. He was in Wisconsin. He was in Pennsylvania. The vice president is out there. Everyone is out there, and the voters are connecting with the president and vice president. And so, I'm sticking with the president. If he changes his mind, of course, the person who would be -- the next person would be Vice President Harris, but I believe that President Biden is in this to win.",

But also, this speaks volumes to why we need to get to public finances of campaigns.Members have tough races. This was tough before the president, the debate, that was, you know, a disaster. We can't sugar coat that. You know, the campaign was very clear about that this was going to be a close race. And so, we have to hunker down and we have to support all of our Democratic candidates and we have to make sure that we support the Biden-Harris ticket and make sure that voters understand the dangers of a Trump presidency.

Sources saying that President Biden is seething tonight at Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tying her to the latest round of Democratic defections, calling for him to suspend his campaign.

And what -- at worst it is, is petty politics, local petty politics from California, et cetera, throwing itself onto the national stage.Look, I believe that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi probably know -- not probably, they do know this American political system better than I, they know Joe better than I, but they also know that Joe Biden is not going to bow to public pressure at all. This man said he's in the race. And at the end of the day, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and others who instead of rallying to the aid of Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden are running to their local newspapers to write op-ed pieces have done more damage to the president of the United States than he did to himself on June 27th. We'll right the ship. We'll get on board. Because at the end of the day, you only have three choices. I've said this for the past six months, and I think people are finally starting to pay attention to it, heard my brother Charlemagne talking about it the other day, but you only got three choices in this race.

But we have to, if we're going to be sober and honest about this, acknowledge that there has been some slippage with the president since 2020.But let me also explain to people why Joe Biden -- because this doesn't get enough play. And let me explain to people why Joe Biden is actually the best person to run for president of the United States if you're a Democrat. Joe Biden has performed better with white voters, white women, white suburbs, white college educated voters. 70 percent of the electorate. He's performed better than anybody since LBJ, right? And that's 70 percent of the electorate, and he's winning more than half of them. Barack Obama in 2012 won about 38 percent of those same voters, which means that in order for someone to win with that number of 38 percent, you have to have a turnout of black voters and black women and Hispanic voters and young voters that is just astronomical, and that's a heavy burden to bear.

There were legislative wins for the black community that came with this realignment with the Democratic Party. And so, there's a legitimate history there that I think that people should know. But when you look at the two parties, it's a clear choice. Just like Bakari said, the -- voting for Trump, voting for Biden or the couch, a vote for the couch is a vote for Donald Trump. And one is going to, you know, give the black community -- there's at least a conversation you can have about what the agenda is. The other, it's not going to give you what you think it is.

You want to convey confidence in the vice president while at the same time not encouraging this faction that has turned against Joe Biden to use that as more reason to push Joe Biden aside, which some of them actually want to push Kamala Harris aside, too, right? Even though this is being portrayed as some sort of opportunity for Kamala Harris to be out front, there are certainly Democrats who are not supportive. There was a recent poll that came out, six in 10 Dems said that they're supportive of Kamala Harris, but that leaves four in 10, right? And Two out of 10 were unsure, and two out of 10 were against her.So, that's just within the Democratic Party, showing that although the majority support Kamala Harris, there's still people that need to get to know her, they need to understand all the work that she's been doing. Now, you add Republicans to the mix. Now, you add independents to the mix. And this is a country that although Hillary Clinton did win the popular vote electorally, right, she lost the Electoral College. They would not elect this very qualified white woman. So, there's still sexism that Kamala Harris will face in addition to all other, you know, isms, right? The racism, all of these things. And so, she's up against a lot. I think that that is also factoring into Joe Biden's decision, that I'm sure it's weighing heavily on his heart. That if he steps aside, he has to assure, he has to feel confident that Kamala at the top of the ticket will win because this is about democracy at stake. And I do think sometimes we lose that. Like Trump and Biden are not the same candidate, right? The stakes are so high. And he has said the reason he ran for president, I'm sure he could have been relaxing somewhere in his old age, was because of the threat that Donald Trump presented to democracy. He ran for that reason. So, I think that's also weighing into his decision about what to do next.",

Investigators now believe the young gunman involved, Thomas Crooks, was scoping out the rally site on the day of the shooting using a drone. A law enforcement official tells CNN the working theory here is the drone would have given Crooks an overview, of course, of nearby buildings and how they connect and ultimately help him find the exact spot from which he would fire shots at Trump behind the podium.Joining me now is Christopher McClenic, who was a senior special agent at the U.S. Secret Service. Chris, there is a lot to talk about, but I want to start with Trump's rally. It was indoors tonight. It's that likely to remain in the future because of what happened in the outdoor rally where he was nearly assassinated, a father and firefighter was killed and two others injured? CHRISTOPHER MCCLENIC, FORMER SENIOR SPECIAL AGENT, U.S. SECRET SERVICE: Well, first things first, good evening, Sara, and thank you for having me. I can only imagine that, yes, that's probably going to be the case at this point in this late stage of the campaign that better safe than sorry. They probably will lean more towards indoor rallies as opposed to the outdoor ones for -- were pretty much obvious reasons. Indoor rallies are easier to control. They're easier to maintain and overall safer. So, I would imagine that they would be pushing more for them than for obvious reasons, the outdoor rallies.",

I can't speak on what they were thinking at this site, but I can say that I was an agent while the drone craze, if you will, became what it is today, and the Secret Service absolutely has policies and procedures in reference to drones and drone activity.So, I would imagine there's going to be a lot of questions in regards to how this individual, if, in fact, it's true, he did use a drone to do basically surveillance. So, that strikes me is a little odd that the Service did not take greater actions against a drone. Now, in regards to his mindset, it appears he was doing his homework by using a drone to do surveillance. That's something that's being utilized more, both with law enforcement and even with military, where you are able to get a bird's eye view, if you will, of an area that you're planning to infiltrate. So, if, in fact, he did do that, then yes, that's becoming standard operation procedure for bad guys, if you will.",

What was the reason exactly?And a week on, we still have no motive. Investigators saying that they're not sure, they haven't found the exact motive. Do you think we'll ever know that, since it's been this long? They've talked to 100 people, including family members and friends.

It sometimes took a while to find it, but there has been. And I firmly believe they will find said motive in this individual.

Also focusing on the link between these Houthi militants and Iran, which according to the Israeli government, provided Houthi militants with the very same type of drone that was used in Friday's attack. The Israeli military says that was a Samad-3 drone.I'm also told that this was a 100 percent Israeli strike carried out by the Israeli military, not in conjunction with the United States or the United Kingdom. And that's notable in particular because over the last several months, Israel has really let the United States and the U.K. take the lead in carrying out strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen, but because this drone strike on Friday actually resulted in Israeli casualties, that changed the calculus here and Israel carrying out this strike alone. I am told, however, by an Israeli defense official that the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, got on the phone with his American counterpart, the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, to give him a heads up on the strike ahead of time.
