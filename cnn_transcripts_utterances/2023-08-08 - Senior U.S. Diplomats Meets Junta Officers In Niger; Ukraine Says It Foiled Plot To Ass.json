The other one is that it's sort of easier to really stop deforestation when you fix the security issues. But then you have to build economic alternatives, right, because people have to leave, they need the alternatives to do so. So, this is also part of the conversation here.

Now, Zoom became a household name during the pandemic. The video communications company has helped enable the work-from-home revolution. Now, though, even Zoom is requiring its workers to start returning to the office. But as you'd expect, not everyone is ready to ditch their couch for a commute, as CNN's Tom Foreman reports.

      "sentences": "Oh, the irony here! The company that taught us all how we could work from home and see each other, Zoom, is now saying it wants its workers in the office at least two days out of every week.And they're not alone in doing that. Several others are doing the same thing. Google, Salesforce, Amazon, and the U.S. government are all saying we like the idea of people being there, face to face. We like the synergy. We like the productivity that comes out of it. They're convinced that's better. Now, a lot of workers are not so convinced, especially younger workers and those who are more highly-educated. They are saying, Look, we don't like commuting. Forty-eight percent say that's one of the reasons they don't want to come into the office. It costs gas. It costs time. It costs money. They don't like paying extra childcare. When they're home, they can take care of that. Fourteen percent think that. Thirteen percent say they are better able to focus. What is the difference here in what they want? Generally, employers want 1.6 days at home per week. That's weird. We don't take 0.6 days. So basically, they're saying two days at home a week is enough. Workers want a little more than that, so basically three days at home per week. The workers have a really strong hand to play here right now, because so many employers are still trying to find enough people. And interestingly, working from home, one study found, workers equate that to an 8 percent higher salary, if they had the freedom to work from home a lot. So, you can see for employers, yes, they want people back. But it's an uphill climb. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
