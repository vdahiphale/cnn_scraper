The Russian warplane dropped the bomb on the Russian city of Belgorod just 25 miles north of the border with Ukraine. State media called this an accidental release. The region's governor says two people were injured. And at any moment, the Supreme Court could hand down a major ruling on a widely used abortion pill. The justices have a self-imposed 11:59 p.m. deadline to decide if they will uphold an appeals court ruling that would severely restrict access to Mifepristone. And court appearance today for this man, accused of shooting a 6-year- old girl and her parents after a basketball rolled into his yard. Robert Singletary turned himself into Florida police about 500 miles from the scene of the shooting in Gastonia, North Carolina. A short time ago, he waived extradition and he will be returned to North Carolina. Jim?",

Law enforcement sources tell CNN the man who killed five people inside a Louisville bank left extensive notes about what he said were his motivations.He claims he wanted to show how easy it is for someone in America with serious mental illness to just go out and buy a gun. We should note, under Kentucky state law, he was only required to fill out an ATF form and undergo a criminal records check. CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem, joins us now. Juliette, you know, I don't want to advertise this person's own, you know, presentation of his reasons for this shooting. But particularly in states such as Kentucky, it is true, is it not. that it's fairly easy to get a weapon, well, under any circumstances, and even if you do have a record of mental health issues.",

I mean, in the end, what he was telling the world before he started his shooting spree ended up being accurate.And it's a -- it's a case in which his motives might be mixed. I mean, he might have said one thing in a note. There is an additional note. And it shows how difficult it is to know why exactly someone wakes up one day and becomes a mass murderer in a mass shooting. This is a unique case. There's no criminal record we know of. The family didn't know that there was -- that there were guns. And when the roommate discovers the note about what's about to happen, the roommate does the right thing, calls the mom. The mom does the right thing and immediately calls the police. And here's where the weapon becomes relevant. She calls the police, he's already in the bank, and within one minute he kills five people. That's the timing that we know of. So even the best interventions are just not fast enough at this stage.",

It's one of them.But let's talk about Red Flag laws then. Obviously, the mother's call sadly came too late. But had there been a Red Flag law in the state of Kentucky, where a family member or someone else could have said, hey, wait a second, this guy has problems. Can you see the circumstances where this could have been prevented? Obviously, you would need time in advance.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Not all Red Flag laws are the same. But there are also -- some are quite broad. And interventions by family or coworkers will justify the inability -- well, at least to justify a court hearing.Others are quite narrow and strict. It really does take, you know, sort of a spouse to come forward. But let's assume that there is a broad one or at least a standard for the Red Flag laws. In that instance, the mother, who clearly had longstanding concerns about her son, and he was in I think some sort of therapy, could have asserted the Red Flag law to ensure that he appeared on a list. And that when he went through a security clearance or a gun -- a gun check, even for this weapon, he would have been flagged. So Red Flag laws do work. And you raise, you know a great point, Jim, in terms of, you know, are we -- as anything as -- that the cure all and the answer is no, right? So you could have Red Flag laws, but someone gets out of them or a family member doesn't come forward or -- or whatever it is. But where we are now, with the number of guns we have on the streets, and then this particular type of gun, the A.R.-15, is you just want to have a number of ways to avoid the mass shooting incident. So you do call it layered defenses. So I'm not -- letting people who are talking now about gun control, I'm talking about like a single solution. It's just multiple ones. And a Red Flag one, are -- they're proving themselves very, very effective in other jurisdictions.",

You wouldn't have a single point of failure, right?I mean, in other words, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't allow all passengers on a plane and then just hope no one gets through the cockpit door. You have multiple layers of security. The same has to be true for the kind of culture that we're in right now, which is you want you want defense, which is where we tend to focus a lot, armed guards in schools, arming others so that they can protect themselves or metal detectors. That's defense. But you also want to be in a position in which you are making it harder for one individual to kill lots of people before there can be a law enforcement intervention. And we are denying both the public that ability to run or hide or protect themselves and, of course, law enforcement the ability to stop this from happening.",

Four that are facing murder charges are teenagers. Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the rampage, which killed four people and injured 32 others. We should note more charges are expected. Also at least three men who participated in the 2017 white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia, have been indicted by a grand jury and are now facing felony criminal charges. They're accused of carrying those burning tiki torches with the intent to intimidate as they marched through the campus of the University of Virginia, shouting racist slogans. The charges carry a maximum of five years in prison. And a Texas woman who is now an Italian princess has been booted from her historic Roman villa. A judge ordering the sale of the villa, which features an original Caravaggio ceiling painting and a recently unearthed Michelangelo statue. The princess lost her royal digs after she and her stepchildren fought over the estate of her late husband. Jim? SCIUTTO: Goodness. Well, a Republican leader in the Tennessee House of Representatives, who voted just last month to expel three of his Democratic colleagues for protesting against gun violence, has himself now resigned from office. State Representatives Scotty Campbell, who served as vice chair of the House Republican Caucus there, resigned from his seat in a sudden move Thursday after an ethics panel found that he violated the General Assembly policy on workplace harassment.

And of course, there are so many eyeballs on the Tennessee State House. You got to think about the fact of how much power this man had, as he was pushing forward the expulsion of those three members. But all along behind the scenes he was saying he had to consensual conversation as an adult. Apparently. at least one of those ladies did not feel that way. They reported to the committee.

We know that the district attorney in New Mexico got new information about a modification to the gun. But the big question is, who modified this gun? And now that charges are being dismissed on Alec Baldwin, pending further investigation by the D.A., could potential other charges be brought against someone who they might think might have, you know, modified this gun? You know, I have spoken to Alec Baldwin's legal team. The lawyer releasing a statement praising the DEA yesterday. Alec Baldwin, taking to social media to thank his wife and his attorney, specifically Luke Nikas. But this comes after many significant legal victories for Alec Baldwin's team. And the first was reducing these charges, Brianna, which was removing the firearm enhancement charge, going from potentially facing five years in prison to 18 months.
