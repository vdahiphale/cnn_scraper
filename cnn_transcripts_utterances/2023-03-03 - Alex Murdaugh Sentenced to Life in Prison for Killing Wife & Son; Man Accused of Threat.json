But the White House changed its approach. While it issued this statement a month ago when the House voted on this matter, it said that while we work towards making Washington, D.C. the 51st state of our union, Congress should respect the District of Columbia's autonomy to govern its local affairs. It said in that statement, it opposed the Republican effort to rescind the law. But yesterday when Biden came to Capitol Hill, he told Senate Democrats that he in fact would allow that Republican-led effort to go into law essentially siding with Republicans to rescind the D.C.-led law. Now, earlier today, the White House was pressed about their - about the President's apparent reversal on this issue and they argue that he never explicitly said he would veto the Republican measure.
