And we've learned that four boxes made their way from the residence to a temporary home in Virginia, and then to the home in Indiana, but they were not kept in a secure storage area.And, Kate, of course, we have heard the former vice president repeatedly say that he did not have any such materials. And he's even talked about his careful process for handling these kinds of documents. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, at this point, we don't know what these documents were, we don't know the level of classification, but we knew -- do know the Justice Department is conducting a review to determine whether there needs to be any other steps.

I'm not surprised that he came forward because I know from talking to people on the ground in Memphis, that the city is on edge, that lots of people are very upset that the body cam video has not been released even though the district attorney says that the investigation of what happened to Mr. Nichols is ongoing.
