You're looking at live pictures of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C. We'll keep you updated.Also this morning, Hunter Biden's former business partner testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill to members of the House Oversight Committee. Sources telling CNN that Devon Archer said Hunter Biden put his father on the speakerphone several times during business meetings. Archer also claimed it was an effort to sell what he called, quote, the illusion of access. The committee's chairman, Congressman James Comer, writing in a statement, quote, Devon Archer's testimony today confirms Joe Biden lied at American people when he said he had no knowledge of his son's business dealings and was not involved. Joe Biden was the brand that his son sold around the world to enrich the Biden family. Now, Comer also accused Joe Biden of lying about his family's business dealings and his own involvement, pledging that his panel will continue to investigate.",

And what we learned is that, you know, this was the House Republicans. They brought him in as kind of their big witness to say that the president -- now President Biden was aware of Hunter Biden's business dealings.So what Archer testified to, according to multiple sources from all different sides, is that Archer was Hunter Biden's business partner for a decade and he said over that period Hunter Biden would call his father every single day. But he recalled about 20 times that he, Hunter Biden, called Joe Biden when he was in the presence of business executives. One time was when they were having dinner in Paris. One time then Vice President Biden stopped into a dinner in Washington, D.C. But Archer testified that they never discussed business dealings. So, this was not the smoking gun testimony that Republicans made have been looking for. And that is kind of a key thing here that the Democrats have seized on. One of the Democrats who attended that meeting yesterday was Dan Goldman from New York. He said that this was -- this whole Republican investigation is a waste of time. And here's more of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): Joe Biden had nothing to do with Hunter Biden's business dealings, derived no benefit from it, received no money and did not know about anything that Hunter Biden was doing. The fact that he spoke to business associates of Hunter Biden to say hello, to have small talk, casual conversation, is not evidence that Joe Biden or Hunter Biden did anything wrong.

In a different clip from that show, Cardi B and her DJ asked the audience to splash her with water, just not on her face. But this is the latest in a slew of incidents where artists have had objects thrown at them while on stage.

It's formed outside the Roosevelt Hotel here in Manhattan. And just talking to one or two of them on my way over here, these are people that have been here for days. This is the city's first asylum seeker arrivals center. So, it connects some of these migrants with those services that I mentioned. But it's also part of what has been a tens of thousands worth of migrants that have come here to New York City since last spring. The latest from the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, said that they have processed more than 90,000 migrants since last spring. But right now they are at a point where places like this are at capacity and they are trying to figure out what to do as far as their next steps. And Mayor Eric Adams has said it's not just about getting more funding to help with the processing, but also about speeding up the work authorization process to try and get some of these migrants processed and to start, as Mayor Adams has put, their American dream. Now, obviously, the scenes of these migrants laying out in the middle of the street and, I mean, folks are going to rush hour -- or going to their jobs in the middle of rush hour here in New York City like normal while migrants are literally sleeping and staying on the sidewalk here. The Legal Aid Society has taken note of that image, as many here have done as well. It's hard to ignore as you walk by. Saying that denying new arrivals placement and forcing people to languish on local streets is cruel and runs afoul of a range of court orders and local laws. And for his part, Mayor Adams says they are still working through a potential next phase here. But for now he says they've run out of room and that he does not want it to get to a point where we're seeing tents set up, up and down the streets. But, again, these migrants are waiting in line to try to get registered for either shelter or other forms of service so that they can begin the reason they likely came here in the first place to the United States, their pursuit of the American dream.",
