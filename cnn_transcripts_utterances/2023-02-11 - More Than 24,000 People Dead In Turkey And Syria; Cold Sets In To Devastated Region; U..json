In Turkey, emergency crews continue digging through the rubble with their bare hands, if they have to -- have to, hoping to find yet another survivor. On Friday, they rescued a mother and daughter who had been trapped for 107 hours. You hear the applause there. But with each passing minute, hopes of finding more people alive are unfortunately fading. Earlier, a woman who lost dozens of her family members tried to describe what she's going through. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Pain, pain, pain. We lost 60 people from our family, 60. What can I say? It's God's decision. It's been six days. We haven't changed our socks. We can't see the light of day. We light fires and wait outside. (END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON: CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from Istanbul. I mean, Nada, the survivors, their expressions on their face is to just say that they seem so incredibly lost and yet wracked with grief.

And I want you to notice that there's no real cloud cover across the region. So with clear skies, allows what we call radiational cooling to take place overnight. And any heat that's trapped up during the course of the day just radiates right back into the atmosphere and temperatures are cold. And that is going to be particularly challenging for people living outdoors or anyone too afraid to stay indoors for the fear of further aftershocks.Now you can see, just in general, no precipitation in store. So I guess that's the bit of good news. We don't have to contend with rain or snow going forward with the recovery process, but it is the overarching theme here, cold weather continues for the days ahead. Here's a look at the forecast temperatures in some of the hardest hit areas. You can see the aftershocks that occurred throughout this region, kind of making almost a T-shaped pattern. We have forecast temperatures for Saturday afternoon to stay below freezing for most locations in central and southern portions of Turkey. And as we head a little further south, may be bumping up just above freezing, but it's the overnight lows that I'm particularly concerned about. You can see the forecast here staying well below zero for southern sections of Turkey. We're talking about anywhere from negative single digits to negative teens. Again, that is for forecast minimum temperatures through the course of the weekend and into early next week with temperatures rebounding through the course of the day. Of course, no significant weather changes in store for the next seven days, but also no major weather systems moving through. That's the good news. Back to you.",
