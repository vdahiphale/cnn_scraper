There has been an outpouring of grief and anger after authorities blamed human error for the crash.Scuffles broke out in Athens where this ill-fated journey began. Police find tear gas at protesters gathered outside the Hellenic train headquarters. The Greek Prime Minister visited the wreckage near the city of Larissa, excuse me, where a freight train and passenger train traveling on the same track collided. The Greek transportation minister has resigned partly over an aging rail network he described as falling way short of current international standards. The head of the Hellenic railways organization also resigned and authorities have arrested Larissa train station manager. That's how I want to say. The government has declared three days of national mourning. Flowers are being placed at the train station in Pilnanikya (ph) where the passengers journey was meant to end. The sadness has been felt across Europe with flags at EU lowered to half-staff. Now to CNN's Nada Bashir with the report from near the wreckage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Well across Greece there is a real sense of devastation. You can see behind me there is still a heavy police presence, fire brigades and other emergency response teams. They are expected to continue working into the night as part of that recovery effort. And of course, the investigation into what caused that deadly train collision on Wednesday morning is still ongoing. BASHIR (voiceover): A fireball ignites a passenger train in Greece carrying more than 350 people colliding head on with a freight train killing dozens. In the aftermath, debris and carriages scattered across tracks. KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, GREEK PRIME MINISTER (through translator): What we're experiencing today is very, very difficult as a country.

There are standards and rules and regulations  in every country. And the women have an important role in Iran, and they gained that roll after the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Today, the outside networks, they are turning the issue of hijab and head scarves into a political crisis.

I said to him, look, we are ready for your military team and the Iranian military came to sit down and look at these documents and then make judgments.

And we said to the Ukrainian counterparts, if you have any documented proof, show it to us. We will look into it. But the Ukrainian side did not show us any strong proof to substantiate that claim with the exception of some media accusations. And I can tell you explicitly, as the foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran, that we are against war. We are against the war in Ukraine, against the war in Afghanistan, against the war in Yemen, against the war in Palestine. And our president has made great efforts in order to stop the war in Ukraine. A few months ago, Mr. Macron asked the president of our country to come and mediate because he has good relations with Russia. And then the president, Mr. Raisi, sent me to Moscow, and I spoke with Russian officials. And we are continuing our efforts. We think war is not a solution. Neither in Ukraine, nor anywhere else in the world. Look, it's military experts who should be proving this. You are a journalist, you're not an expert, I'm not an expert either. And now as a CNN reporter, you are telling me that this is an Iranian drone? You know -- I think that incidentally this is a drone that with used by the Zionist regime.
