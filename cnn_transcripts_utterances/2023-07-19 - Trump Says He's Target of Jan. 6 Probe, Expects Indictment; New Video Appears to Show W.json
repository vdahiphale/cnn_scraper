The statutes listed in the target letter surrounding the January 6th investigations. Those statutes reportedly involve conspiracy to commit offense or defraud the United States, deprivation of rights and tampering with a witness.Broadly speaking, what still has to be determined, exactly what acts correspond to those statutes? What can we discern based on the people we know the special counsel has been speaking with. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now. It has been a whirlwind 24 hours. First news, the target letter, then a little bit of reporting about what's inside of it. What's the latest, Katelyn?",

It's good to see you guys.Michael, John and Katelyn went through the statutes that are contained in this target letter, three possible things we're talking about here, deprivation of rights, conspiracy to defraud the United States and tampering with a witness.

      "sentences": "Yes, well, I'm glad to be with all of you. I really think the tampering with the witness charge is maybe the cleanest case. And the simple reason is those all accounts after the January 6 committee evidence and presentation that occurred post Trump's presidency and efforts in order, it was essentially some efforts that he made to contact people within his circle to reach out to potential witnesses. And so those seem to be a little bit cleaner because you don't get into issues of executive privilege and presidential powers and immunity and all those things.It's not the most serious charge. I mean, when you start looking at the charges that are possible, the idea of deprivation of rights means that somebody under color of law tried to deprive another person or group of people of rights that are guaranteed to them by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. And so that is obviously probably the most significant charge that may be out there. But you're going to get into questions then about what could he say as president, what could he do as president, was his speech protected as political speech at the time. And so I really think a cleaner case may be the latter, but we'll see which way they go.",

I can see Trump's fingerprints on it, as opposed to just trying to catch his whispers in the wind with a net and somehow stick them to him in indictment.

We know the reporting from my Hill team is that Trump spoke yesterday with Kevin McCarthy and Elise Stefanik to strategize on how they can help defend him if charges come.What could the impact be of any effort like that and just an indictment related to January 6, if it comes, on a Republican Party trying to hold on to majority in the House?",

We will continue to see, as you're saying, is already showing some evidence in polling of what people think.Michael, what impact would an indictment here from the special counsel have on -- I'm going to call them related charges, at least the related issues that we've now seen charges coming of Michigan related to charging the fake electors there, or the investigation in Fulton County, Georgia, that you and I have talked about so much that's ongoing or even the other way around if they impact this or this impacts that.

And that is at the Department of Justice, when you're talking about indicting a former president, that you do it with that weight of that office and the sort of that clearer picture of impartiality and non-partisanship, as opposed to some of the locally elected prosecutors who run on partisan tickets, so they can be claimed that this is just a rogue Democrat D.A. out to get the Republican frontrunner.So, I do think that it should have some impact. I think the reality is that it will not have much impact on decisions to bring charges. And you'll see charges brought in Fulton County, I believe. You are seeing the special lecture charges brought in other places. And I think these multiple indictments are probably doing more to strengthen his arguments and the likelihood that the jury may buy into some of his arguments of persecution as opposed to a fair and just prosecution.",

That's five times the number we saw on the previous night, which was also not an insignificant attack.The key focus, Odessa. The Ukrainian authorities, as you're saying, including President Zelenskyy, accusing Russia of deliberately targeting grain related facilities. This comes, don't forget, just two days after Russia are pulled out of that crucial Black Sea grain initiative. We're now also hearing from the Agriculture Ministry of Ukraine, that says 60,000 tons of grain was destroyed, grain that was supposed to have been loaded onto a ship to transit through those previously safe maritime corridors some 60 days ago. That was in the port of Chornomorsk, just along the Black Sea Coast from Odessa. So, a terrifying night for this city, which, before the war, had a population of almost a million people. Russia's account, though, they don't admit to targeting grain facilities. They simply say that they were targeting military industrial facilities, fuel and ammunition storages and things like that. And, separately, John, just quickly, Russia is also dealing with the fallout of a pretty major incident, it seems, in Crimea, a fire broke out at a military training facility, and ammunition depot that several thousand people had to be evacuated.
