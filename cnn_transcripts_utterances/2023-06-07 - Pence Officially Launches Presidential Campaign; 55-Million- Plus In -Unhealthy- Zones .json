It was also a little bit of back to the future, right from his ad that he put out announcing in a way that we're previewing his announcement, which was about the shining city on the Hill. He talked about compassionate reforms here, sort of evoking George W. Bush, as he's trying to cast an optimistic note about the future. What did you think?",

He took us through his conservative philosophy that started out of course, as a congressman from Indiana, as governor, yes, I was vice president along the way and then talked about the leadership going forward. So, I think an extraordinarily well-written speech.One thing I've noticed in this presidential campaign is a lot of candidates aren't giving these you know historic speeches you know that really elevate why you want to be president. You cannot walk away from this, not knowing why he wants to be president. You can sort of quibble with should he be or you know, you could train someone else, but you know why he's running. I was struck. But we've heard some of these themes throughout he's been talking sometimes off camera you know, sometimes just smaller groups. We put it all together and talked about Donald Trump repeatedly, I lost track of how many times. And clearly, a day after Chris Christie jumped in when he gave a full- throated attack on him, Mike Pence was more reasoned. It was more Midwestern if you will. It was more like we need to move on. He said difficult -- or different times call for different leaders. That's the central question. Is he a different leader? Would he be going forward? That's his burden, I think to show that he is the future, not just the past. But it's clear to me by running for president, he seems to be trying to wash some of that Trump off him and remind people that he was, in fact, a true fiscal conservative, a social conservative. On abortion too, he also went after Donald Trump on that saying he has sort of retreated from the pro-life movement. So, a lot to chew on in here.",

I want to show you a picture I took out of the window of my airplane as we approach the Nation's Capital as well. We'll put that up on the screen in a moment. Here, the pilots referred to it as we flew into the city and said reduced visibility as a result of that smoke coming from Canada. CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray joins me now.

Smoke from the ongoing Canadian wildfires blanketing major U.S. cities. Have a look at New York there. The skyline behind an orange, almost Mars-like haze.CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray joins me now. She's been following the spread of this smoke from Canada. I have to tell you. When I look at that map, Jennifer there, the scope of this is just remarkable. How wide and how long is it going to sit here?",

You know you have to think that we're still early in the fire season for Canada, and we have seen fires burn out of control over the last couple of weeks and even longer.So, it all depends on the wind direction. It's all based on the weather pattern. We're in the stagnant weather pattern right now that's driving that smoke into portions of the Northeast, and the Mid- Atlantic. And so from this map, this is the near-surface smoke. The reds, the thicker smoke, and then the blues and greens will be the lighter smoke. So, you can see across New York City, even down into DC, this is Thursday morning, 10:30, that's where it's going to be really bad. Of course, across upstate New York as well. Really bad up in places like Toronto, Canada, the closer to the fire. So as we go into, say Thursday evening, Friday morning, it is going to improve for the New York City area and much of New England. Of course, it gets worse though for portions of the Ohio Valley and even pushing into the mid-Atlantic. So, it's really going to be this back and forth. The wind is driving where the smoke is going. So when it's really bad for someone, it's not going to be quite as bad for others. But this could be a long-term problem, Jim. That's what people need to realize is that as long as these fires are burning in Canada, as long as those winds are pulling down from the south --",
