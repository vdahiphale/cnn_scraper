It's wonderful to have you with us.Breaking news this morning, we have a brand new update just moments ago on Hurricane Milton, the storm weakening slightly overnight, now a major category four storm. It is expected to regain strength this morning, could hit land tomorrow evening. It has been less than two weeks since the Southeast was pummeled by Hurricane Helene, and Florida residents are battening down the hatches once again. Mass evacuations along the state's west coast are underway. Cities bracing for impact, distributing sandbags while still trying to remove debris left behind by Helene. Milton currently forecast to make landfall as a major hurricane near Tampa on Wednesday. The city's mayor urging residents to take this seriously. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, they're facing according to the words from the National Hurricane Center, from the 5Some weakening overnight, right? Category four, but we're splitting hairs here in terms of the potential impacts of this storm. It stayed north of the Yucatan Peninsula overnight, so spared the coastline there, still a powerful category four hurricane. And what's new here is that when you went to bed last night, these were still watches. Now we have warnings. These are hurricane warnings for much of the west central coastline. But notice it also extended tens inland as well. This is going to be a far-reaching storm that will make landfall late Wednesday into the day on Thursday. So this is going to be the most impactful time, could still be a major hurricane, likely will be. Also explicitly stated within the National Hurricane Center's 5:00 a.m. update. It's a compact storm now but it's going through what is called an eyewall replacement cycle. And what that means is that the wind field will grow in size. They state that it will grow to be double the size of what it is currently now. So impacts from this storm, especially hurricane and tropical storm force winds, will extend well outside the center. So that means the storm surge and the catastrophic wind potential will be felt well outside of the eye of the storm. And fact, we have extended this major hurricane wind field across much of the interior, including Tampa, Pinellas, and Hillsborough, Sarasota, even further south. And this is just incredible, 10 to 15 feet of surge potential well into Tampa Bay. Remember what Helene did, six to seven feet. So, if we get this kind of realized storm surge potential, there will be homes that will be underwater, especially near the coastline. Reiterating the timeframe here, this is late Wednesday into Thursday, even though we will start to feel the impacts from the storm through the course of the day on Wednesday, heavy rain inland flash flooding. This will take down trees, knocked down power and cause significant problems for the state of Florida -- Kasie.",

And now as Hurricane Milton is starting to make its way into Florida, and I think that one reason it is because of the devastation and destruction that Hurricane Helene left.But another fact of the matter is that it hits swing states. We're talking about places like Georgia, places like North Carolina, Florida, not a swing state, but a lot of Democrats would have, would have them tell you that they think they have possibility to make gains in that state this cycle. So the fact that its these three to three really key states that are so important to the election outcome that talking to voters in those states it's so key. I think that's also why the response to this storm is taking such an outsized focus on the national political stage, but especially a politicized focus, as you mentioned, as we get into this final stage of the election cycle.",
