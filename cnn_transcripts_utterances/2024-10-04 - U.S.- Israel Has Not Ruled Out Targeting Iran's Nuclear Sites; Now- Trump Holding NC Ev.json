A top State Department official telling CNN the Biden administration has been given no assurances from Israel that it will not target Iran's nuclear facilities, as concerns grow tonight that Israel could launch a devastating retaliatory strike against Iran any moment. Plus, warning of violence. President Biden tonight saying he's concerned that the upcoming election won't be peaceful. And playing nice. Former President Trump appearing next to the very popular governor that he wants called a bad, disloyal guy. What's he saying now? Let's go OUTFRONT And good Friday evening. I'm Erin Burnett live from Tel Aviv. And OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news: in the dark. CNN is learning tonight that the U.S. is in the dark as to whether Israel plans to strike Iran's nuclear facilities as a top U.S. State Department official tells CNN, quote, this is on the edge. That top official telling us exclusively that Israelis are so far keeping their plans to retaliate, which could happen at any moment extremely close to the vest, saying, quote, we hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength. But as you guys know, no guarantees. Well, Israel is at war and more strikes against Tehran could change the arc of history. I mean, these are many of Iran's known and most important nuclear sites, places where the country assembles and spin centrifuges, enriches nuclear weapons grade uranium, and stores that highly enriched uranium, often hundreds of feet under the ground, striking any of them could have massive and unstoppable consequences. And that is why President Biden has said publicly he does not support Israel targeting Iran's nuclear program. But today, he went even further than saying no nukes. He actually tried to take energy and oil off the table. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Jim, let me just start with you. When we talk about this imminent strike that. Israel is determining its targets and keeping very close to the vest even from its closest ally, there are a lot of strikes -- possible strikes that Israel could hit inside Iran, nuclear strike -- nuclear locations oil installations, the actual regime itself, which a lot of people in this country have been pounding the table saying this is our moment to behead the monster as they see it.

And by the way, that's deliberate because they don't want them all in one place because they don't want it easy to be taken out, their facilities to be taken out in one blow. Let's zero in on one of them in particular, Isfahan, khan this is anuclear research facility production facility. Isfahan, the central part of Iran, they produce uranium metal, key to the production of nuclear warheads, if Iran were to go that path, also centrifuge parts, what you need to produce the uranium -- enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon. What's notable about this is that in April, following Iran's last major missile barrage on Israel, when Israel did retaliate, it was Isfahan, not the nuclear site, but a air defense installation around Isfahan that was Israel's retaliation at that point. And that was deliberate because they were showing we can reach out and touch you there.",

I want to talk about one in particularly that is Kharg Island. Kharg is an oil export facility. This is where 90 percent of Iran's oil is exported through here. So this would be an enormous blow to what is Iran's number one source of revenue. Iran sends out about 3 percent of world's oil. That's 2 million barrels of oil a day. It's not the entire market to sliver of the market, but you know, oil markets well. If you take out that percentage, that's going to have an impact on oil prices. So, so certainly an impact on, on world oil markets, but also potentially the world economy, and the U.S. economy.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Erin, you have to look at the target package and Jim and I talked about this earlier today.What will Israel go after? There are a variety of target packages, you've named a couple. I would name a couple more about weapon construction facilities, places where they build ballistic missiles and even the drones that are becoming so prevalent. And not only the attacks on Israel, but also the sale of drones by Iran to Russia for the attacks on Ukraine. Would it be hurtful to Ukraine to not worry so much about the energy production facilities, but in fact a hit their main weapons facilities to places that build the weapons and that's why its think that the president said what he said today. You know, you can hit an energy facility, either oil or a nuclear power plant, or some of the other storage facilities that Iran has, but what would be more damaging in terms of Iranian potential in the future? Their two main proxy groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, have been very damaged. You know, you base -- the Israelis have basically destroyed Hamas. They've taken out 20, 25 of 27 battalions in the Gaza Strip. They're now going after Hezbollah. They know they have a lot of missiles there. They don't want the resupply of those weapons. So when you get back to your question was, what would the strike package look like? It depends. It depends on what they're going after. If its weapons facilities, those are strike fighters going in with a lot more than just aircraft that are dropping bombs, you have to have fuels, you have to have intelligence gathers, jammers and electronic warfare aircraft to pave the path for a bunch of fighters to go in and bomb the locations you're talking about. And depending on the target, if it's a soft target, if you will, like Jim said, Kharg Island, it's very easy to bomb a storage plant or a storage facility for oil, it's much tougher to strike some of the nuclear capabilities that Iran has had in the past because they are mostly deeply buried in the mountains and they are very well spread apart. It takes a much bigger package.",

She's giving them specific policies as to what she is going to be doing every single day during her administration to help middle-class families, working class families, as she always says, not just get by, but get ahead, to expand their economic opportunities in opportunity economy. And importantly, she's making the contrast with Donald Trump, who speaks a good game, but his record is a complete and total failure. I think it was very smart of her to point out those specifics in Michigan where six plants close auto-making plants closed while Donald Trump was president.

This has been the big impact of the switch from Biden to Harris is a short up the Democratic coalition and has given them good signs and a lot of the places that they were lagging. But I think it's a hard question to answer because this is the reality the of a 50-50 tied race, it is going to be about the execution of who gets their base out. And I would also say that the Harris base is composited of voters who vote more frequently, or we know more consistently, come to polling than I think the Trump base is. They're targeting more low propensity voters. They're targeting young men who don't oftentimes come out the same numbers as other groups. They're trying to target people who may only participate in presidential elections. And that's a little bit of a harder task than what the Harris what the Harris coalition looks like. So I think that's the reason why although we expect these battleground states to come down to one or two points, a lot of our modeling shows Harris having a slight advantage. It's just a make-up of the electorate that she is looking for. It's one that we know comes out most clearly. That's the impact of Trump losing out on the suburbs.
