So what's we're hearing is that the ceasefire has not held. And this heavy fighting heard earlier today in the capital Khartoum, and this is as countries scramble to get their citizens out, and the U.S. has actually said that it has got some citizens out via land, sea and aircraft means. Previously, we had reported that some American citizens had felt abandoned and stranded. But the U.S. reporting that some of them have now been evacuated safely. And Saudi Arabia also leading the evacuation efforts, some 1800 people arrived in Jeddah into Saudi Arabia early in the last hour, making over 4000 people who have been evacuated into Saudi Arabia. Nigeria also says it has evacuated its citizens. About 6 -- some 600 people have arrived at -- in Egypt, the border of Egypt to fly on to Nigeria. But this is as Sudanese people themselves are stranded. They -- some of them don't even have passports because consulates when they left, left their passport, their travel documents in those consulates when the personnel were evacuated. But we spoke to one woman who made a very, very perilous journey to the Egyptian border.  Take a listen to what she had to say. OK, so she talked about how this journey was very, very dangerous in boiling hot conditions, and for over several days in some instances. But what many Sudanese are saying and this looming humanitarian crisis is that they're worried that once foreign nationals have all been evacuated, that the world will forget about them, and they will be left to fend effectively for themselves. There's lack of water, food shortages, hospitals are not functioning at full capacity in many cases, and the Sudanese are asking where is the aid and then when we can assistants come to us? Amara.",

So they left but basically admin said they will be back, you know, I mean, we're right on the main road, they want to get onto our roof, because that's a great vantage point. So we literally just packed up a bag, went out the back door. I mean, they weren't there at the time, thank God, that we went out the back door and walked through dark streets, because basically the power is off.

And he's implying now that he believes that the leaker was likely someone who did not want Roe v. Wade overturned as it ultimately was when the Court issued its five, four decision at the end of June. Justice Alito also seeming to be throwing cold water on this theorythat's been floated that a conservative justice or someone linked to the conservative side leaked that draft to lock in the votes to overturn Roe. Justice Alito is telling the Wall Street Journal this about that theory saying that's infuriating to me. Look, this made us targets of assassination. Would I do that to myself with the five of us have done that to ourselves? It's quite implausible. So this was really an extensive interview from Justice Alito, to the Wall Street Journal that was conducted just a few weeks ago in mid- April. Justice Alito also talks about how the leak itself really created this atmosphere of suspicion and distrust within the court. And even talked about how each justice now has 24/7 protection because of the threats they've been facing. Justice Alito talking about how he's basically driven around in what he calls a tank for security reasons. Justice Alito, also lamenting about the attacks on the court's legitimacy saying that this type of concerted attack on the court, and on individual justices is new during my lifetime. We were being hammered daily, and I think quite unfairly in a lot of instances. And nobody, practically nobody is defending us. Justice Alito, also talking about the barrage of criticism and how it's really undermining confidence in government as a whole, not just at the Supreme Court. This really is the first time Justice Alito has spoken out so extensively about the league and it comes as the court is just a few weeks away from issuing even more consequential decisions on issues like affirmative action and gay rights.

Damaging winds, large hail and the potential for a few tornadoes and even some waterspouts right there along the coastal regions are still going to be a possibility. It's two separate waves. We've got that first wave that you saw that cluster of storms over the Gulf of Mexico, those are going to slide across Florida first, then you have a secondary way that such a push in late this evening and continue into the overnight hours before finally exiting the area by the middle of the day on Sunday. To the north, this is where we also have rain in some pretty heavy rain across areas of the Northeast, specifically New York as well as portions of Pennsylvania where we could pick up several inches of rain.

ELANA REDFIELD, FEDERAL POLICY DIRECTOR, UCLA LAW SCHOOL'S WILLIAMS INSTITUTE: Oh, thank you, Victor. That's a great question. Because actually, there's a lot of misinformation about what kinds of care trans-youth might receive. And for very young kids, it's often really just affirmation of their gender.

The framing of the bills, as you pointed out, a lot of them have titles like save our children or protecting youth. The framing of these bills is really misleading. It's a red herring, because this care is best practice medical care. It's endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, it's widely accepted care. There are decades of research and science behind this care showing how important and effective it is.So it's really misleading when they categorize it as protecting young people, it's actually causing them great harm. And with the case of Missouri, and Missouri is kind of leading this, but there are other states where this is at risk as well. They are using that same kind of argument to say that adults shouldn't have access to the care or that it should be extremely limited or restricted. So that is equally inconsistent with the medicine, the medicine actually strongly supports access to the care.",
