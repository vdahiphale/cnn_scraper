The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the group dedicated to electing Democrats in state legislatures, is actually on what they're calling \"insurrection watch\" releasing a new initiative today looking at the critical role that America's state lawmakers play in safeguarding our elections. The DLCC says that \"Trump used state legislators to push his virulent lies and attempted to overturn the election results, both leading up to and after Election Day. GOP legislators colluded with those seeking to disrupt election certification, meeting with them ahead of riots and aiding their entry into capitols.\" Trump continuing to sow doubt in the election as recently as yesterday.

It's going to be a lot harder for them to do bad things. So we're going to see. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

LeBron and Bronny checking in together, becoming the first-ever father-son duo to play together in the NBA. They got a standing ovation from the crowd. The family there to see it happen.And moments later, LeBron here -- the pass to Bronny. He puts up the three, but it was no good. Now, Bronny didn't score in his three minutes on the court. LeBron finished with 16. And here was dad afterwards on the historic night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) L. JAMES:  It's family. It's always about family over everything. And, you know, for me, I lost a lot of time because of this league -- the commitment to this league -- being on the road at times and missing a lot of his things, and Bryce's things, and Zhuri's things. So to be able to have this moment where I'm working still and I can work alongside my son is one of the greatest gifts I've ever got from the man above and I'm going to take full advantage of it. B. JAMES:  Just going up to that scorer's table with my dad and checking in for the first time, that's a crazy moment I will never forget. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And before the game, LeBron and Bronny taking a picture with Ken Griffey Jr. and his dad on the court. The Griffeys the first-ever father-son duo to play together in baseball. They were there for the historic night.As for the game, Anthony Davis -- he was dominant and he scored 36 points and grabbed 16 rebounds. JJ Reddick wins his Lakers' coaching debut as they beat the T-wolves 110-103. The Celtics, meanwhile, raising their record 18th championship banner at TD Garden. They also got their rings during the pregame ceremony. Jayson Tatum then told the crowd they're going to do it again. And during and after the Olympics, you know, the story was Tatum not getting to play. Well, he looked like a man on a mission in this one. He poured in 37 points and dished out 10 assists. Eight for 11 from three-point range. The Celtics -- they actually made an NBA record 29 threes in this game, and they reached that mark with nine minutes to go. The crowd was then chanting \"One more three!\" to set the record. But get this -- the Celtics -- they then missed 13 straight. It was still a great night there in Boston though. They walloped the Knicks 132-109. But Kasie, I don't think I ever heard of the fans chant \"One more three!\" in a game, but the Celtics fans -- they were having a grand old time. As I said, they beat the Knicks pretty easily in that one. And they couldn't miss early and then couldn't make anything late. It was kind of funny.",
