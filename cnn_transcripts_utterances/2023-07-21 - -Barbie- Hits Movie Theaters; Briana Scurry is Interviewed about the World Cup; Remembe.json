You want to come into that first game and literally blow the doors off the opponent and also make a statement in your group and throughout the tournament that shows that the USA is ready to go.

I had the honor of meeting him when he turned 90 and performed in New York at the Rainbow Room. We don't know the circumstances of his death, but we know that he had been battling Alzheimer's for the past several years. His wife, Susan Bennett, she actually told \"AARP Magazine\" in 2021 that despite the Alzheimer's, he was continuing to perform, put out music. You know, obviously, we know that he toured and put out albums with Lady Gaga. I've reached out to her and I'm sure that this is obviously a devastating loss for her. They were just so close. But his career spanned decades from the early 1950s. And Frank Sinatra is someone who touted him as one of the greatest voices of a generation. And so I, you know, meeting Tony Bennett, there's just nothing like - like it. And he was so charismatic, so kind and just, obviously, so talented. And so it's a very sad day for everyone who had the pleasure of meeting him, knowing him or just loving his music to know that he has passed at his home in New York at the age of 96.",
