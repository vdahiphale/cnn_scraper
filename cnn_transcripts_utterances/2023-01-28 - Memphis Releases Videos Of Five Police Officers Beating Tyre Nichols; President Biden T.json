These saturation units, these suppression units, which I more aptly call oppression units, they are amped up, geared up officers who literally, because they're named Scorpion, they want to go in for the sting, and that's what they did. So when Tyre became uncooperative, in their eyes, which I say he was always cooperative, indeed, he was the one who was deescalating and cooperating with them. When they felt that he was not being cooperative, it was the how dare you, and that's when everything escalated. You saw, it went from a zero to a 10 in one second. There was nothing in between.",

He noted that he shares in the outrage that many people in this country are feeling at this moment.Now throughout the course of the past few days, the president has also been urging that people engage in peaceful protests after that video was released. He had top White House officials including his Homeland Security adviser speaking with mayors from across the country to talk about the federal response and preparations for the release of this video, and in his statement, the president also talked about the way to change and prevent incidents like this from happening again is through meaningful reform. Of course, he noted that he supported that George Floyd policing bill that really has floundered up on Capitol Hill, and the White House has so far said it is up to Congress to figure out a way to act on this. But the president has been speaking in very personal terms about this over the course of the past few days.",

So now it is my opinion that it rests with my colleagues and I from a legislative standpoint to put things in place to try to prevent things like this from happening again.I think that the actions of those two probably help diffuse this situation because things could have been a whole lot worse if we compare this timeline to what's taking place in other parts of the country when we've had similar incidents like this. But the swift action of both of those individuals I think helped calm the concerns of the community. Now it's up to the council to act. What I hope that we can do going forward is listen to our community because I don't have the answers for law enforcement. That's not my wheelhouse.

If it's necessary to have units like that, let's do it, but they need to have their mandates and operate within those particular guidelines because in this instance, they clearly did not.

And that's certainly the message that he's trying to convey here in Columbia, South Carolina.I'm surrounded by both state legislatures and supporters of the former president who are standing behind his third presidential campaign. There are a number of Trump advisers who, over the past several months, specifically since his launched his campaign in November, have raised questions about whether his heart is truly in it. He has not been seen on the campaign trail until today. This is now two and a half months after he first announced his campaign last November. So him saying that in New Hampshire, I think, was really meant to address those concerns head on. Now, he's planning to, again, back up that message today by rolling out endorsements from a number of state legislators here in South Carolina. He also has been endorsed by the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster. But we are just across the hallway from the State House chamber, and there are still a number of Republicans in that chamber who have been wary to get behind Trump's third presidential campaign as they wait to see who else gets into this race. One of those individuals is, of course, the former governor of this state, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who has, in recent days, suggested that she's interested in launching a 2024 campaign of her own. And we just learned that Trump told reporters on his flight here to South Carolina that he had spoken with former Governor Nikki Haley in recent days as she informed him of her interest in potentially challenging him for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump said that he told Haley to go by her heart, and he even encouraged her to proceed with a presidential campaign against him. Of course, we will see how that plays out, if she does decide to take that step. A lot of legislators are looking at Nikki Haley, but also South Carolina Senator Tim Scott to see if he also moves forward with a presidential campaign. Trump also made a bit of news on that flight to South Carolina, weighing in on the body camera footage that was released on the beating of Tyre Nichols, saying he had watched it and it was terrible. Again, the former president is currently en route to South Carolina where he will unveil his leadership team for the state and also roll out a number of endorsements. This is really his first campaign event where he is trying to show strong support in a state that he won by 10 percentage points in 2016 -- Jim?",
