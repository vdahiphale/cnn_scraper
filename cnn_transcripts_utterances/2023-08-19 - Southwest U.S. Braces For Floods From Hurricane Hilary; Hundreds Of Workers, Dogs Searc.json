The most vulnerable, of course, were of concern; even those in hospitals and long- term care, had to be evacuated. We had an update from federal officials.

While most of the people were able to leave by road, the fire threatening that community was, at this point, so critical, at such a dire stage, that they decided the entire city had to be evacuated.

Right now, it's our understanding that Trump is likely to do his surrender toward the back half of the week. Here's what's going to happen when he goes to surrender. He is going to surrender to the Fulton County sheriff's office. And this process typically involves a mug shot and fingerprints. The mug shot is important, because, at the federal level, they did not take a mug shot of the former president because they said we use those. They don't release them but they use them for law enforcement if someone goes on the lam. Trump is one of the most recognizable people on the world. They don't really need a mug shot for that. And it's unclear if Fulton County is also going to make that kind of exception. Another big difference between the state and federal appearances here is that he's going to be processed next week. Then, a judge will schedule a court hearing. At the federal level, all of this happened on the same day.

The Netherlands also on board with that. Remember, it was European allies of Ukraine that would be doing the training in Europe. And after that, the Americans would assist in the supply of jets to Ukraine. It's a complex situation here because the Americans had to sign off on the training equipment and simulators. All that paperwork appears to be dealt with now. And they're moving forward. But it's going to take months. These are complex pieces of equipment that require numbers of English speaking Ukrainian pilots to be taken to foreign countries. Once they're in play, a lot of servicing day-by- day to keep them in the air. So it's always a significantly ambitious project, by NATO, frankly, to provide this air capability to Ukraine. But it's urgently needed now. There are Ukrainian troops dying daily on the southern front because of Russian air superiority and half metric ton bombs they're indeed dropping on civilians there. And so, it's an exceptionally important part of Ukraine's potential future arsenal. But it will not be arriving this year. At the same time, there's been some criticism by Western officials that there's been such an acute focus on Crimea by Ukrainian targeted strikes. The suggestion, I think, perhaps, being they should focus more on the southern counter offensive. But I think it's fair to say that possibly reflects concerns amongst Western officials that this might be a red button, a kind of a dark line for Vladimir Putin, that he's deeply worried about losing the Crimea and they might be concerned at how the Kremlin would react. Indeed, that did happen, a farfetched idea, frankly, at the moment. I think many Ukrainians would say, well, the things we are hitting in Crimea are vital infrastructure for that southern counteroffensive front. Bridges, railways, ammo depots that assist the large bulk of military assets there to be brought to the southern lines around Zaporizhzhya to help Russia's defense against the Ukrainian counteroffensive. I think a muddled message there, frankly, from Western officials. Yes, I think they're worried about what Vladimir Putin might do if he thought he might lose Crimea. That's farfetched at the moment. And certainly, I think Ukrainians would argue what they are doing to Crimea is impacting Russia's ability to defend on the southern front -- Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine.

This is, of course, the rise of China, the perceived aggression bysome of China, some might call it an assertive China but certainly a China that is posing new challenges on the economic front, on the military front when you're talking about concerns for the self ruling democracy of Taiwan. And then, of course, you have North Korea, which has been in the headlines as of late for a barrage of ballistic missile tests. Of course, concern that they could take that further in terms of military cooperation with the Russians. Because, remember, it was the Russian defense minister in North Korea just last month, meeting with Kim Jong-un, talking about deepening their military cooperation. Kim Jong-un giving a tour of his new ICBMs. He showed drones that analysts have said closely resemble United States' military drones. And then China, with all of its economic support for North Korea, allowing trade to move back and forth across the border, sending their own high level delegation to Pyongyang last month to celebrate North Korea's armistice day. This authoritarian bloc, North Korea, Russia, China and their increased cooperation is very troubling to the United States and, of course, vice versa as well. China's foreign ministry putting out a statement talking about that, saying, and I quote here, \"Attempts to cobble together various exclusionary groupings and bring bloc confrontation and military blocs into the Asia Pacific are not going to get support and will only be met with vigilance and opposition from regional countries.\" That is from the spokesperson in Beijing. There has been a flurry of military activity, when we're talking about Russia and China. Warships conducting joint patrol in the East China Sea. You have North Korea scrambling fighter jets. North Korea in particular is concerned about upcoming military drills between the United States and South Korea. The North has always said that they consider those a dress reversal for an invasion. And you even had Japan strangling fighter jets after seeing Russian information gathering planes. So a lot of military activity at a very tense and troubling time in that part of the world -- Will Ripley, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

England, facing off against Spain, for both sides a first ever Women's World Cup final. The England captain Millie Bright, in a press conference just behind us a couple hours ago, saying her (sic) and her team need to play the game of their lives. They're up against a side that is widely regarded as being one of the most talented teams of individual players. We've seen so much from them over the last couple of weeks.

England beating Spain on extra time to progress, as they, of course, became European champions. It is the first time in 16 years the United States hasn't been in the final of the Women's World Cup.
