Just 22 days from election day, CNN's latest poll of polls shows Democrats and Republicans in a dead heat for control of the House of Representatives. Early voting kicked off today in the critical swing state of Georgia. Democratic Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock hit the polls this morning to cast his ballot. Warnock is attempting to fend off a challenge from embattled Republican nominee and football legend Herschel Walker. Walker today acknowledged for the first time that he did indeed send a $700 check to a woman who alleged the money was provided to reimburse her for an abortion. Walker denies he sent the check for that purpose. Walker is also defending his use of an honorary sheriff's badge which he flashed at a debate on Friday night with Warnock. Voters wouldn't get another chance to see the candidates face off again before Election Day. As CNN's Eva McKend reports, turnout in Georgia is expected to top previous midterm records because the ballot there, as in so many other states, features a full slate of heated races.

And the notion of a purple state is if you really look at the specifics and where most people are in this incredibly complicated, incredibly personal question, it is somewhere generally somewhere in the middle, which is that there should be liberties and abilities for women to do -- to have an abortion, but not necessarily unlimited when it comes to the viability of that pregnancy.

With just 22 days to go until the November midterm elections, President Biden is touting the launch of the application process for his plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 a year. The administration says 8 million Americans have already signed up since the website went live on Friday.Joining us now is Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Senator, thank you so much for being with us. Obviously, this will have an impact on people's lives. But a new \"New York Times\"/Siena poll shows that a top issue for Americans right now: the economy and inflation. Some economists have said that this student loan forgiveness plan could make inflation worse. Can you definitively say it won't? SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  Yes. Actually, there have been a lot of studies around this and what they've shown is that it's not going to have an impact on inflation. In fact, way I think about this is this is a key difference between the Republicans and the Democrats. The Republicans scream about inflation and have absolutely zero plans to do anything about costs that actually come to families. Democrats say, we've actually got some plans here and we are doing some really important things to move the needle, like we are reducing student loan debt for 43 million Americans. Like we are reducing the cost of insulin for millions of Americans. We are making sure that we're going to have negotiation of prescription drug prices. We're reducing the cost of utilities.

I want to read you a tweet from the former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, who wrote, quote, so it's okay for Iran to provide Russia with long range weapons but not okay for NATO to provide Ukraine with weapons of similar ranges. What is your view of that? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  My view, John, is that NATO and the United States should definitely provide Ukraine with the long range weapons they need to fight back, to hit back at targets, Russian targets in Ukraine that are firing these kinds of weapons at them. Ambassador McFaul is exactly right. The Russians show no restraint and if we show restraint, that is a mistake. We should be providing the Ukrainians with every ability they need to fight back, to attack back, and to defend them themselves -- defend themselves against the drones that are coming in. So that is very important that we provide these weapons to them and right now.",

TAYLOR:  So the Russians are trying to pull other nations in. But even nations like Belarus are not eager to get involved. They know that the sanctions, the penalties, the payments, the pain that they will face if they join this battle. So, President Lukashenko of Belarus has not been eager to join. President Putin is leaning on him to provide these kind of weapons and support. Lukashenko knows that Belarusian people do not want to join this fight. There are no nations, when you think about the U.N. look at the vote there. Nations vote against the Russians, the nations of world have voted overwhelmingly, 143-5, to condemn the Russian attack.
