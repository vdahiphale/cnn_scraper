Both men are turning up the heat on each other in the wake of Super Tuesday.

One thing Trump doesn't have to worry about any longer is rival Nikki Haley, who formally suspended her presidential bid on Wednesday. She told supporters she wants Americans to have their voices heard and she has no regrets. Haley did not endorse Donald Trump, but she didn't attack him either. She simply said it's his turn to convince voters he is the right man for the job.

They used to be given always in January, occasionally early February. But this is helpful to Biden because it is closer to the election. Stylistically, he's got to show energy. He has got to dispel some of what he would say is false impression about age. And he can do that. He's certainly done a good job before, as he did last year. He's really shown in that State of the Union address partly by responding spontaneously to Republican catcalls. He's been around politics a long time, and he knows how to do that. As do British politicians. So the style is important. And he certainly has to focus on issues that really matter to people in their lives. That's the substance of it. He certainly doesn't want to get into attacks on Donald Trump. He can make contrasts with the Republican Party. That's easy enough to do. I'm sure he will focus on immigration, reminding the audience, which is quite large, the largest he'll have until he's inaugurated again. If he gets that second inauguration, he needs to remind people that he did have a solution, a bipartisan solution too much of the immigration problem. And one person who happens to be his opponent now and was his opponent in 2020 made a telephone call to Republicans in Congress, and instantly the solution died.

She said so many negative things about Trump. And the answer is we live in a very partisan, polarized era. And so people gradually return to the house of their mothers and fathers, the party I.D. that maybe they grew up with or adopted in college or shortly thereafter. It changes for some people, but it doesn't change for most people. What people claim they're going to do in March about their vote in October or November, frequently they don't follow through on that. They change their minds. They don't recognize that now, but they will toward the end. So Haley herself, I don't know whether she'll end up endorsing Trump. If she has a political future in the Republican Party, she'll probably have to. And I must say, all of the Republicans, many of whom should know better, end up caving.

CNN's coverage gets underway at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, 1 a.m. in London.There is new urgency for a ceasefire in Gaza as people are starving to death. Hamas said on Wednesday it will continue participating in negotiations to reach a ceasefire. The militant group accused Israel of evading the obligations of the agreement being discussed. Ceasefire and hostage talks were among the topics discussed when an Israeli war cabinet minister met with senior British officials in London on Wednesday. Israeli Minister Benny Gantz thanked the U.K. for its efforts to secure the release of hostages. He also defended Israel's strategy to root out Hamas. He says Israel's actions in Gaza follow international law. The U.K. is among the many countries calling on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis and rising hunger in the besieged enclave. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron says he made clear the steps Israel needs to take to get the aid flowing, saying, quote, \"we are still not seeing improvements on the ground. This must change\". U.S. Central Command says it conducted strikes on two drones in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen because they presented an imminent threat to U.S. Navy ships and merchant vessels in the region. The strikes came hours after Houthi missiles killed three crew members on a commercial ship in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday. We are learning the two of them were Filipino. According to U.S. officials, these are the first deaths since the Iran-backed Houthis began their missile attacks in response to Israel's war in Gaza. U.S. Central Command says it was the fifth anti- ship ballistic missile fired by Houthis in the past two days. One attack struck and damaged a Swiss-owned container ship in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. For more on this, we turn to CNN's Scott McLean, who joins us live from Istanbul in Turkey. So, Scott, what more are you learning about this deadly attack?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, so David Cameron, the U.S. foreign secretary, says that this was a tough but necessary message for the Israelis to hear. Benny Gantz is a member of the Israeli War Cabinet, also Netanyahu's chief political rival.And this message was about pressuring Israel into providing more aid, opening up more aid corridors, and also getting to a humanitarian pause, and also about Israel's international obligations. And I want to read you what the statement from David Cameron said afterwards, said, quote, \"as the occupying power of Gaza, Israel has the legal responsibility to ensure aid is available for civilians. That responsibility has consequences, including when we as the U.K. assess whether Israel is compliant with international humanitarian law\". So this is clearly raising questions about Israel's compliance with international law. This is seemingly contrasting, though, with the message from Benny Gantz' National Unity Party after the meeting. Gantz leads that party, by the way, which said, Gantz also noted in the meetings Israel's commitment to complete the just and necessary goal of removing the threat of Hamas and ending its rule in the Strip, while its actions are carried out in accordance with international law. It's important to note, though, Rosemary, that back in January, David Cameron said that he was worried that Israel had breached international law and said that the advice he had gotten at the time is that they were compliant, but that there were serious questions that still were outstanding. Last month, he said that Israel must follow international law not only on the battlefield, but also when it comes to providing civilians enough food and water. And if they don't, that is a breach. He also said just this week that they are now at the point in Gaza of famine and preventable disease and that people are dying of hunger. So he's not explicitly saying that Israel has broken international law, but we can read between the lines of what he's saying. This is one more tactic, it seems, by the U.K. to try to pile some pressure on the Israelis to do more to help people in Gaza. But it is still an open question whether Israel is going to listen.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the U.S. of suppressing China to, quote, \"bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity\", unquote.Wang added that China also opposes all acts of bullying. Now this happened during questions that were vetted with reporters at the National People's Congress, the annual political gathering is taking place this week in Beijing. And Wang made his comments when asked about the US-China relationship. He called for mutual respect. He acknowledged that, yes, there have been some improvement in relations since recent summits, including the APEC summit in San Francisco. And he also said this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG YI, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): But it has to be pointed out that U.S. misperception toward China continues, and U.S. promises are not truly fulfilled. The U.S. has been devising various tactics to suppress China and kept lengthening its unilateral sanctions list, reaching bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And really, to no surprise, it was 1.77 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.And in fact, there were some days at the beginning of February that were more than two degrees C above normal globally. Again, we're talking land and sea and all that. And look at this. This is the warmest sea surface temperatures we have ever experienced here. Look how big of a gap that is, too. It's 0.2 degrees higher than any time we've ever seen that we've been measuring ocean surface temperatures. Something that's disturbing for the Atlantic hurricane season is this big red area here, the warmest on record for this time of year for that eastern part of the Atlantic. It is so warm that there was a very rare tropical system that moved into Brazil over their summertime, of course, but still very rare for that to happen. Moving farther on down to the south, because we know it was a southern hemisphere summer, we did have a near record for Antarctic sea ice, a near record low, but not quite, still about the third lowest. But look how close that was to the bottom of this scale. So not much ice down there either. And now with sunshine, the northern hemisphere is starting to heat up as well. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
