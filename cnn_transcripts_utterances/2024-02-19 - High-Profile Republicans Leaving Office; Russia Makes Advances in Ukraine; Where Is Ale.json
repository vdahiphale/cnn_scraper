Both times, though, they were turned away, told they will not see it for another two weeks. Navalny's widow alleges the delay as part of a deliberate cover-up. She says they are trying to let poison flush out of his system. Remember, it's widely believed that Vladimir Putin had Russian agents attempt to kill Navalny in 2020 by hiding a Soviet era poison in his underwear. Listen to her message. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, WIDOW OF ALEXEI NAVALNY (through translator):  In a cowardly way, they're hiding his body, not showing to his mother, not giving to his mother. They're lying and they're waiting for the traces of another of Putin's Novichok to disappear. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

At the same time, Russian troops are advancing in Ukraine, taking a key eastern town after months of fighting there. With ammo and supplies running low for Kyiv, mostly crickets from the House of Representatives. After the Senate passed a foreign aid deal to bring $60 billion in aid to Ukraine, lawmakers are on vacation, with Speaker Mike Johnson casting doubt on whether he's even going to bring that bill to the floor. Let's take you now live to CNN's Melissa Bell, who's been tracking this. Melissa, not surprisingly, it sounds like Navalny's family is running into several roadblocks in their search for answers.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, it really functions on two separate levels here.Avdiivka in the east is a place that Ukraine has been fighting to hold on to since Russia first invaded 10 years ago, but the fight has intensified in recent months as it became the focus of Russia's often very brutal tactics, sending thousands of their troops often to their death to try and retake a town of minor, moderate, significant strategic importance. Now, clearly, it fell over the weekend when Ukraine withdrew its forces, much telegraphed as a potential choice that Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, would indeed have to make. But it cut in two in the middle of the Munich Security Conference, where again Ukraine was trying to make a pitch to the United States to somehow get through that congressional dysfunctionality in the Republican-led Congress to get that $60 billion moving. So, to Ukrainians still waiting for that aid, seeing how the lack of that aid translates into no ammunition the front lines, really slows down all the Western support chains that have kept Ukraine in the fight here. The fall of Avdiivka potentially marks the beginning of something wider and more significant. Because it isn't just Avdiivka where they're under pressure, and we're now seeing potentially signs that the areas around Avdiivka, Russia might be trying to push forward as well to the north around Kharkiv in Kupiansk, a town which was retaken by Ukraine just two years ago at the end of 2022. President Zelenskyy was there trying to shore up support for the troops, tell them to fight on, because there are deep concerns that is the next place where Russia is going to push forward. Remember, the focus was Avdiivka. Now they have it, they can move those troops elsewhere. Also, in the south, not far from where I am, near Zaporizhzhia, a key village called Robotyne there that was really one of the major gains, or the only gains, of the southern counteroffensive in the summer, which had been much funded by NATO and the West, well, that seems to be under Russian pressure too. And then Vuhledar to the south of Avdiivka, and also areas around Bakhmut, another town Russia threw everything out to retake in May of last year, these are also under pressure as well. And so I think there's something here where Ukraine is trying to point out to the west that this shortage of ammunition on the front lines is acute and means something other than the political gains that Vice President Kamala Harris referred to in Munich. People are losing their lives because of it. I should point out, here we are in Kherson in the south. The lights are off across the city because people are worried about Russian drones and strikes on any light source that they see. So, for daily Ukrainians, this is a case of a loss of life, a loss of a relative, a loss of a friend fighting on the front lines. And that is being accentuated as a fear now because of this slowdown or possible disappearance of American aid money, very real consequences here, certainly.",

Zelenskyy said that, in the fight for Avdiivka, for every dead Ukrainian, there were seven dead Russians, he claimed. We have no separate evidence to that effect, but it's certainly borne out as an idea by the videos we have of relentless waves, sometimes of Russian convicts who are paid to go to the front line and used in full frontal assaults by the Russians. But Russia's managed to get its military industrial complex running again. It's getting shells from even allies as dark as North Korea to try and keep its artillery functioning, while Ukrainian guns are falling silent because of a shortage of that. So, yes, Putin is seeing both his machine getting back on its feet again and the Ukrainians running out of money on their side and their morale slowly chipped away by this extraordinary paralysis in Washington.",

PETER ZWACK (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Brianna, the -- Avdiivka has been -- Avdiivka has been part of the Ukrainian fight since 2014, when the first Russian invasion occurred. I was in Moscow at the time, and we were all tracking this very closely. They bigger battles around Donetsk, the Russians were pushing into the Donbass. And the Ukrainians -- and were able to maintain a line with Avdiivka in holding half of Donetsk and Luhansk. Now, 10 years later, the Russians, for the last nine months, especially after the fall of Bakhmut -- think of Verdun when you think of these places -- are going all out for Avdiivka. And the Ukrainians have fought hard, as they have in Bakhmut. They're taking heavily -- heavy losses. They are inflicting terrible losses on the Russians. But the pressure is heavy. It's increasingly across the front, less ammunition for all-important artillery and less air defense. And the Ukrainian defense is straining and creaking. And Avdiivka is not going to be the end of the defense by being taken. It's important, but not critical. But, at the same point, it is a prestige victory, especially for Putin, as was Bakhmut and as was Mariupol, if we all remember a year ago.",

The funds are there. If they shift them around or do a supplemental, I believe that it can be done. The urgency of supporting Ukraine at this time is -- I mean, we're all seeing it with the fall of Avdiivka and the increasing Russian pressure, the increasing confidence, seemingly, with Putin. And this is to our national interest, and that needs to be pulled and sold to our U.S. public of all stripes. Again, the military, we need the barracks, we need the training and all that, and I believe that we can balance it.

She's the chair of Energy and Commerce. The veteran lawmakers are among nearly a dozen Republicans leaving the chamber.

Look, there are plenty of years when more Republicans retire, a lot of Republicans, and years which a lot of Democrats retire, but the fact that you're getting a bunch on both sides, that is what's so historically unusual here. In fact, I went back over the last 20 years or so and looked back to see, OK, at this point in Congresses, was there at least 23 folks leaving on both sides of the aisle? Boris, this is the first time it has happened this early since at least 2006.
