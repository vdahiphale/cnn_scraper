Alisyn, great to see you both. So excited, thrilled, relieved, if I may. That last 10 minutes yesterday was a nail-biter, right? So excited for the men. They have worked so very hard. And I think I'm going to put my money on Pulisic being available. Wild horses could not keep him away from this game.

I also want to say thank you to my former teammate, Cindy Pawlow Cone, who is the current president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and all her success getting everybody on board with this. This indicates to me, and to everyone, should indicate how business the disparity is that FIFA has made between their value of women's soccer and men's soccer.

I think, within every federation around the world, especially ones that the women's team are bringing great visibility to the game, such as England and France, where -- and Germany where the women's teams are doing incredibly well.

John, is TikTok a national security threat? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, it depends. It depends on the idea that TikTok is a legitimate company that operates in China. But the difference between China and a lot of places, particularly the United States is, you can't separate the company from the government. TikTok is gathering lots of information about Americans -- I.P. addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, names. That's what you give them. But then what you don't see in the background is they're vacuuming up what computers are using, what do you like, what do you don't like, what are your choices?

They need to face that extraordinarily serious charge. Seditious conspiracy, nobody was convicted of that since 1995. I think it's only been attempted two or three times. Those people are going to be facing serious time. That's going to have a real chilling effect in that right-wing extremism area. And yet, at the same time, while that should be the chilling effect, we have, you know, Donald Trump, a presidential candidate and former president, dining with an avowed white supremacist, anti-Semite and racist at Mar-a-Lago.

But it was a suspect who was dedicated to killing as many police officers as possible and they weren't going to put any more human targets in front of them. It was a very unique approach. But there are many uses for robots in terms of reconnaissance and barricade and hostage situations. That was the first lethal use. But think of it in the suicide bomber context.
