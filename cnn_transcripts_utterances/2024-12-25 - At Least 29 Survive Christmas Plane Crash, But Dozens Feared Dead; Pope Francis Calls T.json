Merry Christmas, everyone.We are following breaking news this morning out of Central Asia that we want to get to first. At least 29 people have survived a Christmas morning plane crash, though many more are feared dead, 67 passengers and crew members were on board the plane. A warning some of the video we're going to show you may -- you might find disturbing this morning. It was taken by a witness on the scene who saw first responders and civilians rushing to help survivors get to safety. You can see the plane. It appears to split in -- be split in half. Many of the survivors appeared truly dazed and all of them, those who survived were taken to the hospital. The Azerbaijan Airlines flight went down near a coastal city in Kazakhstan. Joining us right now is CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector, David Soucie. David, thank you so much for jumping on this morning. Really amazing and terrifying images coming out of this. Some of the video that has been seen shows the plane, you know, erratically the airfield before it crashed. And then as it hit the ground, the aircraft bursting into flames. And now we see this video, you know, as rescue workers are trying to make it there almost immediately, we're told. What do you see in this video?",

That we do see that not only was the aircraft going up and down, but it's going left and right. There's total loss of control as far as how he tried to land the aircraft. But on the scene, the miraculous survival of 22 people is just amazing that that happened.But you can see that the reason that happened is the initial impact site. The aircraft was nose down and caused that initial impact to happen. That's where the engines and everything burst on fire. Now, the tail of the aircraft broke loose and that moved far away from the initial impact site. It continued to travel and that absorbs the energy that's going on with the aircraft. So that's why there were so many survivors, apparently from that tail section. And that's what they're working that -- with there as far as getting them out and trying to see what happened to the aircraft.",

But if we look back at other accidents where there have been survivors, such as the Sioux City accident, Richard could tell us more about that, actually, because Richard was there at the site on that one. But in that case, most all of the survivors were in the tail section of the aircraft. The reason that happens is because, as I was mentioning before, the first initial impact is wings forward. And when that happens, the tail of the engine, the tail of the aircraft, most of that energy is absorbed by that initial impact and the tail of the aircraft breaks loose. And then you can see it's far away from any fire or any other dangers with the aircraft on the impact. So primarily that's how they survive is after that energy absorbed by the front part of the aircraft.",

And that coming, of course, in response to President Joe Biden commuting the sentence of 37 of 40 people currently on death row and instead giving them life sentences instead of the death penalty.And -- and I should point out that Biden in his statement specifically said that part of his -- his reasoning behind this was because he didn't want his next -- the next administration to come in and continue the exec -- executions that he paused. Donald Trump, though, has long been someone who believed in law and order, as he said, and he was one of someone who aggressively pursued executions during his first term as president and now Kate promising to do that once again.

There are court decisions that say rapists cannot be sent to the death penalty without also being found guilty of murder, for example.So if Donald Trump wants to give rapists the death penalty, then he's going to have to get a change in law or he's going to face court challenges.

And the death penalty in general is so expensive and time consuming to, you know, actually finish a sentence that it really is not that critical a lever, any criminologist will tell you.

      "sentences": "Well, thank you. Well, look, you know, I think we forget how many institutional constraints Donald Trump faced when he arrived in 2017. He had Republican leadership in the House and the Senate in Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, who were very dubious of him at that point. There was only a 4 to 4 Supreme Court with Anthony Kennedy as an unreliable vote from a conservative perspective. Business leaders kept their distance from him. The media, I think, was more, you know, kind of in a -- in a more aggressive posture of -- of oversight.And most of those restraints are -- are reduced this time. And -- and I should have added that he was forced, really, because of his position within the Republican Party, to appoint a lot officials, senior officials who are not really part of his MAGA movement. And they ultimately said no to many of the polarized pushback on many of the most polarizing things that he wanted to do, like, you know, according to Mark Esper, use the National Guard to shoot racial justice protesters or seize -- use the military to seize voting machines or launch unilateral military strikes against Mexico without permission of the Mexican government. All of those restraints are weaker this time. He is kind of constrained by a narrower House majority that can produce rebellions from the right on occasion, like we saw during the budget fight, you know, the -- the other day. But by and large, the kind of people who said no to many of Trump unbound -- Trump's unbound impulses are not going to be in the room this time. So what you are going to see, I think, is, you know, even more of these secondary firefights. He was elected in part because he kept his focus overwhelmingly on two issues, you know, cutting your costs and gaining control of the border. And what we have seen in this transition, I think the unifying theme of the transition from Matt Gaetz to Panama to the debt ceiling is that, you know, Trump's impulsiveness is just undiminished, and his ability to keep his presidency focused on any central theme, I think is going to be very challenging, especially without the internal regulators that were there the first time.",

The very crass political answer is Democrats benefit in the long run from Trump's stronger position, because Trump always goes too far when he is uninhibited. However, he is going to break things that are very hard to fix, and he is going to hurt people who are very vulnerable, whom my fellow Democrats and I are in the business to protect.
