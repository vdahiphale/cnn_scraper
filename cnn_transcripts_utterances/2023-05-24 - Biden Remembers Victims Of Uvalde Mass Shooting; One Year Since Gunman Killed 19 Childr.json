Shimon, the president saying to the families of those killed, quote, we're thinking of you.

      "sentences": "Yes, and I think what the president there said is something that about the emotions of losing a loved one. Certainly a child. I think is going to really hit home here to many of these families. Because they don't know that they can go on and that is something they have said to me. Parents who are just in some cases, waiting to see their kids again. That means death. And they don't know. They don't know if they'll be able to move on, ever.And I think what the president there said to them about when you pass by the ice cream store or some place that reminds you of your child, when you can finally smile, then you know that there is hope, I guess, right? And a lot of these family members don't feel that. They don't feel that hope right now. And part of that, yes, is because Boris, as you said, there's been no accountability here for the failures that have occurred here from the law enforcement side, to the community leaders, to the politicians, elected leaders all across this state and all across this city and across this community have failed them. And that is what is so frustrating for them. Today for them is about sort of remembering their kids. But also trying to come together. Trying to unite. That's been something that's been very difficult. I've seen some of the family members come out here today and they've laid flowers. But it's a very difficult day for them and also for the survivors. The parents of the kids who survived were here. Earlier, one of the girls laying a flower with her -- you know, to pay respect to her friends. Her best friends. Some of who died in that classroom. But you could see this little girl, who was here earlier today, you could see she was really distraught today, understandably. But there's also a sense of anxiety here today because it brings back all of those terrible memories. So, there's still a lot of work that needs to happen here. And I think what the president there said is going to really hit home to this community that is trying to look towards elected leaders for some kind of solution. And just briefly, you know, we talk about changes in gun laws. This is something that the family members of this community have been fighting for since this really happened. Just simply to ask the state legislators here in Texas to raise the age of -- when someone can purchase an assault rifle from 18 to 21. And many of these family members spent weeks, days at the capital in Austin fighting for this. In one situation, they had to wait 13 hours to testify. The committee holding them in the state capital for 13 hours and letting them finally testify at midnight. And they finally got their chance to speak but it didn't go anywhere. But they're going to keep fighting. So, I think the community today needed to hear that from the president. As they try to heal, try to get answers and try to get some kind of change to happen here.",

So she was so young and stuck with him for like a decade long. And when she finally left, and to cover the night disaster, he hadbeaten her, she said. She wrote this in her book. And she ran with 36 cents and one gas credit card -- for a gas station -- and ran and got someone to get her a plane ticket to get back from Dallas -- this is 1976 -- back to L.A. She was like no matter what I have to do, I'm not going back to that. That's the kind of life -- I know I keep talking about it -- but that's the kind of life this woman was up against and why she looked at everything after that, is like, yeah, I had rough times, but look at what I have now. and imparting that in that -- in her music, in her performances where she was giving all, all the time.
