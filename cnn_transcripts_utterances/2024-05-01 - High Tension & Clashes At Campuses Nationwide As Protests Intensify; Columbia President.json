This was the scene just a short while ago at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Police clashing with protesters. 12 people were arrested.Hours earlier, protests rocked the University of Arizona where campus police use chemical irritant munitions to remove protesters. Around the same time at UCLA, pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups were attacking each other, hurling all kinds of objects, a wood pallet, fireworks, parking cones, even a scooter. And before that the NYPD was able to clear Columbia University after protesters barricaded themselves inside a campus building. 300 people were arrested at Columbia and City College of New York. But it is unclear how many were actually students. New York City Mayor Eric Adams warned this morning that professional outside agitators are getting involved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS, (D) YORK CITY: There is a movement to radicalize young people. And I'm not going to wait until it's done. And all of a sudden acknowledge the existence of it. This is a global problem that young people are being influenced by those who are professionals and radicalizing our children. And I'm not going to allow that to happen as the mayor of the City of New York. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, there was a ceasefire on October 6, the day before Hamas terrorists brutally murdered more than a thousand people inside Israel and took hundreds more as hostages. This hour, I'll speak to an American Israeli family whose son is still held captive by Hamas since that horrifying day, that brought us to this moment. You don't hear the pro-Palestinian protesters talking about that. We will.Now protesting the way the Israeli government, the Israeli prime minister is prosecuting the retaliatory war against Hamas is one thing. Making Jewish students feel unsafe at their own schools is unacceptable and it is happening way too much right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now security just coming back out here at 9 a.m., local coming back out. But as you can see, this is the area of contention last night where these barricades were set up like this, with this walkway in between but you can see where they were broken down.And you can see that in the video. It looked like people from this side were breaking down the encampment from the pro-Palestinian side last night, throwing objects in there. As well as it looks like some sort of maybe pepper spray or something coming from the other side over here. You saw the security and media trying to keep it safe. But there is visible images of that there was violence like there's -- looks like blood on the ground here. You can see it on the grass around where we are standing now. And we have a new update because of all of this, UCLA just tweeting now due to the violence last night that they are closing -- or I'm sorry, canceling classes today and asking students to stay away from this area of the campus after those clashes where you saw fireworks being deployed. We just saw that it was uncomfortable and dangerous. We've heard from some of the student journalists who actually said that worked for the Daily Bruin saying that some of their people were hurt. And so, you see some of those signs out here now still, and they're asking for the UCLA leadership to be accountable and to do something to make it safe for the students that go here, Dana.",

I was talking to someone who's a longtime Biden ally, who was trying to explain the context of this. And they said, this is sort of a confluence of events here where he needs to be a strong leader, but he also normally plays this empathetic role.And those two are very much at odds in this matter here. It's complicated, without question, as you just laid out. There are no simple solutions. But if you use history as a guide, our friend, Peter Baker, at the Times this morning reminded us of what Joe Biden was doing in the protests in '68. He was just finishing law school. And he said, I wear a suit coat. I'm not a protester. We know that he does not like these images of disorder. But that is a central worry. Just some Democrats are facing his presidential campaign.

You are ignoring the growing majority of Democratic voters who recognize Israel's war in Gaza as genocide and demand that immediate -- an immediate and permanent ceasefire. Now, I just want to say this that this is pointed out to me by a high- ranking Democrat, that you know, what's not in here? There's no mention of October 7. There is no mention of what started this.

He's got to -- he's got to strengthen up, but he's got to be heard. (END VIDEO CLIP) KANNO-YOUNGS: We've seen this playbook before even in 2020. I remember when there were protests in Portland as well outside of that courthouse. We started to see criminal justice protests breaking out. Trump trying to say, look, Biden is overseeing this disorder and chaos. Biden trying to push back on that by showing sort of his police and crime bonafides, and law and order bonafides. I think that's the message you're probably going to see moving forward. But again, the reason why this is challenging here is, you know, rhetoric only goes so far.

He does not support this effort to oust Mike Johnson, believes it is coming at the wrong time politically for his party.And that's really what allow those hardliners who do not support obviously, Mike Johnson. They say, they may not support some of his deals that he has cut, but they certainly do not support the timing of all this worry that it could be a backlash against them politically. Now there is some division though within the ranks. One Republican Warren Davidson of Ohio told me that he will support -- actually advancing it, because at first there will be a procedural motion next week to try to kill this measure. That is what the Democrats plan to vote in large numbers to kill -- to kill in the first motion. Warren Davidson told me he would vote to advance. And so, Marjorie Taylor Greene has a handful of Republicans who may vote for on the actual first motion, but ultimately. She will fail overwhelmingly because Democrats and mass with most Republicans plan to vote to kill it on that first vote actually, Dana.",
