The results somehow rigged by Democrats. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, but that hasn't stopped Mr. Trump and his allies from relentlessly pushing these lies. Now, many of those same allies are gathering again ready to claim fraud if the former president is once again defeated in November. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan spent the past few months with some of Trump's biggest promoters who continue to spread doubts about the security of the election and are doing whatever they can to ensure Trump wins. He begins with the most famous pillow salesman in America. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: How are you? My name is Donie O'Sullivan.",
