      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. Secretary Blinken has been meeting with the Israeli prime minister over the last nearly three hours now at IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. During that time, we have heard not one but two air raid sirens going off in Tel Aviv, as you are very well aware, Anderson.We know that at least during that first instance that the secretary of state and the Israeli prime minister went to a bunker for about five minutes before emerging and continuing their discussions. I would assume that the same situation happened just minutes ago when those air raid sirens went off once again. Because as far as we know, secretary of state and the Israeli prime minister are still there having those meetings. During this day, we've seen air raid sirens going off in Tel Aviv at least three times, I believe. Also, sirens here in Jerusalem. Both of those locations are typically less frequently the site of rocket attacks from Hamas. We see those typically much closer to the Gaza Strip, so it's always quite notable when they do go off in Tel Aviv as well as in Jerusalem, effectively the central Israel area. The Secretary of state is in Israel right now after a week of shuttle diplomacy between Israel and several Arab countries in the Middle East. He has gone to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, all of this aimed to try and prevent this Israel-Hamas conflict from escalating into a wider regional war. What he's also trying to do is to try and allow the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and also to try and get American citizens who are trapped in Gaza to be able to exit the Rafah Crossing into Egypt. There's been some conflicting information over the last several days about when that Rafah Crossing would open. U.S. officials believe that it would be open perhaps even Saturday, telling American citizens in Gaza to head down there in the event that crossing opened. As of yet, though, no U.S. citizens, it seems, have been able to get out. There were some conflicting reports about whether fuel was able to get into Gaza earlier today, but clearly all of us - the secretary of state's meetings today focus around that humanitarian issue as well, of course. We have to know the fate of those hostages, 199 hostages believed to be held by Hamas, 20 of whom at least are believed to be American citizens as well.",

He went with friends. He has a cabin in the Gaza Valley, which is not actually that far a drive from Gaza City, but that's where they've been told to go. Get down into the south. There are 50, 50 people, including 20 children, now in this small cabin all together. They can hear the fighter jets going across. They are - he said to me, explained it as saying, we are literally down to fumes as far as fuel is concerned. That means they're going to struggle with water because they haven't got the generator to run the water. They're very low on food supplies. And I said, what are you doing with the kids? I mean, how are the kids? And he said, look, we're distracting them. They've actually had a birthday party for one of his daughters who's nine years old. He said, all we can do is just distract them.

But those seem pretty primitive tunnels by comparison to what Hamas has.S. ANDERSON: Yes, Anderson. My first sergeant when I was a young lieutenant was - had been a tunnel rat in Vietnam. And in those days, they send you down a hole with a flashlight and a .45 and say, have a nice day. But no, these are very complex, very, very different - a much, much different situation. It's more like an underground metro system is the way to think about it. I mean, we've seen some evidence of that. They have shafts that go into buildings. They can pop out in any number of places. It's going to make this fight, which was already a really, really tough fight fighting in an urban environment, it's going to make this really, really difficult. So they've got to take that into consideration. There's things they can use to - they're going to - there's lots of innovation and technology, perhaps that they can use to help them down there. But again, the Israelis understand they're motivated to seek revenge, but they need to show restraint. They need to continue to apply the noose that they've applied, tighten their grip on Gaza, put the pressure internally, continue to with the blockade and make - set conditions for an appropriate attack into Gaza City when the time is right. COOPER: From a military standpoint, let alone a humanitarian standpoint, but from a military standpoint, isn't it in Israel's best interest to have as many residents of Gaza in the south and to enable supplies and shelter for those residents in the south to keep people staying in the south? S. ANDERSON: Absolutely, Anderson, could not agree more. What I would recommend that in terms of a tactic, in terms of an operational approach to this, cut the country in half. When they do attack into Gaza, go straight for the Gaza power plant, which is about 10 miles away, cut the country in half and allow all the civilians that are in the north to come down through the south. And of course, check them all out, make sure they don't have weapons, make sure they're not bad guys and whatnot. And aid as much as they possibly can in the evacuation of civilians from the Gaza City area. Set up camps, use the World Health Organization. I mean, when I was in Iraq, I set up camps all over the place 15, 16 years ago in Iraq. They need to set up camps, obviously, can take care of these refugees that are - be coming down. But yes, they've got to get as many of them out of there. They've got to tell them, look, you guys are hungry, your children don't have medicine, come south, cross through the border, cross through our, essentially, our checkpoints and move south to get your family taken care of. Motivate the people to come south and then they can take on the leadership of Hamas and actually execute the kind of attacks into the city and the location of the hostages like they want to.",

So I imagine there will be full investigations. More information will be coming out.But in a big picture sense, of course, it's important to remember that Iran has been a longtime funder of Hamas, supporter of it. In many ways, the group would not exist, along with other terror groups in the region were it not for the sponsorship of Iran. So again, there's so much to learn about the specifics of this.
