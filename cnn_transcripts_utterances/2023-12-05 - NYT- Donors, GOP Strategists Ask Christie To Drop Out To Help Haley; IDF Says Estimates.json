According to \"The New York Times,\" Republican donors, strategists and pundits are publicly pressuring Mr. Christie to follow the lead of Tim Scott and Mike Pence and formally end his campaign. Many would like to see him throw his support behind Nikki Haley.Republican strategist Kevin Madden adds, quote, ideally, it would have been facing this reality yesterday, a month or two months ago. The other big rumbling, is Liz Cheney in? The ardent Trump critic and Republican just told \"The Washington Post\" this morning that she is still considering a third party run as she continues to warn of Donald Trump's quote, grave threat. Now as for Trump himself tonight, he's holding a solo town hall tomorrow. He is ditching a presidential debate. Thursday he is heading back to court all while intensifying his rhetoric and spouting fringe January 6th theories. CNN's Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene following all of this for us. First, Kristen, let's start with you in what Donald Trump is up to in saying now?",

He is skipping the debate for a fundraiser in Florida. And then he's going to sit through testimony and his civil hearing in New York.And on Monday, he is expected to actually testify with his lawyers calling him to the stand again in that trial. And this is a call coming at a time where we're starting to hear alarm bells being raised and you mentioned his rhetoric intensifying. But it's not so much that his rhetoric is intensifying, he has been saying the same thing that since he announced back in November that he was going to be running for president. But people are really starting to pay attention likely because we are just six weeks out from the Iowa caucus and he still holds a commanding lead in the polls, not just in Iowa, but also nationwide. And that is causing many people, critics, Republicans and Democrats to wonder what a Trump second term would look like. And when you look through the rhetoric of what Trump is saying they believe it is a threat to democracy. And one of his loudest critics, as you mentioned, Liz Cheney has been talking about this quite a bit hitting both Donald Trump and the Republican Party, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: I don't know if our party can be saved. It may be that we need to build a new party.

And I think this is something that we've been hearing for weeks, we know that many Republicans want to consolidate around one Republican candidate that could be seen as the alternative to Donald Trump. And increasingly, we've seen Nikki Haley have an excellent few weeks, and people urging her, urging the candidates I should say to drop out and support her. And that's exactly what they're trying to tell Chris Christie to do.Christie, though, on his part, says that he has no plans to do that. He wants to stay in the race through the Republican convention. He recently told CNN that he thinks he's doing really well in New Hampshire, that's kind of the state where he's focused all of his attention. But he also thinks that he'll do so well in that state that it could carry him through the rest of the primary season. We'll see if that's actually what happens. But that is Christie's goal. Now, just about the debate tomorrow night, it's going to be the smallest debate stage yet that we've seen. You have four candidates, Christie, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy, all taking the stage. And this is really a crucial time. We are just six weeks away from the Iowa caucuses. And they're doing as much as they can to court these voters in the hopes of eating away at Donald Trump's support. Now, of course, as you mentioned, Donald Trump will not be on the debate stage. He's skipping it, as he has done with the previous debates. And that's really led to a lot of frustration among his opponents. We heard Ron DeSantis on Monday in New Hampshire, attacking Donald Trump for not showing up. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump is not willing to debate. I mean, you got to ask yourself why? Why can't you just stand up on the stage for two hours and articulate? What's going to be different this time then happen in 2020? How is he a better candidate? What -- will he admit any mistakes? I don't think so. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And their goal is really to make it look like Donald Trump is in a different league than his opponents. And they think that skipping these debates, continues to help him. And that's why he's continuing not to show up.And I do, I just want to point out the two big things that I think is most frustrating for Donald Trump's opponents is that, one, they do not have an opportunity to attack the front runner directly. But they're also really not getting the opportunity to try and continue to court and win over a lot of the pro Trump viewers that are not tuning in while Donald Trump isn't there. BERMAN: And is worth noting and except for Chris Christie, none seems to show great interest in attacking Donald Trump directly. But be that as it may, you know.

He continues to dominate the field, and his supporters are essentially growing. But I think and many Republicans I speak with say the best option for the GOP is to find a Trump alternative. And so that is to look at these other candidates and see who is in the best position to make the case to voters.And look at this stage of the game, we understand what these debates are all about. They need to contrast with each other on the policies, which in many cases, Kate, are similar when it comes to a foreign policy, immigration, as well as, there is a contrast on abortion. But the most important argument to make on this debate stage is their electability. To make the case to voters, they cannot only beat Donald Trump, but they can beat Joe Biden if he is a Democratic nominee. And they also need to show it's time for a new generation of optimistic leadership that is forward thinking and not past looking at past grievances. So those are the important issues I'm going to be looking for on the debate stage. And hopefully we can win out this field even more to have a more viable candidate to take on Donald Trump as we head into those important Iowa caucuses.",

He barely made the debate stage this time around. Nikki Haley has continued to see her numbers rise. Chris Christie, also, I would argue, has some personality issues. Not a lot of voters like Chris Christie. He comes off as a bully to some individuals.I think Nikki Haley is someone who comes off as forward thinking, as Alice just spoke about. She's a former governor. She had to deal with a very sensitive racial crisis in her state, the country still has many racial issues to deal with. She's been the only Republican on that stage to, I would argue, really articulate a very positive message on abortion that would resonate with independent swing voters. And so if you're looking for a contrast with Donald Trump, you want someone with state background. You want someone with foreign policy experience. And you also want someone who can really sort of parse through some of those social issues that Trump frankly doesn't do very well with.",

But at the end of the day, I happen to be a firm believer in the two party process. May the best Republican win or the best Democrat win. And it's incumbent upon people in the two parties to get behind the person that not only represents the views and values of the party, but also does so with a tone and tenor that is representative of what this country should go for. And that is a less toxic tone and representing the views of the American people. And look, Donald Trump what he's doing right now, we're hearing him blast Joe Biden about him being anti-Democratic.

Democrats have to strongly consider that. On the Republican side, we also have to consider what votes Kennedy may take away from the likely nominee which at this point is Donald Trump.

We heard those sirens go off that Israelis have become very accustomed to, as well as those loud booms in the sky of the Iron Dome interceptor rockets, taking them down.But most notably, Sara, we did see an impact just to the north of where we are in northern Tel Aviv, a large plume of black smoke that landed just near a power station from what we understand. Here's a little bit of what we saw and heard. And Sara, it is quite rare for a rocket to get through the Iron Dome, but it can happen if the barrage is big enough for the Iron Dome, determines that the rocket is not going to land near a populated area. It did land near a populated area. The police are checking to see if anybody has been injured. We've gotten a report of at least one, 40- year-old who has been injured. And of course when those rockets are taken down, shrapnel falls to the ground so they can certainly hurt people even if they are intercepted. Sara, this comes as Israel is expanding its ground operation in Gaza that has been officially announced. They are -- they say finishing up their operation in the north and then we'll move to focus more on the south. We've seen both satellite imagery and new video showing dozens of armored vehicles in southern Gaza. You mentioned a satellite image just to the west of that Salah al-Din Road, where -- which goes from north to south towards Khan Yunis. Of course Israel had told more than a million Gazans to move south during that first phase of their operation. Now, they're -- they continue to tell the southern -- Gazans in the south to evacuate to other areas. We understand that Khan Yunis, the city in the south, will become a particularly focus for those Israeli operations because officials, both Israeli and American do believe that Hamas leadership is in Khan Yunis at least part of it. But Sara, this adds to an already catastrophic and chaotic situation where you have the vast majority of the 2.2 million population of Gaza now displaced. The U.N. believes that it is 1.9 million Gazans who are displaced. Some of them are in shelters, but many are just camped out wherever they can find safety, whether that's in the streets or other open areas. Sara?

That doesn't mean that they can't resume, it doesn't mean that they can't get back to the negotiating table. But right now, things are not in a good place. And that has complicated the effort to get this funding to Ukraine, despite the administration making very clear to lawmakers on Capitol Hill that they are at the bottom of what money they have left to give Ukraine. They're arguing this as an urgent matter that this money needs to go out before the end of the year. Meanwhile, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have just this week and next week to figure this out. And given the fact that Republican senators are arguing that they will not vote to advance Ukraine aid without border policy changes, that puts this all in the context of it's one big mess. You have Senator Chris Murphy, the leading Democratic negotiator saying that he believes that it's possible they might get to the end of the year without this funding. Obviously Zelenskyy talking to senators today is a strategic move to try to imperil members and remind them how important this money is. But the issue for Zelenskyy is that no matter what he says about the situation on the ground in Ukraine, you have Republican senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been a strong advocate of Ukraine funding who are arguing that this doesn't have to do with not supporting Ukraine.
