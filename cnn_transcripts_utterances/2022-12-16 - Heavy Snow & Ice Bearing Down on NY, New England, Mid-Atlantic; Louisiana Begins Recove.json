And, with time running out on Trump-era border rules, the Biden White House reveals its plan for the migrant surge. Will it work?Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. Happy Friday, everybody. Right now, 10 million people in 15 states are under weather alerts as the huge storm that dumped feet of snow from California to the Midwest and spawned all those tornadoes that killed three people in Louisiana now marches into the Northeast. More on the storm's damaging effects in just a moment. But, let's begin with Meteorologist Britley Ritz. She is in the CNN Weather Center. And, Britley, what kind of severe weather this morning and where is it exactly headed?",

Rain from Boston down into Long Island, even New York City, tapping into that moisture, freezing rain for parts of PA back into the southern parts of New York and into the higher elevations of the Appalachians, back into the Catskills dealing with some heavy, heavy snowfall.Now, we also had reports of freezing rain over the past 24 hours from West Virginia to Virginia, on up into Maryland, all the way up into New York. Now, where we have the heaviest freezing rain, Maryland. You'll see that flashing white dot. That is Cedar Hill, Maryland, where we picked up three tenths of an inch. That's enough to cause widespread power outages, and sure enough, many of us have had that. Winter storm warning, still in effect, from Maine, all the way down into parts of PA. These are areas that are likely to pick up nearly two feet of snow. But, the time it's all said and done, let's take a look. Over the next 24 to 48 hours, snow continues to spin right across the state of New York up in New Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. And, that system tapers back a bit on Saturday. But, we're still dealing with that snowfall all across the Great Lakes, once it kicks out, still holding on to some moisture as that air runs over the lake itself, it cools, condenses, and we wind up with a few inches. Now, some of the heavier snow expected around Lake Erie in your Buffalo and Watertown. That's where we could pick up almost 20 inches of snow through Saturday. Now, the higher elevations over New England expected to pick up 24 inches of snow, widespread, roughly about 12. Now, that snow extends back into the northern plains. Well, we have another area of low pressure sitting there. Now, you notice it doesn't seem like much, two to four inches. Well, that's enough to cause some issue. It's that area of low pressure where it starts to blow the wind around and then the snow starts to blow when we lose visibility. So, blizzard warnings are still in effect. Christine.",
