I'm Lynda Kinkade, Richard Quest is on assignment.Just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, teams of rescue workers race to free survivors of Monday's devastating earthquake, as aid organizations say much more help is needed. And facing an election next year, the U.S. president prepares to address the nation. Also, Germany's Defense minister visits Kyiv, promising more tanks. Well, the quake's death toll is rising as searchers race to find victims within the rubble. More than 7,000 people across Turkey and Syria have now died. And the Turkish president has declared a three- month state of emergency. Crews are digging through thousands of collapsed buildings to find any signs of life. Aftershocks and winter weather are making that effort even harder and more urgent. In many parts of Turkey, temperatures tonight are expected to drop below freezing. Nearly two full days later, and people are still hopeful for moments like this. Images showing crews rescuing a young girl in Turkey 24 hours after the quake. Well, in Gaziantep, near the earthquakes epicenter, CNN witnessed as workers asked for quiet so they could listen for people in the rubble. Crews said they heard the voices of at least three people. Well, CNN's Becky Anderson is in Gaziantep and joins us now live. You've been there, Becky, hour after hour. I've been watching as you've been waiting to hear whether rescuers are reaching anyone under that rubble behind you. Just bring us up to speed with the latest.",

As is always the way in earthquakes you tend to get these pockets of destruction. And actually around those you can't believe that the buildings, other buildings are actually still intact.That's not the case here because all of these buildings are clearly in danger of coming down. But in other parts of the city, this is a new city, a relatively new city with relatively new buildings and built in a fairly robust fashion. And so many of the buildings here have actually survived. Sadly, that isn't the situation, for example, just north of here. We're very close to the epicenter. There is a town about 100 clicks away from here and the buildings are older, they're not as robust, and one of our colleagues Nick Paton Walsh is there, and what he's observing is an awful lot of destruction across the entire city. [15:10:11] So it really does depend where you are and how strong the buildings are. Yes, and where the quake actually occurred. This was, as I say, relatively close to the epicenter. But not everything here has been affected. Spare a thought, of course, for those in northwest Syria, we're reporting from Turkey and northwest Syria, in Aleppo and in Idlib, the stories -- the accounts that we're hearing, the reports that we're hearing are of real destruction. No electricity, no fuel, no water, no electricity, and people really struggling. And not seeing anything like this sort of support that we are seeing here from the international community, although there is some support going in through Damascus at this point. It is highly political and highly charged, of course.",

Now this is a chance for him to win back support ahead of a likely reelection bid. His popularity has slipped in recent months. A poll from late January put his approval rating at just 40 percent. Well, the State of the Union gives the president a massive audience. Last time almost 40 million people watched. Our reporter Phil Mattingly is covering the story and joins us now from the White House. Good to see you, Phil. So the U.S. president certainly has plenty of economic data to highlight some of his economic gains in terms of unemployment rates at a record low and stock market higher than it was when he entered office. But of course inflation is still biting. How much time will the president use tonight trying to convince the American public that the economy is not weak?",

      "sentences": "I think it's the core of the entire speech, to be honest with you. And frankly, this has been the disconnect that has been confounding the White House officials for the better part of the last several months particularly in the wake of just the most recent economic data, which includes, in clear deceleration, in terms of inflation, obviously, going to be blockbuster jobs report last week, economic growth that has remained durable, and yet, when you look at poll after poll after poll, it hasn't resonated with the American public.And I think you make a critical point here in terms of how many people are watching this. For a president that doesn't command huge crowds at rallies, who tries to lower the temperature and not necessarily engage on a day-to-day basis in the political battles that would put him in front of people on a regular basis, this is a huge moment, a primetime speech, tens of millions of viewers, millions more watching clips of this on social media, a content throughout the country in the wake of this speech. This is the opportunity not just to lay out a laundry list necessarily of economic statistics that the White House officials believe really bolsters their case, but to some degree, when you talk to officials, they understand the import of drawing kind of a thread here, a real narrative, as to why they believe their first two years coming out of the pandemic, coming out of the economic crisis, tied to the pandemic, demonstrates that there has been very real progress. But also has laid the groundwork, as they're going to say, and as the president is going to lay out tonight, finish the job in the years ahead. And not just necessarily in the months ahead or in the year ahead, but when I say years, I mean as you alluded to, the reelection campaign that's expected to launch in the coming weeks. That's considered imminent and so is the urgency to really outlined why the president and his team believe that they have a record not just of accomplishments in the first two years, but a record to run on in the years ahead.",

He would like to see higher taxes on billionaires and a 4 percent tax on share buybacks. The president's economic record has been under increasing strain. The U.S. is on track to default on its debt. And citizens are feeling the pressure of decades high inflation. Ellen Hughes-Cromwick is the former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Commerce and she joins us now from Washington.

Is that partly why the president has such trouble with his approval rating? And how will he explain that tonight?HUGHES-CROMWICK: Well, I think there are several different factors that should be highlighted and really speak to what's happening on the ground. One of them is, believe it or not, the inflation rate has already come down from 7 percent last June to the latest data of 5 percent. So in the span of six months we've seen inflation start to come down quite markedly. And you also probably saw Fed chair Powell just speak here in Washington at noon today. And he also indicated that we're seeing some of the prices of not just goods but other parts of the economy start to get inflation down. So this is kind of all hands on deck. And we're starting to see significant progress to bring inflation down. As you know, the Fed is in the driver seat. And they are accomplishing the mission. It will take some time but that's really going to be a great way for the economy to start growing more decisively as we get into the latter part of this year.",
