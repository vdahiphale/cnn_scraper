But that is, sort of, shifting into grim resignation that a lot of loved ones may never be found given the temperature of the fire. Governor Josh Green said that many of them will never be recovered.So, as we stand overlooking the town, we are seeing the clouds of dust coming up from some of the heavy machinery, and it's so heartbreaking to realize recognize that dust holds people's children and parents and neighbor and loved ones. And how do you get a sense of closure in this particular space? This will be a sacred space for so many for so long. Three and a half square miles of area burned. The president is expected to fly over Lahaina. It's uncertainly whether he'll actually touch down on the ground. He's expected to meet first responders and victims of this disaster. He, of course, is known as an empathizer in chief given the tragedy in his personal life. But he uncharacteristically gave a \"no comment\" when asked about Hawaiians a few days ago. The White House insists he's been on the phone hourly, almost, making sure that everybody gets the resources they need. But this is really an emotional charged time. So many tender emotions right now. And so, the president is, sort of, walking into that. As for the future, so much of that depends on, sort of, ancient fights over water rights, in particular. So, that's at the top of mind of people who say that the water could have kept this place lush and fireproof was diverted to resorts and rich homeowners at the expense of locals. That may come up during today's visit, but it certainly will be an issue going forward. Bill Weir, CNN, Maui. (END VIDEO CLIP) KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Bill, thank you for that. A sacred space as Bill puts it. As he's mentions, President Biden will be meeting with survivors of the fires, as well as community leaders when he visits Maui with the -- along with the first lady staying (ph). And joining us right now is the chair of the Maui County Council, Alice Lee. Thank you for coming back in. You're going to be meeting with the president and the first lady when they visit Maui today. What is your message for him?",

I think there's nine people left as of today. Thousands have been moved to transitional quarters like the hotels who are taking very good care of the people, as well as individual homes and short-term rentals.So, I'm sure, as you go through talking to various people, you will hear stories of disappointment, of course, because they have lost a lot. And I can't -- you know, you can't blame them for being disappointed. But there are many success stories as well.",

You mentioned we got some national polls as well. We can throw those up on the screen. Donald Trump's lead is even larger there. He -- if you look at an average, our CNN poll of polls over national polls, he's got a 40-point lead over Ron DeSantis, 57 percent to 17 percent.So, what do these candidates need to do? They need to, in Donald Trump's absence, since he is not showing up on that debate stage, seize this moment to start building a coalition and a coalescing of the piece of the Republican electorate, John, that is not for Trump and start building support. One person is going to need to that over these next several months if they're going to have a real shot at taking on Donald Trump.",

He's not the incumbent, he is not the current president of the United States. But in terms of polling, one of the things we always say is, oh, if an incumbent is not above 50 percent, then they're not doing that well. Well, nationally, we can see Trump is over 50 percent. But in Iowa, he's, you know, 42 percent. So, what do you think the right barometer is for a guy like Trump? CHALIAN",

And I will say that I know from my conversations with Donald Trump's team, and we know as well that Donald Trump, himself even, is privately and publicly boasting about his commanding lead in the polls, exactly what David just laid out there. And he also feels emboldened by his current status as a frontrunner.But of course, we are very far away from the 2024 election, and also far away from the primaries. And there's a lot that could change between now and then. But this ad, it's released by MAGA, Inc., one of the outside Donald Trump super PACs. And it really is focusing on drawing that contrast between Donald Trump and President Biden. And I know from my conversations as well with Trump's team that they really want both the former president but also Republican voters to think about the big themes and his key agenda items as he heads into election season. And these themes like the economy, the border, crime, and China. All things that they want voters to be focused on more than his current legal battles which are, of course, hovering over all of this. And again, Sara, as you mentioned, this ad comes just two days before the first presidential primary debate in Milwaukee where Trump won't be there. And so, I think this is them getting ahead of this. Showing what Donald Trump wants voters to be focused on ahead of, you know, his surrender in Georgia this week.",
