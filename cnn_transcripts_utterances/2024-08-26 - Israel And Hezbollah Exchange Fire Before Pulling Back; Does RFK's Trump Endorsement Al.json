Over the weekend, Israel struck southern Lebanon in what it called a preemptive strike targeting Hezbollah's rocket launchers. And the Iran-backed terror group says it still fired 320 rockets towards Israel.CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa. So Jeremy, is there a sense that both sides actually want to avoid further escalation?",

      "sentences": "You know, there really is, Manu, and that's despite the fact that yesterday what we saw was really one of the most intense barrages, intense exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah since the beginning of this war.And yet in the span of a few hours, you saw not only heavy strikes by the Israelis carried out in what the Israeli military has described as a preemptive strike, 100 plus fighter jets in the air, striking dozens of targets, dozens of rocket launcher targets in Southern Lebanon. That was then followed by a volley of rocket fire, hundreds of rockets, as well as some drones fired by Hezbollah towards targets in Northern and Central Israel. But then very quickly, what you saw is both sides really climbing off of that escalation ladder that could have sent this region into a far, far darker place. Part of that stems from what the Israeli military says they believe they accomplished. And that is to say that no Israeli bases, according to them in central or in Northern Israel were actually hit by any of these drones or missiles. The Israeli prime minister even said that all of the drones that Hezbollah fired were indeed successfully intercepted. Meanwhile, Hezbollah for its part, despite the fact that it appears that almost all of its rockets and drones were actually intercepted, they've still sought to kind of tout this as a victory, that they accomplished what they wanted to accomplish in terms of retaliating over the killing of Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah military commander about a month ago in the Lebanese capital. And now both sides are saying that at least for now, this current phase of escalation is over. And that's obviously promising for this region, and it's giving more space for those ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations to continue. And that's exactly what we saw yesterday. Despite the significant uptick in the attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, the negotiators still met in Cairo, still sought to continue to hash out a deal to try and release the hostages and lead to a weeks long ceasefire in Gaza. The question is, are those negotiations actually going anywhere? And that's because what we saw yesterday is a U.S. official claiming that progress was made, but all of the senior officials left Cairo without a deal being in place. Technical lower level negotiations are still ongoing, but at this hour, it's still very hard to see how a ceasefire deal can be reached right now, as there are still several key sticking points and whether or not these negotiations are actually going anywhere.

So I think it's a bit of vindication.I talked to one campaign adviser who kind of downplayed the impact, at least electoral impact, of that 6 percent in some places that RFK could potentially give to Trump. I think that they potentially don't even know if those 6 percent of people would actually vote, right? Or whether they would feel so aligned with Trump that they would vote for Trump. So I think that they are both feeling vindicated. They're downplaying the seriousness of it. And they also want to talk about different things, right? They want to talk about the former president. They don't necessarily want to talk about RFK. They haven't really ever wanted to talk about RFK. And so I think that any time where they can tie them together is good.

VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think what his endorsement represents is that Donald J. Trump's Republican Party is a big tent party.

Like if you look at Arizona where they had that announcement on Friday, he was pulling at 6 percent. Of course, that is completely different from the low to mid 40 percent that both Harris and Trump are seeing right now in Arizona.

And it's -- I should note, one of many investigations that are ongoing into exactly what happened on July 13th when it comes to the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. We're going to see, like you noted, Republican Representative Mike Kelly. He's actually a representative who represents this area of western Pennsylvania. We're also going to see Democratic Congressman Jason Crow who is from Colorado. They're leading this delegation and the goal really is to lead a fact finding mission. Jason Crow telling CNN that there really is no substitute for being on site when it comes to finding out more facts here on the ground. And also, Manu, I can tell you that part of this particular visit is going to involve meeting with local law enforcement officials as well to better understand their response to what happened on that day. But meanwhile, Manu, we keep learning in really a drip, drip fashion more troubling details about the planning and the lead up to that particular rally here in Butler. Late last week, our team at CNN reporting that Secret Service actually did not pick up radios that local law enforcement officers had left out for them. Perhaps that would have been able to streamline communication between the two groups of law enforcement officials who were here on scene, especially as those local law enforcement officials were radioing to their colleagues that there was someone on top of that roof with a gun in the minutes or in the seconds, really, before he opened fire. Plus, we're also understanding that multiple Secret Service personnel from the Pittsburgh field office and one member of former President Trump's security detail, they've been reassigned to administrative duties in this meantime. So what we're looking forward to seeing today, Manu, is really just the first step, though, of this particular task force coming on the ground and trying to do their own assessment of just what went wrong here six weeks ago.",
