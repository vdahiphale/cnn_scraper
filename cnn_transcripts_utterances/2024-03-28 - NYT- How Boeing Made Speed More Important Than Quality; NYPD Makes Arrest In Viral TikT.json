      "sentences": "Now a very troubling report out today from \"The New York Times\" about problems with quality and safety at Boeing.The company is facing scrutiny after several incidents, including this one, that door plug that flew off an Alaska Airlines plane when it was at 16,000 feet earlier this year. The plug was missing bolts needed to secure to the fuselage. \"The Times\" spoke with several current and former Boeing employees. One former engineer there and a safety expert saying, quote, \"There's a lot of areas where things don't seem to be put together right in the first place. The theme is shortcuts everywhere.\" A quality manager in Washington State, who left Boeing last year, telling \"The Times\" that workers assembling planes would sometimes try to install parts that had not been logged or inspected, trying to save time. Another worker describing seeing wires being routed incorrectly, raising the risk that they could rub against one another resulting in damage. And said, quote, \"Employees would sometimes go inspector shopping to find someone who would approve work.\" This week, the Boeing CEO said he will be leaving at the end of the year. We have Niraj Chokshi with us, one of \"The Times\" reporters on this story, a very good story. Niraj, thank you for being with us. And when you read this, I think what you and your colleagues really demonstrate is that this goes so far beyond door plugs. Tell us how widespread you found this pattern of shortcuts on all kinds of parts of these planes. NIRAJ CHOKSHI, REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, thanks for having me. Yes, I think from our reporting what will be discovered is that there are -- there appears to be a sort of a fraying or a straining of several separate layers along the process here. Some of that is within Boeing's control, some of it isn't. The stuff that isn't, their suppliers are struggling at times. They, like many large companies, they lost a lot of people in the pandemic. They struggled to hire a lot of people back. But some of it obviously is within their control and that's -- that's the quality control piece of this. And so it seems like there's a lot kind of conspiring to kind of make -- make this a difficult moment for the company.",

You know, it did -- it did slowly start to recover and rebounded actually relatively quickly.But in the industry, airlines, Boeing's major costumers all were sort of very worried that this might take a long time to come back. And so airlines and Boeing did everything they could to cut costs. And, you know, one of their biggest costs, as with any company, is labor. And so by the end of 2020, Boeing had lost about 19,000 workers.",

It's pretty stunning, as you outline it.There was also one former worker describing this practice of self- inspections. How did that work? And tell us about this, even though it's been it seems largely eliminated, is there a bit of a hangover effect because it was in place with airplanes that are still -- they are now in the air?",

Well, outside of their South Carolina factory, which is where they make the 78y7, the other sites Boeing says that about 10 percent of their inspections are still self-inspections.Now, those aren't always concerning. Sometimes if it's -- it could be anything -- something you can say -- you can say, yes, that was painted. I took care of that. But a lot of times, it may be stuff like, did you twist the nada tork (ph) nut? And that even -- even something like that, if you're doing it a dozen times a day or several dozen times a day, you know you might not catch them all. You might miss one. You might think you did it when you didn't. It always helps to have a second set of eyes looking over your shoulder.",

I mean, if it had happened a few minutes later at a higher altitude with people walking around, people not having their seat belt on, it could have been catastrophic.And so it's fair for travelers to wonder if they're safe. Some important context though to keep in mind is that we're in the safest period in aviation history in the U.S. We haven't had a major crash in 15 years. It's a particularly good stretch. That's not to say that we should rest on our laurels. The FAA has stepped up inspections of Boeing. And they've said it's not enough to just take -- take the safety record of the past 15 years at face value.",

People feel crime is rising because they're feeling more signs of disorder.So look, in New York, crime is actually down from last year. If you compare New York to, you pick your city, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles Milwaukee, per capita, this is the safest major city in the country. But crime is up from where it was before the pandemic. Now if you look at the issue here, stranger assaults, these are assault by random people against people they don't know, are up 13.9 percent. And this is where we see an intersection with issues of homelessness, issues of mental health. It's very important to note that mentally ill people are no more likely to commit an act of violence than anybody else in society. But in New York, where you have some people who are what the experts call treatment resist. They're trying to stay out of the hospital. They're trying to stay away from authorities. And yet they act out in these ways. And you know, this week, we saw a man pushed in front of a train. And we hear about these assaults. The mayor's office has been pushing Albany to allow them to have more legal and medical legal powers to commit people and get them into treatment when they're a danger to themselves and others. Even at this rate, without the law that the mayor is asking Albany to pass, they're doing 130 involuntary commitments a week involving police and medical personnel.",

Maybe your kids come visit, see it for yourself.Because it is spectacular. Stop looking at me. Let's look at some beautiful poppies here. California state flower, here on this hillside just taking over. And this is what part of a super bloom can look like. And the reason why it's a super bloom and why people get so excited out here is because it doesn't happen every single year. It all depends on the conditions. There needs to be plenty of rain. And then those cool temperatures. And then that warmth that comes in. And it's just right. And the flowers are like, hello, we're here to see you again. So when California is in those very dry, dry, drought years, those years we don't have super blooms. And you know, we go into those phases for a long time. There was a lot of rain last year. So if you look at those satellite images from last year, you can see from space just how dense those carpets of color, kaleidoscope of color were in parts of California last year. This year, we were kind of dry, but then, after January, we got some rain. So now we've got flowers. Of course, one thing that happens is they start to compete with the grass here, but still take a look. If you come in a little bit closer with me, you can see that you've got the poppies down here, the California poppy, and then you've got a little yellow there. And you've got some purple here, too. So there's more than just the orange here. But all together, when you look out to the landscape, you can see all of those colors.
