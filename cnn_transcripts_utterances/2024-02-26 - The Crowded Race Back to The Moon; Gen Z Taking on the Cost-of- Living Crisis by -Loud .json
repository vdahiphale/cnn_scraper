      "sentences": "Humans landed on the moon for the first time over 50 years ago. Back then it was really only theU.S. and Russia that were in the space race. Now, the European Space Agency says there are over 100 lunar missions planned for the moon before 2030, and they`re made up of countries and companies all over the world. So why is everyone racing to the moon again? Well, the main reasons are resources, exploration, and politics. The moon is home to many resources like rare earth minerals and elements like the isotope helium three that could prove useful to mine. Helium three is hard to find on earth, but it can be found all over the moon and is theoretically vital towards nuclear fusion of possibly game changing, clean energy source. Studies have theorized that water in ice form may be available in large quantities on the moon and mining could provide water and oxygen. The critical elements needed to make rocket fuel and allow further exploration. The U.S., Russia, and China all have plans to establish permanent bases on the moon, offering a jumping off point to explore Mars and go even deeper into outer space. But how legal is all of this potential activity on the moon? The 1960, `70 United Nations Outer Space treaty is signed by most countries when it comes to lunar laws. But experts say that it needs some updating. It outlines that the moon should be the province of all mankind and should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. So military bases, nuclear weapons and weapons testing are forbidden. The treaty also stresses cooperation, but critics say that it lacks any means of enforcement, which could prove diplomatically dangerous if it`s exploited. Now, in recent years, the United States has engaged in the new round of space diplomacy called the Artemis Accords. So far, there are more than 30 signatory nations, but notably China and Russia have not participated. Many scientists are concerned that mining and development could affect experiments and scientific projects that are already in place. So although there is this renewed rush to get to the moon, the future of diplomacy on the moon is a critical question. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The card was put into use in 1950, initially used only in local restaurants before expanding to include retailers. One year later, The Diner`s Club had 42,000 members spanning major cities across the U.S. Now, here`s a wild statistic for you. The total amount of Americans credit card debt surge passed a trillion dollars in 2023, but some economists say it`s not necessarily a bad thing citing that the U.S. job market remains solid and wage growth is beating inflation. Some economists are also saying that Americans are currently better positioned to pay down their debts. And in some cases they`re making enough money to also stash some money away in their savings accounts. Now, having conversations about your money can be tough. Like if a group of friends is headed out, maybe to get a bite to eat and we just don`t have the dough to go. It can be tough to say I`m on a budget, bruh. Well, a new TikTok trend created by comedian Lukas Battle aims at taking the shame out of being frugal, saving money. He uses a term called \"Loud Budgeting.\" And our Vanessa Yurkevich met with him to learn more.

Thefirst person who`s made a lasting impact is Jane Bolin born in 1908. She was super focused and dedicated as a kid graduating high school at just 15 years old, persevering the challenges of growing up as a black girl in that era, she`d go on to become the first black woman to graduate from Yale Law School. First to join the New York City bar Association and the first black woman in the U.S. to become a judge. She served on the bench for 40 years where she ended segregated childcare facilities and race-based assignments of probation officers. She said she wasn`t concerned about being first, second, or even last because her primary concern was her work.
