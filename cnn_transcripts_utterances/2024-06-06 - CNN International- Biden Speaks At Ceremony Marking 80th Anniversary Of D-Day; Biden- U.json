They are in Normandy to pay tribute to the thousands of allied forces killed, some 4,426 allied troops who died during this Operation Overlord and 2,501 Americans who were killed.We've got our reporters who are dotted across the map, also watching this beautiful tribute. You heard the President of the United States saying what the allies did 80 years ago far surpassed what we could have done on our own. Joining me right now, Nic Robertson in London, Max Foster at Buckingham Palace. But, let's begin with Melissa Bell there in France on the water.

And we met them the American Veterans as they came off, especially chartered planes earlier this week, with a remarkable spring in their step, some of them navigating with difficulty, the steps on the way down, but with all the emotion of what they'd seen a lifetime ago, and bring it with them, of course, their memories of what they saw that day, because it would have been whether they were 18, 19, 20, completely transformative. What they witnessed here was extraordinary heroism, but also extraordinary loss.So, we have a couple of hundred of these Veterans, the last living ones that are with us today here on these coasts, but an extraordinary variety of people who've come out beyond them. Perhaps I can just show you, Fredricka, on the shore, you can see all across these shores, and this is just one of the beaches. As I said, Gold Beach. Omaha is further down that way, are lined with people who've come out, some of them dressed in period costume and the fatigues at the time, others just out with their families.

So, earlier, President Macron and King Charles led the tributes at a new memorial on Gold Beach, which is where the British landed, and there hadn't been a memorial there before. It's only just been built. So, it was a big moment for the British Veterans, at least, who were there.I think a couple of things that were very poignant there, the fact that you consider that a lot of these Veterans are around 100-years- old. So, the only Veterans left are the ones who were teenagers when they hit the shore there. And it's extraordinary to think that some of them were as young as 16 and they had to lie about their age to actually serve. And then, you have the modern references, and Charles referred to them saying, we recalled -- we recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades. Three nations must stand together to oppose tyranny. And I thought that was interesting when you then heard President Biden talking about tyranny currently invading Ukraine. So, making that tie from Hitler's Germany to what Russia is doing in Ukraine right now, which is very strong symbolism, very bold on this occasion, but something that certainly receives claps amongst the Veterans, because I spoke to a veteran earlier on today and I spoke to him about what it was all for. And he said, he just couldn't understand why world leaders were still going to war when everyone knows what happened on D-Day and how much suffering there was and what they tried to prevent in future. So, there is celebration of the heroism and the lives lost, really, in the name of their countries, but also some concern that the lessons haven't been properly learned.",

And I wonder, globally or especially within Europe, when other allies hear President Biden say that and then to hear, I believe she was a seawoman, who said pointing to the Veterans who are on stage, saying you World War II Veterans stand relieved. We have the watch. I wonder if that also brought a sense of relief to some European allies who have been very concerned, given you mentioned the former President and the demands on retreating from or the threat of retreating from NATO, if there were some relief that came with and reassurances came with hearing of the current President's words and the next generation.",

So, will they be the leaders in Europe be relieved to hear that kind of language? It's always what people say, isn't it? It's more than words. We need to see the actions.They will be hoping that when the Americans get to vote in November that they vote for a President that will continue to support the alliance, not just the military alliance against the President Putin, but that economic alliance, the global infrastructures, the geopolitical stability that followed on from World War II because of the horrors of World War II built out of the ashes of World War II, a nation Germany that had gone to war with all these allies, yet embraced by and afterwards rebuilt as all of Europe was to a better economic future that stands with the United States today, shares all those values. There is going to be the hope that this is the future that American voters choose. It seems like a remote -- it seems remote that the U.S. elections can have so much consequence in Europe, but they will. And frankly, people are holding their breath because they don't know what the outcome will be and what it would mean to have a sincerely isolationist United States that was willing to break the bonds that have benefited Europe and the United States.",

And I think they felt an incredible sense of unity and purpose. I know that sounds a little corny today. But, I think the attack on America on December 7, 1941, the American struggle in North Africa, Italy, and then on June 6, 1944, I think brought out a really exceptional sense of unity among American troops.I think, as the war went on, that sense of why we fight probably transitioned, we know, from one have kind of a belief in democracy and a certain motivating ideology to this, what we see in shows that were extremely well done and very accurate, like Band of Brothers, or Saving Private Ryan, it turned inward, which is why it's so moving to see these men on the stage. It became about who you were sitting next to. It became about the person in the foxhole with you.
