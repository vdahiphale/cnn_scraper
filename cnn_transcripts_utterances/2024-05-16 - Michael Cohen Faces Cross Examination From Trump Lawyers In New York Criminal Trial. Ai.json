This is one of their key objective today is to go back to this phone call that Cohen has testified and challenge his recollection of it and also challenge whether it was actually about Stormy Daniels. And they believe this will be key to their defense of their client to undercut the Cohen said he called Keith Schiller and he wanted to talk about stormy Daniels, when in fact, they were going to present evidence that this was actually about something completely different.

Now, Cohen says both would occur in terms of Schiller either putting him on speakerphone or giving Trump the phone privately, he says he doesn't recall this specific call. Now again, one thing to remind our viewers is that Donald Trump never really made calls himself, he always went through someone else who is near him.

Or are they major inconsistencies that go to the heart of the matter?Again, I'm not using the exact words, but that's the general idea. And I think juries will sit down and parse out every single thing they've heard, and decide whether these inconsistencies matter or don't.

Now Michael Cohen never told me firsthand, I'm going into the WhiteHouse, I want to, but it was widely discussed that he was angling for attorney general or to be White House Counsel. That's I mean, there's dozens and dozens of people around Washington who could corroborate that. My jaw hit the floor when I heard him denying that, and as a practical matter, which is probably extraneous to this discussion, but I'll share anyway. He likely wouldn't have qualified for a job in the West Wing. You have to be able to get a top secret security clearance, they would have gone through his finances, frankly, this home equity line probably would have shown up, the payment that he got back likely would have shown up on a financial disclosure.

He says Cohen, as to sheets you should speak to and Keith Schiller replies at 8:02, according to Blanche, telling Cohen column, Blanche is pulling up the call log. This is a call that you testified about on Tuesday, that you had a conversation with President Trump that you called Keith Schiller, and it wasn't to talk to Keith Schiller was to talk to President Trump about the Stormy Daniels deal. And to move forward, it seems to me like Todd Blanche's effectively making the argument that this phone call was actually about a 14-year old who is making harassing phone calls with Michael Cohen. We've talked to other prosecutors, former prosecutors here, Alyssa Farah Griffin, about whether or not given Michael Cohen's credibility issues, they would have brought this case and at least two have said no.

If you brought me up in one of these, I'd be able to say it was the lies around the election, it was the events that eventually led up to January 6, many of us who broke with him can point to something fundamental, that was a breaking point.And that's not been as clear with him. So it's allowed the defense to kind of bloody him up with, you know, these are the lies you told, these are your motives and maybe money you are motivated or grievance. And I think that's very difficult. But more broadly, this case, I don't think fundamentally matters the way some of the heavier ones do the mishandling of national security secrets, the investigate -- the trial around January 6, and the overturning of the election. And if he ends up getting off on this case, because it wasn't a strong one to begin with and it relied on a known liar to convict him, I think it really blurs in the public perception the seriousness of those other cases, it feeds this notion of he's a victim and it's a witch hunt.
