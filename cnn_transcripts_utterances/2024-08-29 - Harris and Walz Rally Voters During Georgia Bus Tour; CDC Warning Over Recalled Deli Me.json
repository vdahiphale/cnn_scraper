And ahead of that, I think it's fair to say, Georgia's on their minds. They're continuing their bus tour of the Peach State today, and Harris is getting some promising new numbers there. A new Fox News poll shows Harris at 50 to Trump's 48.While there's still no clear leader, it is a tangible difference from the deficit President Biden faced there just a few months ago. But Harris very clearly doesn't appear to be taking any momentum for granted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Everyone vote actually matters, and we have to remind people of that.",

Can I ask, you know, one of the questions that I've had as I've watched you both, not just there, but also, some of the stuff you were doing at the convention, polling still shows Trump with leads in younger voters generally, at least better numbers with younger voters overall and leads with younger voters in Georgia.What's your sense right now in terms of what the campaign, the Harris campaign needs to do to change that down the home stretch in Georgia?",

But they are doing pretty much everything they should be doing.As the president of the Young Democrats of Georgia, you know, I've been involved in this work for a long time. I know how to reach out to young voters. And you know what is happening right now, all of our students across the State of Georgia are returning to college campuses. In 2022, the State of Georgia reelected Reverend Raphael Warnock. Well, since then, 200,000 more young people have registered to vote in the state. So, this weekend at Georgia Tech, the Young Democrats are hosting a convention with all of our folks back in school at the AUC Morehouse, Spelman and Georgia Tech and Emory and, you know, across the metro area and we're engaging young folks. I know the Harris campaign is reaching out, and I think the truth of it is that the Georgians know that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have attacked their rights. You know, my friends, my peers, my partner are all scared to be pregnant in the State of Georgia because it really is dangerous because we don't have laws that care for the health and the safety of our people. So, I think young people know what's at stake. I think young people want a safer climate and a better Georgia, and I know we're going to turn out. Polling is one thing, but I feel the energy on the ground, and I'm excited to have all these young voters on our college campuses show up and make the difference on November 5th.",

      "sentences": "You know, it's an interesting point. It's a very clear-cut strategy, and I think one that has paid off in the past, perhaps through different platforms and mechanisms. But what's been interesting in looking at kind of the polling over the course of the better part of the last year, the Trump campaign has a very clear advantage with younger men in particular, college campuses in particular, their outreach has been very tailored to them. What media they do is very tailored to them. They think that they can turn them out in large numbers to their advantage. Do you think that's wrong?",

You know, we are seeing something among young men where they're more disaffected, where they're going to college at lower rates. But you know, I have a wonderful little brother in Atlanta and he is probably what the Trump campaign would think they would be able to reach out to. You know, he works in the service industry. He never went to college.But him and I sat and watched even the Biden-Trump debates, and he just said, God, Trump is a bad man and Biden's got a good heart. I think young people know what's at stake. Young people know that we need a safer climate. When Trump is out here attacking women, attacking our climate, attacking our future, attacking our education, I really think young people will see that. And I am making a call to young men. We need to be responsible. We need to be self -- we need to not be selfish in this moment. And we need to understand that, you know, what it means to be a real man, what it means to be masculine is not to cower and hide in this, you know, old idea of masculinity. It's to care about people, to be a good neighbor, to be a good person, to help somebody change their tire, not to be hateful and continue this rhetoric of, you know, what Donald Trump is elevating men should be.",

So, it's completely up to Trump whether this is sustainable because Trump has always been the one starting the drama, thus far, kemp has always been the one to take the high road and quite frankly, being willing to bury the hatchet afterwards. You know, whether it was after the stop the steal efforts and all, Trump really attacked Kemp directly in 2020. Then he attacked Kemp and his wife, I think, which was a lot more -- even more problematic for a lot of people earlier this month.But again, Kemp has always been willing to bury the hatchet, A, for the future of the party, but, B, Kemp also has future aspirations, and it behooves him to stay in the good graces of the party.

They were all hospitalized. This is across 18 different states. And sadly, nine people have died and those deaths have been reported in New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina, and Illinois.And Phil, the CDC has been investigating this outbreak since last month. That's when Boris had recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli meat. To many of the people who've gotten sick reported having liverwurst or ready to eat a Turkey deli meat. And with listeria, it is a bacteria and symptoms include fever, muscle aches, stiff neck, or even seizure in some cases. And to look for these recalled products, they come with the established number 12612. And that number, you'll find it inside the USDA mark of inspection. And those are the products that have been recalled. But, Phil, think about it. We're at back-to-school time. Many people might have these deli meats and their refrigerators for their kids' school lunches, for instance. So, make sure to check products. And if you do have a recalled product, throw it out, Phil.",
