But this all comes as the president all the way down -- what do you think of, the Defense Department and State Department, they have been in deep contact with their Israeli counterparts since Saturday. The president himself has spoken twice with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer unwavering support. He told Netanyahu there would be additional assistance coming to them soon.

      "sentences": "I think this is in a way an extreme continuation of the policy that Israel has had in place for many years in relation to Gaza. This is Israel reverting to what happens whenever there are the usual kinds of escalations that have been going on for many years, mainly since 2009. But remember, Gaza has been under a form of closure for a -- yes, closures blockade since about two -- since 2007.And every time there's around of fighting, Israel bombards, and then sometimes there is a ground incursion. And every time Israeli policymakers raise this dilemma about what to do if Israel wants to completely control Hamas. Are they supposed to reoccupy Gaza? Apparently, no Israeli government truly wants to do that, or they would have done it. And this is the same dilemma in the absolute extreme because the hardliners in government and in the public, of course, are calling for you know complete devastation of Gaza. The defense minister has already said it will be completely shut down, no water, no food, no fuel, no electricity. There has been already an 80 percent electricity cut. Those are the policies that have been in place this whole time. And, frankly, it's an enormous question Israel is going to be having to ask itself, if not a failure of both intelligence and the security policy that this terror attack happened. I mean, this is the biggest -- I don't need to reiterate that this is the biggest terror attack in Israel ever. It is slaughter. And Israelis -- you know, the Israeli government might be planning for a ground attack. We know for sure. I have doubts that the Israeli government still has any plan to reoccupy Gaza because there's no -- there's no future in which Israel can continue to reoccupy Gaza in any serious way. And so, this is the continuation of the same cycle that we've seen for years.",

In the meantime, you have this attack, how does the attack change things? And do you think that because there has been so much turmoil politically in Israel with several different governments coming up and being brought down, that they may have missed what was about to happen that the intelligence failures may have anything to do with that?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, this is certainly an accusation that is being made, or this is something that many citizens feel. And you're absolutely right to spotlight the very you know divisive protests that have been going on all year. What we did see was that there's no -- there's no division over -- of opinion over this the nature of this attack. At the very immediate level, this is a terror attack against Israeli civilians, and therefore everybody, including everybody who has -- people who are at the protests, anybody who was called up no matter what they feel about the government went immediately and everybody -- Israelis who are not serving in the army are all rallying to help with the wounded and the -- and the trauma that -- (AUDIO GAP)So, in the immediate sense, Israelis are completely united over how to cope with the devastation right now. But already we see the divisions surfacing. You know, part of the public is saying that the -- what we see the government doing is that we need to simply be more hardline, crush Gaza, crush Hamas, never mind the consequences. And a good portion of Israeli society, we have no way to know how many are saying that this is happening in part because of exactly what you just said, the government has been single-mindedly focused even obsessive about its attempt to undermine the Israeli judiciary over the course of the whole year given that that sparked an enormous social protest against it. The government then became focused on the protests and has been neglecting numerous areas of governance. And you know, many people jumping to the conclusion that they have also been you know, neglecting in a very, very severe way with severe consequences, security, and intelligence. But this probably -- this intelligence failure probably goes beyond to be honest because it is such a colossal failure of intelligence.",
