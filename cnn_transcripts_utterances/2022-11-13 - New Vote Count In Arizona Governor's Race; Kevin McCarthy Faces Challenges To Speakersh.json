With votes still being counted in 20 races Republicans are in the lead with 211 seats. The GOP needs seven more to win the majority. Now Democrats have achieved what seemed almost inconceivable just a few days ago. CNN projects they will retain control of the Senate. Now at any moment in Arizona we're expecting a huge new batch of voting numbers from Maricopa County. The new tally could have a huge impact on one of the most watched governor's races in the country. Trump firebrand Kari Lake trails Katie Hobbs. So let's begin this hour in Arizona. CNN's Kyung Lah, she has been reporting in Arizona for years. She is one of the best people to help us explain what is going on there right now. Kyung, what's the latest?",

That is going to be the largest category of votes number-wise since election night, since the big first results came out. So this will really give us some sense of where this race is heading.It is still too early to call this race between the Republican Kari Lake and the Democrat Katie Hobbs. Democrat Katie Hobbs has been leading just by inches, and so this may be -- this is what it may be coming down to, Paula. So some time in this hour, perhaps in the next 30 minutes or so, we are anticipating that this clarifies it just a little bit. And the reason why we are paying such close attention to this particular batch of votes is because this is where the Lake campaign says they have their path. This is it, the mail ballots that were returned on election day, it is anticipated, according to the campaign, to lean their way. If it does not, it is going to give us an indication of how the rest of this could potentially go. So we are anxiously awaiting this. The tabulation is still continuing for all of these ballots. The curing process of just a very small number of votes, just about 10,000 or so, Paula, that is continuing as well. And that's simply trying to track down some of those signature verified -- the ballots that they were not able to signature verify and make sure that those ballots are connected to real people. So stay tuned. In the next 30 minutes to an hour we're going to certainly have a better picture of this very, very tight race -- Paula.",

I mean, A, we aren't going to know the answer to the question if Republicans actually are going to be in control of the House for possibly a few more days. But the House Republicans are going to be holding leadership elections on Tuesday, and there's no doubt there is a serious challenge to Kevin McCarthy's leadership.At this point no one has emerged as necessarily one rival. But as we have seen in speaker elections and leadership elections in years past, this can move very, very quickly. So Kevin McCarthy I'm told has been working the phones throughout the weekend, trying to shore up support, and he has considerable support of course from some hard liners like Jim Jordan, obviously his longtime colleague Steve Scalise as well. But there certainly is a question of how much support he has out there and what he will have to do in order to assure the votes, what concessions he'll have to make even to get the job. But of course as most things still do in the Republican Party things revolve around the former president, Donald Trump. And of course he has a big announcement on Tuesday. I'm told that Kevin McCarthy still speaks very regularly to the former president. He has been over the weekend as well. So we will see if there's any signals from that coming. But this is certainly a tense moment for Kevin McCarthy. [20:05:01] He did not expect the majority, if they get one, would be this small. So this is something he's been waiting for and wanting for a long time. He had a narrow shot at the speakership several years ago, did not get that. So certainly on the House and Senate side this week big election, leadership elections, so we do not know, of course, how this is going to play. But he's just trying to keep his base happy and, you know, all these questions at bay.",

You know, I've been following this race, and when I looked at it at the end of last week what you essentially had was I believe a two-point race.So you've seen this more and more mail-in ballots have come in the 13th District. You've seen the Democrat Adam Gray closing, closing, closing. There's also the 22nd District which I think kind of gets at how this path is for Democrats. And what you see in the 22nd District is you see right now Rudy Salas down by five points. But again, look, well, less than 50 percent of the estimated vote in. David Valadao was up by eight points when I was covering this race at the end of last week. And keep in mind, the 22nd District or at least what now is the 22nd District back in 2018.

So take a look here in Arizona where obviously Kyung Lah is, and you can see that right now you have the Democrat up by a little less than a point. But David Schweikert, the incumbent, has been closing, closing, closing.So basically what Democrats have to do is they have to win those seats where they're trailing and then they have to hold on to seats like this. That's not the easiest thing.

The voters of color overwhelmingly voted for Raphael Warnock, 81 percent. He also did very well with that younger vote, the 18 to 29-year-olds. And then look, 68 percent of urban voters supported Raphael Warnock. I want you to hear from Raphael Warnock and hear from his Republican challenger Herschel Walker as they got out this weekend to try to rally the vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: I'm reaching out to the folks who didn't vote for me the last time. Maybe they voted for the libertarian candidate. Maybe they voted for Herschel Walker. And I want you to ask yourself a serious question, who do you think is really ready and who do you think is fit? HERSCHEL WALKER (R), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: You voted the last time, go vote for me again. Or tell the people that didn't vote for me they need to vote for me.

But by state law we cannot have it on Thursday, Thanksgiving, Friday is a state holiday and Saturday is following a Thursday holiday so you can't have any voting then under state law.

So for those 30 days from the original cut off for the November election, anybody who registered like anybody who moved to the state who got their driver's license they're automatically registering, they're allowed to vote in the runoffs.So there really is 30 additional days of registration beyond what was there, but there has to be a cut off in the way our system is built. So it's a little bit quirky, but, again, there's a whole 30 days people who register from there -- when the rules are the rules and the laws are laws everybody knows that. Somebody complained what if you're 18? In Georgia you can start this process if you're 17 1/2, and if you did you're registered. So there's some responsibility on the voters in this thing.

Stacey Abrams has lost the state to Governor Kemp by 55,000 votes four years ago. But this time Governor Kemp won by 300,000 votes. And my boss, Secretary Raffensperger won by 368,000 votes. I think voters are discerning, and you saw that in the difference -- in about 200,000 vote difference between what Governor Kemp got and what Herschel Walker got.

And going into these races, though, a lot of people thought that President Biden was really a liability for the candidates, but how much credit does he deserve for the Senate control?LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, a lot of Democrats are giving him credit including Senator Elizabeth Warren I think today was out there saying that Democrats should credit him because of the fact that he was really crystallizing they think the argument heading into the final stretch. A lot of people did doubt what he was focusing on, and Biden was focusing on what he and his administration had been doing they think to help America's pocketbooks but also abortion access and threats to democracy. Those were two of the biggest arguments from the president and from a number of other Democrats. And there was a question about whether or not those two focuses would actually help vulnerable Democrats. Now I -- although some of the polls didn't always show that that was top of mind for voters. When I was traveling in Michigan and when I was talking to some voters in Pennsylvania, it was very clear that abortion access was front and center for a lot of those voters. In Michigan there was a ballot measure, an abortion ballot measure in that state along with four other states, but in Pennsylvania some of the voters that I was talking to in the lead up were saying that they were squarely focused on abortion, it was motivating Democrats. And they also brought up democracy a lot and their fear about all of these election lies that was a common theme as Mark mentioned across states. It wasn't just in Arizona. There were election deniers up and down the ballot in Michigan. There were some in Pennsylvania, and across the board they appear to have lost. I don't think that that means, though, that election lies are going to go away at all because we see that the former president is continuing to spread those lies.",

But also I think it's important for the state of Georgia. You know, Senator Warnock and Herschel Walker have been running their campaigns very differently. They're very different candidates. And really key to Senator Warnock's re-election argument is that he is willing to work with Republicans, right? We are living in a very polarizing time, and we don't hear that a lot. We don't hear candidates center as core to their re-election argument that they want to work with the other party. And so does this work? Is he successful?

It's also the case that the world has been undergoing I would say a big case of, you know, super power shock the last few years as it's become clear that the extent of America's internal political problems are also affecting its ability to lead on the world stage. And I think, you know, for many people one of the big questions when you meet with President Biden is well, you know, what's the point of making an agreement with Biden if in two years or four years you're simply going to see a new government, a new administration come in like that of Donald Trump that's going to throw out agreements that the United States had made? And so I think one of those questions that world leaders have is America -- you know, does it have a national foreign policy or just a partisan foreign policy? So that helps. I also think the other issue that's on the agenda here is Ukraine, and I think that's something that I think President Biden is going to bring up with Xi if only to point out that the U.S. sticks by its friends and that, you know, Russia has not done very well with its territorial war of aggression.",

She's a hostage of the Putin government because she's the most high-profile one they have, not one to be let go of lightly.And I think the fact that they just transferred her to Russian penal colony this week is obviously grim news and it doesn't suggest that any kind of release is going to be happening anytime soon.",

All right, Michael, are you surprised that the former president will be making this announcement this week? MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Not at all. I think that Donald Trump really only has one or two gears, and they both are forward. He doesn't have any reverse. So he's got to move forward. He's going to declare for the presidency I think in part because he foreshadowed a couple of weeks ago when he gave a speech. And if you watch what happened actually to Jason Miller a few days before he said he was sure Trump would announce, the same fellow was saying he shouldn't, he should delay.

He's counting on this idea, and it's reflected in the Office of Legal Counsel decision related to prosecuting presidents, that a former president who's running for office or any major candidate for office should not be prosecuted during the campaign. Now I don't think that this is necessarily going to hold in this case because the federal government has been investigating him for a couple of years. I think Merrick Garland, the attorney general, has delayed in order to get past the midterm. But he's not going to let evidence of a crime go unprosecuted. So I think he's mistaken in that way. I also think he's planning on a huge uprising should he be prosecuted. And I'm not sure that's going happen either.

But his brand of extremism has met its expiration date. And a lot of Republicans are looking for him to move forward. They do not want him involved in the Georgia Senate race because he got involved in the runoff election two years ago and cost us two Senate seats that lost us the balance of power or the majority in the Senate.
