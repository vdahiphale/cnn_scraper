But that was in exchange for around 80 Israeli hostages.So less hostages for the same amount of pause. Looks like they're trying to sweeten the deal. It would include the rest of the women, according to this report from Axios that Hamas is holding. You'll remember the reason why the talks broke down last time, one of the reasons was because Israel believed Hamas was still holding a number of women and refused to release them, so that would indicate fulfilling the terms of the previous deal. Also men over 60 and anyone in urgent need of medical care. And it is, in a sense, a quick turnaround because just last week, Max, we heard that Israel had canceled a meeting between the Mossad chief and Qatari officials. That was later reinstated. At the time, an Israeli official told CNN that they didn't believe the conditions were right to restart the talks. Obviously then on Friday, we got the accidental killing by Israel of those three hostages. So it seems like that might have been part of the trigger point here to push them towards advancing this deal. But of course, there's no guarantee the U.S. -- the Israeli ambassador to the US said look it's on the table. There's no guarantee that it will actually happen and Hamas has indicated not in response to this latest Reported offer but it has indicated that it's not wanting to do anything unless Israel stops its war in Gaza.",

Many of their drones and ballistic missiles have been intercepted. The Houthis claim they're supporting Hamas and the Palestinians by targeting vessels that are linked to Israel. And Houthi forces say they won't stop until Israel lets more food and medicine into Gaza. While Houthi rebels may not be able to pose a direct threat to Israel, their actions could jolt the global economy. Maersk and other shipping giants are already re-routing their vessels, sending them along the coast of Africa via the Cape of Good Hope.

And then because of the insecurity of how this will happen and how available freight will be, we've already started to see the -- the freight rates and box rates for this type of transit to increase quite a bit. Over the weekend we had the Far East Mediterranean rates up roughly 20 percent.And that is set to continue as long as there is risk to disruption here, which I think is the main driver from the logistics provider side. Now that's on the container side. I think it's also very interesting to mention that of course there are other types of cargo that pass through the canal. For the time being, it has been the containers that have been leading the move outside of Suez, but you've also had some of the main tanker companies and also the energy companies saying that they want to redirect their ships outside of the Suez Canal. And that, of course, has a direct impact on the cost of oil or oil products and the security of such into, for instance, Europe. And that in itself could also add additional costs to this.

Now a lower court oversaw a trial in this case.The lower court found that Trump engaged in an insurrection, but they said presidents are not specifically mentioned in that section three of the 14th amendment, so they said it didn't apply. But here the Supreme Court looking instead at the intent behind this amendment, looking at the overall objective of what they were trying to do when they were working on the language of this specific section. Now the issue there is that the Trump campaign, the Trump team, they've made it clear. They're going to appeal this to the Supreme Court. This decision will likely be on pause until the Supreme Court weighs in one way or another. But this decision, which is largely based on intent and larger objective, is likely headed to a Supreme Court that is dominated right now by originalists, textualists, judges who pride themselves on looking at the specific literal words in the Constitution. So may not be the most favorable environment for this Supreme Court of Colorado decision. But again, it's unclear if the Supreme Court will take this up. They likely will want to resolve this issue because otherwise you're going to have this hanging over all 50 states and undecided. And if the Supreme Court weighs in, that decision would be binding across the country. But the Trump team says they're going to appeal swiftly.

Now, Eagle Pass, Texas is the epicenter of the immigration crisis in the United States right now.

If you look over my shoulder, you'll see that these are men, women, children who are waiting right now out in the cold to be transported for processing. And what you're looking at right now is a federal issue in the United States. It's up to the federal government to apprehend these individuals, process them and hold them. But Texas Governor Greg Abbott has just signed a bill known as SB4 that would -- that has created a new state law for illegal entry into the United States. And what that means is, is the images that you're looking at right now could turn into a state issue. Now I've talked to state leaders all along the border who are very concerned about this. Why? Because it's going to cost their communities money. I talked to the sheriff here in Maverick County and he says that his deputies don't have training in immigration law and that he doesn't have space in his jail to house all of these individuals is jail can only house 250 individuals there's already 180 in custody and there's thousands of people behind me so why is all this happening and why is there this bottleneck. Well right now there's about 23,000 migrants in border patrol custody and holding capacity is only 10,000. So do the math. There is an overwhelming number of migrants who are in custody right now, and it has created this bottleneck, which raises the question, why? What's happening? Why is this different? I'll tell you why. There's a few factors. Of course, the capacity issue, the flow issue. There's a lot of migrants who are coming to the United States from all around the world. And then there's this, the Biden administration is trying to implement and use legal consequences for illegal entry into the United States. And what they're doing in certain processing areas along the U.S. southern border is using something called enhanced expedited removal. And what that means is that asylum officers make a determination on a migrant's case while the migrant is in custody, which means that migrants are spending more time in custody. And as I mentioned, they only have holding capacity for about 10,000. They're already holding 23,000. migrants and so what this is doing is it's testing the infrastructure on the U.S. southern border. Rosa Flores, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's mostly rural, often mountainous and sparsely populated despite the epicenter being only some 60 miles or so away from the provincial capital of Gansu.

Their remit from the IDF is blurring the lines as settlers encroach on Palestinian land. Like here, in the Palestinian village of Tuwani, where there's a settlement at the top of the hill. In this video, you see men in military fatigues. The IDF equips both civilian settlers' security squads and soldiers in the region. As you can see here, it's almost impossible to differentiate.
