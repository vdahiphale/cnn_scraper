This is coming from Kyiv city local officials that say that hypersonic missiles have been fired. These are Kinzel missiles that have been fired towards the capital. They say that their air defense systems are working, but they're calling on all families to take shelter.So a great deal of terror and fear in the capital this morning, but straight to those front lines, Kim, of course where Ukrainian officials say that Russian troops are making an attempt to pull them, to distract them from that southern front, which of course has been key for Kyiv's fight in this counter-offensive towards the north, towards Kharkiv. In fact, so intense has the Russian assault been towards the Kharkiv region that one city, Kopiansk, has had to order mandatory evacuations for all residents. Officials there saying that the city has been saying that the city has been struck by air assaults, dozens of times a day. Kyiv's troops saying that Russia has sent in troop reinforcements, airborne division reinforcements, trying again to pull Ukraine's focus towards the north. And that's really what we're seeing throughout this conflict, of course, Kim. It yet again presents that issue of these very long front lines, hundreds of miles of active fighting where Ukrainian forces are stretched very thin and consistently trying to react to Russian air superiority, which has continued, of course, to hold Ukraine back in certain areas. And that means there's very few gains that we've seen in recent months since the launch of this counteroffensive. While at the same time with very few successes in hand again, President Biden going to Congress asking for more help, more support, $24 billion in additional aid that includes humanitarian assistance and security assistance. He's absolutely set for a showdown in Congress this fall, Kim.",

That's not to say that all Republicans are against additional funding to Ukraine. In fact, some, of course, have continued to call for additional assistance, saying it's absolutely imperative for the safety and security and future of NATO to counter Russian aggression on the ground. Joe Biden, of course, President Biden, of course, already trying to sell this new aid package. A White House spokesperson saying, look, just think of the cost of this. We are fighting, providing help for the fight for Ukraine at the same time. This gives NATO what it needs on the ground against Russian aggression.
