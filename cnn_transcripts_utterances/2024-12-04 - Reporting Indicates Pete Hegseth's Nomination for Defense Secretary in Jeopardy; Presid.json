The families of transgender kids fighting against a Tennessee ban on gender affirming care for minors. Big implications far beyond Tennessee.

We've got brand new reporting on sort of the back and forth that's been happening behind the scenes already between Trump and DeSantis and how Trump feels about all this. We are standing by to hear from DeSantis. We are standing by to hear from Hegseth for his first interview since new allegations of sexual misconduct and drinking and more. We're standing by to hear from Hegseth's mother on TV after an e-mail surfaced where she expressed alarm over her sons treatment of women. But again, new reporting on where Ron DeSantis fits in all of this.Let's get right to Florida man Steve Contorno. The twists and turns here, some new developments, Steve.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, this is really a set of blockbuster meetings today on Capitol Hill, Kate. And that is because before this moment Pete Hegseth had met with several friendly members, people who were close to Donald Trump. Today is really a huge test. He's going to meet with the incoming Republican leader, John Thune. That is going to be a very important meeting. He is also going to be meeting with Roger Wicker, who is the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He is going to be running those confirmation hearings if Hegseth gets to that day in January.We also expect that one of the closest meetings to watch is going to be that meeting with Joni Ernst. That is because she has been very careful about whether or not she supports Pete Hegseth. She has not said publicly where she stands on this nomination, instead saying that she was looking forward to this meeting today. But she's also important because she sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. She is a woman on that committee. She has spoken publicly about experiencing sexual assault. She also is someone who has spoken very vocally about women serving in combat, something she supports. That obviously is an issue for Pete Hegseth given some of his past commentary on women serving in combat roles. So this is going to be a really critical day. Also, he's going to be meeting with Senator Kevin Cramer, another member of the Armed Services Committee, who has made clear he has questions about some of these issues in Hegseth's background. And so you can expect that these are not going to be meetings where some of these tougher issues don't come up. That is what we saw on Monday evening when he had met with a series of Republicans who said, one after another, that these issues about the alleged sexual assault that Pete Hegseth denies didn't come up. They also said the issues that were raised in \"The New Yorker\" story about excessive drinking did not come up. So I think that that is something that is just really going to be key today, that these are not the kind of easy-breezy meetings that he might have experienced in the past, Kate.",

I can't imagine ever stopping anyone, especially our youth, from lifesaving health care. But what it entails is mental health access. It entails medicine. And it helps kids be themselves.

Trans people have been around forever. This has become a political issue. This isn't about health care. This isn't about trans people. This is about politicians politicizing the LGBTQ community for their own gains. And I think what this does is pull us back and actually hurt trans youth because they need this health care. It's medically important.And now these days, over half the states in the United States have banned health care for trans youth. So from 2020 from zero, to now almost half across the country, you can see trans kids have been around forever, but now they're being politicized.

I will say that the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, wrote a decision on transgender rights just a few years ago that basically granted transgender rights, or upheld transgender rights in the workplace. So you have a Supreme Court here that has ruled in favor in a different case on transgender rights here.

So I am concerned about the Supreme Court, the makeup of the Supreme Court, what they did with Roe v. Wade. So I hope it's not the case, but \"I hope\" is not a strategy. And I think what we've seen in this past political cycle of hundreds of thousands of -- millions and millions, excuse me, of dollars being spent on ads, anti-trans ads during Donald Trump's candidacy, has a big effect on the culture and the thought and the feeling. When you live in a world where only 30 percent of Americans say they know someone who's transgender, 70 percent are making it -- making decisions about trans people through culture.",

And, you know, at the very least, now the whole world is talking about South Korea's political difficulties. Yoon has raised this to a level of debate that wasn't taking place beforehand.
