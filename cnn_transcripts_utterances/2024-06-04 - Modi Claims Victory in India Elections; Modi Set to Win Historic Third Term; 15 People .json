The U.S. president takes action on the southern border with sweeping new restrictions in a move that echoes measures attempted by the Trump administration. Dome dangers.

We speak to the startup combining robots and bees to make Japanese strawberries right here in the United States. That conversation and much more coming up. But first, the Indian election results are in, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi set for a historic third term. But votes for his own party fell far short of expectations. The BJP Party losing its outright majority in parliament for the first time in a decade. And one particularly painful loss, Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, home to more than 200 million people, including Modi himself and a former BJP stronghold. The stock market too, as I mentioned, had an immediate reaction with the Sensex suffering its worst day in four years. Losing ground, I should say, from a record high. Ivan Watson joins us now from New Delhi. Ivan, good to have you with us. A huge stock, I think that accounts for the stock market reaction.

WATSON (on camera):  Right. Well, some of the big infrastructure projects that Modi has liked to champion, presumably, it might get a little bit trickier if he's got to work with coalition partners to try to get some of that done and pushed through. And Modi does not have a long track record of really engaging in the deal making and compromises that of everyday parliamentary politics. And I do think, you know, just judging anecdotally by some conversations I had with rank-and-file supporters, I do think that there is a perception, even among some of those fans of Narendra Modi, that he may have overreached. I spoke with a 25-year-old supporter at the BJP headquarters here in New Delhi, and he said that there are a lot of people in India who were annoyed at the BJP government, the past won, that it was making monopolistic decisions, as he put it. Decisions that this supporter liked, but that he acknowledged were irritating other people. And that may have to curtail some of the more controversial decisions that -- and policies that Modi has pursued in the past. The Hindu nationalist rhetoric that he has pursued, how can he follow that if he's in a coalition with a secular party or a network of secular parties?

Biden's new executive actions on immigration allow the government to ban migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum, which has changed to a decades long policy. The new rules apply from midnight tonight. The president did, however, also acknowledge that more work is needed.

What this action does is shut off asylum access for migrants crossing the border illegally if a daily threshold of 2,500 is met, and that has already been met. And for that reason, this will start to take effect at midnight tonight. That means that authorities can turn migrants away back to Mexico or to their origin country. Now, there are some exemptions for unaccompanied migrant children, as well as people with vulnerabilities, especially those who are victims of severe human trafficking, that according to the administration. But they are already being met with fierce backlash from progressives and members of their own party who say this is far too similar to what Donald Trump tried to do in 2018. The ACLU also saying that they plan to challenge this in court. And the courts are exactly what stopped President Biden's predecessor the last time around. Now, President Biden addressed that criticism in his remarks, saying that they should be patient, and noting that American's patience has already been wearing thin. Of course, immigration being an issue, a top issue for American voters going into the November election. So, all of this amounts to a significant policy shift from 2021 for this White House, which started by saying that they wanted to reform access to - - or reform the asylum system and now, may -- taking measures to shut it off, given the situation on the border and saying that the current situation is simply not tenable.

Obviously, there must be a conversation prior to the announcement, but he didn't explain what role will Mexico have in helping the United States implement these policies. What he said is that he's not worried about deportations. He said this is something that happens all the time, that they can deal with that. He also assured Mexicans that the border will not be shut down. You know, we keep hearing that word, as Priscilla explained, that is going to apply to people who are detained at the border. They will be deported quickly, not shutting the legal crossing into the United States. The Mexican government, they said, they would have more details about this later on. We are still waiting for those details. Meanwhile, we did talk to some migrants in the southern state of Chiapas, which is the entry point for many of the ones coming from South and Central America. And quite frankly, they were not concerned. They basically told us, you know, policies changed, they do one thing, they change it, they put something else, it goes away. They say they will continue their journey and try to get into the United States. What could happen is that, what we've seen, the reason the numbers are so high is because migrants knew that if they turned themselves into immigration authorities once they crossed over, they might be processed and allowed to stay in the United States while they waited for an appointment for asylum. Now, knowing that they would be deported, they perhaps are going to try to avoid authority, still get into the United States. We would just know about them because they would not be caught.",

Navalny died in a Russian prison earlier this year. Hundreds attended a tribute concert in Berlin on what would have been his 48th birthday. His widow and former team members were all in attendance, and they said the revenue from tickets would be donated to other Russian political prisoners.

So, actually right now, and most of the retail stores, including, you know, whole foods, we are -- a pack of our berries thatcontain somewhere between on average eight to sometimes even 20 berries, depending on how big the berries are, we retail for $9.99. So, I think we're a little bit cheaper than what you've described. But still, it is still a little more expensive than your conventional berries. But to your point, it's always the same quality, and it is 100 percent pesticide free, and it's probably the most sustainable strawberry that you can find on the market. And as we're scaling this operation, we went from $50 to $10 or $9.99 in the past five years alone. So, you can probably imagine where we might get to another five years.",

And if you see the scale of our facility that we just announced, it's the size of several football fields. So, it's massive. And we can supply to probably, you know, a couple of thousand stores from that single location. And so, we definitely can keep on building these facilities around the world where there is enough consumers.

He actually won that contest but says he can't compete in Wednesday's quarterfinal. We wish him well.
