Florida man, Donald Trump, free on $200,000 bail after turning himself in on racketeering charges.Today after Vladimir Putin is widely suspected to have ordered Yevgeniy Prigozhin's death, Russian President Publicly mourns the death of the head of the Wagner group, describing him as a talented businessman. And for the first time since the war began, Ukrainian special forces stage a lightning raid in Russian occupied Crimea. Disgrace former U.S. President Donald Trump has now racked up his fourth arrest in less than five months. This time though, it was different. In Fulton, Georgia, he was booked, fingerprinted and photographed. His hair was listed as Bond or Strawberry, height at 6 feet, 3 inches, weight, 215 pounds, inmate number P01135809. It's the first time ever mugshot of a former U.S. President. Sources say Trump wanted to appear defiant. He chose not to smile. He's charged with more than a dozen felony counts, stemming from his efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election results. He's now free on $200,000 bond, covered with a 10% down payment to an Atlanta bonding company, according to sources. The entire process took about 20 minutes. Then the former president headed back to the airport just outside of Atlanta for his flight back to New Jersey. He railed against the charges in Georgia, as well as federal charges of trying to subvert the 2020 election and mishandling of classified documents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What has taken place here is the travesty of justice. We did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. And everybody knows it. I've never had such support. And that goes with the other ones, too. What they're doing is election interference. They're trying to interfere with an election. There's never been anything like it in our country before. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The district attorney, Fani Willis, has said she would like to do the arraignments for all 19 defendants the week of September 5th.Now in his federal cases, this all happened at once. He was processed, and then he went before a judge to enter his plea. But here in Georgia, things happen at a slightly different pace. Now, after that initial week or two of arraignments, the defendants actually only have a short window of time to file certain challenges to their case. Several defendants, including Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, they've already challenged their cases, trying to get these state-level cases moved to federal court. Now, the former president has signaled that he will likely try to do the same. Rudy Giuliani, they also try that move. So that process will take quite some time to play out. The next thing that's going to happen though is on Monday, there will be a hearing for Mark Meadows' effort to move this to federal court. We expect that the focus of that hearing is going to be that infamous call between former president Trump and former Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The district attorney, Fani Willis, has dismissed any suggestion by Meadows that what he was doing was just part of his job as Chief of Staff and that this should be not prosecuted. Now, it'll be interesting to see what the judge does here, but if Meadows does not succeed, he will be back with the other defendants here in Fulton County as this case proceeds. But for a RICO case of this size and complexity, it could take years for a final resolution. Paula Reid, Fulton County, Georgia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He was widely seen as a man on borrowed time. As footage started to emerge on social media of the crash, CNN's open- source team began piecing together what happened. The aircraft associated with Prigozhin is RA02795. It makes frequent trips between Moscow and St. Petersburg.CNN geolocated the main crash site to here. And you can see the same tail number visible amid the debris. The plane had left Moscow at 5.55 p.m. local time, 12 minutes later, the location is no longer detectable. But public flight tracking site Flight Radar 24 still receives information on its altitude. (On camera): The last minute of the recorded flight is key. You can see here the flight's altitude is erratic. It's going higher and lower before it eventually plummets. No aviation experts told us this is highly unusual. And it suggests those on board were trying to stabilize the plane after something happened to it. In other words, the disruption was not big enough to obliterate everyone and everything instantly. (Voice-over): Expert opinion is split on what exactly happened, likely an explosion, perhaps a bomb on board or a missile hitting it, or even something else. Whatever it was, was clearly powerful as the plane is visibly falling without a wing. The tail ends up over here, 2.6 km away from where the rest of the debris lands. Videos show fires at the crash site. Some are graphic. Human remains strewn amid the debris. Since then, Russian authorities have taken the bodies away for examination and began an investigation. But many have already made up their minds as to who they think was behind the Wagner aircraft's violent end. Katie Polglase, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I think it's fair to say in the eyes of many Western officials in the mind of Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is a very important part of their occupation of Ukraine because it was the first area they took in 2014 almost without a shot being fired annexed through troops infiltrating.What Ukraine is suggesting is that a series of amphibious assaults hit the Crimean coastline and may have killed up to 30 Russian troops, essentially attacking their infrastructure and more importantly impacting their psychology, showing that even Crimea, which I think most Russians consider to be far enough away from the actual front lines of fighting, is now vulnerable to Ukrainian special forces assault. That's an important message for Ukraine to send because it has been criticized in Western media reports for focusing too much on Crimea. Ukraine's response I think would have been that so much of Russian military infrastructure is in that peninsula and that helps Russia defend its positions in the front parts of the areas of Ukraine's southern counter offensive. But this statement from Ukraine, essentially coming on Ukraine's Independence Day, a bid to project force, depth of how far they can hit Russian targets that may have thought they were secure otherwise. And also too feeding in to the broader discussion about how Yevgeniy Prigozhin appears to have died in mysterious, if not deeply suspicious circumstances. Remember the death of Prigozhin is not by itself isolated from the war in Ukraine. It's another reminder for Ukrainians that Prigozhin led an armed rebellion against Putin, fought heavily in Ukraine for Russia and some of the more brutal front lines, but also too that Putin, if indeed he is somehow involved in this death, still feels a threat internally because of how Prigozhin negatively characterized how this war had been prosecuted. A lot's moving here on Ukraine's Independence Day, but battlefield changes certainly what Kyiv wanted to project as the world asks exactly what happened to Yevgeniy Prigozhin.

The Fulton County Jail, it is also known as Rice Street because of its address. The facility opened in 1989, and almost from the moment it opened, it became obsolete and overcrowded. Just last month, the Justice Department announced an investigation into this facility because of allegations of, \"unsafe, unsanitary living conditions, excessive force, and violence.\"As for the overcrowding, the capacity of this facility is 2,688 inmates. As of April, according to the state of Georgia, it has 3,221 inmates. According to various news reports, seven inmates died at the facility just this year, about 15 inmates died last year. And there was a notorious case of an inmate who passed away in his cell last September, 35-year -old Lashawn Thompson. The medical examiners and Lashawn Thompson's family's attorneys say that he died of neglect, malnourishment, and other poor treatment. He was in the mental ward at that hospital. Most noteworthy about his case was that his body was found covered in lice, bedbugs, and other insects, just horrible images released there. Lashawn Thompson's family's attorney has also released a photo of the conditions inside his cell that just showed absolutely deplorable conditions. All over this jail, there is grime, there is dirt, there are overflowing toilets. One -- another really horrible anecdote regarding this jail is that last year, during a public meeting, law enforcement officers rolled in to the meeting a wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow was full of shanks that were made by the inmates by grabbing just chunks of crumbling walls in the facility and fashioning them into shanks to attack other inmates. That's how bad this facility got. The Sheriff of Fulton County, Patrick Labat, is completely admitting these conditions are horrible. He says he's welcoming the Justice Department's investigation, and Sheriff Labat is requesting about $2 billion in county funds to build a new jail. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
