We've seen in video large objects being thrown, people being beaten. The LAPD has arrived on the scene, but they have yet to significantly intervene. And California's governor says he's monitoring the situation there. Take a look at these live pictures there as these campus protests are escalating.Donald Trump did weigh in on the scene that unfolded on Columbia's campus last night as police cleared Hamilton Hall.

If you go back a year or go back three or four or five years ago, this would not even be possible to think about. Nobody would be thinking this could happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That, of course, David Chalian, was Donald Trump weighing in on this. I was trying to kind of get a sense of what the White House had to say about this yesterday. And it was actually a paper statement from Andrew Bates, the spokesman. And we heard from John Kirby in an off-camera gaggle. Now, they did say, \"forcibly taking over buildings isn't peaceful, its wrong. Hate speech and hate symbols have no place in America.\" This is, obviously, and I think the fact that there's nothing on camera from them reflects the difficult position that they are in politically as this unfolds.",

It's at the bottom. And so for the Biden campaign, I think what they will try to do is bring the focus back to what Donald Trump said in his \"Time\" interview about abortion and women being, you know, prosecuted under - in a - during a second Trump term, if they try to seek reproductive health care. So, you know, in some ways that communications effort here, yes, is absolutely, people want to see leadership. And again, I think Biden's been very clear about renouncing and condemning the anti-Semitic nature of some of these protests. But, you know, from a communications perspective, they also want to move the conversation back to issues that are stronger for Biden, but also, you know, that people say have a more direct impact on their day-to-day lives.",

They're - this is a combination of hate and loss of control, right? And so, there's this kind of anarchy feeling about it in America. Like, no one - no one's at the wheel and - which kind of goes back to the Republican theme about the Biden administration not really having a grasp on what's going on.

If we don't win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of the election. I don't believe they'll be able to do the things they did last time. I don't think they'll be able to get away with it.\" David Chalian, whether or not there's going to be violence depends on the fairness of the election.

Late last night, things turned very violent between the two sides. We saw large objects thrown, people being beaten. They were fighting for several hours before the police arrived on the scene. We've now learned that California's governor is monitoring the situation. And CNN's Stephanie Elam joins us live from campus. Stephanie, the last time we talked to you we saw the lines of police.

Now, keep in mind, where we're standing here, this is the line of police officers here on - if you were entering off - from the eastern side of campus, just to kind of give you an idea.But if you look down through there, if you look down through there, you can see on the other side, that is where you'll see the encampment. And so what - how this has been broken up here on campus is you have this side, which is the pro-Israeli demonstrators, and then cross the other side there's a barricade, there's a walkway, and then there's another barricade. And on the other side of that is where you'll find the pro-Palestinian demonstrators on that side and the encampment. So, what we have seen is we've seen some people being pushed out just now coming out of the center of this grassy area. We've also seen the police increase their line and move it up a bit here as well. So, we have seen some movement. It got quiet for a while and it seems like it is right now. But we've heard some chanting from the pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the last few moments here. But definitely there does seem to be more of a presence here. We've seen out here, where we're standing, that there have been arguments between people. And there is this one woman who's walking around actively separating them to try to just keep people and the high tensions apart, separating them. Something that we've seen. I mean we've seen people who were agitating throughout the night. We saw people playing loud music. We saw fireworks being thrown out here. We saw people using whatever they could find to toss at the other side. And what's still not clear is what turned everything from when we were out here all day yesterday, which it was relatively calm, I mean, and I should also point out that the vast majority of campus is very calm. I walked around. People are out studying. They're readings, sitting. It was a beautiful day yesterday. They were sitting on the grass. This is the area that has been the point of contention. So, what happened from the day, where we did see they were unloading more barricades and bringing them out, and what led to what happened here overnight. It's still unclear what has gone on here. But what we have seen from the aerials, what we have seen from here on the ground as we have seen people from both sides engaging and then people trying to break them up. But all night long there were these skirmishes. There were people really going at each other. Now that energy does seem to be changing now that we have this - this police presence here.",
