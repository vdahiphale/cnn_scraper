Hello, I'm Isa Soares coming to you from London, and welcome to our continuing coverage of the war in Israel. And a very good evening. The US president telling Israel you are not alone and warning the country not to be consumed by rage. Joe Biden was welcomed to Tel Aviv with a hug from Benjamin Netanyahu. During this historic visit, he also met with members of the prime minister's war cabinet. The second leg of his trip, a Summit with Arab leaders in Jordan was abruptly canceled. That meeting was to include the presence of Egypt and the Palestinian Authority. Jordan called it off after Tuesday's hospital blast. In Tel Aviv, President Biden said he understood Israel's pain after the attack by Hamas and he told Israelis they faced tough choices ahead. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, the sirens going off, then we hear huge explosions as the Iron Dome intercepts incoming fire from Gaza, so forgive me if it's a little noisy as we speak. You're right, we didn't hear any calls for restraint, de-escalation, any calls to calm things down and there was a recommitment on the part of Joe Biden, the US president, that America has a steadfast commitment to Israel and stands shoulder to shoulder and America will supply whatever support Israel needs. Look, I spoke to Jordan's Foreign minister earlier, that's the bang as the Iron Dome intercepts a rocket behind me. I spoke to Jordan's Foreign minister earlier on about the role that he believes the US must play in managing this conflict. Ayman Safadi told me the decision was taken to cancel the Summit. That was a Summit being held in Jordan. Joe Biden was going to be at that Summit alongside the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas and the Egyptian President Sisi, that was cancelled. Jordan hopes that there will be a better environment they said, to hold that in and a better environment to have a discussion about ending this conflict. I asked him about the blast at that hospital in Gaza last night, around about 7:00 PM local time. What time is it here now? Around about 10 now. So, it is about 24 hours or so ago. I asked him about that explosion, that blast, and the statements from Israel and the US, this intelligence that suggests that Israel was not responsible. Have a listen to what he told me.

So that's something that just, we will not accept, we will not allow Israel to transfer the crisis to Jordan. If there is any real attempt to do that, Palestinians don't want it, Jordanians don't want it. So what it will do is, let me be honest, it would be just another war in the region, it will be expanding the area of conflict, it will not bring peace. So again, make no mistake, when it comes to that, our position is unwavering. We will never allow population transfer from Palestine into Jordan and that will just take the conflict into a whole new dimension that will be dangerous and disastrous for the whole area. So no, that will not happen. Palestinian homeland is on their national soil. The two-state solution is the only way to go forward. Israel has to understand that. The world has to understand that. It is enough. And let me warn of something here, Becky, and we say it as a country that, you know, has tremendous good relations with all our western friends and allies. The growing perception on the street, as they see this unequivocal ironclad support for Israel for Israel in this war, it is a growing perception that this is a Western-Arab Muslim War. That's a place we don't want to get to. That's a place that we should all work to prevent getting into and that's why the guns must go silent, commonsense must come back, reason, rationalism must come back and we figure out a way out of this darkness. We took a clear stand in condemning the killing of civilians, the world needs to do so, otherwise, it is risking being equated with the crimes that are being committed. We do that because we care about peace, because we have all worked about peace. That is His Majesty's mission. That is nonstop. We keep trying to work for peace. It's time we listen, trying to shift the conflict will just make it worse. The risk of this war expanding into the West Bank, into other parts of the region are real.

But in this case, they hurried to cancel the Summit that was planned with the American president, insulting the American president with no reason to do that. So I was surprised by their response. I don't think we need to prove it once and again, really the evidence, that conclusively was enough for the president of the United States, saying that it is also supported by information that he got from the Department of Defense in the US that clearly this was an Islamic Jihad rocket. Now talking about war crimes, at the end of the day, we have Hamas and Islamic Jihad firing from behind civilians, which is a war crime on civilians in Israel, firing on my kids, on my elder mom, and trying to kill them. So I don't think there's a question who is the war criminal here. Israel does not target civilians deliberately. Yes, in war, there is collateral damage, but Israel has proved once and again that it is going out of its way to minimize collateral damage, knowing the fact that Hamas is operating from a civilian surrounding, so it's very hard, but in no case and no matter how angry and how sad Israelis are, after what we've been through, there is no way that you will see these the Israeli Air Force deliberately targeting Palestinians. And you know what? I think the people of Gaza know that. I think the people of Gaza know that the Israeli Air Force will not target them and will not try to hurt them -- harm them in intention. Yes, some people will be hurt if they stay around Hamas, and that's why Israel is asking most of the population in Gaza City to evacuate south so they won't get hurt. We don't want to hurt civilians.

And it's also impossible for the civilians deserve to have safety when there is constant airstrikes and fighting. So wonderful, it's amazing that the goods are coming in. But the fighting has to stop. There must be a ceasefire. There must be centrality of protection of civilians. All sides have to prioritize the protection of civilians.",

We know that the categories, according to diplomatic sources arestill trying to effort the release of those hostages with an open track to Hamas, the U.S. and Israel. But at this stage, we know that Hamas has also said no release of hostages until there is a ceasefire. So we are in a, you know, a position where it seems neither side are willing to budge at this point, you say it's absolutely imperative. And at every 15 minutes, a child is dying at this point. How concerned are you, sir, at this stage without a ceasefire in place, and with the promise of the next phase of this Israeli incursion, whatever that looks like to come, just how worried are you?",

The longer that thisis protracted, that rate will most surely increase. It is impossible to keep civilians safe and alive, especially children when there's ongoing fighting, when there are no supplies in Gaza, supplies running low, when there is no safety for civilians to move around, when there's no humanitarians to deliver these assistance. Again, I cannot stress the urgency of the situation. We do not have time. The civilian population do not have time. Children in Gaza do not have time. The assistance has to get in. The fighting has to stop. There must be safety and protection of all civilians. There must be adherence to international law, from all sides, all duty bearers are accountable. These are not things that people can choose when to do or what they would like to do when it's convenient. These are obligations that all duty bearers have to uphold, and those that do not have to be held to account.",

In Turkey, protesters clashed with police outside the Israeli embassy. On Tuesday night, Israel has advised its citizens to leave Turkey immediately, citing an escalating threat of terrorism. While the U.S. has temporarily rarely closed its consulate in southern Turkey. In Lebanon, police use water cannon and tear gas to disperse demonstrators earlier on Wednesday. Some protests tried to break through security barriers near the U.S. Embassy. And this was the scene today in the Jordanian capital, Amman, a major protest close to the Israeli embassy. Nada Bashir is in Amman and you've been down, you know, amongst protesters. What was the atmosphere and what were they telling you?",

And this has really resonated across the population. And it's not just on the popular front we have heard words of condemnation, strong messages and statements as you saw earlier today, from the Jordanian government.
