You can't bring Republicans, Democrats and Independents and third-party members together. But we've proven them wrong. And that's why this is a close race. So all the credible polls have us down by a few or up by a few with lots of undecided to lean against Lee. That's why Lee is in such trouble now. But the reason this is a race is because we've rejected the broken politics of extremism and division, and been able to build this coalition.And we start with our ideals as a country. Those in the Declaration of Independence, that we're created free and equal and our human purpose, our deepest human purpose is the pursuit of happiness. And therefore, we have a democracy in which our leaders are accountable to us. And so we come together on those grounds. And we find further common ground on the most difficult issues facing the country. And that's why this coalition is growing. And it's a rejection of politics, as it is now, the broken politics of Washington. And I'd like to see this all over the country, but it's working here in Utah.",

Well, here's a barometer. When the news first broke, I made a point of wearing ties here on CNN every Saturday in the color of the Ukrainian flag, you know, blue and gold to show my support.And for several weeks, I only covered the conflict. And then for several more, I mostly covered the conflict. But now I got to be honest, it's been a while. My support is not waning, but my speech has. Today I've got to another blue and gold one on. Support is fading, if not outright splintering. A Pew poll last month found that 20 percent of Americans felt that the U.S. was providing too much aid to Ukraine. That's up from 7 percent back in March. And among Republicans, that number has gone up to 32 percent from 9 percent back in March. As the midterms approach, Kevin McCarthy potentially the next Speaker of the House, warned on Tuesday, that if Republicans win control of the House, aid to Ukraine likely to dwindle. He said this, \"I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.\" The next day, former Vice President Mike Pence told the Heritage Foundation, quote, \"There can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to Putin.\" One senior Ukrainian official told The Washington Post that because of Ukraine's near total dependency on foreign aid, its military feels that it must move fast to recapture as much territory as possible before such support softens. \"The U.S. midterms are one of the factors that have us concerned about the winter. Russia will gain an advantage with the new Congress and with Europeans as they blackmail them on energy policy. That's why the current offensive is so important.\" Nevertheless, the Ukrainians seem bullish on their belief in victory, as seen in research by my next guest. Joining me now is Mohamed Younis, the Editor in Chief of Gallup. Mohamed, Gallup recently did some really interesting polling among Ukrainians.

And many of the underlying challenges emanate from that within the country.That being said, I think it's very clear that Ukrainians do expect U.S. support to continue. And I want to go back to this point on U.S. public opinion. You know, we asked at the beginning of this war, not whether you support the war in Ukraine, but whether you support the U.S. continuing to stand behind Ukraine through a prolonged conflict. And over six in 10 Americans have shared that view, then, interestingly, Democrats much higher than Republicans. But the notion that the inflation or the recession will somehow result in a complete 180 on Ukraine, I think, is very far-fetched for one reason.

After beginning renovations, the couple began receiving creepy letters from an anonymous person calling him or herself \"The Watcher\" and claimed to have been watching the house for years as their father and grandfather had before them. Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard? Why are you here? I will find out. More letters followed. The writer showed familiarity with the family's children, referred to them as young blood and threatened -- quote -- \"Once I know their names, I will call to them and draw them to me.\" The family reported the letters to the local police. They hired a private investigator. But to this day they have never learned who sent them. \"The Watcher\" based on a story published by my next guest, Reeves Wiedeman, in \"New York Magazine.\" In 2018 he recently revisited the case in a piece called \"Taking Another Look at The Watcher, What we know about the case four years later.\" Reeves joins me now. He's a features writer at \"New York Magazine.\" So how many letters in total and over what time period?
