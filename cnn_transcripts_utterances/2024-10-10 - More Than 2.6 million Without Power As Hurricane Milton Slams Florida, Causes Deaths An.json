It made landfall just south of Sarasota around 8Those extreme winds toppling a crane in St Petersburg, Florida, that large crane clipping a building and now laying across the street. So far, thankfully, there are no reports of any injuries, but the wind is only one of several major threats from Milton. The storm surge and heavy rain could potentially fuel catastrophic flooding. Some parts of the coast are bracing for a surge as high as 13 feet, and Milton is spawning more than a dozen tornadoes all across the state and we already learned that several people have been killed by tornadoes in St Lucie County, Florida, that's on the east side of the state, mind you, that gives you example just how powerful this hurricane really is. CNN team of reporters, of meteorologists, are all covering every angle of this storm all night long. I want to start with CNN's Victor Blackwell, who is in Orlando, Florida. Victor, the center of Milton is nearing you as we speak right now. What are you experiencing down there?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Laura, the winds have really picked up. What were the gusts? Maybe an hour 90 minutes ago or now, the sustained winds, they're sustained around 40 miles an hour. We recently saw a gust at the airport, about 74th miles an hour. So the worst of what is coming from Milton is coming here to Orlando.Power outages are going up as those winds pick up as well, about 65,000 customers out here in Orlando and east toward the coast. And this, really, for Orlando, is not a story about intensity. It's more longevity, the hours and hours of rain that will come here. The concern is about the localized flooding, much like what this area saw from Hurricane Ian in 2022. I checked in with local officials, and they've now pulled their officers and the fire rescue off the roads in just the last 45 minutes because of the sustained winds at about 40 miles per hour, it's just not safe for them to go out. But they are anticipating in many areas, the flooding around Lake Davis, the flooding around some of the retention ponds and lakes around Kissimmee as well. I'm not far from the Orlando parks, and Lake Bryant is nearby, so there are concerns about the flooding here. But as the winds pick up, those trees will come down and give you a kind of look. Maybe you can see the wind and this rain that's now coming horizontal at some points because of the intensity. We checked in on shelters. They're getting us a shelter report across the county that's been opened. But the rain, really here is the concern, the storm surge at the coast, but the amount of water that's coming in. The officials have been out. The crews have been out trying to clear the drains so that the storm water control systems can accommodate it. But they know, with up to 15 inches of rain forecast over the next several hours, that they will be overwhelmed. Our weather center tells us that about three inches has fallen so far, but this is just the beginning of what's coming to Orlando. So the dog that bit the coast is now barking at Central Florida, of course, will be here throughout the night. Laura.",

Earlier we had about 102 miles per hour at Sarasota airport, which we're not very far from, but we have been up doing live shots in 7We had some rain earlier this morning, then it turned into heavy rains, and then very, very heavy winds, strong winds. And then we were in a very tranquil state as the eye passed over us, and we saw the frogs started coming out, the birds were out again. And then after we got through the back end of the eye, we started getting these gusts of winds again. And that's when we had that 102 mile per hour at the airport. But we have seen plenty of damage here, around the neighborhood that we are in. It's a completely evacuated neighborhood, Laura. We haven't seen a soul here, and it's really pitch black. We lost power several hours ago. In fact, we're just running our lights now on battery power, but you can see some of the damage here. This fence was separating the two property lines and that came down when we were seeing the worst of the winds, and then it was actually lifted up. And now it's broken into some pieces here. And I'm not sure if you can see that white cloth back there, but that was sort of a covering for what seemed like a little patio area or dining area. And when, before the eye came through, it was just whizzing like crazy with the winds. It was going that way. And then after the eye, the change -- the wind change direction, everything started blowing that way. So that's why you see it going that way. But we, again, like many of these areas, Laura, we won't know how bad the damage is until tomorrow morning, until daylight, or until this morning, I should say until daylight, because we are about a half mile from Sarasota Bay. So we just have to see how bad the storm surge were. They were expecting about nine to 13 foot storm surge with Hurricane Helene just a couple of weeks ago, it was a seven foot storm surge, and we saw the amount of damage that did. So, it will be very interesting to see once we get some daylight and we can go survey the damage, just how bad it is, possibly here in downtown Sarasota. Laura.",

We do have some power lines that are that are down, but as I said, the powers out, so we're not especially concerned about those.But when earlier, when we were a little bit further away down the driveway here, the water in the road had actually started to really come up. I mean, it was up to my shin area. So, there was some, you know, some minor flooding, I would say, in the streets here, certainly more than they would like to see, more than they're used to. But then the question is, you know, we are at a higher elevation in evacuation zone D, which was not required to evacuate. So you have A, B and C ahead of us, which are much closer to the bay.

It takes weeks to disassemble these big tower 30, 40, story cranes, so much like the cleanup after Helene, not enough time between storms to even think about that.And some of those worries were confirmed when one of those cranes came down, crossed the streets, smashed into a building across apparently. There are no injuries, thankfully. But that is more time for this city to have to clean up. It's more money involved, and could just be the tip of the damage iceberg on this storm statewide. And this is a time, Laura, too, when the state is roiling with an insurance crisis. A number of smaller insurance have gone out of business in the last couple years because the storms have just too, too many, too many claims. The insurance of last resort in the state of Florida, is overtaxed, and legislators have been wrestling with that. So again, these are -- we don't really connect our health, wealth and happiness to a planet in balance.

So yes, and this is the problem we've had, really from north to south. Venice, your biggest problem is that your wind was from the West, that west wind was pushing the surge to you. We know there's flooding in Venice. We know there's flooding in Naples. We know there's flooding in Punta Gorda, and all the way up toward Port Charlotte. We know there's water that shouldn't be where it is.And then if you get down to the other side, where the wind was blowing offshore Tampa, that's why you blew all the water out of Tampa Bay, just like Brian Todd was talking about. But in the meantime, it was raining, and in St Petersburg, they picked up 16 inches of rain today alone. Up toward Lakeland, more than 10 inches of rain has already fallen. And look at this stripe of purple. I want you to notice that the purple is 10 inches of rain or more, and there's Orlando, maybe Orlando executive right there, all the way back to Tampa. Now, if we ever get a white part in there, that will be 20 inches of rain or more, just in 24 hours so far, so good on that. But I mean, you know, I mean, 10 to 12 is plenty, and the problem is, it's not 10 to 12 in a neighborhood that can run off. [01:20:00] It's 10 to 12 over an entire county. Where is it going to go? Just to the low spots. And that's where the problem is, and that's why we have those flash flood emergencies going on right now. The heaviest rain is, according to Orlando, toward Daytona, toward New Smyrna Beach. That's where most of the heaviest rain is. Why we still have wind in Tampa, is because this is the backside of what was the secondary eye. Big storms like this can have more than one eye wall, and when the inner one gets so small that the outer one takes over, you get an eye wall replacement cycle, and the whole storm kind of goes down in wind speed. Well, this is one of the outer bands. This is still coming in, bringing wind speeds in the 60 to 70-mile per hour range. When this comes in and actually turns a little bit farther toward from the west to the east, that's when the water is going to blow back into Tampa Bay. You don't want to be down there. Authorities have already said, Please don't go down there. Do not go in just because it's drying out. It won't be dry for long. So yes, it is now a 90-mile per hour storm, but it still holds an awful lot of power. This is still going to be a hurricane when it exits the East Coast and gets back into the Atlantic Ocean. That's how strong this storm was. It made it all the way across the land and didn't die enough to just be a top tropical storm.",

So no reports of water main breaks yet here in -- I shouldn't say \"yet\" -- no reports of water main breaks or those major concerns that you're seeing from the other reporters there on the southwest coast of Florida but they are watching closely those bodies of water.",

      "sentences": "It's so hard to really go storm to storm and compare. Hurricane Helene was just such a blow, the biggest blow that the Tampa Bay area has had in at least a century just because that storm surge was so impactful where you had 20,000 homes and businesses majorly- damaged.And it was crushing to see just the stacks and stacks of debris that you've seen on the video. The sand that was brought in that covered the beach towns. People commenting, saying, you know, this looks like a blizzard. I thought it was snow that's why I clicked on this video and instead it was actually the sand that was covering the roads and into homes and businesses along some of the barrier islands around St. Petersburg and St. Pete Beach. So it was a very impactful storm in a way that people, I don't think, necessarily believed could ever happen here just because it's been so long since this area has really seen a direct impact. And that was 100 miles away, Hurricane Helene. This one is directly impacting us. It's the first major hurricane we've had in 103 years. And it's going to be a shock to people's system when they -- when they do get back in the area. Fortunately I would say the vast majority of people in the Tampa Bay area that were in the affected areas, they left. Hurricane Helene scared them straight. And so they listened to those evacuation orders. They didn't try to say, oh, I'm a Floridian, I can stay. And they did get out because they did see the reality of what a storm surge could do. And so I'm glad that that happened, I'm obviously worried to see what my home is going to look like tomorrow. Not only just my personal home but also the homes of my neighbors and my community. You know, you don't want to see that ever happened to your neighbors. And so it's kind of a surreal feeling as someone who's covered disasters all over the world and, you know, you see this in other people's homes and you have the empathy to go through it because you always know in the back of your mind where you live is as vulnerable as where they live. And so at this point, you just realize that you have a price to pay where you live. And this -- that's my price to paradise and all of our prices of living in paradise here in Florida are these hurricanes. And Hurricane Milton is calling that due today.",

They're watching the streets, the breaking news reporters.That's the way I watched what happened in Katrina to get our initial assessment because that's how we'll figure out what the potential damage was in the city of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. So those initial reports are actually coming through news media people, the storm trackers that are out on the streets showing infrastructure damage. Many of those reports came in first from the media into the newsrooms because CCTV cameras go down sometimes. So if we gather -- they've been gathering information to get a perception of what the problem is, but it won't be until daylight and they start getting the calls in for people to be rescued that we'll actually know what the situation is. But this is a terrible storm, I think this will be a historic storm.",
