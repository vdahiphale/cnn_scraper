Harris highlighted Walz's career as a high school teacher and football coach who served more than two decades in the Army National Guard.As governor, he expanded medical and paid family leave, passed free breakfasts, and lunches for public school students, and codified abortion rights in two state law.

LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: This was an incredibly raucous and energized political rally. The first formal introduction of the Harris-Walz ticket. And we saw from this evening how much the Harris campaign is going to be leaning into that contrast between Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Both of them as they took the stage really talking about the biography of Tim Walz, as they were trying to introduce him to so many people around the country that don't have a great sense of who he even is. His midwestern roots, the fact that he was born in Nebraska, the fact that he was a football coach and a teacher and served in the army National Guard. These are all factors that the Harris campaign is hoping will make him an appealing person on the democratic ticket, particularly in the critical blue wall faith. Here is a little bit of how the vice president introduced her new running mate in Philadelphia. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was coach. LEE (voice over): And of course, one of the biggest reasons that the Harris campaign decided to choose Tim Walz as the vice presidents running mate is because they also think that he is not successful at sort of prosecuting the argument against the Trump dance ticket on the other side of the political aisle. And, in fact, in this room this arena, some of the biggest applause line. But Tim Walz got tonight was when he specifically went after Donald Trump, including his recent conviction.

And one of the things that people said about him is that he's very authentic. He is supposed to bring back some of the working-class Democrats who voted for Reagan in the 80s and then voted for Trump in 2016 and '20. If you can bring some of those people back into the fold, they will have done a great job for the Democrats.

Sinwar takes over from Ismael Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week.

Israeli officials say Hezbollah drones injured several people in northern Israel, and a Hezbollah rocket barrage caused several fires. The IDF says it struck a building in southern Lebanon used by Hezbollah, killing five people. Israel has been bracing for further retaliation from both Hezbollah and Iran for the assassinations of key militant figures last week.

This has been brewing for a number of years now, and I think it's very important to state that this has not come out of nowhere. There is been a real push to kind of portray this as an act that nobody could possibly have seen coming. But in reality, the normalization of far-right rhetoric has been happening steadily over the past decade and a half. A lot of it coalesced, Bianna, perhaps in 2016. And there has been a kind of casual use of anti-immigrant rhetoric by not just far-right politicians, but mainstream conservative politicians, some mainstream politicians from the Labour Party, which is our center left party. And there've been huge volumes of anti-immigrant sentiment churned out by mainstream conservative media outlets.
