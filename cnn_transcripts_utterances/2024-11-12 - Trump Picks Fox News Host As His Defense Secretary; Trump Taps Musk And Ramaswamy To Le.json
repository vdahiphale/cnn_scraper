I was at the Madison Square Garden rally, where he talked about it as well.And what they are calling it is the Department of Government Efficiency. Obviously, any federal agency that was created would have to be approved by Congress. That's not a sense that that is happening here, that this is necessarily a real genuine agency. But clearly what they have been seeking to do is cut costs in federal spending and also staffing inside the federal government. I think there are real questions tonight about what that's going to look like. This says it is being led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Anderson, one question that I have had over the last few weeks is we've heard them talk about a trillion dollars in cuts, but when you look at how much money the federal government spent in the last fiscal year, it's close to seven trillion dollars, over five trillion of that has gone to healthcare, to Social Security, to veterans. So, if they're cutting a trillion dollars, they wouldn't really be able to do that without dipping into that. So, I think there's a real question of how all this would work because obviously, spending for agencies is approved by Congress and the president, not by outside groups and we have been told Elon Musk is not joining the federal government per se.   I still think there's a lot of questions over what exactly this is going to look like, but Elon Musk clearly has had a lot of influence on this transition as he has been spending a lot of time at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.",

I mean, this has long been something he sought to do. Trump pledged to cut federal spending when he was in office the last time. Obviously, that didn't happen. The deficit actually went up.

I think we need a little bit of it. I think we need to streamline it. Technology could potentially replace a significant amount of people. We have too much bureaucracy.And so I'm curious to see if their advisement to the president, working in tandem with Congress, could potentially improve some of those things. I take the point about the laws. That's going the make it a bit difficult. They will have to work around that. I suspect that they will. As it pertains to Pete, Harvard guy, Princeton guy, 20 years military service, two tours, I think he'll be fine. I was a bit surprised about Kristi Noem, Anderson, I have to be honest with you. Kaitlan reported there was some internal disagreement there. I would have preferred with someone with military background or intelligence background leading DHS. We'll see how she'll do in terms of being confirmed ultimately by the Senate. But everyone else, I think the president-elect is moving in the right direction but I'm really honing in on this government efficiency. We have to improve the way our federal government works. I think a lot of presidents have tried, none have been successful, can they move the needle a little bit? That could beneficial in terms of the resources for the American people.",

But what its actually going to be is basically culture war stuff.Again, I think it's important to point out that there has been some culture stuff in the DoD that has been acidic. It has hurt recruitment. There's nothing wrong with saying, let's kind of level the playing field here. Making sure the best people are in the right spots because DoD frankly has a history of promoting the wrong people just based on what they do on there -- you know, there is cold work versus based on the trust of the troops.

So, the fact that he's going in and trying to cut people and departments that regulate him and his businesses is extremely problematic. And let's look at his track record. What did he do at Twitter now X? He completely gutted that organization. It remains to be seen what he does in the federal bureaucracy. But let's not forget here, Trump came in and all of the Republicans around him came in with a promise to basically gut the administrative state as they call it. To get rid of government.

And someone took me into a room, and I could hear my mom next door in the room with my dad wailing. And then eventually, she quietly walked in the room and told me that he was gone and that I should come with her and walk in and say anything that I might want to say to him. And she said, he can still hear you. I remember saying, dad, I love you, and I will always do whatever I can to make you proud. And then I walked out into the waiting room of all my family, and thus began a great long journey into grief. A little over a year later, my mom dies. Didn't smoke. I don't think she drank much. And yet there she is with lung cancer. And then March of 2006, she died. I didn't want to face it. That's so final.
