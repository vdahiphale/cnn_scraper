The fight for control of the House of Representatives is also undecided right now. Democrats so far have won 195 seats.Republicans just won some more seats. They now have 211 seats. This is just seven seats short of the 218 needed to win a majority in the House. Twenty-nine House seats are still undecided as of this minute Republicans moving closer to their goal of trying to take back the majority in the House. Let's go to Arizona first right now. CNN's Kyung Lah is on the scene for us. Those new vote totals, I take it, Kyung, are coming out any moment now. Is that right?",

What our anticipation is, is that sometime this hour, we haven't been given an exact time, but they, we are hearing that this county will be releasing another trench of votes. So, this is going to give us a better picture of those early votes before election day.These are from Saturday night, Sunday and Monday. So, before election day early votes out there. We're expecting a drop of about 60,000 plus. We have not been given an exact number, but we're going to see it on the county web site. And so far, these numbers, actually, they have just come in. They have just come in. John, if you are there, we are looking at new numbers for Mark Kelly here in Maricopa County. The current vote total out of Maricopa County is 60 -- 642,691. For Blake Masters, it is 539,795. And in the race for Arizona governor, which has been very, very tight as well, Democrat Katie Hobbs at 627,778. Kari Lake 573,284. I'm not going to do the math here, but these races percentage wise are looking fairly stable, pretty much where they were before this drop. So, at least at the county level, it appears to be pretty stable. The thing that these campaigns are trying to tell us is that they anticipate that as these same day election votes come in, those votes that came in on Tuesday, there could be some more shifting. We don't know which way they're going to go, but the campaigns are certainly hoping, at least the Republican campaigns, they anticipate that it could be favorable to them. But again, we just don't know, Wolf. The percentages on those. Mark Kelly is at 53 percent. Blake Masters at 45 percent. So that is where it was before.",

So, these are the statewide numbers. They have not been added, I'm told. So, essentially what you have to do is they're both going to get additional. They're coming in at the same percentage, so it shouldn't change this, right? That might change it on the margins. You might see the decimal point changes, but when the new votes are added to the system, since they match what they had earlier in Maricopa County, they'll even out there as well. And again, in the senator's race, when you come statewide, you know, it's 52, 47 statewide, even though Senator Kelly is winning by a larger margin in Maricopa County.

People around the country who care about policy care about who controls the United States Senate. Yes, there's still a long way to go, but it is a smaller number now than it was five minutes ago.So, look at it, look at it that way in the sense, and then we also get to the point, and David Chalian can do this math for us. I'm sure he is already working on it in a few minutes. You know, do we have to wait? They say the final numbers could come, you know, could be several more days. The question is, especially in the Senate race with 114,000 vote lead, you know, this is just Maricopa County. This is not statewide yet. There are additional votes, but so how many votes are out? Right? So, if you look at, you know, if this were statewide, 68,060. That's 99,000. I'm rounding up a little bit here. You know, at this point here you're getting close to the area we -- where you can call the race or one more vote.

And I understand that Kari Lake wants us to move quickly and a lot of people do. But you know, what's more important is that this is done accurately. That is the focus and that, you know, like for all of these mail-in ballots, that those are signature verified. This is very important to me as an elected official that only eligible people, only eligible votes are counted. I would think that Kari Lake would be interested in that as well. That's something that I ran on, on the board of supervisors. I support I.D. at the polls and all those things.

And these are honest hardworking people who don't get paid enough money doing the work of democracy.But to Kari Lake's point, I just want you to explain number one, you're a Republican. I want our viewers to know that. The Republican candidate for Arizona governor is questioning the integrity of a local Republican official who has proven he knows what he's doing and his team knows what he's doing.

In Nevada Democratic Congressman Steven Horsford reelected in Nevada's fourth district as well. So, let's take a closer look at the state of play for control of the House right now. Now, there you see it right now. Right now, the Democrats have 197. Democrats, 211 Republicans. The Democrats have four pickups so far. The Republicans 16 pickups, 27 seats remaining right now. Let's go over to John King. Take a closer look at the House of Representatives. It's very dramatic what's going on in this battle for the House, John.",

If you look at it right now as you note, these are the called races. This is the current state of play, 211 to 197, 218 gets you to the finish line in the House majority.So simple math, your eyes don't lie to you. Republicans are closer. Republicans are closer and very close. Seven seats away from taking the House majority and taking the speaker's gavel away from Nancy Pelosi. And that tells you right there doesn't -- that these races are not called right, but this, they are ahead in more than enough races, more than enough races. But Republicans now have 212 seats at the House. They thought they, they could still get more than a 10-seat gain, but they were talking 25, 30 seat gain not that long ago. So, we'll see what happens. But let's just come back to this plate here. This is the important number. Now these are the races that are called. Just want to quickly touch on the two you just called because you noted, Republicans thought they could have an opportunity. That Titus district is right here. Unemployment at the peak of COVID was 28 percent in Nevada. Las Vegas was so punished by the COVID pandemic. The unemployment rate has dropped down. It's below 5 percent now, but gas prices or buck more than the national average out in Nevada. Republicans thought this is a place we could pick up. You see this, Joe Biden carried this district by nearly nine points. The Republicans had these grand ambitions that were going to beat Democrats in solid Democratic districts. It did not happen. Ran a competitive race that's close. That's why it's so late to call it. But this is the reason that Republican, when you come out, you can find districts like that all across the country. And that is the reason Republicans had ambitions saying we can win districts that Biden carried, you know, by seven, eight, nine points. There are some examples of that, but way fewer than the Republicans thought, Wolf, which is why that number is right there. Again, Republicans are knocking at the door of 218 seats and they very well could get there. The probability is they will get there, but this idea they were going to get there with a massive.

And it benefited the Democratic candidates in Arizona.Well, what does that mean then for what the Republicans need now that there are fewer votes left outstanding? So right now, in Arizona, statewide, 540,000 votes approximately. This is an estimate, not an exact science, 540,000 votes now remain outstanding after that big batch of votes from Maricopa County. And the calculations of what is needed for each candidate are now dramatically. Blake Masters has now moved up to a range of a need number between 58 and 60 percent of everything remaining. So, when you watch Arizona votes come in going forward, look to see if Blake Masters is winning 58 to 60 percent of him because that's what he needs. Mark Kelly's number now is down to between 37 and 39 percent of what's outstanding.

Obviously, the biggest bulk of that will be coming from Maricopa County. Now look at what happened here to the -- what each candidate in the governor's race needs to win. This changed from just before that vote batch when we showed you this. So now, because Katie Hobbs got to increase her lead a bit in that last batch, Kari Lake has a bit of a taller hill to climb here. She now needs between 52 and 54 percent a range of what is outstanding in Arizona. And the Hobbs win percentage has gone down. It's now between 47 and 49 percent. Earlier it was like they both roughly needed about half, but now you can see when those votes came in and Hobbs stretched her lead a little bit.

That is so important right now when we have so much on the line. I think for years Republicans have concentrated, actually for decades, they have worked hard in state and local elections. I think Democrats have not done that as well. I think we, with the election of Donald Trump, we've been waking up to that. The Democratic Governor's Association invested three times the amount of money that we did in 2018 in these elections because we knew how important it was. And it turned out that we had the right formula. People knew that Democratic governors were going to protect their pocket books and their freedoms, and we know that they're there to protect democracy.",

And a source close to the Walker campaign tells me that they kicked off their runoff campaigning here in Canton deliberately. Part of their strategy over the next four weeks is to try to get out to vote in red counties where they underperform when compared to incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp, who won his midterm election and avoided a runoff. At the rally both Cruz and Walker boldly predicted a win in the runoff, and it was after the rally was over that we caught up with Senator Cruz and asked him if he thought it was a good idea if Walker should invite the former president, Donald Trump to stump alongside him as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HERSCHEL WALKER (R), GEORGIA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  We in overtime, that mean we got a run off. Hey, I was built for this. I will feel for this.
