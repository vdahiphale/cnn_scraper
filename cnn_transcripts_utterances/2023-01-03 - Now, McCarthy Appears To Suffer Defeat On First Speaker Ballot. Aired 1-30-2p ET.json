      "sentences": "Yes, it's going in the wrong direction, to put it bluntly. This was not what they expected several days ago.Remember, yesterday, it looked like there were about 14 votes, five hard no votes, nine Republicans who were skeptical, who suggested perhaps they could ultimately vote for him if maybe some changes were made. But they've had meetings that did not go well. One last night in which they presented a number of changes that they wanted. Key committee assignments that Kevin McCarthy said they could not agree to at this point because that is not the way the process works. That did not go over well for those members. Then you saw the tense meeting with McCarthy where he tried to shame those members into getting behind him. Also did not work. Then the threats that you could use committee assignments. That also did not work. And now there are 16 members and counting, meaning Kevin McCarthy needs to somehow figure out at least a dozen members, how to convince them to go back to his camp. And there's no certainty about how that will happen. Andy Biggs, as he left the meeting this morning, I asked, are you going to drop out after that first ballot? Because it was pretty clear he and McCarthy were not going to get 218 votes. Biggs laughed at that question. He plans to stay in it. We'll see how long he does. But unless there's some reason that Biggs and others decide they simply -- it's time for them to hang it up, they plan to press ahead here. Which is why that this long vote -- we could see a number of these long votes with no certainty to who gets 218 votes and the House essentially paralyzed until they figure out the solution.",

Anderson Cooper, the only thing that seems certain is the uncertainty about what's going to happen.

But this vote tally is actually worse than Kevin McCarthy did two years ago when he lost the speakership because he was head of the minority party to Nancy Pelosi. In that race, Pelosi had 216 votes, McCarthy had 209. He actually has fewer votes for him to be speaker today even though he has a majority -- Dana Bash, this is an ignominious defeat. It doesn't mean it's over. Who knows what will happen on the second ballot. But it is difficult to see how this process ends with a speaker McCarthy.",

Ten for Congressman Andy Biggs, who no one thinks will ever be the speaker of the House. But then of the nine, for others -- and it might be time for our graphics people to add a banner for Congressman Jordan -- because six Republicans voted for him. He is certainly part of the MAGA wing. But a more palatable member to a lot of the Republican caucus. Six voted for him. One for Lee Zeldin, former congressman. One for Byron Donalds, a current Florida Congressman, and one for Jim Banks. Let's go to Rodney Davis, if we can, right now to get his reaction to this. Because, Congressman, tell me how this ends with your friend Kevin McCarthy being speaker, because I'm having a difficult time seeing it. RODNEY DAVIS, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, we all are. This is historic. First time it's happened in 100 years, as has been mentioned numerous times. This is new territory for him. From my sources on the floor right now, Kevin is going to go immediately to another round of votes. You saw him talking to Jim Jordan. Jim has been adamantly supportive of Kevin McCarthy. I think Jim is going to be asked to go talk to those members who voted for him against his wishes and to talk them into maybe changing their vote for Kevin. Jim really wants to be the judiciary chair. He wants to get to work. But right now, the only discussion for any other candidate for speaker of the House on the Republican side besides Kevin McCarthy is happening between the people who already voted against him. No one else is discussing another dark-horse candidate right now.",

Because as I said, sometimes math is upside down. You mentioned Jordan, as Congressman Davis notes, he has good relations with all 19 of those people who voted against Kevin McCarthy.

They can go to that room and say, we've embarrassed ourselves, a Democrat came out on the first vote, but many members don't care about that. That's not the world they live in. They don't live in a normal Washington. They are not party members. They are -- they view themselves as MAGA warriors, So, yes, you noted six votes for Jim Jordan. Not enough.

Those conservatives opponents have promised there will be another candidate, another dark-horse candidate to push forward. And they have not said or revealed who it is. And it is highly doubtful if they can get to 218 votes. And McCarthy said they will not give into that demand of the bloc of conservatives, but that is the next card to play. And what is McCarthy's next card to play? To push ahead and wear these people opposing him down. But it is not happening at the moment here. And so expect another lengthy vote series.

You have someone like Matt Gaetz who spends more time on FOX News than in the chamber. You have Lauren Boebert, who barely won her seat in this cycle, only by a handful of votes. These are the people holding the Republican conference hostage today. And for Kevin McCarthy, there's really not a path forward unless he can convince a lot of people that he was expecting to change their votes. And that is humiliation on top of humiliation for him.
