A massive landslide in Papua New Guinea buries thousands of people alive. We are in the region with the latest on search and rescue efforts. Violent storms sweep the central United States leaving several dead, homes leveled, thousands without power and millions more are at risk as the severe weather moves east. Plus, no place is safe. An Israeli airstrike on tents in a makeshift camp in Rafah kills dozens of Palestinians. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas compound. We begin this hour in Papua New Guinea where the death toll from last week's massive landslide now appears far worse than initially feared. In the letter to the United Nations, an emergency official says as many as 2,000 people were buried alive. The United Nations Migration Agency has said the landslide swallowed up more than 150 homes with debris spread across an area as large as four football fields. Rescuers are still searching, hoping to find more survivors. The landslide hit a remote region of the country in the middle of the night early on Friday. With us now Chris Jensen, the National Director for World Vision Papua New Guinea. Thank you so much for joining us Chris. I mean the figure is horrendous. We were reporting on it last week but the rescue workers have clearly really realized the scale of the devastation.",

We've got a lot of you know inclement unseasonal weather happening across PNG. There's flooding in other provinces, we've got a lot of challenges here probably exacerbated by climate change where things are changing and we're adapting to different circumstances.

In fact we have seen some parts of Rafah particularly in the east which were ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military ahead of what is expected to be a ground offensive.This was not one of those areas, this was supposed to be a safe zone but it was targeted last night and the video the images that we have seen coming out of the southern neighborhood which is the particular area that was targeted are distressing, they are graphic, many of them we cannot show because they are simply too graphic. These are some of the most horrifying videos I personally have seen over the last seven months of this war. We've seen footage of charred bodies being pulled from burning tents. We've heard from some humanitarian organizations including Doctors Without Borders saying that they have seen an influx of patients now coming in with severe burn injuries. The health ministry in Gaza says it simply does not have the capacity in Rafah to care for all of these patients. Now as you mentioned the Israeli military says it struck what it has described as a Hamas compound that it killed two senior Hamas leaders but as we know this is an area densely populated with civilians. The Israeli military has acknowledged that it is aware of civilian casualties that this strike in particular caused harm in its words to civilians and that it is reviewing the incident at the moment but again fierce criticism coming from humanitarian organizations and of course the Palestinian Authority as well as Hamas not only directed at the Israeli military but also crucially at President Biden. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas both accusing Biden of facilitating Israel's actions and offensive in Rafah and of course this comes just a week after the International Court of Justice ordered the Israeli military to halt any plans for a military offensive in the south.",

No, there's a major sticking point as you just alluded to in your question and that is the ceasefire.Any hostage deal needs to be accompanied by a ceasefire. Whether draft number one says a six-week ceasefire or draft number two says five weeks it doesn't matter. A ceasefire under current condition prevents Israel from saying it toppled, destroyed, annihilated, eradicated Hamas. In other words it prevents Israel from saying it won the war because there's nothing to show for other than devastation and death in Gaza and devastation and death in Israel. So Mr. Netanyahu has a disincentive for a ceasefire not only because that would prevent him from showing or demonstrating an achievement or something tangible that he could call a triumph but because that would subject him almost inevitably to the scrutiny of being responsible and being held accountable for the period leading to October 7th and the mismanagement of the war. On the other hand on the Hamas side without a ceasefire they have absolutely no reason to give up what they cruelly savagely and barbarically think are negotiating assets, human lives including babies and women and so both sides are, you know, locked jammed in this no-win situation.",

They've existed for over 60 years now and are essentially bars or clubs where young, usually attractive men are paid to entertain women, flirt with them, pour them a couple of drinks.Now, it sounds like it's all fun and games in theory. But from what we've found throughout reporting is that recently, some of these clubs are forcing women to spend an exorbitant amount at their clubs and incur massive, massive debts. Now, once these women do incur these massive debts, they are then expected or forced into sex work by these hosts. And the hosts then take a cut of that profit. It's become a huge issue in the country and it's left hundreds of people a victim to this type of romance scam. So host clubs have said that they're going to self-regulate, that they'll ban minors from entering their clubs and also prevent women from incurring these massive debts. But according to the lawmakers, the victims, the aid groups that we've spoken to, that just simply is not the case. Women are still being trafficked into sex work and being exploited. We spoke to one victim of this scam earlier this year, a woman named Yu, who told us about how she lost everything and how she was trafficked overseas.
