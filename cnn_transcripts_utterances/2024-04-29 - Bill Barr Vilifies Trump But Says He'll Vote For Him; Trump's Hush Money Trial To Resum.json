And he's far from alone. What our revealing conversation tells us about the state of the race, and the state of the Republican Party. Also, a new front in the flashpoint on college campuses, as protesters are being told tonight, that time is up. Columbia beginning to suspend students, and police in riot gear making hundreds of arrests across the country. Our source on this movement, tonight, is Michael Moore. And did a potential Trump vice presidential pick just shoot herself in the foot? There's new fallout tonight, for South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, after her story about shooting her puppy on purpose. We're digging into what's behind her latest bizarre defense. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, an exclusive window, directly into the disconnect, at the heart of our current national politics, a window that was thrown wide open, by former Attorney General, Bill Barr, right here on THE SOURCE.

We'll talk more about that in a moment. But six months out from a presidential election, Mr. Barr's position is far from the only one in his party. Look at this. A new CNN poll shows that 92 percent of Republicans believe that Trump's first term in office was a success. Four criminal indictments later, that is actually higher than it was when he left the White House in 2021. Look no further than what Trump himself is saying, tonight, touting what he says that the full and enthusiastic support of Governor Ron DeSantis. Trump met with DeSantis, in Florida yesterday, to talk about how he can help with Trump's campaign. This is the first time they've spoken since DeSantis, dropped out of that ugly primary race. But we see this paradox echoed by Republican after Republican.

I would point to Viktor Orban, who Donald Trump regularly praises, Bolsonaro in Brazil, also came from the right. It's an absurd, historically inaccurate claim that he's making. But I don't know Bill Barr well. I served alongside him. I was in high-level meetings with him in the West Wing. He, matter of factly, admitted to you that Donald Trump talked regularly about executing people. I knew of the one instance, I personally witnessed. I had heard of other examples secondhand. But he seemed to dismiss it, and then goes into this line of like, oh, don't take him literally. Well, we didn't take him literally when he wanted to steal the election or when he incited a mob to go to the Capitol, and it turned violent. It's time that people start taking Donald Trump much more literally at his word. [21:10:00] And I would just also add this. Donald Trump has done a masterful job and with, I would say, his friends and the right-wing media, of painting America as being in this hellscape, right now. We can't survive another four years of Joe Biden. We've survived 9/11, World War II, economic downturns. I don't like Joe Biden's policies. That is demonstrably untrue. The border -- whether it's the border. Crime is down. Republicans were blocking a border bill, right now. We can survive bad policies.

I mean, there's -- what's great about the democracy and free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of not having a state religion, this is what every -- you know, those who came here, the White people who came here wanting to escape that. And so, the lesson teaching the children of today, in this case, Gen Z, that we will -- we will tase you, we will beat you, we will club you, if you -- and what -- none of them are committing any acts of violence, none of them are destroying the university. Worst maybe, in some people's minds, they're doing is holding signs that say Free Palestine, or From the River to the Sea. This is the one that is constantly being thrown out there. Oh, look at this, this sign is, is frightening all the students, From the River to the Sea. And it's like, well, why don't you talk to them? Because, actually, first of all, large numbers of these students are Jewish students, who are with the Palestinian students, who together are forming these encampments. I don't know if that's been covered, very much, how much. I saw this one instance, where the Palestinian students inviting the Jewish students into the encampment.

I wanted to say this on your show tonight that his chance of not being reelected, I think, at this point, is so great, because of those numbers. Because he's losing the youth vote. He's lost the Arab American vote in Michigan. So even Michelle Goldberg in a column, in The New York Times, last month, said that you lose Michigan, you lose the election. I am fighting to make sure that doesn't happen. I am trying to save Joe Biden. Because as soon as he does the right thing, as soon as he -- and if you're listening, watching Mr. Biden, fellow Catholic, although some will say recovering, in my case, but still, we are -- we are Catholics. And the Pope is right on this. We need an immediate ceasefire. It is wrong. A mass slaughter of innocents, of children, of women, of the elderly, is a sin. It is absolutely against what we believe in. I know you know that too. I know that's why you're not really happy with what Netanyahu has done here. And you can stop the killing tonight. You pull the plug, you close the bank. You shut it down. Doesn't mean we're not going to support Israel, protect Israel. Absolutely. All of that. But it's not what's going on here. It is a mass slaughter. It is -- it is a -- it's so, it's madness, President Biden. And you know this. And I speak to you, as a fellow seminarian, to the Catholic priesthood, that's me, that this is wrong. This is not what we believe in. And I think, you know, after the World War II, we are all -- we are all in the shadow of the Holocaust. We are all sons and daughters of that era. And what did we want to do? We wanted to make sure that no Jew would ever have to suffer again, or be killed again. And so, everybody got behind the idea that they should have this home. But the home, the land wasn't taken from the Nazis, the Germans. We didn't give them Bavaria. We took land from people, people who -- who not a single Palestinian, built an oven at Auschwitz. Not a single Palestinian, historically, ran the Spanish Inquisition. Not a single Palestinian turned away boatloads of German-Jewish refugees that tried to dock in Boston, New York, Miami, prohibited, tried to escape before they were all exterminated. And we turn them away, we, the United States. [21:35:00] And it's, I'm just saying, yes, it's, you're right to be, as you say, you care and you love the Jewish people, obviously, yes. But not this.

Sleazy tabloids, slamming political opponents, a porn star, a Playboy Playmate, and David Pecker all took center stage.But it's easy to lose sight of what the alleged crime is here. It's all about documents, legal fees, business records, that will really be what determines Donald Trump's fate. My next source tackled this topic, today, in a New York Times Op-Ed piece, writing, \"It's not surprising that the lawyers on both sides are trying to make this about something sexier... but,\" she goes on to write, \"the case about preventing wealthy people from using their businesses to commit crimes and hide from accountability.\" Joining me now is the author of that piece, former Assistant District Attorney in the Manhattan D.A.'s office, Rebecca Roiphe; along with Jennifer Rodgers, former federal prosecutor and CNN Legal Analyst; and also Arthur Aidala, a veteran New York trial attorney. Rebecca, let me start with you. Because we often just say this is the hush money case. Alvin Bragg, the D.A., says it's the election interference case. You're kind of saying it's neither of those. REBECCA ROIPHE, FORMER ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, MANHATTAN D.A.'S OFFICE: Right. It's the boring old documents case. But I think it's important to focus on that, in part because it just simplifies the case, a huge amount. And there're sort of these promises with all of these stories that things that don't need to be proved are going to be proved. And that has the potential of confusing the jurors. Once you boil it down to the case, it looks a whole lot more simple, a lot more like things that are normally done in the D.A.'s office, and therefore more legitimate.",

He could sort of silo in his own state and do his own thing. But I think Trump needs Ron DeSantis. He needs fundraising. He needs money. He needs a Florida operation.
