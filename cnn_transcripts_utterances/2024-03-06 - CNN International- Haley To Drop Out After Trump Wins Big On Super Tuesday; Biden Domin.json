Sources telling CNN Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley will drop out of the race today. We have full coverage. Plus, growing unrest in Haiti. Police stations in the capital under attack, as we learn the Prime Minister is in Puerto Rico. And face off on the high seas. CNN is front and center for a standoff between the Chinese Coast Guard and a Philippine ship. A live report is just ahead. Donald Trump all but certain to be the Republican presidential nominee. This is sources tell CNN Nikki Haley, Trump's last remaining challenger for the GOP nomination, will announce today she is dropping out of the race. She is set to deliver remarks just about two hours from now. Notably, Haley is not expected to endorse Donald Trump today. The decision to drop out comes after Trump not resounding victories in 14 out of 15 states on Super Tuesday. And in many of those states, Trump captured more than 75 percent of votes cast. The political world's attention now shifting to what had frankly been expected all along, a rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Before she leaves the stage, though, Nikki Haley will have one final message for Donald Trump, telling him he needs to do more to win the support of her voters. With more on that, here's CNN's Kylie Atwood reporting earlier.",

And that's not altogether surprising because we have heard from Nikki Haley over the course of the last few months saying that Trump cannot win a general election if he is losing the faction of the party that is voting for her.So she is now daring him to engage in a conversation with those voters. She has said that those voters don't want to be ignored, that they see a different vision for the future of the country. The question is, how does Trump engage with them? How does he engage with her? We'll have to watch and see how that plays out. Now, one interesting thing on this conversation topic of endorsing the nominee of the Republican Party, Nikki Haley did commit to endorsing that nominee back last summer that she had to do that in order to get on the debate stage. But she has given indications in the last week or so that she was leaning in this direction because she laid out a few reasons for why she no longer felt bound to endorse the eventual nominee, saying that the Republican Party is different now than it was when she made that commitment. Also noting that former President Trump never made that commitment. So why does she have to uphold that commitment? She is bowing out today, but she is putting herself into a position of power. It is a very deft political move for Nikki Haley. And we should note that even though she didn't get enough support to keep her campaign alive, there were some states where she had a significant faction of the voters voting for her. And so her campaign is trying to use that to their advantage today as she continues to engage in this conversation surrounding the future of the Republican Party.",

Thank you.For more reaction to what is frankly a monumental week in U.S. politics, joining me now is Thomas Gift, he's the director of the Center on U.S. Politics at the University College London. Nice to see you this morning, Thomas. So if we pick up sort of where we just left off there with both Kylie and Alayna, there is this sense, and we are expected to hear this from Nikki Haley in just a couple of hours from now. There's a large swath of voters out there that it can be seen as either a challenge or an opportunity depending on which direction you're coming from for both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Who has the upper hand this morning? THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER OF U.S. POLITICS, UCL: Well, it's great to be with you, Erica. Thanks so much for having me. You know, there is this huge block of voters who are very dissatisfied with both of their choices. And it's one reason why 70 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the Trump versus Biden matchup. I think right now, you have to say that Biden has a slightly upper edge just because he's less alienating. If you just look at sort of disapprovals between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Joe Biden's disapprovals are less than Trump. So that suggests to me that there is a larger fraction of upscale suburban voters, sort of educated voters who lean more moderate who are still probably more inclined to vote for Joe Biden than Donald Trump. But, you know, I think Nikki Haley could go a long way and maybe helping to Donald Trump swing some of those voters who came out to the polls for her or who just failed to show up to the primaries altogether. You know, her words could mean something.",

Already, I think it's probably fair to say that she'd be a persona non grata in a Trump administration.But it's also important to remember that it's not like Haley has been out there sounding the alarm on Trump for months. He did take a much more critical tone of Trump once the primary turned into a one-on-one race. But Haley spent much of the early going tiptoeing around any issues that could alienate the Trump base. She said that if she were elected president, she pardoned Trump if he were criminally convicted. When asked about how she differentiated herself on policies, she basically never gave a lucid answer. So this is not someone who spent her time going full on Chris Christie. And there's a big question, I think, within the Haley campaign about whether she should be a team player. I think some think that she should be, that she's a loyal Republican. She took this pledge to support the nominee, or whether she could be the face of a broader movement of Republicans who speak with moral clarity against Trump. So there's this question about whether she endorses or not, and then what she actually says, and it's hard to predict at this point.",

And if you look at what Donald Trump did in 2016 and 2020, he basically doubled down and said, I just want to motivate the base and that has been limiting in the sense that it hasn't allowed him to extend his circle of support.It's very difficult, I think, for him to make that pivot now. I mean, everyone's trying to court this elusive median voter, swing voter, but he would spent months and months on the politics of grievance and sort of on this very right-wing agenda. I think it's difficult to kind of make that shift. And it's very possible that the Trump campaign is just going to write off a lot of voters and say, look, as long as we get our core supporters to come out to the polls, Joe Biden's enthusiasm tends to be so limited at this point that maybe we can win a match up like that.

So certainly he's going back with a message of his own. But we are seeing once again, the U.S., the U.K., many other countries calling for more aid to be allowed in. It is not being heeded by Israel at this point. The U.K. and the U.S. have said that they want to see more crossings open. There are two near the northern part of Gaza on that border with Israel that could potentially be fixed, could be opened and then you can get humanitarian aid straight to those who need it in the northern part, which is the most devastated part at this point. But those calls don't appear to be heeded by Israel at this point. And just pointing out that the U.S. has had to resort to airdrops in order to get aid into those who need it within Gaza, because even though it is the closest ally of Israel, it is not able to influence them in such a way that they will allow more humanitarian aid trucks through. In fact, we just heard from WFP, the World Food Programme, that they were actually turned back by Israeli military as they were trying to get 14 trucks to the northern part of Gaza. They said they had to sit at a checkpoint for three hours. They were then turned back. And on the way back, the-- there were other groups that then took that aid so there was no sense of a good distribution, a distribution to make sure it really got to those who needed it. Erica?",

You know, they drift. So, a second Philippine Coast Guard vessel actually was hit. There was a mild collision with a much larger China Coast Guard vessel. Fortunately, nobody was hurt there. This is not the first time that these kind of confrontations have taken place at sea. But the Philippine government says a difference here is that some of its service members were actually hurt this time and some of their ships were actually damaged. Again, the several of the windscreens, the windshields of this small resupply ship were broken in by the force of the Chinese water cannon. It is remarkable that there haven't been worse accidents thus far. And this does have potential much bigger implications because the Philippines is a mutual defense treaty partner of the U.S. So theoretically, if there is an active war, if this escalates, the U.S. will be obliged to come to the Philippines defense, and that would become a much bigger potential scary scenario. China commands the world's largest Navy. Despite these threats, the Philippines has said since this took place, it will not back down. It is going to continue asserting its rights. So I'm not sure where this is going to go from there. China keeps accusing this much smaller poorer weaker country of operating illegally in what is essentially the open sea. Every ship should have a right to move through this territory that China is claiming for itself.",

He very notably, a few weeks ago, said that people who donated to her campaign would be barred permanently from the MAGA movement. Not exactly sure how that logistically would work.And her campaign was selling shirts that said, barred permanently to sort of lean into that insult. All kidding aside, though, some conservative observers, they say when the rubber meets the road, Republicans will all get behind Trump. But that isn't necessarily a given. If you listen to her supporters, for instance, even in ruby red states like South Carolina, they would show up to her events.

The U.N. is supposed to have a meeting this afternoon about this to see what they can do to stabilize a very worrying situation, a situation that has been brewing really for months and years, but it seems to have hit critical mass as we are seeing with the prime minister of Haiti having been overseas, essentially the country plunging into chaos.These well-armed, well-financed gangs, excuse me, taking on the police and beating back the police using police stations that have been abandoned, police that have essentially given up the fight or simply been outgunned jails where prisoners have been -- thousands of prisoners have been freed, and are now roaming the streets of Port-au- Prince. So just a country that has fallen into chaos. Prime Minister Ariel Henry had gone to Kenya to sign a deal that would allow Kenyan troops to come, about 1,000 Kenyan troops come and try to fight the gangs themselves, fight the Haitian police have all but admitted they cannot win on their own. While he was there doing that, the gang saw an opportunity to rise up, close down the airport to prevent Ariel Henry from returning. And so at this point, it's not clear when or how he will return. We are told that he is working on doing that. The U.S. government is trying to help him to do that apparently. But getting back into his country under these circumstances is going to be so difficult and dangerous, and it's not clear yet if when he actually lands, if it will help to stabilize the country. This is a very unpopular prime minister. He was not elected. He became prime minister after the 2021 presidential assassination. And it's still not clear yet when new elections will be held in Haiti because of course the security situation up until now has not allowed for it. But, you know, for the thousands of Haitians have had to flee their homes, they need to see action now because this security situation, this moment that Haiti is living through where the gangs have almost total control of the capital city is really putting this country on the brink of collapse.",
