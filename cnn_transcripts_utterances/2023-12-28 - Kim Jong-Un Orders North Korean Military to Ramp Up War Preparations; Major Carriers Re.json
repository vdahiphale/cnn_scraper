Fears of a widening war in the Middle East, Israel warning if Hezbollah doesn't pull back from Israel's northern border, the IDF will push them back.A top-level meeting in Mexico as U.S. officials look for a solution to easing the crisis at the southern border. And a CNN investigation inside the underground world of dogfighting. How a vicious disturbing practice thought to be in decline is now thriving. And we begin with a warning from Israel's foreign ministry as tensions along the country's northern border with Lebanon intensify. The ministry says failure to implement U.N. resolution 1701 could lead to war in Lebanon. That resolution called for the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah following the 2006 Lebanon War and the withdrawal of troops from a demilitarized zone. That morning coming after the Israeli Foreign Minister rather visited the border. And as new shelling is reported on Wednesday, Hezbollah claimed a targeted and Israeli border city with 30 Katyusha rockets. The attack Hezbollah says was in response to earlier IDF airstrikes on a Lebanese village and Israeli war cabinet member now saying time is running out to reach a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI MINISTER (through translator): The situation on Israel's northern border demands change. The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The hospitals are on their knees, barely functioning, huge numbers of patients coming in every single day. And a very small number of staff. Staff have been -- health workers have been detained, some of them have been displaced.Some of them are unable to access the hospital safely. So, the last time I was in Al Shifa Hospital which is the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip, there were five or six doctors and five or six nurses caring for hundreds of patients with -- many with very severe injuries. And everywhere we go, everybody's asking for food. Everybody's asking for water. So, it's a -- it's a very desperate situation in the North. And here in the south part of the Gaza Strip where I am. We see more and more internally displaced persons every day. People driving south in vans riding on donkey parts, setting up camps all over Rafah from -- running for their safety basically. GIOKOS: Look, we've spoken to so many doctors and they keep describing scenarios that are very difficult to imagine and sort of get your head around specifically on embarking on very serious surgeries without anesthesia. Is that still the case? And I asked this because during the truce, we saw more aid going in. But it's always getting to the hospitals. It's that last mile, there has always been a challenge.

We're getting some across the border, it's very difficult to get it to the northern areas to the middle area. And so, there are -- our items that are lacking. There's a severe shortage of health workers because so many of them have been displaced. Actually, Gaza has a huge health workforce, but they've now had to resort to spending their time trying to survive and take care of their families that are unable to get to work sometimes because there's so much fighting around the hospital.And then there's a challenge of the number of patients relative to the number of operating theatres. So, it's not just that there's a lack of medicines or lack of anesthesia, but actually there aren't enough operating theatres, operating rooms to perform the surgeries and there's a lack of specialists to do it. So, in the hospitals that do have operating theatres are running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and still can't keep pace. But in the biggest hospitals like Al Shifa in the north, they're not able to do surgery at all. The operating theatres are not functioning. The hospital doesn't have enough power. And IDPs are living inside the hospital. They become safe havens for people who've been displaced.",

There are field hospitals that are being set up.We're also trying to find ways that we can support the health workforce here in Gaza, the local health workforce, to get back to work safely. It's a combination of those, but we do need more beds, we need more operating theatres, we need more specialists. Unfortunately, there's amputations that are happening that would normally be unnecessary because there's a lack of a vascular surgeon or another specialized surgeon. So, we're working to bring them in, we had a number of come in yesterday, and we have to have more search support in the coming days, and more beds being set up across Gaza, in Rafah but also in the north, in the coming days and weeks.",

And people are -- feel fearful for their lives and their safety right across Gaza. But what we're seeing now in the south, even 30 meters away from me, there's a cap than has spontaneously been set up with people who are displaced.And in the last two days, we've seen truckloads and truckloads of people fleeing from the north in the middle area because the fighting has intensified and pushed farther south. So, it becomes logistically challenging when we go up to the north, but I go with my colleagues and partners to the north. We have to deal with horrific road conditions, buildings that have been destroyed, that great rubble all over the road, power lines that are down. Areas where fighting is ongoing and where we're having to change routes, spontaneously because of access constraints. So, it's very difficult and we're dealing with a population that's really desperate. So, anytime people here see any truck, they hope and pray that it's good and they -- and many times rush of the truck and, you know, we're taking medical supplies, once people realize that it's medical supplies, they have to pay the way but the level of desperation is also part of this integration.",

After some legal back and forth, Apple says it will begin selling its latest and most technologically advanced Apple Watches in its U.S. stores in the coming hours. The watches are manufactured abroad, but an import ban on the Series 9 and Ultra 9 Watches had gone into effect earlier this week.

KENNEDY, 35TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More than 60 years after those famous words, it was full steam ahead for a new space race in 2023. Space agencies from around the world are once again competing to get to the moon and, this time, they're hoping to stay for good, leaving more than just flags and footprints. In 2023, India's space program took a giant leap forward, successfully landing it uncrewed robotic Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the lunar surface in August.
