There's little pop of smoke and the next thing you know, I look to the right because there was a set of speakers that were on a crane and we believe he hits a hydraulic line there, and the speaker started coming down.And right about the same in time, the president went down, the Secret Service went on top of him. I look back to the left, the shooting had stopped at this point, people were all over the ground. They were all huddled down. And I'm being waved over like very vigorously to come over to the bleachers behind me. And of course I got to make my way over top of people because they're all laying on the ground. I get to the bike rack and the guy says he's shot and that's the first time I knew that this was a serious, serious incident. I got on the radio, called for medics, the ambulance, and literally within seconds we had a physician, we had a nurse. We have EMTs with the ESU unit. I had a doctor come up behind me, vaulted him over the bike rack to get him help. And at the same time trying to get people off of the bleachers. At that time that event is over. So now it's about getting people away and potentially securing some of the witnesses so that whoever was investigating could have opportunity to talk to them.

He has said that he is determined to move ahead with the convention. What this looks like at the convention in terms of how this has factored in, I don't think we know yet. You have seen him stressing in his own messages on Truth Social, unity. I think that he is going to recognize that this is a different kind of moment.

He was standing just 10 yards from Corey Comperatore when he was shot and killed, and Dr. Meyn then helped carry Corey's body out of the bleachers. It was Dr. Meyn's first time attending a Trump rally. And Doctor, I am -- I am so sorry for what you witnessed, but for the grace of God, but you carried him. You saw him hit, you saw him hit in the head. You saw him die and you took the photos of the bleachers, which is where Corey's body fell when he was hit. I am warning people these images are extremely graphic, but Corey went to this rally because he supports Trump. He wanted to be there. He went for a nice Sunday afternoon with his family and this is what happened. Dr. Meyn, can you tell me exactly what happened as you saw it. DR. JOSEPH MEYN, EYEWITNESS: So, I was attending the rally and I was actually in the folding chairs that were situated on the other side of the barrier just in front of the left bleacher, at the very end of the bleachers to the left of the stage. You know, I was looking -- I was recording President Trump on my iPhone in my right hand and the way the angle where I was sitting, President Trump's head was covered by the right screen of the teleprompter. So I was leaning in to get a better angle to get pictures of him speaking, but you know, there was information that was being projected on the jumbotron to my left. So you know, as I was holding my iPhone on my right hand, I looked at the jumbotron and just as I was glancing down from the jumbotron and moving my head from left to right. That's when I noticed gunfire, immediate -- it was a hot, muggy day in Pennsylvania, immediately there was vapor trails of bullets right in front of me just above me. And then there was there were seven gunshots relatively loud, quickly. All seven gunshots were shot or fired, just over a second or maybe under a second and-a-half and as I was changing my vision and moving my head from right to the left, on my left visual field, I noticed a man in the bleachers you know, where the gunfire was coming from, I assume that the gunfire was coming from behind the bleachers, it sounded about a hundred meters distance. He was hit in the head and killed instantaneously and as I continued to look from left to right in my right visual field, that's when I noticed that one of the vapor trails from the bullet struck President Trump. Just before the bullet struck him, I mean, the moment before President Trump looked from right to left and I saw the vapor trail of the bullet slice the top right portion of his ear.

I didn't even want to sit at a table with you. But she said, I am so glad I stayed because I had never sat with a Trumper and I learned something and you're a good guy.
