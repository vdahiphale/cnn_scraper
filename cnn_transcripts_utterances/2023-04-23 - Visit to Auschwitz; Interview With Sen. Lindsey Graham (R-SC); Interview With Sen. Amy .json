I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is beginning to feel a lot like 2024.President Biden is preparing to officially announce his reelection bid as soon as Tuesday, four years from when he announced his last bid for the White House. The long-expected announcement comes as his administration is celebrating a win, even if a potentially temporary one, on abortion, after the Supreme Court moved to protect access to the abortion pill mifepristone, prompting praise from Democrats and mostly crickets from Republicans. The battle over abortion is shaping up to be a key campaign issue, as the 2024 field comes into focus. We're also following breaking news this morning. Late last night, President Biden announced American diplomats and their families were safely evacuated by helicopter from Sudan's capital, Khartoum. It came amid escalating violence between the Sudanese military and a paramilitary group. The Biden administration is coordinating with Americans still in Sudan, but making it clear a broader evacuation is off the table. Joining me now, a top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Senator, thank you so much for joining me this morning. We have a lot to get to, but let's start with that evacuation. There are still estimated to be thousands of American citizens still on the ground. The government isn't currently considering another evacuation. So, what is your reaction, and how is President Biden handling all of this? SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  Well, I appreciate the effort to get our folks out of the embassy that serve over there. The military did a very successful operation. Yes, I'm worried. You have got thousands of people in the middle of a civil war. And have we been late about sort of telling them to leave? Could you see this coming? Those questions will be asked and answered later on. But, right now, if I were an American in Sudan, I would shelter in place. And, hopefully, we can find a way to end the fighting, get humanitarian aid, and get our people out.",
