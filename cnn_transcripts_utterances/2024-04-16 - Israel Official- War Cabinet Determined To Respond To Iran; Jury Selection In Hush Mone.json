Hundreds of missiles and drones fired directly at Israel from inside Iran, an escalation without precedent in their long running proxy war.Right now, the Israeli war cabinet appears to be divided over what comes next. A meeting on Monday, the second time in as many days ended without any announcement. According to an Israeli official, both diplomatic and military options are on the table. At the same time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is urging the world to stand united, gets what he calls Iranian aggression, which he said it was a threat to Israel, the entire Middle East as well as world peace. In Tehran, a senior military adviser has warned there will be no restraint if an enemy crosses so called red lines. Weekend, drone and missile strike, according to Iranian officials, was necessary and proportionate, described as an act of self-defense. And part of the difficult calculation for Israel in responding to that attack is the risk of further escalation by Iran. Still the head of Israel's military is warning it's not a matter of if, but when. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, John, those negotiations appear to have hit a wall, frankly, at this point. One Israeli source close to these negotiations telling CNN that Hamas has now reduced significantly the number of hostages that they are willing to release in the first phase of this deal. They had been talking about a three phase deal. Within the first phase, the parameters were around 40 hostages, the women, the children, the elderly, the sick, the wounded, in return, for around 700 Palestinian prisoners that we're now hearing from this source that Hamas is saying, it only has 20.In fact, fewer than 20 hostages, that it will be able to release and they are also asking for more Palestinian prisoners in return and many more, that are serving life sentences. Now the source saying that this is a significant step backwards. And it's being seen by Israel as a sign that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza doesn't want to deal. And they are looking to exploit a perceived gap in the positions between the U.S. and Israel at this point. Now, we've also heard from a senior Biden administration official recently who did say that Hamas had told mediators that they simply don't have 40 hostages within those parameters that are still alive. So what the U.S. was expecting was that they would make up those numbers either with younger men, or with the remains of some of those who have lost their lives. So at this point, it really does seem a significant sticking point within these negotiations. Hamas has also said that they don't believe Israel is addressing its concerns. They want a full withdrawal. They want Palestinians to be able to go back to their homes in the north of Gaza. And they want to have a permanent ceasefire, something Israel is just not willing to give. John?",

That has now we understand been put on hold because of these attacks by Iran over the weekend. So that is what is complicated this issue. We understand from these sources that Israel was about to start dropping leaflets into certain parts of Rafah telling them to evacuate the area.It's unclear where they would evacuate to, of course, at this point. But we also understand from one Israeli source that this great offensive will go ahead as far as the military is concerned and the government is concerned. It's just not certain on the timing or the scope at this point. And remember, there's up to 1.5 million Palestinians who are currently sheltering in Rafah itself. This is more than half the population. Many of them have been displaced once, twice, even three times, in some cases, many more, because they have been moved from the north. So what we have seen in recent days is some people trying to go back to their homes, or what's left of their homes in northern Gaza. But they have been repelled by Israel. Israel saying that the North is still a dangerous conflict zone, and they're simply not able to get to that area. So that is on hold as well. And of course, it's a consideration when they're talking about what to do in response to Iran. They also have to think about what they're going to do in Gaza in tandem with that. John?",

Now this is a process that takes some time, and it took extra time on Monday because the judge first needed to contemplate some additional motions and questions about evidence that would eventually be introduced at trial. But one of the most significant moments on Monday was when the jurors were asked if any of them could not be impartial in this case.More than half of the 96 potential jurors said they could not in fact, be impartial. And they were all dismissed. Now this is something that the Trump team has really been focused on. They fought and won for that statistic, that number should be made public and not to have all of the jurors who are dismissed for cause lumped into one group. Why are they so interested in that number? Well, they're interested in that number for a possible appeal. They're hoping that if there is a conviction here, they can appeal this and try to overturn it sort of through debt by 1,000 cuts by raising every issue that they see over the course of jury selection and this trial. Now, as Trump left the court on Monday, it was interesting, even though so much happened over the course of the day, he was focused on the fact that as a criminal defendant, he is required to be inside the court throughout these proceedings unless he can get a waiver. And he suggested repeatedly that the judge said he couldn't attend as his son Barron's high school graduation. Well, the judge actually hasn't ruled on that question. But the judge did deny a request for Trump to be able to attend next week's Supreme Court arguments on presidential immunity. The judge noting there is no requirement for Trump to be at the high court, but he is as a criminal defendant in Manhattan required to be here for every day of this case. Paula Reid, CNN, New York.",

And this is a strategy that has drawn the ire of other nations like the U.S. that have warned China of overcapacity, over manufacturing and dumping.Now in China, in regards to its economy, its manufacturing that's doing the heavy lifting here, but there are other very significant economic challenges. We spoke to Louise Liu earlier she is the China economist at Oxford Economics. And this is how she broke it down for us. She said this, quote, economic momentum gains pace on a sequential basis in Q1, supported by broad manufacturing outperformance festivities boosted household spending, she's referring to the Lunar New Year and the feedthrough of easy policy settings and investments. However, standalone March activity indicators suggest weakness coming through the post Lunar New Year, unquote. Well, China has been struggling to bounce back and to commit to a sustainable economic recovery after that protracted post pandemic slump. It faces quite a number of challenges, including weak consumer spending, high youth unemployment, deflation and also mounting local government debt. But above all, the ongoing property slump, this is the one single major drag on China's economy and it is still there. Now, earlier this year, China set that bold growth target of around 5 percent this year, President Xi Jinping he called on the nation to unleash what he called new productive forces, which is Xi Jinping speak for a high tech upgrade for the economy.
