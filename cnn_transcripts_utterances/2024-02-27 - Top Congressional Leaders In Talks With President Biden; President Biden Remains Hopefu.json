Top congressional leaders are in talks with U.S. President Joe Biden. He's hoping to persuade them to reach a funding deal. Now without it, the government could see a partial shutdown in just four days, and the fate of Ukraine may be hanging in the balance without an agreement on a new U.S. aid package. Moments ago, the President spoke ahead of the meeting and said they will get a deal. And if all of this feels familiar, it's because this is the fourth time now since September that lawmakers have run up against a funding deadline. Listen to two Democrats making an urgent plea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH WARREN, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT: What is wrong with these people? This is -- this is the central thing Congress is supposed to do. The Republicans can't seem to get themselves organized just to sign off on the basic work they're supposed to do. This is just ridiculous. JOE MANCHIN, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT: I swear to God, this is -- it is sinful, what's going on, the games are being played right now with American people and all the people are depending on the services of the federal government, and we can't even get our act together. It's a shame. (END VIDEO CLIP) CNN's Lauren Fox is keeping an eye on all of the unfolding drama, and she joins us live from Capitol Hill. So, Lauren, there are multiple people from the House and Senate leadership in this meeting. But of course, most of the pressure will be on one man, and that is Speaker Mike Johnson. What are you hearing about his strategy here?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, all eyes are on Speaker Johnson. And you've heard from both the Republican and Democraticleader in the Senate that they want to wrap this up. Their argument is that they are now five months into this fiscal year. And their argument is that this has really been agonizing, given the fact that every few months you have to have this dance around whether or not the government is going to be funded. The difference here is that Speaker Johnson has a completely different set of pressures that are facing him. He has members of his hard right flank who are pushing for policy writers, who are arguing that if he can't get those writers included as part of this negotiation, that he should stick to a one-year spending bill. And the reason that they want that one-year Spending Bill at current levels is because there was a provision in the Debt Ceiling Bill that would trigger across-the-board cuts after May 1st, if that's the route Johnson goes. That's something that's very appealing to conservatives who want to make sure that this government spending is cut down. Now, the difficulty for Johnson is a lot of the people who are egging him on, a lot of the conservatives who are trying to pressure him right now are not members who traditionally vote for spending bills at all. And that is why Democrats really have the leverage here, because they are looking across the Capitol and saying, this guy can't pass anything with just Republican votes, therefore he's going to need a number of Democrats to get this across the aisle. So, no, we're not going to give you the poison pills you want, and it's time to wrap this up. So that's where negotiations currently stand. But again, there's just a couple of days left. This deadline is Friday into Saturday at midnight. And the other factor here is that House Republicans have a rule within their conference that says that legislation has to be rolled out for 72 hours ahead of when a vote takes place. That means today is D-Day to finally agree to how to fund those four Spending Bills that are due on Friday. And that's why this crunch time, that's why this meeting is so, so pivotal. Bianna.",

It's the most rosy take on these negotiations that we've heard so far. And of course, we're talking to sources in all the different groups who are participating in these talks. As you know well, Bianna, Hamas and Israel never agree on anything. And yet on this, they seem to be in agreement that Biden is essentially getting ahead of himself. An Israeli official spoke to CNN earlier, expressing surprise at the optimism that we heard from the President there. Hamas, as you noted, they say that there's no sense that any kind of ceasefire is going to affect as of next week. And Qatar, which is at the center of this, says that they are still feverishly working to iron out an agreement. But there is progress, Bianna. We have seen that. There was an important meeting on Friday with the intelligence chiefs from Egypt, Israel and the United States, as well as the Qatari Prime Minister. That was followed up by a meeting yesterday in Doha with what are known as technical teams. So, they are putting the finer points on some of these broad strokes that we've been hearing about. And so we do have a pretty good sense of what we think a deal would look like if and when it goes into effect. We are hearing that it would be around 40 Israeli hostages who would be released by Hamas and the other groups who are holding them. The same time, there would be an expectation for Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli prisons. And we don't really have a sense of how many of those prisoners would -- would be released. If IDF soldiers are released among those hostages, you can imagine that Hamas would be asking for a higher ratio, as it's known, of Palestinian prisoners to be released. And then, Bianna, I have been told that Hamas has softened some of their positions, some of their demands. You remember that Prime Minister Netanyahu had called a Hamas counterproposal crazy and delusional. And so, Hamas has actually backed off of the number of prisoners that they are demanding be released in this first phase, that IDF troops leave Gaza entirely and that there be an agreement over an end to the war. Now, those are certainly things that Hamas is going to be asking for later on in the negotiations. But it does appear that the parties are getting closer to a first phase. And during a pause in a first phase, some of those more complex issues are expected to be addressed. One thing does appear clear, Bianna, is that the U.S. does want a ceasefire in place, a pause in the fighting, and the beginning of these hostages being released by the start of Ramadan, that is on March 10th.

He's a formerMiddle East negotiator for the U.S. State Department and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Aaron, good to see you, as always. So, first, your thoughts on the President's rather rosy, optimistic, and surprising deadline that he set for himself. It seems that the other parties were not aware of this as soon as Monday. AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPT. MIDDEL EAST NEGOTIATOR: No, it's fascinating. And I'm sure that the President, and we all do, hopes that, in fact, this deadline that he's created is real. But one of the first primary rules of negotiation is that you never appear to be in more of a hurry than the people you're negotiating with. And it may well be. I was actually quite struck by the fact that the President actually offered up a date, weekend. Then he actually said by Monday. There's been some pushback from Hamas now. Their external leadership, and they're not the principal decision-makers here. Their external leadership saying that they're disappointed in the Paris framework and we're not close to a deal. So, I doubt if the President's remarks had that impact. But it just goes to show you that nobody ever lost money betting against any Israeli- Palestinian agreement on anything.",

What do you make of that strategy on the part of the Israelis?

But I have no doubt that this Prime Minister and much of the Israeli military believes that they need to go into Rafah. They need to destroy those tunnels that link Rafah to Sinai, which has been a route of huge smuggling. And they also need to work out with the Egyptians how to monitor the so-called Philadelphia Corridor, which is roughly eight miles of Egyptian-Gazan border, over which, through which many, much of the smuggling occurs. And there are Hamas battalions in Rafah. So, what boggles the mind, though, is how are they going to produce a plan to relocate a million humans into safe zones and corridors with potable water, with shelter, with proper access to medical attention? It just seems almost impossible. And clearly, based on five months of war, it's clear they cannot prosecute a war against Hamas without doing grave injury. The exponential rise of Palestinian deaths is a consequence. So, that one's hard to get. It's hard to analyze what their calculations are.",

The big finding here, so-called gaps in Boeing's safety culture, that was the fear by observers after the 737 MAX 9 door plug blowout. But this report was commissioned a year ago, long before that incident last month. This review panel of airlines, unions and safety units at other aerospace companies are brought together by the Federal Aviation Administration. The inspiration, as you mentioned, the fatal 737 MAX 8 crashes abroad in 2018 and 2019. This group found that employees on the production line at Boeing did not know how to report safety problems to their managers. Workers said they were concerned about retaliation for reporting those issues. And the report also calls out quality issues that demonstrate an overall poor safety culture. Remember, it was essentially a quality control problem that the NTSB detailed in their initial report on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. That plane left the Boeing factory without the four critical bolts that keep the door plug in place. Here is the big takeaway quote from this report. \"The expert panel observed a disconnect between Boeing senior management and other members of the organization on safety culture.\" This only confirms what critics have been saying, that Boeing has really lost its way. Boeing now has six months to respond here. The big question, though, is what the FAA will find in these other reports that are forthcoming. It's about to put out a report on Boeing quality control. It has about two dozen inspectors on the ground at Boeing's plant in Washington. And that report could come out any day now. Bianna.",

This is an issue that is more on the nose, that Boeing may have sort of flown a little bit too close to the sun here, and now it has to fix some really serious problems that are far and wide at Boeing.

But even in previous elections without a campaign like this, we had seen more than 10,000 people vote uncommitted for various reasons. So, we do expect that number to be higher than what's been put out as a goal up to this point. But again, that is to try and send a message that when you look at a general election portion of things, there is a much larger population that could be at play here based on his handling of what's happening. And that is a critical factor to keep an eye on. And then on the Republican side of things, Donald Trump is most likely to win.

In the meantime, the consequences are quite significant, not only in avoiding a government shutdown, but we still have the $93billion supplemental, with $60 billion being allotted for Ukraine, hanging in the balance here. Is there any view from what you're hearing that there's movement in terms of finding a resolution in seeing that bill actually pass and the aid start going to Ukraine? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, this has real life consequences, as all of these discussions over money do. When we're speaking of Ukraine, we know that the situation is dire right now in the front lines of Ukraine. They're running out of ammunition, and the United States has been one of the major funders of actual money for guns, ammo, all sorts of military equipment. And so, this money is very, very much needed. And the person that holds the purse, that is the person who really holds the strings here, is again, Speaker Johnson. He has chosen, even though that funding package passed in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate, in the lower house, which is the House of Representatives, which he controls, he has seen fit not to actually put this to the floor. That is something that he determines. And so, I think it's going to be a major source of discussion with the President right now. He, President Biden, has said that he wants to see this funding package passed. It also involves money to Israel, which is a key ally of the United States. And so, it remains to be seen what kind of deal can be struck here. But all these things are kind of tied together because they all meet at one single person, which is, of course, Speaker Johnson, who, let's be reminded here, his predecessor was kicked out by the hard right because they didn't want him to make a deal with Democrats over funding. And here we are again with the same group of people making the same demands. And Speaker Johnson's very political future is on the line here.",

And that seems to be a big focus for voters in Michigan. The President likely is anticipated and expected to win. That having been said, there is this protest movement, the so-called uncommitted group of people that are hoping to secure 10,000, if not more, votes to send a sharp message to President Biden about his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. What are the ramifications here? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, one of the things that this has in common to the funding fight that we just -- were talking about is this idea of minority rule. We have small groups of people having an outsized effect on policy. And this, in this case, it is the Muslim American community in a key swing state of Michigan. They are not a large number in regards to the total population of this country. But this issue is incredibly important to them. And they hold an outsized role in this particular part of the country. And so, you know, one of the things that people are going to be looking for is not whether President Biden is going to actually win the primary, that's a foregone conclusion. But if they can actually have this effect, if we see actually people not showing up to vote, if we see them voting uncommitted, that will send a signal and a very strong signal to the White House, which we already know is very worried about this issue, saying basically, you know, you have to take this seriously. What's happening in the Middle East is impacting what's happening here in the United States in terms of what's going to happen in November. And so, you really have to take our demands quite seriously. One of the other things that I'm looking for in Michigan as well is union workers, black voters, suburban women. Do they show up for President Biden? He needs this coalition if he's going to win in November. And Michigan is a great state to take their temperature, too. It's not only about the Muslim American vote. There's going to be a lot of key indicators here that are going to tell us maybe how well Biden might do in November.",

Well, the Kremlin is warning the West against sending troops to Ukraine, saying conflict with Russia would be inevitable if that ever happened. It comes the day after French President Emmanuel Macron floated the possibility of deploying European forces to Ukraine at an E.U. conference in Paris. European leaders were quick to push back. Italy, Spain and the U.K. said they are not considering the possibility. And Germany's chancellor also rejected the idea.

It was an intense meeting. It was an honest meeting. And ultimately, it was a productive meeting. We discussed three issues. First, the need to avoid a government shutdown and to fund the government so that we can address the needs of the American people in terms of their health, their safety and their economic well- being. We are making real progress on the appropriations bills that are scheduled to lapse on March 1st. And I'm cautiously optimistic that we can do what is necessary within the next day or so to close down these bills and avoid a government shutdown. At the same time, it may be important to come to an agreement that's bipartisan and anchored in common sense to extend the pending expiration of the eight additional bills that are scheduled to lapse on March 8th so that good faith, tough negotiations can continue in the absence of a government shutdown. Second, we discussed the urgent national security priorities of the American people as captured in the bipartisan, comprehensive Senate passed legislation. This is an existential moment for the free world as it relates to being there for our democratic allies in Ukraine, in Israel and in the Indo-Pacific. And also at the same period of time making sure that we provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians who are in harm's way in Gaza or in other theaters of war through no fault of their own. Third, as Leader Schumer indicated, we had an open and honest and a candid, firm discussion about the border. We all agree that we have a broken immigration system and there is a need to address the challenges at the border in a thoughtful, bipartisan way. As Democrats, we support a safe, a strong, a secure and a humane border. We just need our House Republican colleagues not to play politics and engage in political stunts relative to the border but to sit down as was done in the Senate and enter into good faith discussions about fixing our broken immigration system. As Democrats, we stand ready to do just that.",

But shaken that here they are fighting without arms against a brutal dictator who will just do anything to kill them. And the intensity in that room was surprising to me. But because of the passion of the President, the Vice President, Leader Jeffries, Leader McConnell and myself, it was. And, you know, Johnson tried to answer and he made it clear he wants to do something on the border. But we made it clear to him we can't tarry or the war could be lost. And second, we had to, we wanted to do border and have a tough, secure border plan as we showed, we Democrats showed in the Senate. But he can't say it won't do Ukraine until we get border.
