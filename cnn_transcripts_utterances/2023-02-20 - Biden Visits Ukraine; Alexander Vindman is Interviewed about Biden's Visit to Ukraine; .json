      "sentences": "Good Monday morning to you. I'm Jim Sciutto.A significant day in Ukraine and Europe as the U.S. president, Joe Biden, makes a surprise visit to the war-torn capital of Kyiv as air raid sirens sounded around him. Walking side by side there in the capital with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Biden, with this visit, sending a strong message to Ukraine and to Russia. It is his first trip to the country since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago. CNN has learned the president made the final decision only on Friday to make the unannounced visit. This after multiple invitations from Zelenskyy. This morning, the Ukrainian president says that Biden's visit leaves Ukraine, quote, closer to victory, calling it the most important visit to his country in the history of U.S./Ukraine relations. During a news conference, President Biden announced a fresh swath of sanctions against Russia, as well as pledging another half billion dollars in military aid, including weapons to Ukraine.

And they made a decision. They weighed the concerns here. Obviously, the dangers of having a president go into an active war zone where there is no U.S. military presence. I can't remember, in recent memory, Jim, I don't know if you can either, of when that has actually happened. And so they did decide it was a manageable risk. They had President Biden go and go into Ukraine as he had those few precious hours on the ground with President Zelenskyy. And the White House said that he saw the emphasis of that and that he only had so much time with him. And so they did notify the Russians, we are told, in the hours before President Biden actually showed up in Ukraine. They did not want there to be any kind of miscommunication. They called it a deconfliction to make sure that, obviously, his safety could be part of that consideration as he was traveling there. He was there for a few hours on the ground. He announced a new half a billion dollars in aid that's going to go to Ukraine. A lot of it is similar to what we've seen them send before when it comes to artillery and howitzer. You did not hear those long-range missiles that President Zelenskyy has asked for, or the F-16 fighter jets that he and his aides have said they do believe that they need as we turn into this next phase of the war. That is still going to be a conversation that President Biden will be having when he's on the ground here in Poland, which has been a vocal advocate for Ukraine. And so just notable in and of itself, though, this is President Biden's eighth time in Ukraine, obviously his first as president and his first since Russia invaded nearly a year ago, Jim.",

      "sentences": "Well, to your point, Kaitlan, U.S. presidents have visited war zones before. Iraq, Afghanistan. This one's different. The U.S. is not at war there. The U.S. does not have full control over the security on the ground. Quite a risk. I'm sure the security measures put in place, notable.Kaitlan, thanks so much. Clarissa, you were able to see there in the capital, Kyiv, Biden meet with Zelenskyy this morning. I wonder, what is the reception in Ukraine to this? Boost to moral? How significant for Ukrainians? [09:05:00] CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think it's definitely significant. There has been a lot of excitement across the city. This city was pretty much brought to a standstill in terms of traffic this morning. Large parts of the center cut off to vehicles entirely. But the only thing you saw on social media were essentially messages of excitement that President Biden was finally making this trip. We heard President Zelenskyy come out and say with this visit or with this conversation with President Biden, Ukraine is now one step closer to victory. And as you just heard there with Kaitlan, I mean this is something that took a lot of planning. They were standing right where I am here in the central square. That's St. Michael's Church. This is the square. It's a vast, open area. Not an easy thing to secure. You can see perhaps in the background, those are some Russian tanks that have been destroyed by Ukrainian forces. And beyond that, you can see the hotel where some of our live shot positions are. This is what we look at. Well, this morning, we had multiple visits from security officers saying, basically, you cannot be near those windows. You cannot film anything from those windows. At one point they even asked us to shut the curtain. That is how much intensity there was around the security situation. When President Biden and Zelenskyy came out of the church, they followed behind two soldiers carrying wreaths. And you can see over here, you can also see there's a lot of journalists here. It's been a very big day for international journalists from all over the world. But you can see here the U.S. wreath that was laid here at the wall of fallen defenders. Those who have been killed in the Russia/Ukraine war. After that, President Zelenskyy and President Biden embraced warmly and then President Biden got into his motorcade, which was a large size motorcade, at least a dozen vehicles, and left from that direction there. What was interesting, Jim, is that this whole thing didn't last -- this part of it, at least, didn't last more than ten minutes. They were inside the church for five minutes, air raid sirens started going off. Again, that's a pretty regular almost daily occurrence here in Kyiv. But it does take on an added level of importance when the U.S. president is visiting. Then they had about five minutes out here on the square laying that wreath before they moved on. But certainly the overwhelming response from people we've spoken to has been, to quote one woman, wow, amazing, the big boss came here.",

      "sentences": "Yes. That's interesting, Clarissa, watching you there with those faces behind. I  remember on previous visits there they would have pictures of those who were killed in the Maidan protests in 2014. That death toll, those pictures numbering in the dozens. Of course now, a year into this war, the number of Ukrainian dead numbering in the thousands. All those faces. Clarissa Ward in Kyiv, thanks so much.Joining me now to discuss, retired Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He's former European affairs director for the National Security Council. Also, I should note, born in Kyiv, Ukraine, himself before immigrating here, becoming a U.S. citizen and joining the U.S. military. Lieutenant Colonel, good to have you on this morning. I wonder, as you see the U.S. president walk the streets of Kyiv during wartime, air raid sirens -- signaling sounding behind him, what is the significance of this in your view to Ukraine? LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET.), FORMER EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: I'm proud of the president for visiting. This is probably the most important visit that a president has paid to Ukraine, the fifth visit of a president since the independence in 1991. Bill Clinton visited three times. George Bush visited once. Actually days before the fated (ph) NATO Bucharest summit in which we offered Ukraine the inevitable joining NATO but without any specific dates, kind of (INAUDIBLE) some of these events that have unfolded since. This is a very, very important visit. This is a demonstration that the president of the United States is still the leader of the free world, defending democracies against tyranny. And this is a strong signal to Putin, especially that President Putin was informed of this visit ahead of time that the U.S. will be there. I would almost argue that this probably, you know, several hours that the president was in Kyiv, were maybe the safest hours in Kyiv since the start of this war. The Russians were not going to launch an attack and threaten the president of the United States, especially when they were warned ahead of time. So, it's a very good demonstration of support and strength. And I'm glad he did it.",

Things are not going well for the Russian military in the east, even as they're willing to sacrifice troops by the thousands, it seems, on that front line there.

Secretary Blinken, over the weekend, while in Munich, said in a number of interviews that the U.S. is now concerned that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia to help in its war against Ukraine. They have not done so in the first year of the war. This would be a notable change. How significant would it be if China were to provide such lethal aid, and would that make an impact? Might it lengthen the war in your view?",

And that could make Ukraine a perpetual land of war with battles on going for years. I don't know if China is going to do this -- make this step, public step, because then it would make this bilateral relationship between U.S. and China that much more difficult and further isolate China. I think that's a -- that would be a major change in policy, but it's a risk the longer this war continues. Thank you.",

He did so kind of on the heels of some other incidents where he had to show some strength and muscularity. There's no chance that Trump would have had the fortitude to travel to a war zone where he risks his own skin. And, for that matter, he wouldn't be interested in provoking Putin. He wanted to curry favor with Putin.So, no, it's a pretty far-fetched notion that Trump would have made anything of this sort. As a matter of fact, we probably would have been in a situation where, you know, Trump would be denouncing NATO, a backbone of support to Ukraine.

In Ukraine, he has been much closer to what he promised voters in 2020, kind of the steady, senior statesman, unifying the western alliance against a global threat. And today was perhaps the most dramatic way to underscore that. And, yes, by being there and by making so clear the U.S. commitment in what Colonel Vindman points out is - it threatens to become a proxy war between the force of democracy and forces of autocracy around the world, I think he does draw a line in the sand that makes it tougher for Republicans to pursue what many of them have said they want to pursue, which is reducing and rolling back the U.S. commitment here.",

The very first thing that we saw, Jim, as we were driving into Plains yesterday was a man on a stepladder painting -- repainting this giant peanut statue. This was a prop that was part of Carter's 1976 presidential campaign. As many folks know, clearly Carter, the former president, but he was also a peanut farmer. And really he just is revered in this community. We are a stone's throw away of where he went to school. Here on main street, not far down, is a train depot that also served as the site of his headquarters in the 1970s.
