A major Russian attack could come in February, at best, in March and at worst, at the end of January.\" So in anticipation of this, he's asking for hundreds of tanks, armored vehicles, Howitzers, other materiel. So unless the general is spreading disinformation, is this potential assault on Kyiv possible, or likely? Can Putin, you know, conscript another 200,000 men? Or does he have enough already? M. DAVIS: I don't think the Ukraine are spreading disinformation. I think this is probably going to happen. I think the question is when and how successful. Certainly, the information that I'm seeing online amongst various different expats and commentators, is that it will probably stage from Belarus South towards Kyiv, that the Russians are going to have another go at trying to capture Kyiv. And the key issue is, will they make the same mistakes as they did at the beginning of the war? I don't think so. I think that the Ukrainians do have more of a challenge here going into 2023, because not only do they have to maintain their forces in Kherson Oblast and Donetsk, where they're being pushed back around Bakhmut, but they could now be facing a third front coming from Belarus itself.",

DAVIS: Well, certainly, we have yet to get into the depths of winter over there in Ukraine. And so as long as those attacks continue -- continue, the pain and the misery that the Ukrainian people are suffering in the cold will mount up. The Russians are clearly counting on these attacks to break the spirit and the will of the Ukrainians. I don't think that will succeed. I think because the Ukrainians understand that they cannot afford to give up, because if they give up, they essentially not only give up their country; they give up the lives of potentially millions of their people where Russia has occupied their territory. So the Ukrainians will continue to fight. But the Russians are clearly thinking that they can continue to attack those critical infrastructure, the power and so forth in a way to break that spirit and weaken the Ukrainian resolve.",

That is who can really turn to war from a military path to a diplomatic one. Only he can do it.\"I don't think he's going to do it. Is Zelenskyy getting out over his skis here? You know, with Europe heading into winter with an energy crisis, military shipments to Ukraine depleting weapons stockpiles at home? Is he risking the West's support and goodwill if he's seen as the one who's dragging this out? M. DAVIS: No, because as I said earlier, if the Ukrainians begin to negotiate and, essentially, allow Russia to maintain control over areas such as Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, they're effectively sacrificing the Ukrainian people in those regions to the sort of -- the brutality of the Russians that we've seen in other cities, Bucha and so forth. So I think the Ukrainians understand this is a fight to the end. They have to win. And for the West, the Ukrainians have to win, because if the Russians manage to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in this conflict, they will be emboldened. And in a few years' time, the Russians will be back, fully re-armed and ready for a wider war. So we have to ensure that Ukraine wins, and then, we have to deter Russia from ever attacking again.",

DAVIS: Well, right, but keep in mind, America is still America. We're still -- still the leading power on this planet. But more than that, America's good graces opens the door to Europe, as well. It opens the door to the West. It's a big deal. It's a big deal, for one thing, that the United States is starting -- and I say \"starting\" in quotes -- to take Africa seriously. This is a continent that is emerging as a major player. Antony Blinken has told us that in no uncertain terms. So he didn't come empty-handed. It isn't as much as China is doing, but the heft and weight of the United States is nothing to sneeze at.",

It's a totally different attitude than the one of the previous administration. The previous administration treated Africa, basically -- I don't even want to repeat it -- with disdain. This administration, what we are hearing is a respect coming to the table and coming to the people of Africa with respect but acknowledging that it has not always been just in its treatment of black people.

J. DAVIS: You know, Russia's presence and its influence is all over the continent. But it's because it is also able to influence not only by supporting regimes and supporting strongmen that we would not like supported. But keep in mind that it has been responsible for not having Africa speak with a unified and clear voice against the invasion of Ukraine. Look at the numbers. If Russia had not had the power and influence that it's had throughout that continent, this indeed would -- they would be stronger in condemning what has happened in Ukraine. And Biden was very smart to connect his comments today with the food insecurity in Africa to that, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That may be one way to convince Africa and these       African leaders to stand with the United States and the West, and to help stop Russia's invasion. He did announce more than $2 billion in food assistance for Africa, which should be very important, especially given what has happened with the quantity (ph) prices and -- because of the war.
