Damar Hamlin making this tackle on Tee Higgins, taking a shot right to the chest. Now, he stood up initially but then immediately collapsed. Medical personnel rushing out onto the field and administered CPR. All of the players on the field surrounding Hamlin and as you can see, many of them were just visibly upset. After 16 minutes, Hamlin was loaded onto an ambulance and taken off the field. Just a few hours ago, the Bills tweeted, \"Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest following a hit in our game versus the Bengals. His heartbeat was restored on the field and he was transferred to the UC Medical Center for further testing and treatment. He is currently sedated and listed in critical condition.\" Now, after the ambulance left the field, Bengals coach Zac Taylor and Bills coach Sean McDermott -- they got together with game officials and decided to pause the game at that time. And then after about an hour, the NFL officially postponed the game. Taylor and Bills receiver Stefon Diggs went to the hospital later to try to see him, according to ESPN, while the rest of the Bills team did fly back to Buffalo. And quarterback Josh Allen tweeting \"Please pray for our brother.\" Cardinals defensive end J.J. Watt was one of the many others taking to social media, saying \"The game is not important. Damar Hamlin's life is important. Please be OK. Please.\" Now, LeBron James, meanwhile -- he praised the decision to postpone the game. He was one of the many NBA players who were thinking about Hamlin after their game last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is opening day. Hello, 2023. Twenty-twenty-two, goodbye -- the worst year since 2008. A big economic week is upon us to set the tone now. Job openings, job quits, the minutes from the last Fed meeting all lead up to Friday's critical jobs report. On inflation watch, folks, gas prices ticked up slightly overnight, now at $3.23 a gallon. All right, let's bring in Spencer Jakab, editor of the \"Heard on the Street\" column at The Wall Street Journal. It was just a terrible year for markets, right? The worst trading year since 2018. The first down year in several. What I see when I look at those charts, though, is don't rely on the rearview mirror too much because we tend to bounce back after a big down year.
