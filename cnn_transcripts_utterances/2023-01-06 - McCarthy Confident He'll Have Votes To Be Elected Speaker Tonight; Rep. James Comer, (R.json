Let's go to CNN's Melanie Zanona who's live on Capitol Hill. Melanie, McCarthy flipped 15 holdouts today. What are you learning about the concessions he made to them in order to get their votes?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, that is really starting to come into focus. The number of concessions and promises that Kevin McCarthy has made over the course of these negotiations has been quite outstanding. And I should caution that this stuff has not been put on paper. There has not been anything put out that we have seen. This is based on all the reporting from me and my fantastic Hill team.But I just want to walk you through some of these things just to give the viewers a sense of what has been agreed to and what a Kevin McCarthy speakership could potentially look like. So, the big one is that he agreed for any single member to be able to call for a vote on ousting the sitting speaker. That's something Kevin McCarthy used to say he would never budge on, now he is relented and any member can call for that vote. So that could potentially undermine his authority going forward. He's agreed that his leadership Pac (ph) is not going to play in primaries to try to beat conservatives, at least in open primaries in safe districts. That's something conservative has complained about in the past. He promised to hold votes on a number of different bills, including ballot budget amendment, congressional term limits, border security. Of course, we should note that anything that passes the House has to then pass the Senate, which is held by Democrats. So, it's not like those things are necessarily going to become law, but it will give you a sense of the things that they will be voting on. McCarthy also promised that any debt ceiling hike is going to be paired with spending cuts. That's a big one because it could really tee up a fiscal showdown as Democrats have drawn a line in the sand about exchanging those types of things. And finally, more Freedom Caucus representation on committees including the powerful House Rules Committee, which has say over which bills come to the floor and how. So that just gives you a sense of what Kevin McCarthy's speakership could look like, Jake.",

If there are some of my colleagues on the Republican side that are a little skeptical, I tell them, just give him a chance, and these guys have done well. You know, two years ago, we would have said Thomas Massie and Jim Jordan would have been two of the guys that would have been creating havoc, and they're outstanding members, and they've been leading the way and trying to negotiate a deal for speakership.

Most members of Congress on the Republican side, we've all campaigned and spent money in mailers and on T.V. ads saying that were going to do this, but yet we've never voted on that for whatever reason. I think these guys on the Rules Committee will make sure that we actually do the things we campaigned and said we would do.So, I think that's a positive. And I'm hopeful that when they see that we start actually voting on the bills that we campaigned on, that they'll come around and realize we have to govern, we have to get to 218.

ADAM KINZINGER, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, ILLINOIS: Well, so first off, I mean, I thought that he would do literally whatever he needed to win this position, and I mean, he gets credit for that. He's been going through a hard negotiation. If he does win, really, it is historic. I do think the question is, though, how can he govern? And you know, knowing what I know about the House and some of the moments we've been through, and then seeing some of the things he's going to give away. So, for instance, the whole, you know, one person to vacate the chair, that's going to be chaos. But the bigger things are Rules Committee positions for some of these Freedom Caucus members. You can't get a bill to the floor, as you were mentioning, without going through the Rules Committee. You have things like that.

And I don't believe that all Republicans are sympathetic to the MAGA agenda.That being said, it's very difficult to defend the Republican Party when only one of their members takes the time to show up and show support for law enforcement. It was there defending them that day. It's disgraceful. It's an embarrassment for their party, and it's disgraceful behavior.
