It's in place, but it appears that it is utilized far less in Colorado than in other states that have laws in place. According to one study, Colorado has seen relatively few petitions for these protective orders to get weapons removed, since it's -- since it was passed in January of 2020. Some -- 109 filings in the first year only a slight increase in the two years since, by contrast for everyone, more than 9000 petitions have been filed in Florida since the state passed its law in 2018. There could be many reasons for a discrepancy here, of course, why do you think that is?",

We're in a -- in a -- what they all felt was a safe place.You know, 50 years ago, that we as a country came together and created something called the national highway safety transportation authority or administration, I guess it was, and they, over the last -- it's a little bit more than 50 years have dramatically reduced the number of highway fatalities without taking away anyone's car, without taking away anyone's right to drive.

FIFA, there's no one that deserves this kind of controversy and fiasco more than FIFA for giving the World Cup to Qatar back in 2010. We could have telegraphed all of this even then. And in fact, the steady drumbeat of controversies and stories, the human rights violations of the migrant workers, the concern obviously now apparent that we should have been concerned over LGBTQ rights, and how Qatar and FIFA with handle that.This is a catastrophe -- frankly, a PR catastrophe of their own making. They deserve this. And instead of talking soccer and sports, we're talking about this, as we should be, the controversy about the armbands. What they were saying -- what FIFA was saying as many now know is that if you were the armband that would be on the captain, immediately that he would get a yellow card. And if you get two of those, you're out of that match and the next match and your team play one person down. I so wish that the European countries had told FIFA to go jump in the lake because there's no way that FIFA could have been -- actually, they could have gone ahead with it but it would have tainted their entire tournament at the very beginning.
