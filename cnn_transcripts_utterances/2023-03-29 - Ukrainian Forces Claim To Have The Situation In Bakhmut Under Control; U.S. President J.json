      "sentences": "Well, a very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Paula Newton in for Isa Soares. Tonight, Ukraine forcesclaimed to have the situation in Bakhmut under control. Has Russia lost the momentum in and around that city? Then a strained friendship. President Biden says publicly that the Israeli prime minister should walk away from his controversial judicial reforms. We'll tell you how Benjamin Netanyahu is responding. And Britain's King Charles on his very first official state visit. We are live with him in Berlin. Now, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, admits his forces in Bakhmut have been quote, \"pretty battered\", but Yevgeny Prigozhin insists his mercenaries have practically destroyed the Ukrainian army. Again, those are his claims and continue, he does, saying they will win the battle for the eastern city. Ukrainian officials, of course, dispute that claim, saying they are the ones that are keeping control of Bakhmut. Now, the U.S. believes there are about 6,000 Wagner mercenaries currently fighting there. And they are suffering serious losses. A top U.S. General, saying Ukrainian defense forces are quote, \"inflicting a lot of death and destruction on those guys. Ben Wedeman joins me now from eastern Ukraine. And Ben, really curious to get your insights here. You've been on the ground there for a few days. What more have you learned about the state of play, especially there in Bakhmut? And I know that you've heard from both sides in terms of each giving their position and sometimes putting forward disinformation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, seriously, the situation is unclear. Back in January, we were almost everyday in Bakhmut, but since the 21st of February, the Ukrainians declared Bakhmut a red zone. So volunteers and journalists simply cannot go there, so I can't tell you firsthand. But what we are hearing is that the Ukrainians are still controlling perhaps 40 percent of the city that they have lost some ground over the last few weeks. But the Ukrainians insist that the lines in their words have stabilized now. Now, what you have ongoing there is really -- it's been called a meat grinder. We could call it a bloodbath. There are heavy casualties on both sides. Now the ratio of dead Ukrainians to dead Russians, it's not clear. Some put it as much as five dead Russians for every one dead Ukrainian. Others say it's more like one dead Russian or rather two dead Russians for one Ukrainian. So the battle is intense, and certainly, what we've seen is that there are many Ukrainian forces deployed on the outskirts of Bakhmut. They've dug defensive positions. There's lots of armor in the area. So in the event the Ukrainians can no longer hold Bakhmut, they hold the high ground to the west of the city, and they certainly would be able to stop a Russian advance there. It's been really battle of quantity versus quality. The Russians obviously have a huge numerical advantage, and certainly in terms of weaponry, their weaponry may be antiquated, but they have a lot of ammunition which we've heard from Ukrainian officials. That they don't seem to be suffering, the Russians that is, from a shortage of artillery shells. But certainly, the situation is more or less stalemated, but at a high price to both sides, Paula?",

Now, meanwhile, we want to bring you back to the Ukrainian capital as unusual and bloodless standoff is taking place at a monastery that serves as home to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Now, Ukrainian officials are ordering monks and other clergy to leave the historic Kyiv Pechersk Lavra Complex. Today, in fact, is the deadline, and you may be asking yourself why? Well, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is a branch that has traditionally been loyal to the leader of the Russian Church. That's patriarch Rio(ph). Rio(ph) is in fact, a close ally of Russia's president and here is the key. He is a vocal supporter of the war. Last year, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church cut ties with Moscow and declared its own independence. Oleksandr Tkachenko is Ukraine's Minister of Culture and Information Policy, and he joins me now from Kyiv. You have ordered them out. The deadline is today. By any measure, your actions could be portrayed as extreme. So, why are they necessary? Are you saying that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church -- Orthodox Church poses a national security risk to your country? We seem to be -- we seem to be having some trouble with the audio.

So, it doesn't mean that they necessarily need to leave tomorrow or today. It means a process. Legal process, transparent process of canceling disagreement, which we for sure understand was illegal -- and part is, there were violations of this agreement. So that's first issue. Second issue, it's not Ukrainian Orthodox Church. We do have Orthodox Ukrainian Church, which go to Thomas from Patriarch Rahalamils(ph)several years ago.
