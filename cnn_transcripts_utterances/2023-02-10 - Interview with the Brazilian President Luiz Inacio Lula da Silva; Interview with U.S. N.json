I'm Christiane Amanpour at the White House, where today the U.S. and Brazilian presidents meet to kickstart a new relationship after the divisive Trump-Bolsonaro era. Joe Biden and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva agree that they need to bolster democracy, advance human rights, and tackle climate change, but there is tough work ahead. They each lead countries roiled by right wing extremism stirred by their predecessors. And indeed, just days after Lula da Silva's inauguration last month, Brazil suffered its own January 6th style attack on government buildings. On Ukraine though, they differ. With Lula da Silva calling for non- intervention and peace talks now, just as Kyiv weathers yet another Russian assault on its infrastructure. Lula has staged a stunning return to power after his first presidency ended in 2010. And his opponents threw him in jail. When we sat down here in Washington for an exclusive interview, he told me that he is confident democracy will prevail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I would never could imagine that it could happen in the U.S. and North America, the invasion of the capital. As I could -- never could have imagine that in Brazil after democratic procession elections would -- could have an invasion of the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. And so, this means that you have extreme right running around the world, and extreme right that is very nervous and that uses fake news as if it was a tool to develop politics and talk to people -- communicate to people. And we have to destroy, you know, this narrative that the use against the Democrats. And I should say that yesterday, that I want to congratulate President Biden for his excellent speech at the State of the Union at the national Congress. That it was a very, very interesting speech. It looks like he was talking to Brazil because in Brazil happens the same thing that's going on in the U.S. now.",

And there's -- he has the right to explain himself to civil society. He has a right to be tried in the most dependent way, in the way that I was not treated. I want him to be considered innocent while proved to the contrary and -- which I didn't have that. So, that's why I'm not concerned. I want him to be tried according to the law. And I can only touch this issue with Biden if President Biden raises this issue. If he doesn't raise it, I did not come here to speak badly about a president that everybody knows that he is a copycat -- a fit copycat of what Trump was to the U.S.",

Now, a Harvard political scientist has notedthat in Brazil, after January the 8th, your institutions, government, media, public opinion, Supreme Court, everything was very quick to unify in opposition to the January 8th uprising in your country. Much quicker than the public space here in the United States. So, my question to you is, do you believe now, just a month later, that democracy is secured in your country? DA SILVA (through translator): Well, I believe that the institutions that were created to guarantee the democratic process are very well prepared to confront and face any coup d'etat attempt. Because what happened in Brazil was a coup d'etat attempt organized, simply (ph), that it would happen on January 1 when I took office. It didn't happen on January 1 because there were a lot of people in the streets. So, they decided that, when everybody was already -- we had tranquility, everything was going well, they tried this coup d'etat on the 8th of January. I can guarantee you that the Brazilian institutions are committed to the democratic process. The national caucus, the presidency of the republic, and judiciary power, the branch of power. Everybody is together so that we can guarantee democracy. The church, the social movements, society, and civil society as a whole, they do not want that democracy should be dismantled or broken.

President Barack Obama was singing yourpraises, and many people realized and appreciated that you had raised tens of millions of poor, poor Brazilians from extreme poverty. It's a different Brazil now. The economy is not great. The agriculture, the commodities, all those prices are not what they were when you were first in office. And it's a very divided country. You won by a tiny little bit. What do you have to do to deliver to the people who voted for you and to unify the country? DA SILVA (through translator): Well, I believe that -- as I give is a reference the Brazil that I had in 2003. As a reference to Brazil in 2003 had an inflation of 12 percent a year and unemployment above five percent. And now the -- and Brazil in 2003 also had a foreign debt of $30 billion. And so -- and we had a domestic public debt of 60.7 of the GDP. What did we do that? We've reduced the public debt from 60.7 to 37 percent. We paid $30 billion back to the IMF and we had hard currency -- international currency reserve of $370 billion. And we reduced inflation to four and a half percent from eight percent. And we created 22 million jobs in Brazil, that's what we did during my two terms and that's what we're going to do again. This is what I want to do again. And my policies are very simple one. To include the poor people in the public budget, in the national budget. They have to participate in the economy. We have to have a strong policy to give incentives to the small and medium sized enterprises. And we have to help the small and medium sized enterprises, help the co-ops and go back to developing infrastructure policy to build low income housing, public housing, basic sanitation, highways, roadways. And so, we have projects and we have designs. Even more important, we know how to do it.

How do you do that when half the population, as I said, despises you? DA SILVA (through translator): Well, we're going to have elections in Brazil after the U.S. elections.

Because we never could we imagine that in a country that was the symbol of democracy in the world, someone could try to invade the capital or that someone could be as inhuman as Trump was.

It's necessary that we should build up interlocutors to talk with the different parties that are in confrontation. That is my thesis.

And I think the other thing that happens too is that in reading other scholars at the time talk about kinds of black culture and black -- African American literature in particular, it dawned on me that I didn't necessarily recognize the black people that they were talking about.

You know, and I think that thinking in that way there was a pleasure and a possibility that opened up. Thinking too about David Walker's \"Appeal,\" which is known for its anger. But what if that anger is not an end to itself but an anger that is supposed to mobilize the certainty of the joy that black people would experience once they actually took ownership of this country? Thinking too about Phillis Wheatley and Obour Tanner, you've got these two black women who are friends during the Revolutionary War, and they figured out how to keep talking to one another even when they are refugees from their respective homes. Now, they keep sending letters. And Obour Tanner keeps those letters for another 50 or 60 years.",

Obour Tanner is based in Newport, Rhode Island, which is not too far. And they correspond for a number of years. The extent of correspondence is from 1772 to 1779. And they talk about all kinds of things. They talk about God. They talk about the death of Susanna Wheatley, who is the enslaver or mistress too Phillis Wheatley. They talk about the sale of Wheatley's books. Obour Tanner helps Phillis Wheatley to sell her books in and around Newport. So, I think it is a fascinating entry into this friendship between two enslaved at times black women. And Obour Tanner is the reason that we have Phillis Wheatley's letters. She keeps the letters and ends up giving them to her pastor's wife, Katherine Edes Beecher in the early 1830s, just before she dies and in a meandering way. Most of the letters end up at the Massachusetts Historical Society.

So, there is the meeting minutes of the Free African Union Society, there are letters too that they have, there's Caesar Lyndon, who is my favorite. He keeps this account book.
