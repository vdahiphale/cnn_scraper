And the sweet taste of success, the Kansas City Chiefs now have back-to- back Super Bowl titles. After more than four months in captivity, it took just minutes to bring a pair of Israeli hostages to freedom. The IDF says they were being held in a house in Rafah, on the southernmost tip of Gaza, as Israeli forces fended off the Hamas captives with gunfire and struck from the sky, the men were whisked to safety. The Hamas-run health ministry says 94 people were killed in those airstrikes. The former hostages are now set to be in good condition at Israeli hospital. Israel's prime minister suggests the ends justify the means.",

All of those forces coming together to put together this operation that happened overnight at 1:49 a.m. local time, Special Forces, breaching a residential building in a neighborhood of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza they breached that building, they went to the second floor where they say that these two men, Louis Har, 70 years old and 60-year-old Fernando Marman were being held by Hamas fighters. They fled that building under fire from Hamas fighters in the area. But one minute after that building was breached Israeli Air Force carrying out a series of strikes throughout the city of Rafah, resulting in heavy casualties. At least, 94 people were killed, according to the Hamas-run ministry of health, many more injured and that death toll is expected to rise. We know that according to videos and people on the scene that there were women and children among those who were killed, and medical facilities were told were overwhelmed by the number of casualties. But the Israeli Prime Minister says that this operation is effectively evidence of the fact that military pressure, in his view, is essential to securing the release of the hostages. Although, it is important to note that this is only the second successful military operation to actually free hostages being held captive in Gaza. But one thing is for sure is that these two men have now been reunited with their families at a hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. We're told that they received a call overnight telling them that their loved ones had been rescued that they were waiting for them at that hospital.

He says that the military is planning for an evacuation of civilians from Rafah. But remember, there are 1.4 million people now crowded in a city where there are normally only 300,000 residents. So, the enormity of that challenge, the scale of this problem is something that the Israeli military is currently planning for, but so far, we haven't heard a whole lot of detail. But certainly. last night, the people of Rafah got a taste, this very small taste of what a military operation in that city would look like.

This is the international consensus that Sigrid has just referred to. What we need today is a humanitarian ceasefire that has been our position consistently. And I think that, you know, whilst recognizing what Sigrid has said, and this is indeed included in resolution 2720, the hostages must come out. And that has been an unequivocal position of the United Arab Emirates that these hostages must be released, but they cannot be released in the state of conflict when. I've met with hostage families, honestly, that my heart goes out to them. The extraordinary trauma and pain that they are also feeling with their loved ones captured in the Gaza Strip. Having said that, the scale of the response, the scale of the devastation in Gaza, with 70 percent of it uninhabitable today, and these are people that have been many times displaced, I think shows that we need to, as Sigrid has said, stop, we need to a pause, we need that to lead to a more permanent ceasefire. We need the hostages out, we need the scale up of aid going in. Now, what Becky is pointing to is that the resolutions are not working in the way that they were intended to work, and that is always the case with diplomatic toolkits.
