The incident is being investigated as a terror attack.The suspect has been identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. citizen and army veteran. He was killed in a shootout with police. Investigators say he made recordings on the drive from Texas to Louisiana about joining ISIS and killing his family. One witness described the scene on Bourbon Street on Wednesday morning.

It seems that the authorities have found a location, a house, a rental, an Airbnb in New Orleans where they believe that these explosives were made. Was there somebody else renting that with him or did he rent it in his own name?So these are some of the immediate questions. Is there another attack in that area to come? Then the next one, are there associates that he was talking to by phone, online, by other means that could be preparing their own attacks in other parts of the United States? So sort of as a follow-on from this. So that will be another immediate concern. And I think we're seeing that reflected in the fact that the sporting events that were planned in New Orleans has sort of been given a slight delay. That will allow the police to sort of give some level, a measure of certainty about safety there. But then you get to the next big issue which is who was supporting him more broadly? Have they gone to ground if they're not planning something else? Can the police get to them?

He presented himself, as we saw in that video clip, as a professional in the home sales industry. This was somebody who, until recently, had seemed fairly normal in society, but he was having financial issues. He's saying that he was short of money, that he wanted to settle a second divorce quickly because his business was suffering. Mental crisis. It speaks to mental crisis, and we've seen before with attackers, whether it's in the name of ISIS or others, that they go through a mental crisis, which leads to a breakdown, which leads to a change in behavior.

Absolutely, as you say, ISIS and Al-Qaeda have both talked about using vehicles as a means of attack, use a pedestrian area, get to high speed, maximum casualties. The reason they do that is that came about 15 years ago.These terror groups before tried to sort of have mass participation, big planned explosions, that sort of thing. Intelligence -- the intelligence community was able to sort of see those coming, get the warnings because they were grouping together, having discussions, and stop them. So the vehicle became an easy way of perpetrating terror. So you can ask the question in two levels here at the moment. The authorities are saying he didn't act alone, OK. Does that mean intelligence opportunities were missed, that there was some level of communication that they didn't see? And then, of course, the idea that pedestrian areas are protected, protected with bollards, protected with other things. And in this case, as we heard Omar reporting there, the bollard was down because new bollards were being put in place. But at that event, as you say, New Year's Eve, mass pedestrian participation, therefore a potential target. Why would you not have a backup available?

Of note here with ISIS, of course, we haven't heard much about it yetin today's discussion, but is the fact that on 19th of December, the United States Central Command killed the most recently known leader of ISIS, Abu Yusif, in Syria.

And that may be why we have seen such a spike, such an increase in the number of incidents that emergency services are having to report to. And just over New Year's Eve, I mean, we've seen a staggering number of quite disturbing incidents, including one apartment building, a firework setting alight at a balcony on one floor and then extending that fire to the second floor of the apartment building, as you mentioned. We've seen at least five people killed and countless people injured as well. There has been reports of pretty serious injuries, including amongst children. One of the reports from officials says two-year-old, 11-year-old and 14-year-old children were seriously injured with burns to their hands, necks and faces.
