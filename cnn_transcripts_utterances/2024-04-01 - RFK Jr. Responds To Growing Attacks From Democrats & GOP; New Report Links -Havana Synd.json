      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is here with me in studio live as his campaign says he now has enough signatures to appear on the ballot in North Carolina, another battleground state that as both Biden and Trump nervous tonight. Plus, another suspected case of the mysterious brain injury known as Havana syndrome. I'm going to speak to investigative journalists, Christo Grozev. He singles out a specific Russian intelligence unit as the possible culprit. Also OUTFRONT, a retired us official based in Havana who is widely considered to be patient zero. And, Trump's net worth plunging today by a billion dollars on paper. Why? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, don't call him a spoiler. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. saying he is in the race to win it in November as he reaches yet another milestone tonight. His campaign says Kennedy now how has enough signatures to get on the ballot in North Carolina, which is, of course, a crucial battleground state. And in just a moment, I'm going to speak to Kennedy live right here on set. The Democrat-turned independent who has the money, the supporters, and the potential to upend the 2024 presidential election. And as of tonight, he is on the ballot in Utah. However, his campaign and allies claimed they have met the signature threshold to get them on the ballot and a whole slew of additional states, Hawaii, Michigan, Georgia, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Arizona. And of course, I've mentioned North Carolina as well. Now, when I say those names to many of you may say, wow, those are obviously crucial states and they were. They're states that Biden and Trump many cases, one by just a few votes, and that has both campaigns nervous that Kennedy, with his famous family name and his charisma may siphon crucial votes away from them in 2024. And I just give you one example. Look at the state of Arizona. So the 2020 margin of victory there for Joe Biden was just over 10,000 votes so now, just compare it to the latest polling right now from the state of Arizona. And in that polling, Kennedy has the support of 26 percent of registered voters. Biden and Trump are only head by a few points, they're at 33 percent each. So to put that in perspective, as of tonight, they're 4 million registered voters in Arizona, making the bottom line clear, that particular poll well indicates the Kennedy right now has the support of 1 million registered voters in the state of Arizona. Now, with those kinds of numbers, Kennedy can do a lot of damage, which is why both campaigns, Trump and Biden, are very concerned. Trump posting online, RFK Jr. is the most radical left candidate in the race by far trying of course, to tie him to the left and siphon votes from Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats posted this ad on billboards around a Kennedy campaign rally and you can see it reads: RFK Jr. powered by MAGA/Trump. Well, all the while, Kennedy continues to say that he's not going to spoil the race for Biden or Trump. He insist that he's going to win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (I), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm way ahead of an independent candidate in history right now, and I intend to win the election. I think I can win the White House. I think we have a very good chance of winning in November. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

KENNEDY JR.: Well, right now, I don't know what I'm going to do -- who I pull more from in November. Right now, I'm pulling pretty much equally, probably a little more from President Trump.

Democrats say, if Donald Trump gets in, it's going to be the end of democracy. And I don't think either of them are actually going to destroy democracy. There's -- we have institutions in this country that are pretty enduring. And if you look at both those candidates, they're very different in their temperament. They're very different in their ideology, their -- and in their rhetoric. But on the issues where they actually depart from each other, it's a very narrow band of issues. And it's the culture war issues, like abortion, guns, the border. And they're all important issues, but they're not existential issues. On the existential issues, neither of them has the capacity to address them, the biggest one being the debt. We now have $34 trillion in debt. The service on that debt is more than the -- our military spending. So, and within five years, 50 cents out of every dollar collected in taxes are going to go to servicing the debt.",

The chronic disease epidemic, when my uncle was president, 6 percent of Americans had chronic disease. Today, 60 percent do. It's the biggest issue we have, $4.3 trillion that we're spending on that. And it's four times, almost five times our military budget. And it's getting worse and worse. You have never heard President Trump talk about it, never heard President Biden. The polarization in our country, again existential, all of these issues, A.I., and neither of them has the capacity to deal with these. And all of those issues are created by a system of corporate capture, this corrupt merger between state and corporate power that has absolutely subverted and undermined our democracy. And neither President Trump nor President Biden has the capacity to address it, because they're part of that system. They're both being financed by BlackRock and State Street and Vanguard, the military contractors, the pharmaceutical industries, and that system just spits out bad policies and the illusion that, if you differ on culture war issues, it means you're radically different. But the real issues -- things that we need to do to save our country, they can't do them. And if you vote for President Trump or President Biden, they both had their chance.

She's a very, very, uber successful businesswoman. She has encyclopedic knowledge of A.I. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of the chronic disease epidemic and how to stop it. She is young and she's a mother. And I wanted -- in my candidate, I wanted three things, one, somebody who was not an insider, some -- because it was the insiders who created this problem. They created the debt crisis. They created the addiction to war. They created the chronic disease epidemic. And they created the polarization. I wanted somebody outside who was thinking outside of the box. I wanted -- our campaign is for young people.

We even in Havana, and I remember visiting that embassy there, the U.S. embassy is a real fortress like place, right? But then there were officials who experienced these horrible attacks. That's how it became known as Havana syndrome.And there were always suspicions that it was tied to Russia. And yet it was never proven. And now the U.S. government doubles down on its conclusion. They say that it is not likely an adversary behind the attacks, which is an odd just use of words because obviously something adversarial is accusing is occurring, right? But they're saying not an adversary and not a state actor. What's your response to that?",
