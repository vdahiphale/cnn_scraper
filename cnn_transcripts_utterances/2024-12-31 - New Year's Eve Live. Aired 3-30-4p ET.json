And I say close because we're going to be packed in here like sardines. Now, this is my first time doing Times Square New Year's Eve. And I quickly learned that you need to be prepared. So, I did some investigative reporting and came up with the New Year's Eve Times Square survival kit. First thing is snacks. You need snacks and lots of snacks. Big boy. It's a long night. People have been lining up since 5 a.m. And you need hand warmers. So, I've been told it can get chilly. It might even rain tonight. We shall see. And a water bottle. You need to stay hydrated. Unfortunately, no alcohol allowed in Times Square. I learned that. That was a little rough to hear. But you saved the water bottle. And here's why. Because you cannot go to the bathroom once you're in. Now, not everyone has the skill set to be able to go in a water bottle, if you know what I'm saying. So, I was like today years old when I learned you also need to have a diaper in your survival kit. So, yes, I went and bought some diapers. And now I know why my 4-year- old is always yelling at me, Daddy, daddy, get this diaper off me. These things are itchy. Like, I feel like people think I'm dancing. I'm like, no, I'm just trying to get my diaper right. Now, listen. People are about to come in. And if you can see, you can see the hordes of people. They're getting ready to descend upon Times Square for a party like no other. One of the greatest cultural celebrations in the world as we welcome in the new year. Right here from New York in Times Square. I'll be here. I don't have a cozy, warm, heated blanket and a tea maker like Boris. But I'm going to do all right, baby.

That's a light little snack to start the party. You can add a crab. You can add whatever you like. This is just basically cod, potatoes, on a beautiful toasted piece of bread. And it's so delicious. I want to do a quick nacho, right? So we got some really nice tuna, or your favorite seafood, right? Could be salmon, could be crab. I'm just going to put in a little bit of chives and avocado. That is going to be that perfect party food. Just like that, tuna, avocado. Squeeze in that lime juice. I'm going to add some more chives in there. Sesame seeds. Don't hold back on the tuna. Just like that, right? I'm just going to build it. And this should just eat so light and be a crunchy bite at the party, right? Don't stress out. Make the food delicious and light, easy to prep, fun to eat. You're going to hear that crack, right? Like, boom, it has to be crispy. Mmm. So don't over prep. Everything doesn't have to take a long time. The party you're at does not have to be the biggest. You just have to be with the most important people in your life. And it has to be done with good food. Otherwise, it's not a good New Year's Eve. From all of us at Metropolis America, we wish you (SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE).",

I'm Boris Sanchez coming to you live from Paris.My good friend and colleague, Laura Coates, is in London, and Laura, I am ready for some more fireworks. This hour, Doha is set to deliver, Qatar always putting on an extraordinary display. The glow from its fireworks, its drones, its light show, bathing that capital city skyline with color. And just south of the equator, one of Africa's biggest cities, Nairobi in Kenya, is going to deliver the New Year in just a few minutes. We want to take you straight though to Becky Anderson, because we are awaiting an impressive celebration, including lasers, fireworks, and that drone show in Doha.",

So what you've had over the last hour or so is some remarkable displays here at Expo City where I am in Dubai, down the road, at the tallest building in the road, the Burj Khalifa. I saw you admiring what was going on down there, and then down in Abu Dhabi where they've been breaking all sorts of world records today at 55 minutes, as I understand it.The longest fireworks display in the world. That is a Guinness World Record. So thousands of fireworks, thousands of fireworks, tons of fireworks going off here in the UAE. They've had drones and they've had laser shows. It's been remarkable. Now we are less than four minutes to go to Dateline Doha. Now remember, Doha really came of age in 2022 with the Qatar World Cup, and Lusail is one of the areas that people in Qatar will be able to see the fireworks tonight. Lusail is a remarkable area, a new area in Doha, really built for the Qatar World Cup. Two years on, that will be packed tonight, as will downtown Doha and along the Corniche. So expect an amazing display. Let me give you just some of the facts, Boris and Laura. There are over 10,000 fireworks going off, more than 100 sea pontoons engaged for what will be a spectacle, which will mean that Doha is in play. The fireworks have closed out here, people beginning to contemplate what 2025 looks like for them here in the UAE. But it's about to kick off Dateline Doha, and of course after that, quite frankly, it's over to you guys in Europe. You're going to have to pick up and match what you have seen out of this part of the Gulf in the wider Middle East tonight. I don't know how you're going to do that. I know you're not feeling very well, Boris, I know you didn't get your chocolate, Laura did.",

He was an engineer from Egypt, came over here, took himself off to Texas at some point back in the early 2010s, learned how to barbecue, brought it back here and fused it, fused it with Arabic culture. You would love that. It was wonderful. You asked me how it was. I told you it's all over my white suit.

Nothing. But I'm telling you, this has been so impressive.I don't know about you. You may have barbecue there. You may have French food over there, but what they're going to have soon, as you know, Boris, is a taste of us dancing and that's going to be very fulfilling. OK, we're all very fulfilling.",
