It's almost like he sees himself as Ezekiel, beset on all sides by the tyranny of evil men. But here's the thing about those enemies. They're about as real as the Samuel L. Jackson character, Jules Winfield, meaning not at all. On the other hand, these biblical-sounding promises of great revenge against their invisible enemies, well, there's a lot to suggest that they could be taken seriously. Trump, just hours ago, ranted about his trial where 12 jurors made him a convicted felon. He called it rigged. And then he made what you can only interpret as a threat to the courts that will decide the validity of his conviction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have to straighten out what's going on in these courts. We got a rigged deal going, this whole country, and we've got to do it, and those appellate courts have to step up and straighten things out, or we're not going to have a country any longer. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP: Now, Trump and his disciples, they all have the same complaint, basically, that the system is somehow stacked against them, and that they all have the same cure for that, tearing down the system all together. Take Steve Bannon, for example, the former Trump fixer who was just ordered to report to jail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
