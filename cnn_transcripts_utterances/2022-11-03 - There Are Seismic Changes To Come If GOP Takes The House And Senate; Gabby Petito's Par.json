Her parents have filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against the Moab City Police Department today, alleging that its officers were negligent in those interactions that you have seen on the police bodycam video, basically. Those are the ones with Gabby and her fiance two weeks before her death last summer.So, the lawsuit accuses the police department and its officers of failing to follow the law and failing to protect Gabby Petito during that investigation into a domestic disturbance in August. That was just weeks before Brian Laundrie killed her. So, here with me now with all these latest developments, John Miller, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. We also have CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers. And back with us is Molly Jong-Fast. So, this -- John, what do you see here in this lawsuit because we've all seen that video she is, you know, sort of sequestered over in this area, being interviewed by police. Brian Laundrie is over here, and she is crying and upset, and then they leave.",

You have to put negligence on the part of the police, as John was just discussing.And then you have to prove causation, that this was not the biggest factor in her death but a factor in her death, the fact that two weeks beforehand, they did not separate them or do something that would have stop them from getting back together, stop those events from moving forward, and stop her death. That is very, very hard to do. So, we will see what comes out in discovery. But I think with the examinations that have come out to date, we know most of what there is to know here.
