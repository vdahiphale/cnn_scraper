He is being held without bail and police are still investigating if they are going to charge this as a hate crime.There is some good news to report this morning. Sources tell CNN one of the three men has been released from the hospital. He has not been identified, however, due to concerns for his safety. I am joined now by Elizabeth Price.

But last I knew he was still in ICU, immobilized to try and get theswelling down on his back, making sure that he's been getting medication to make sure his spinal fluids and blood is at a good enough level to keep it, you know, healing. His clavicle is broken and he has a fractured thumb due to the bullet embedded in his back. He has a hard time regulating his body temperature. So, they are managing that with either keeping him warm or packing him with ice bags. And in total, I guess some diagnosis is that he has an incomplete spinal injury, which means that he can feel his legs but currently can't move them.",

Again, I do not know that for a fact. But since his office has already ruled that C.J. did not have adequate representation and since C.J. has already done 12 years in prison for a crime that I do not believe he could have committed, a crime that nobody was seriously injured in, much less killed, I think that ultimately C.J. will be a free man.

And C.J. was shot in 2011. And a few weeks after he was shot, C.J. was accused of participating in a shooting, but my dad said he couldn't have done that shooting. He couldn't have walked up to this family and then run away because he could barely walk. But, you know, the justice system, quote/unquote justice system inthis country is what it is. And based on a photo lineup of very questionable circumstances, one witness said that C.J. did the shooting. And based on that one witness, C.J. was convicted and sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, even though his co-defendant was completely acquitted. And my dad asked me to take a look at this after years and years of trying to get C.J.'s conviction overturned based on the fact that he didn't think that it was fair, and that he didn't think his medical testimony was adequately respected during the trial and that he didn't think C.J.'s lawyer was very good, a woman who has since passed away. I took a look at it and realized that he had actually inadequate representation. The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees you counsel. And he really did not have adequate counsel. And so I went to my friend Jeff Goldberg, who is the editor of 'The Atlantic,\" and I said, I would like to write about this. And Jeff, to his great credit, assigned me another researcher, reporter to help me write this story. And we wrote this piece. And Jeff put it on the cover of \"The Atlantic,\" October 2022. And hopefully that got a conversation going. In the meantime, my dad, I think, although he won't confirm it, hired an attorney named Carl Schwartz, and he filed this habeas petition based on the same argument that C.J. did not have adequate representation. And the district attorney's office in September agreed. And then one judge in October agreed. And then the second judge yesterday also agreed. So C.J.'s conviction has been overturned. And now we're just waiting for the system to move forward and let C.J. out for this great injustice. And I would just like to -- I know I'm rambling, but I would just like to point out, we know that jails, prisons, are full of kids like this. Full of lower income, especially people of color, and that C.J. just happened to have been lucky to have had a pediatrician with a son who's a journalist. And it sucks. This is the system we have.",
