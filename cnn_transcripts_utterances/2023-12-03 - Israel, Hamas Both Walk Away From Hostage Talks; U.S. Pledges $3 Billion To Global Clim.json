Aaron Deloney hitting an uncontested layup with six-tenths of a second left. But then on the ensuing inbound play here, look at this. Yale committing an offensive foul. Vermont gets the ball back. TJ Long absolutely making Yale pay. Draining the three-pointer to tie it and he gets the foul and he makes the free throw and somehow Vermont pulls off this insane comeback win, 66 to 65, the final. There is a lot going on right now. We're gone know more about the college playoff and where that stands later on this afternoon, but a fun morning for you guys for sure. Back to you.",

Yesterday, it appeared that many of them were focused in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, which Israel has said is no longer under Hamas's control.But there was on social media, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli media told people in areas to the east and north of Gaza City to leave their homes immediately. But what we saw was, in those areas, there were multiple strikes, one of them hitting a six-story building, which, according to people in the area, had more than 100 people who had fled from other areas. And the local hospital reported that dozens were killed in that instance. Dozens were killed in another strike in the Shujaiya district, which is east of Gaza City. Now, we don't have a clear idea of how many people have been killed in Gaza within the last 24 hours. But I think it's fair to say hundreds is probably safe. Now, we understand that according to the Israelis, they were able to kill one of the Hamas commanders who helped plan the 7 October attacks on Israel. The Israelis are also saying that they have until now managed to locate 800 Hamas tunnels and destroyed 500 of them. Now today also the Israelis are announcing that two of their soldiers in Gaza have been killed. And as far as the humanitarian situation goes, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, 100 trucks were able to pass from Egypt into Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Those trucks contain food, medicine, and body bags. A spokesman for the U.N. agency that looks after the -- after Palestinian refugees said that however, the amount of aid getting into Gaza is, in his words, a drop in the ocean, they are increasingly concerned about the spread of disease, given that especially in the south of Gaza, it is so crowded and the sanitary conditions are deteriorating.

And in that way, he was against democracy. And just a reminder here that former President Trump is currently facing charges for his efforts to try and overturn the 2020 election. But just when it comes to the Iowa caucuses, in general, we should note that he remains a clear favorite. His polling numbers are extremely high, and it was really fascinating being in the room during his speech earlier before he started talking. We heard someone one of the intro speakers asking how many people in the room had never caucus before, and it seemed about half raised their hand.

And as was noted, a lot of these people are new to the process still even after his run in previous years.So it's the campaign's job now to make sure that those people know how to caucus. It's different than a normal primary election. You have to be in the room at the exact right time. And a lot of people still don't know that when they come to these events, and so that's the campaign's job is to inform these supporters so that they know that on January 15th, they know where to go and where to be to express their support for former President Trump. As far as Governor DeSantis, it's a simple task of trying to create some momentum. There is still time. Iowans are notoriously late breakers, late deciders in caucuses. So even though we're getting down to the wire, we're counting weeks now instead of months, there is still time for someone like Governor DeSantis or perhaps Ambassador Haley to make a charge. And so that's what they need to do, is to coalesce basically that for lack of a better term, anyone but Trump lane and start to mount a serious challenge to former President Trump in the polls.

They want to see them multiple times really.

It's helped Iowa Caucus winners in the past, like Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. We're in a slightly different era of politics now with former President Trump. He did not do that eight years ago, and he still finished a strong second here. And obviously went on to earn the nomination. So, Governor DeSantis is kind of putting that strategy to a test. Is it still valuable? We haven't seen, like I just said, we haven't seen that rise in the polls yet. But if he continues to do this, then maybe he does start to coalesce that group of late deciding people.

And then at the -- for the top polling candidates, it sort of gives, you know, information to those next steps. You know, Iowans will ultimately decide on a few candidates. And the old phrase is there's three tickets out of Iowa. I don't know if that's necessarily true this year. I think it may be true. But the meaning behind that is that Iowans vote and then the next states look at that and say, OK, here's who finished at the top in Iowa. Maybe I should give that candidate a look. And it's a springboard. It's not the decider, but it's a springboard into the next early states and so that's why Donald Trump has to make sure he locks down that support and why either Rick -- Governor DeSantis or Ambassador Haley needs to improve those numbers to show those next few states that they are a viable challenger to former President Trump.",

So here's a look at the live radar. You can see a lot of that moisture really starting to surge back across portions of extreme northern California, Oregon, as well as Washington.But also the snow from yesterday and the day before is now starting to spread eastward. So you've also got some winter weather alerts that stretch a little bit farther off to the east. Here's a look at going forward, and I want to emphasize this is multiple systems here. So this is going to be a new one practically every day. You've got this next one starting to arrive early into the morning, that's going to begin to spread out as we head into Sunday afternoon and Sunday evening, bringing some more snow to areas of the Intermountain West. Then by Monday, we get the next system that begins to push into the Pacific Northwest, that being more of a focus for Washington, whereas today is really more of a focus for Oregon. By Monday night, that wave continues to slide back in. And yet another wave begins to push in as we go into Tuesday. That begins to spread farther into the east as we head into Wednesday. So again, back to back rounds here, essentially of atmospheric river events. Now, when we talk about atmospheric rivers, not all of these are bad. Level ones and level twos, those are mostly beneficial rains that these states need to kind of fill up that water table. But once you start getting to level fours and fives and we have a level four from much of Oregon here, now it becomes more hazardous than it is beneficial. And that's mainly because of how much moisture you're putting into these areas. You're talking widespread along the coastlines of Washington, Oregon, and even northwestern California. 4 to 7 inches of rain when you move inland, especially into the higher elevations. Now you're talking a lot of this snow being measured in feet. 1 to 3 feet, not just for the Olympics and the Cascades, but also going into money of -- most of the Rockies as well. Winds have also been a big factor too. Take a look at some of these. Trout Creek topping out at 61 miles per hour. Tacoma 54, the Seattle airport at 52. And again, more of these winds are going to kick up later today and even as we go into Monday and Tuesday of the upcoming week. So it's not just winds, but also rain.

And also, what is their level of concern about the viruses? We see when we look at parents and what they're expecting to do, the highest number, more than 70 percent really plan to get the RSV vaccination. Next, at about 60 percent we see the flu vaccination, and at 40 percent lagging is the COVID vaccination. And what that shows is, what is their level of concern? The highest level of concern for parents is RSV this season, followed by flu, followed by COVID. And you know what else is interesting?",

I think this year we're really beyond that ground zero that catch up and we'll see a normal flu season, maybe slightly a greater uptick as we see this confluence of RSV, Flu and COVID . And don't forget, pneumonias and things are caused by other things like Michael plasma streptococcus. We always have to mix that in as well as we get all of our exposures back to normal.
