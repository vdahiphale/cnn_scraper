On day two, a sharp warning to the former President, from the judge, don't even think about intimidating potential jurors, after the judge saw Trump muttering and gesturing, in close proximity, to a potential juror. And what is it like to be in that jury pool, with the former President turned defendant, watching your every move, as you are being considered to decide his fate. My source, tonight, will tell us all about it. I'm Sara Sidner, in for Kaitlan Collins tonight. And this is THE SOURCE. An immigrant from Ireland; an oncology nurse; a corporate lawyer; a grandfather from Puerto Rico; a young English teacher; a recent college grad; and a civil litigator. Seven strangers, who have at least two things now in common. They all live in the New York City borough of Manhattan, and they're all seated on the jury that will decide if Donald Trump should be a convicted felon. That's more than half of the jurors they need for a jury of 12, plus about six alternates. They are yet to be chosen. And make no mistake. This judge is wasting no time moving things along. Yet another thing that has Donald Trump really unhappy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to continue our fight against this judge. We think he's totally conflicted. We're having a hard time with the New York State system. It's under watch by the whole world. And it's not looking very good. So, we think we have a very conflicted, highly conflicted judge. He shouldn't be on the case. And he's rushing this trial. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Another questioned intensely, about a video she posted, after the 2020 election was called for Joe Biden. That elicited a response from Trump, who apparently muttered something about it, and visibly reacted gesturing. That earned him an admonishment from the judge, who told Trump's lawyer that he won't have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom. Now, inside court, the former President was said to be watching the potential jurors very intently, sizing up the jury pool. And after court today, this is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I just have to thank Kara McGee again, for coming in, and sort of explaining what that was like, because she said it was scary, it was nerve-wracking. But she wanted to be on the jury. It just didn't work out for her life. Temidayo, I want to start with you. There are seven people that are on this jury. Many legal analysts said this is going to take weeks, to get this jury. The judge is now saying he believes that potentially Monday, they'll have the entire jury seated. What does this pace tell you? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JAN. 6 COMMITTEE: I think it tells you that Judge Merchan is fully in control of his courtroom. And that's what we've seen. He has moved this process along efficiently. And I think it bodes well that this entire trial is going to be run quite well by the judge. We saw today that the time when the former President, at one point, started speaking and gesturing. And, the judge did what any judge does, which is to reprimand a defendant, saying you cannot do that. So, I think if he continues with what he's -- we've seen thus far, this is going to be a quick case. And he's not going to allow either the government or the defense or the former President to really run this off the train tracks. So, I think it's a good sign.",

So, I really do hope that Judge Merchan does whatever he needs to do, to try to make sure that these people stay anonymous. But it's an interesting jury. It's a heavily professional jury. So that so far is very interesting. Usually, you see a lot more kind of lower-level government employees. So, I'm interested in that aspect of it.

They've each already used six.Temidayo, what do you think? Is there a clearer picture of who is getting the better jury? Or does this seem like this could go either way, so far? AGANGA-WILLIAMS: I think it's never clear. This is always picking an art. And everyone who has ever picked a jury, if you get the result, the verdict you want, then all of a sudden, you look back and say, I really know how to pick a jury. And if it goes the other way, then it's a jury's fault. So, I think it's really hard to tell at this point. But I do think it's interesting with the professional jury here, because it's a somewhat of a technical case, right? This is not a case, where we simply say, did they commit a murder? Did they rob the bank? Yes or no? It's a case where you're talking about documents, where you're talking about, you prove a business fraud, and then you reference a separate crime.

And Blanche pressed one juror on a post, calling Trump's travel ban, unlawful, which prompted this reaction from Judge Merchan. He said, \"If it ended there, I wouldn't really have a problem with it... then [the post] continues\" saying, \"'get him out' and 'lock him up.'\" And Merchan struck the juror for cause, but not before saying that everyone knows Trump could potentially be locked up, if he's convicted in this case. This is his first criminal trial. What do you make of how the judge sort of dealt with that particular case? And is it a signal to everybody else about what could happen to them? AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Well, I think, one, I think he was fair. I mean, I think what we saw in both with what Jen mentioned is that he's not looking to strike jurors, just for having opinions.

And despite Trump's claims to the contrary, bringing this charge as a felony, actually happens a lot in New York. Records show felony charges of falsifying business records were brought more than 9,000 times, in New York, between 2015 and when Donald Trump was indicted. As for the paper trail, on that scheme, there's a treasure trove of texts and phone records, showing Cohen working directly with the campaign, to keep an eye out for the stories, including text to Hope Hicks, where they discussed how the McDougal story was, quote, \"Getting little\" traction, and that quote, \"It's working.\" We even know that Trump was on those phone calls. Now, Donald Trump denies all of this. But in the end, all that effort, eight years ago, to keep those stories from coming out, just before an election, all but ensures you, the voter, will be seeing wall-to-wall coverage of every salacious detail, just as Donald Trump asks you to send him back to the White House. Here with me now. Ashley Allison, CNN Political Commentator, and former White House Senior Policy Adviser, under President Obama; as well as CNN's Senior Political Commentator, Ana Navarro. Thank you, ladies, for being here. Allison, I want to start first, talking about the voters. The latest New York Times poll looked at where women are in this. And women were twice as likely as men to see the charges in this case as very serious, which mirrors what we saw, in 2018, when all this start to come out, when these stories were all over the place. His approval rating with women, if you take a look at this, were 20 points lower than with men. So, as we're getting this sort of daily input and deluge of the salacious details, of alleged sexual encounters, and cheating, and cover-up, do you think women are going to respond to this, at the polls, this time? Or is this something that like we've already heard, we already have made up our minds, this is old hat?",

But they actually didn't hear everything, in 2016, when they went to the polls. And so now, what is happening to Donald Trump is exactly what this case is alleging he tried to prevent, women being fully informed about his behavior, where he had an affair with his wife, and another woman. And women are thinking, what type of man is this? Is this the type of person with the character I want to be in the White House?

Many of those people were also convicted for other crimes as well. So, it won't simply result in the vacating their convictions entirely. Some folks, that you mentioned, have already been sentenced on convictions, for these counts. So, it's very complicated. It's hard to say from this perspective, exactly how that will play out.

So would effect -- it wouldn't throw the statute out entirely. But it would prohibit its use for people, who simply entered the Capitol, on January 6th, and didn't engage in other criminal activity.
