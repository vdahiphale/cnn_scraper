Whilst the document is critical of gender theory, it does include a strong condemnation of the criminalization of homosexuality in certain countries around the world, something that Pope Francis spoke about in 2023 ahead of a trip to Africa. Cardinal Fernandez presenting the document said he was shocked that some Catholics were supportive of these laws criminalizing homosexuality. The document appears to be a balancing of both Pope Francis' desire to maintain Catholic teaching and doctrine, but also his pastoral welcome to same-sex Catholics and LGBTQ plus believers. This document comes in the months after the Vatican issued a groundbreaking text offering blessings to same-sex couples, something that sent shockwaves through the church, and allowing for trans- Catholics to act as godparents at baptisms. So with this document, we see a reaffirmation of Catholic teaching and doctrine, but at the same time a desire to apply that in a pastoral and compassionate way. Christopher Lamb, CNN.

These are really the first cases to be heard on a regional level by the European Court of Human Rights. We've had national decisions on these types of cases before. One is from the Swiss senior women. They've already had their case thrown out in Switzerland. They are suing the Swiss government essentially, accusing them of violating their human rights because they say that as older women, they are more vulnerable. You see them there to the effect of things like heat waves. Then we have a case brought by the former mayor of a French flood- prone town saying his rights are being violated because government alleged inaction, he says, threatens his home. And then we have the biggest and most ambitious case which has been brought by six young Portuguese people ranging in age from sort of early 20s down to 11 saying that they, as young people, are being disproportionately discriminated against and their rights being violated because the planet, thanks to alleged government inaction, is becoming increasingly unlivable, and they are suing 32 different governments. So this is a massive case and one that tests not only the idea of linking human rights to climate change, but the sort of -- the idea of where the jurisdiction lies, right? Do countries have a responsibility to protect the rights of people outside their national borders? So this is why we see this being heard today by the European Court of Human Rights. It's already a big deal that it made it there. It's being heard by the highest bench there, the ground chamber. So we await to hear the verdict, but it could set a significant legal precedent.",
