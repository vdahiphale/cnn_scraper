Coming upthis hour, Ukraine's Army Commander in Chief says it's time to rethink its war strategy in an exclusive op-ed for CNN. A truck explosion in Nairobi kills three and puts hundreds in hospital. We're live at the scene. And for the first time in the United States, the mother of a school shooter is on trial for involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors are cross examining Jennifer Crumbley today. In an exclusive op-ed for CNN Ukraine's embattled Army Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi is calling for a wholesale redesign of battlefield operations if it's to win its war against Russia. He writes that Ukraine must focus more strongly on technology. And he writes, we must contend with a reduction in military support from key allies grappling with their own political tensions this perhaps an indirect reference the failure of the U.S. to agree on a new military aid package for Ukraine. The general's article made no reference to his rocky relationship with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Nor to reports from sources that Mr. Zelenskyy is about to fire him after four years on the job. Let's bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Kyiv. Fred, just take us through what he says in this report and why he's putting out in this way.",

His op-ed is an exclusive for CNN. We are following a developing story out of Nairobi, Kenya too about a gas explosion that's left at these three people dead and 280 others injured. The Deputy Police Commander or Deputy Police Inspector General rather says the incident happened on Thursday by a truck. And according to a Kenyan government spokesman, a huge ball of fire was caused by a gas that the truck was carrying. Although it wasn't immediately clear what kind it was carrying, it apparently exploded at a cookery gas plant around 11 pm Nairobi time.

Butit's a dramatic one because the government, the regulator in charge of this industry says the construction permit for this place. They applied three times and were denied three times in March in June, and in July of last year. But somehow it still continued to be here, operating in an area which is densely populated. These are homes all around here. And so when that explosion happened last night, there are people who were wounded and injured all around here because this should not be happening here in the first place. But that's just one aspect of it. The petroleum industry of East Africa, which represents other dealers of similar places, says this space will demolish at least twice before because it's unlicensed, it's illegal. It should not be here, but it was here anyway. In fact in 2020 there was a criminal case against the owner of this place. He should have gone to jail for five years. But somehow, despite the law, he only went to jail for a year. And he was allowed to keep some of the tankers. One of the tankers is those that exploded here last night. But look at this. There's a work permit and risk assessment board here. So this supposed to look official, but obviously it didn't work last night. There's even a fire assembly point here. And it says that in Swahili, you have to make sure that when you come in here, don't bring anything incendiary like a matchstick, and make sure you leave your phone by the security there. And make sure you're wearing PPE, all the rules that were not followed, which led to this tragedy. So many people injured and at least three people dead. Listen to this one survivor.

We spoke to one of theneighbors who say for a few days before the explosion, they could smell gas in the air. And that could explain why the blast radius went so far. The reason why the construction permit was rejected is because for safety reasons. They're supposed to be some calculations about how far a blast can go. And they're supposed to calculate that and present it to the regulators and the regulators rejected because there's just too close. That's why for instance, last night during the explosion, there's a car that came from here, flew several 100 yards away and landed on the rooftop of a sixth floor building on the other side parts of the car strewn all around here. So when the full accounting is done, there'll be a lot of answering for the regulators that allowed this to happen and for the administrators that didn't do anything to stop it and maybe save the lives that could have been saved here, Max.",

The latest CNN polling shows in a hypothetical general electionmatchup, Former President Donald Trump leads President Joe Biden 49 percent to 45 percent. That lead for Trump is slightly outside the poll's margin of error. But a poll taken by Quinnipiac University showed President Biden with a six percentage point lead over Trump, more than double the margin of error. The new CNN poll also has revealing numbers on how Americans view President Biden's response to the Israel Hamas war. Less than 40 percent of respondents think U.S. assistance to Israel, in the nearly four month old war is right where it should be. That's roughly matching the proportion of people who approve of how Mr. Biden is handling the war. But if you look closely, the percentage of young people who fall into that camp is much less.
