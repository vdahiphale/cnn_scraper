U.S. President Joe Biden is taking his message on the road today after delivering a very fiery, very forceful and starkly political speech during his State of the Union address on Thursday night. In the next hour or so, he's set to depart for Pennsylvania. That is, by the way, a crucial swing state that really could determine whether or not he wins reelection in November. And on Saturday, he's going to be visiting the battleground state of Georgia. Vice President Kamala Harris is also hitting the campaign trail, as well. She's actually leaving for Arizona today. That is another pivotal state that could play an outsized role in determining the control of the White House. The trips by the President and the Vice President are taking place just hours after what we got this morning, a solid jobs report that was released a few hours ago, providing yet another indicator of how strong the U.S. economy is right now. And something else the President may indeed be happy about, how his speech last night is being perceived by a lot of people. Mr. Biden covered a wide range of topic topics rather. And he tackled the questions about his age head on. I want you to listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The percentage of men and women living on the planet is roughly equal, but that's just in numbers only. While women and girls are not a statistical minority, they of course do not share the same power, the same privileges, rights and opportunities as the other half of the population, with gender inequality a real problem worldwide. That can actually vary significantly based solely on geography, and in some regions, being female can cost you your life. A new United Nations report shows the female genital mutilations has actually increased globally by 15 percent in the past eight years, a practice described by the U.N. as inhumane, degrading, barbaric, and at times, of course, deadly. But even in highly industrialized developed nations, the hard-fought rights of women and girls are slowly eroding.

You have Ireland taking proactive measures to modernize its constitution around a vision that is consistent with women's equality right now. And so, we're watching, you know, country after country move forward and yet we look here in the United States and we see a state like Alabama moving backwards on IVF. We see states like Texas and Idaho suing the federal government to not provide so they don't have to provide emergency abortion care when patients are in danger. So, the reality is quite stark, but I think it continues to be a reminder that all of the rights and the fights that we have seen overseas are rights that have come through movement, right? Rights that have been hard fought by communities coming together, organizing, and continuing to demonstrate to their elected what they want and what they need to live free and equal lives. And I think it is no different than the work that we need to continue to do here and remind people that these rights are never settled, that we will have to continue to litigate and relitigate these for every single generation so we don't go back in the way that we have in the last two years.",

The toughest race to call right now may actually be Best Actress. We have the awards pundits say it's simply too close to call between Lily Gladstone from \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and Emma Stone for \"Poor Things\". And as for the biggest hit of the year, \"Barbie\", its best chances for an Oscar win are probably in the Best Song or Best Costume categories after snubs for Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie. Joining us live now to dive deeper into this weekend's award show is entertainment journalist Michael Musto of the Village Voice. Michael, thank you so much for being with us. Let's talk about Oppenheimer. When you think about Christopher Nolan's greatest hits, \"Inception\", \"Interstellar\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"Memento\", I mean, this really is his time, right, this weekend? MICHAEL MUSTO, ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST, \"VILLAGE VOICE\": Yes, absolutely. He's had nominations before he has never won. This is a huge commercial hit. And some people actually found it as a double bill with Barbie. They called it Barbenheimer.",

      "sentences": "It's a very good category. My personal choice is Annette Bening, who has never won, and she was brilliant as Swimmer Diana Nyad in \"Nyad\", butshe's like always the bridesmaid, like Glenn Close. She's not getting it over with. Sandra Uhler, a very respected German actress, is also brilliant in \"Anatomy of a Fall\", a courtroom drama. But, as you say, the choices between Emma Stone, who's won before, she won for \"La La Land\". She's terrific in \"Poor Things\". She plays a kind of Bride of Frankenstein slash Eliza Doolittle. She's reanimated by a mad scientist, and she has no idea how to behave in society. But then you have Lily Gladstone, who I'm predicting. She's the star of Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\", and she plays a -- Osage County Indian, sorry, Native American, who is married to Leonardo DiCaprio's character, who's kind of bumping off her relatives for money. It's based on real occurrences. Lily, if she wins, would be the first indigenous actor to win a competitive Oscar. And that's one of the reasons I think she's going for it.",

You've also got the fact that we know, I think it's fair to say that we know, we know that \"Oppenheimer\" is probably going to win Best Picture. And so, when you have an award ceremony where there aren't as many surprises, how do you still make -- this is for the producers of the show. How do you still make it enticing for the audience?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, there'll be the five best nominated songs, which include two songs from Barbie. Ryan Gosling is going to do his Ken number,and Billie Eilish is going to do her number. I think she's going to win. That's her second Oscar, believe it or not. She's in her 20s. I'm very jealous. But in addition to that, it's all about the spontaneity and the speeches and not just people pulling out a piece of paper from their cleavage and reading a list of names, but that moment of real triumph and joy, and also generosity, and sometimes political opinions, as well. And that's what's going to sell the Oscars. Plus the fact that even though Oppenheimer is going to sweep so many categories, and that's a lot, by the way, it was seen by a lot of people. It's not like one of those years where nobody saw the winner. Even I'm scratching my head, like, what movie was that? And \"Barbie\", of course, was huge. It really saved the movie industry. And so, even the presence of \"Barbie\" in different categories and with the songs is going to make a difference in the ratings.",

I mean, it's a completely different ballgame. Getting tens of millions of people to sit down and watch the Oscars on network television is not what it used to be. So, you point out there are sort of various -- various, you know, surprises potentially in terms of the way people deliver their speeches. Obviously, you have \"Oppenheimer\" which is a beloved movie. But really, in terms of getting people to watch this year, what is going to be the secret sauce?",

KATIE O'MAILEY, ELLE U.K. SITE DIRECTOR: I think Carey Mulligan has shown the sophisticated chic glamour that you can bring, whether it be an Armani Prive dress or a Dior dress. Emma Stone as well has been a real champion of color. And I think Lily Gladstone and Sandra Hula, as well. They have just shown what it means to be not only excited by being at an awards show, I know Lily Gladstone, it's her first Oscar nomination, but also they're bringing that injection of excitement when it comes with the fashion, as well.
