So that's what they're worried about. And the reason why it's important for the financial piece, Judge, is it's how the money ended up going back to her. She put her boyfriend in the spot, paid him, and then reaped the benefits from it. That she created the system and then didn't tell anybody about it. She didn't even tell her dad about it. So I think, in the grand scheme of things, if you're looking at the totality of the facts -- and I've got to sit down here about two minutes to make room for my co-counsel. If you look at it, everything put together, Judge, is they tried -- they did this. They knew it was wrong. They hid it. And they didn't -- even when they were called out on it, they tried to create an excuse for it by saying it happened after the fact. We know now from the testimony, Ms. Yeartie confirmed that Mr. Bradley, his text messages were accurate, not his testimony. But -- but that fact was accurate. The motion is accurate. And so also, I do want to point out there's no paper trail here for the cash. I know that this was -- I know she -- she and her father both testified -- both testified that they kept cash on hand, which -- I mean, keeping cash on hand in and of itself is not a problem. But when you're a public official and you're required to keep track of gifts that you receive, then you need to keep track of it. But there's no paper trail. There's no deposit history. There's no withdrawal history. There's no receipt. None of that. So even -- even assuming their testimony could be credible -- and we don't think that it is -- you still don't have enough information to keep -- to track all that money that she received. And this is just what would -- (CROSSTALK)",

She met with Wade and they develop, in 10 minutes after talking about the financial piece, I believe, this cash theory that could not be rebutted. We have no ability to do that. They did.

Because you don't have to accept the fact that he wasn't speculating. The cases that I provided, I think by email yesterday, the first dealing with that, you can disbelieve that testimony and draw a negative inference. That's the Ferguson case. On Lee, the other case, you can simply take the prior and consistent statement as substantive evidence. It has the same value. And that's what I'm asking you to do, to take what was the unprompted statement in Defense Exhibit 26 of Bradley. And take that on its face -- face value, that that is an indication that Bradley, in fact, knew and had said he did. If you accept that, you have to have concerns about the truthfulness of Willis and Wade on the timing issue.",

That basically what I'm getting at is, where in the law that we find the remedy to an untruthful statement? Generally, we send you down the street to the bar, right?",

Went through the ethical violations and said, based on that, you are disqualified, you cannot be the attorney of record in this case. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. If defense counsel can be kicked off of a case because of ethical violations, I suggest the same thing can happen for prosecutors. When ethical violations deal with truthfulness, candor to the court, extra judicial statements, those are the things that this court can rely upon and say, based on those, again, I find an appearance of impropriety.",
