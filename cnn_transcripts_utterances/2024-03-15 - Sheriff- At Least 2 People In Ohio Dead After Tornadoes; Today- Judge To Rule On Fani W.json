It obviously attracts a crowd and that it seems is what we had here when this attack took place. As you said, witnesses describe what sounded like tank or artillery fire. Israeli say it wasn't them. But the Hamas-run health ministry says that this was a deliberate attack by Israelis. Now we know that the IDF troops are typically stations near to that roundabout and there was another incident of violence on Wednesday when seven people were killed after the IDF opened fire, they didn't comment on that particular incidents, but they did confirm that they struck separately on Wednesday in aid distribution warehouse run by UNRWA, killing five people. They said they took out a Hamas commander, UNRWA says that, look, this was in violation of international law in the Israelis knew precisely what they were hitting because they had the coordinates in advance as they have with the 150 other UNRWA food warehouses or distribution sites that have been hit since the outset of this war.",

It's called Open Arms.It is normally used for shipping, search and rescue. It is towing a barge carrying some 200 tons of aid. We're talking about the absolute basics, flour, rice, beans, canned goods, lentils, things like that. There has been a barge or excuse me, a jetty constructed using rubble from the destruction in Gaza. Its about 60 yards long or so.

There's not a great deal of excitement amongst the voters about what the outcome will be. It's more of a dutiful, patriotic but the thing that people are doing coming out to register their -- support for their preferred candidate.Again, this is the polling station. You can see a couple of people here that have come to register that they'll be getting them ballot papers and then they can sort of like tick the box. They want and do that either electronically with these machines here or put them into a ballot box over there. Look, the reason it's such an inevitable outcome is because the opposition in Russia has not been permitted to stand in these elections. There's been blanket coverage of Vladimir Putin on state television. And, of course, the really critical that the critics of the Kremlin like Alexei Navalny like people who have been sort of campaigning against Vladimir Putin for many years, well, they've been silenced, jailed, exiled, or of course, in the case of Vladimir Putin sorry, in the case of Alexei Navalny, he died in his arctic penal colony last month. And so that sort of crackdown has really sort of sent a repressive atmosphere across Russia. And so again, as I say, this is Russia going through the motions of a Democratic process, but no one really seriously doubts that Vladimir Putin at the end of it is going to emerge as president for our fifth presidential term, Kasie.",
