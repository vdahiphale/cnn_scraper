The overall death toll from the outbreak of storms has jumped to 21. This evening, in Arkansas, the National Guard, is rolling into devastated communities and there are reports that at least a dozen tornadoes touching down in that state.

First responders describe the scene as chaotic when they arrived. Some people were trapped under the debris. The folks were here for a concert, many came for a good time. Some of the people who were here not only included folks who just wanted to enjoy the event, but members of staff. Back outside this crew has been working to clear the area. There were bricks scattered throughout the street, as well as other debris. If you drive around the neighborhood, and it is a bit challenging to drive, because there are barricades in place like this, but we were able to see trees that have also fallen across the state of Illinois. There were multiple confirmed tornadoes. One woman who stopped by to see what happened after she heard about it, said she was devastated because she had so many memories here at the Apollo Theater.

In just three days, Donald Trump is expected to make some unwelcome history as he voluntarily surrenders to New York authorities after being indicted by the Manhattan district attorney. He'll be the first former or sitting U.S. president to be arraigned on criminal charges. Trump and his allies say the prosecution is nothing but a political move. And now Trump advisers are telling our Kristen Holmes they believe there's no way Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan. Kristen joins me now from outside Trump's state, Mar-a-Lago. Kristen, I suppose this is what they're going to say. You and I both know Donald Trump is not beloved in Manhattan, but I suppose they're going to have to deal with this.

We talked to members of the legal team who say there's just not currently under consideration to ask for a change of venue to a perhaps more Trump friendly area or Trump friendly borough, and that they're not going to be making any decisions until they actually see that indictment, which they're expected to do on Tuesday when Trump is arraigned.But look, this is just another part of this narrative. Another thing that we are hearing that from these Trump advisors, from these Trump allies that this is an unfair case. And as we have reported, Trump himself has been going after the district of attorney in Manhattan linking Alvin Bragg to Democrats saying that he is linked to Joe Biden, talking about where he donated money from. He also went after the judge that he's expected to appear in front of on Tuesday, saying that that Judge specifically hates him. Again, part of a narrative here that that they have begun to spin and we're going to likely hear more about this New York part of it as we continue down this path, as we go through Tuesday. The other thing to remember here is that we're talking about a potential hearing way down the road, right? This is not something that is happening right now. He has to get arraigned first on Tuesday. We actually have to look at those charges. And that's one thing to point out when we kind of continue to give the Trump defense here. We continue to talk about these Republicans who are coming to his defense. They have not actually seen the legal charges. So they are talking about how this is unfair, how this is all political, it's a political hoax, but they haven't actually seen what he's being charged with, Jim.",

Now, of course, there are still questions about what this means in the long-term. There's also questions about what this fundraising looks like, overall.

When you return an indictment in state court where -- and we are in state court here with the Manhattan DA, it automatically goes over to the judge and it remains under seal until the arraignment. That is standard procedure here.Part of that is to protect the interests of both parties, really. The prosecutor doesn't want the charges out there until the person is formally arraigned. The defendant may not want it out there till they're formally arraigned. There are extraordinary circumstances where it can be released early, but it doesn't appear like that's going to happen here. And so this is -- you know, as much as this is a big spectacle, Jim, this is also very much just a case like any other. And in that respect, it's being handled like any other case.",

Normally, a person would be photographed, mug shot at, although mug shots are not supposed to be public in New York State, unless there's some compelling law enforcement interest.So we'll see if they follow through with that. A person ordinarily is fingerprinted. We'll see if they do that. Handcuffs usually are a very brief part of the picture. But I doubt Secret Service will allow Donald Trump to be handcuffed. I bet they sort of negotiate around that. In court, what will happen is a standard arraignment, the indictment will be unsealed. That should be the moment when we in the public see that indictment 2:15 P.M., according to the reporting on Tuesday. The judge will advise Trump here are the -- let's say 34 accounts, according to the reporting against you. The judge will then say to the defendant, do you want me to read them all to you or have you just read this on your own with your lawyer? And defendants almost always waive that. They say, I've read it, it's fine. He'll enter a guilt -- excuse me, he'll enter a plea of not guilty in all likelihood. And then the judge will set bail, in this case, there will be what we call released on own recognizance, meaning, you don't have to post any money, you don't have to wear an ankle bracelet just come back for your next court date. And if you don't do that, then we'll get more severe in the bail conditions. And then it'll be released. And we'll have a schedule. We'll have -- we'll have the table set for pretrial motions, for discovery, which is the exchange of information, prosecutors have to turn over all their evidence and will be on the way to trial.

That will always stand out as one of the things I will not forget from that campaign. But here's Jeb Bush's tweet: \"Bragg's predecessor didn't take up the case.

But, you know, more than that, I think the fact that someone like Jeb Bush is accusing Alvin Bragg of engaging in political persecution just shows you how broken the Republican Party is. I imagine Jeb Bush wants to have some kind of political career in the future and feels like he needs to align himself with the mood of the base of the Republican Party, which, to be sure, does feel like this is some unfair, you know, prosecution. But let's be clear. The base is also going to feel that way if and when Fulton County does what it does, which is likely to be a prosecution. And it's going to feel that way when the Department of Justice, you know, potentially does it - does this in the case of the classified documents or the insurrection at the capital? So you're never going to get to a point, I think, where the base of the Republican Party thinks that any prosecution of Donald Trump for his myriad crimes is acceptable.",

I asked the pope how he was feeling. \"Still alive,\" he joked. Francis also comforted and prayed with a couple who had lost their daughter, Angelica, just last night. While in the hospital on Friday, the pope visited the pediatric oncology and neurosurgery ward, bringing children Easter eggs and children's book and rosaries. He even baptized a newborn baby boy, Miguel Andhell (ph). After leaving the hospital, Francis stopped at the Basilica of St. Mary's Major in Rome to pray for the children he had met and all the families who have lost a child or whose children are ill, the Vatican said. And one last stop before arriving back at the Vatican, the pope greeted and thanked the police. Francis confirmed to journalists that he will be present on Sunday in St. Peter's Square for Palm Sunday mass. And that he's still intends to travel to Hungary at the end of the month.

Primarily, because the issue with Dominion is that it's a private company, that FOX News was promoting lies about them. Them just saying that the election was stolen really appeals to their base. It doesn't land them in any legal liability, even though it's a journalistic scandal, of course, that we haven't seen in a very long time.

He is not accountable to leadership. There's not much editorial oversight over his show, if any. And FOX News CEO Suzanne Scott is not often a fan of the kind of rhetoric that he airs on his show, particularly more extreme stuff that fueled, say, the riot, the January 6th riot at the capital.
