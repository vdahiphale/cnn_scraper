But we do know that the hospital that you see behind me is the hospital where the two Americans were brought to once they crossed into the United States.Now, all this as we're learning more from Mexican officials about the actual timeline of what happened in Mexico. Mexican officials saying that the Americans crossed into Matamoros, Mexico, at about 9:18 a.m. on Friday, and that they were lost for a few hours. They were trying to get signal. They were calling the doctor where Washington McGee was supposed to have for her medical procedure. They were trying to get to the doctor's office. They couldn't get there. And at 11:45 a.m. is when that dramatic video was taken that shows the kidnapping, that shows individuals being dragged into the back of a pickup truck. And now the mom of that survivor, Latavia Washington McGee, talking to CNN about those intense moments based on the account that she heard from her daughter. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Frank, good to have you with us. You know, if we pick up just where Kylie left off there, this push by some lawmakers, questions about whether the State Department could, in fact, designate cartels as terrorist organizations. What would that actually change? What would that change on the ground, especially for FBI agents, for example, who work out of that Mexico City office? FRANK MONTOYA JR., FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: Yes, it might open up some -- and it's a great question -- it might open up some other avenues of approach when it comes to dealing with these cartels. But the reality of the situation is, we're not going to be able to operate unilaterally against these targets in a place like Mexico. There's -- it's just too fraught with bad history. It's also -- this is a problem that is primarily a Mexican problem. They could use our assistance. I love what Congressman Vicente Gonzalez said yesterday when he talked about our neighbor's house being on fire and they need our help to put it out, but it is largely a Mexican problem. And so however we move forward in terms of trying to deal with this, it's going to require a joint activity, a joint -- a joint effort by both sides of the border because there is so much intended (ph) in terms of how you address these really dangerous cartels.",

When you look at the border region, and I started in the FBI in 1991 in San Antonio, so I got to see a lot of this firsthand even back then. And then when I ended my time in the bureau 26 years later in Seattle, of all places, we continued to see just the spread of the cartels' influence around - you know, different places around this country.And so when I talk about the failed state nature of that, it's the inability to control the criminal enterprise that is occurring down there. I mean we would like to be able to do it as a country. The United States would like to be able to do more, but we're still dealing with a sovereign nation. And the challenges that they are facing right now in terms of trying to get control, it really reflects not just an inability, but so many other systemic issues that prevent them from being able to get control of this situation. And that's where that idea -- and I'm not the only one that feels that way. There are a lot of guys who work in law enforcement and in the intelligence community who feel that way because of the things we have seen over the last couple of decades in Mexico.",

So, Melanie, you know, this is a highly politicized issue as well. I wonder, is the testimony today going to be about digging in for answers here or is it going to be more of a political back and forth? [09:10:05] MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Yes, Jim, I think we're going to see a mix of both politics and some substance here because the big question that has plagued both health officials and intelligence officials is where did this virus come from. And that is something that Republicans have vowed to dig into with their new majority. And we will see the first step in that process today. The House select committee on the coronavirus pandemic just kicked off a hearing moments ago with opening statements about to get underway here, looking into the origins of Covid-19. And the three witnesses that Republicans have called are Robert Redfield, the former CDC director under Donald Trump, Jamie Metzl, a former fellow for the Atlantic Council, and Nicholas Wade, he is a science writer. And all three of these witnesses have given some voice to the theory that the coronavirus may have originated in a lab. And, of course, their testimony is coming amid this intensifying debate over whether the coronavirus originated in a lab or if it was because of humans exposed to an infected animal. Now, the intelligence community does remain divided over this subject. There is no conclusive evidence on that front. But the Department of Energy did recently come to the conclusion that it may have been the most likely cause of the coronavirus. So, I do expect Republicans to focus a lot on that specific theory. You have firebrands on the panel, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who have been really animated over this. I expect that she will try to claim vindication. We could see some fireworks. But overall, Jim and Erica, I will say that there is a bipartisan agreement here on Capitol Hill that figuring out the origins of the coronavirus is important in order to determine and make sure this never happens again.",

The group, along with two OBGYNs, say the Texas laws, quite simply, put lives at risk, and they are demanding the state now clarify what qualifies as a medical exception.Lead president Amanda Zurawski, says she nearly died when her water broke just 18 weeks into her pregnancy. Doctors, though, at that time told her there was no way to save her daughter's life. She was initially denied an abortion because of that new law. She had to wait until she developed sepsis days later, a life-threatening medical emergency. Amanda eventually needed a blood transfusion and the infection also caused one of her fallopian tubes to permanently close, impacting her future fertility. Amanda Zurawski joins us now, along with Nancy Northup, who's president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, the advocacy group behind the lawsuit. It's good to have both of you with us this morning. Amanda, you've been very public about what happened to you, the very real concerns about your life in those moments. I know one of the reasons, as I understand it, that you have wanted to share your story so publicly is that you don't believe your experience is unique in the state of Texas. What have you heard since you first came -- became -- or went public, rather? AMANDA ZURAWSKI, SUING TEXAS OVER STATE'S RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for having me, first off. But to answer your question, it's definitely not as rare as people think. And every time there's any sort of story or headline or awareness that's brought up around what happened to me, I hear from women and men, not just in Texas, but across the country, sometimes across the globe, of similar stories. And people are afraid to speak out. And I'm hopeful that by speaking up and by putting a face to what's going on that it will give courage to other women to speak up about what's happening to them as well.",
