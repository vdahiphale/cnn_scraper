And tonight, we are taking a deep dive, into the major investigations, into former President Donald Trump. The hush money case, involving Stormy Daniels, the Fulton County grand jury case, in Georgia, and the Department of Justice's Special Counsel. We will have new information, on the Special Counsel investigation, this hour. But we begin in Manhattan, where Trump could be indicted, when a New York grand jury is expected to reconvene, in the morning. While there are hints that an indictment is looming, the reality is no one really knows what's going to happen, not even the 45th President himself. He predicted, over the weekend, he would be arrested today. That did not happen. The special panel of 23 jurors, investigating a 2016 hush money payment, to Stormy Daniels, has been meeting, in the downtown Manhattan, for months. So, if an indictment comes, it could happen as soon as tomorrow, with this investigation appearing to be near a conclusion. This whole saga has ignited another political firestorm, with Republican allies, in the House, trying to shield Trump, from making history, as the first former U.S. President, to be criminally charged. They're launching an investigation, into Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, and demanding his testimony. We're going to have much more, on the political fallout, just ahead.

Bring it to the grand jury. In New York, it's 23 people that have to be a majority. So, it'd be 12. Now, they would then vote on this. And if all 12 voted for it, then the D.A.'s office would inform Trump's attorneys, \"Your client has been indicted.\" Now, this happens behind-the-scenes, although, of course, former President Trump has been very public, about a lot of things that happened, including the raid, at Mar-a-Lago. But this would be done in private. They would be given a chance to surrender, because he's not -- this is not a violent felony. And there is always the possibility that he could decide he wants to fight extradition. But I think most people think he would agree to surrender, here. And, while this is a very normal process, he is such an unusual person, because it would be the first president that we're going to have security concerns. So, the Secret Service would be involved in the transportation. Trump has called for protests. We're seeing an already increased presence, down at the courthouse, by NYPD, and some new security features installed there. But, at a minimum, he would come in, he would surrender. He would be processed, like anyone else, a mug shot taken, fingerprinted, read his rights. And, because he's a former President, and there is a security issue, he would likely have this expert -- the next piece, expedited, which would be getting before a judge. But again, because if he is charged, nothing is a violent crime here, he would likely be released that day, and then, be on his way.",

ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: So, it's certainly possible. I think it's very, very unlikely at this point that Alvin Bragg would not seek an indictment. So, two big decisions have to be made, before this becomes an indictment. First, Alvin Bragg, as the D.A., as the prosecutor, has to decide, \"Am I going to ask this grand jury for an indictment?\" That is almost entirely -- that is entirely up to the prosecutor. You have very broad discretion. You can decide to seek an indictment or not seek an indictment for really any reason that you believe is appropriate. If he decides, \"I'm going to ask this grand jury for an indictment,\" then they will vote on it. As Kara just laid out, you need a majority vote. It's a lower standard than to convict.

Kaitlan, what do we know about this finding by the judge? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: So essentially, what she is -- what she has found here is that the Justice Department has convinced this judge that former President Trump did use one of his defense attorneys, in furtherance of a crime, or fraud, when it comes to the existence of classified documents, at Mar-a-Lago. Obviously, this is something we've been talking about, especially ever since last Friday, when the judge ruled that prosecutors had met that crime-fraud exception, when it came to Evan Corcoran. And if people aren't familiar with what the crime-fraud exception is, it basically means they want Evan Corcoran, to come testify again, before the grand jury, which he's already done. But this time, when he's asked questions, he can't cite attorney-client privilege, for not being able to answer, some of those questions. And the reason that she agrees with the prosecutors here is significant, is because it basically means the first time that the judge is saying here that it is Trump, who may have committed the crime here, not Trump -- or Corcoran, which had kind of been ambiguous before. So, it's incredibly significant. It could be significant to what Jack Smith, as Special Counsel, is pursuing here, when it comes to potential obstruction of justice. What we do know is that as part of this, they do have handwritten notes and audio recordings from Evan Corcoran. That is the defense attorney, who has been handling the documents probe, ever since May, ever since, of course, in August, when the Justice Department and the FBI went in, and had that search warrant, at Mar-a-Lago. So this is significant, because it zeroes in on Trump. Now, he has not been charged with anything. It remains to be seen how this all ends up. But when it comes to how this is being pursued here, and what could happen, over the next few days, it's incredibly significant here.",

And so, we know that she was, at least she overheard, or listened to that phone call, the one -- one of the phone calls there that they now have recordings of, where Trump is pressuring local officials, to help him find the votes that he believes will help him remain in office, or at least win Georgia, which of course he had lost. So, this indicates that there is still some investigation being done. So perhaps it's not as imminent as we first believed. The problem, for the District Attorney there is that, obviously this has been going on, for about seven months, and the clock is ticking, right, for the political calendar. And so, the question is, are they going to bring this perhaps in the next month or two, while this, the political calendar is going on? And of course, that's also the political calendar that the Justice Department is having to pay attention to, because, as you know, the candidates are declaring, and everybody is getting ready, for the coming election.

He spoke to Jerry Falwell, about that. He was at wit's end. And you can be sure he would have done it, then. What changed? Well, Lanny Davis is his lawyer now, for one thing, and he sees now how to market himself, perhaps.

And from a lot of the sources, I've spoken to, recently, who've been in touch, with the former President, they say recently, he has been actually ignoring this. And they believe this might be some sort of compartmentalization, or resignation, to the fact that this is happening, and it's just time to move on. One thing that I thought was really interesting, from the number of close advisers that I spoke to, of the former President, is what we're hearing all of these allies, and Republicans, publicly say that Trump is going to be helped, significantly, politically, by this. Those closest to him weren't (ph) so adamant. They said yes, they do believe it will help him in contested primary, will give him a boost, but that they have no idea what this would look like, long-term that they're in uncharted territories. I had one aide tell me, they'd rather he not be indicted at all, than get any sort of potential boost, and have to deal with this. But they are putting plans, in place. They do feel like they don't have a lot of that information that none of us have, in terms of timing.
