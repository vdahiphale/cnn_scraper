Amasterful example of Gothic architecture, the project began under King Louis VII and took around 200 years to complete. A site for religion, state occasion, and at one point monarchy, Henry VI of England was crowned King of France there in 1431. It was plundered and partly destroyed during the French Revolution, renamed briefly as the Temple of Reason. It even set the stage for the coronation of Napoleon as emperor in 1804, a scene recorded in one of the Louvre`s most celebrated paintings, one of countless works it`s inspired, including literature like the Hunchback of Notre-Dame, which helped motivate extensive renovations that added everything from the chimeras seen today to the spire that fell in 2019. Luckily, many of Notre-Dame`s treasures survived the fire. Its bells were restored and recently rang again. A crown of thorns said to have been worn by Jesus was saved. Even the rooster, a French national symbol, which sat atop the spire containing sacred relics was rescued. Although now a re-imagined bird inspired by a phoenix rising from the ashes sits fittingly in its place. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Lakes, oceans, tributaries, or estuaries? The answer is oceans, where catadromous eels migrate to spawn. Britain has a history with eels that stretches back to the 11th Century. But in recent decades, overfishing and blockages in the water have seen the number of eels returning to British rivers fall by 95%. This week on Call to Earth, we join a school in Somerset at the forefront of the grassroots movement to protect the eel`s future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
