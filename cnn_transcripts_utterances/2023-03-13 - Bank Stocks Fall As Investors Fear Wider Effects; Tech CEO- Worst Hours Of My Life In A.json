      "sentences": "The closing bell is ringing on Wall Street and the Dow and S&amp;P 500 just barely closing in the red in what wasan extremely volatile day. As you can see, the Dow Jones down around three- tenths of a percent, much better than what he was doing earlier when it was losing almost 300 points. Those are the markets and these are the main events. The ongoing fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, despite government efforts to restore confidence, shares in some regional US banks tumble. Israel's top VC says plenty of banks are stepping up to service tech startups. And expectations soften for the next Fed meeting. Live from Dubai, it is Monday, March 13th. I'm Eleni Giokos and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a very good evening. Great to have you with us. Tonight, bank stocks closed down heavily as the US President assures Americans their deposits are safe. Joe Biden said his administration will do what it takes to prevent contagion after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Still, shares in small and regional banks have been battered. First Republic falling 60 percent despite securing additional funding on Sunday. Western Alliance was down 46 percent. And PacWest fell 19 percent. Trading and the stocks was halted several times due to volatility. It comes after officials took emergency measures on Sunday to guarantee all deposits at Silicon Valley, as well as Signature Bank. The two collapsed after a bank run. The measures were meant to shore up confidence and prevent contagion effects. And Richard Quest is in Jerusalem for us. Richard, welcome. Great to have you on your show. Look, you're in Jerusalem, there is a vibrant tech startup space. And look, it is an exciting industry, but so many of these companies had deposits at SVB. What are you hearing? I mean, are they concerned about contagion? Do they have the liquidity that they need? RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\":   Good evening from Israel. This evening, we are here and indeed, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS will come from here tomorrow evening. There are two very clear and very distinct issues here. The first relates to banking and the second relates to tech. On the banking question, it really is an issue of whether other banks could fall the same fate or face the same fate of the two that we've been talking about, and the reason why these banks failed was because their asset base declined. They were stuffed to the gills with government and corporate bonds. Bond prices went down as interest yields went up, and that left the institutions classically, classically with a poor risk management portfolio. There is nothing magic about this. There is nothing different. There is nothing unusual. There is nothing weird. It is straightforward bad risk management at a time of rising bond yields. That's half of it. Now the tech side is arguably more interesting because so many techs were involved as you say, will they be hit by the fact that these lenders have gone? I spoke to Shlomo Dovrat, he is the head of Viola Group, which is the one of the largest venture capital here in Israel. They basically fund many of the world's greatest startups. He told me, he did not see a systemic risk from what was happening at SVB. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But on the bankingfront, it's very likely that there will be other banks that will suffer the shortfall, because the bonds that they've got have gone down in value. Eleni, there is nothing magic about this. This is classic. It's what happens in the same way that when there is a run on the bank -- I remember back in 2008, I use the phrase, a good old fashioned run on the bank. Once it happens, there is very little you can do other than to take the institution into public management or public ownership. So I certainly wouldn't be surprised to see more banks that have to be bailed out, taken over. The question, of course, Eleni, whether all depositors should be made whole?

But here's the thing, Richard, and we've seen this playing out before. Sentiment is everything, and a lot of this had to do with the way that people felt, just a little bit bad news, snowball effects, and then we saw big trouble coming to the fore. And I know that you don't believe that this could create further systemic issues, but I wonder if there's a worst case scenario we are not exploring.",

In thisfragility, the fragility of the current situation and the worries over what's likely to happen? Yes, there could be a nasty accident. Absolutely, particularly when we know rates are going higher. And the higher the rates go, the lower the bond prices that are in portfolios. And we certainly saw it, again with the pension funds during the whole Liz Truss debacle. Out of nowhere, you suddenly get these crises with asset managers. It's possible. Absolutely. But I think the difference here is unlike 2008, the banks are much, much, much better capitalized, number one. Number two, policymakers are not going to take any truck with this.

And today, President Biden alongside the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and Australia set to announce an accelerated timeline for the delivery of those first nuclear-powered submarines. Initially, experts had said that it was likely going to be in the 2040s when this partnership was first announced, but now, we are learning that at least three nuclear-powered submarines will be delivered in the early 2030s. And in between then and now crucially, both US and British submarines are set to rotate through Australian ports in an effort to counter China's naval presence in the region. But what's important to keep in mind here is that the President has really been pursuing a multi-pronged strategy with China. On the one hand, trying to counter China's military moves in the Indo-Pacific and also taking steps to address US companies' investments in China, for example. But at the same time, also seeking to try and normalize diplomatic relations, which have really taken a hit in recent months, particularly in the wake of the downing of that Chinese spy balloon over US waters. I spoke with a senior administration official who told me that rather than improving those military-to-military communications, which the US has been seeking to try and avoid some kind of a miscalculation that instead, this official said quite to the contrary, China has been resistant to establishing those dialogues. Now the question is going forward, especially now that the Chinese President Xi Jinping has completed his unprecedented consolidation of power with this third term, what will the Chinese posture be going forward? US officials are certainly hoping that there will be more dialogue, that China will be willing to reengage now that they have gotten past that People's Congress and that consolidation of power. But that is certainly a looming question, and keep in mind, here in the United States, there really is this growing bipartisan consensus about the risks that China poses to global stability, and that certainly is buttressing President Biden's position here today.",

The deal secures the deposits of thousands of British tech firms. Still, the sale wasn't enough to boy HSBC shares today. Indeed, most major U.K. banks were down over concerns about SVP's demise. Anna Stewart is in London for us breaking it all down. I'm looking at this rate across the board, HSBC down two percent. Lloyds, I think down around five percent. It's read across the board. And here's the big issue. There's a delineation between what this means for tech startups and what this actually means for the banking sector as well. And we've got those numbers up again. It is not looking good for the banking sector. This is speaking to the contagion concerns, Anna. What are you hearing after HSBC bought SVP U.K. for one whole pound?",

Aaron Klein is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and also a former deputy assistant secretary for Economic Policy at the Treasury Department. He joins me now from Washington.

And now he's got a full on, you know, bank -- the start of a possible bank panic or contagion on his hands. And he's worried about the consequences of that. And the Feds now, you know, monetary policy has been too much of the focus of the Fed. I wish they'd been focused more on regulating what was going on Silicon Valley Bank. I've long question whether the Feds interest rate hikes are really what's necessary to tackle the inflation issues in America. And so, the Fed is caught in a tough situation because if they pause their interest rate hikes, or they're going to be perceived, as we saw on inflation, which is in their messaging,",

So, it wasn't alone. It wasn't the only one with exposure to crypto and Silicon Valley startups, et cetera. But there aren't as many other banks like that. It -- this doesn't really pretend on Main Street banks who by and large are far more safe, far more sound. So, in that way, I don't think so. There isn't. But, you know, contagions are tricky things. Panics are tricky things. They don't behave rationally. So, I can explain to you that one set of banks over here were outliers, and almost all the rest were really in much better shape. But you have to trust that. And it's hard to have trust when the Federal Reserve was regulating a bank right under its nose that just imploded like this.",
