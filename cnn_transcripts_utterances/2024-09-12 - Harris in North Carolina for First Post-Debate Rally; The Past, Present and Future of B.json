They think that the Republican candidate for governor thinks it is especially weak in a way that makes them more viable. There are nearly a dozen Historically Black Colleges and Universities in this state, and we have seen a surge of momentum in terms of early voting. More than 161,000 people have requested valid to vote early. And we know central here is going to be this issue of reproductive rights and the broader issue of health care. So they want to confidently run on those issues, and they think that they can resonate with voters here in this state on that issue. Now, the vice president's team, they are feeling very confident about the debate performance. Let's take a listen.
