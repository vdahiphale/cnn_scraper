      "sentences": "Well, I was struck as well by the very graphic description of the videos it was clearly shown during his visit here, or as he has seen at some point in the line about how quickly, nearly a month after how he believed that that has kind of receded from the memories of many people.This clearly, because the last several weeks have been filled with dramatic and painful images of civilians in Gaza, in the fallout of the military operation that Israel has carried out there inside of Gaza. So, clearly, the U.S. trying to convey to Israel that the images of this being broadcast around the world is having quite an impact on Israel's reputation and exactly how people feel about the way Israel is acting in this operation as we speak. So, they're trying to strike that balance. Secretary Blinken also talked about the painful videos and images that he has seen of Gaza civilians suffering in the bombardments there that have taken place over the last several weeks. And that is the fine line, kind of the balancing act that the U.S. is trying to carry out here and trying to get Israel to behave more constrained. But he also went on to say that there are legitimate questions about how any kind of pause in all of this would take place. And, clearly, in the last several days, Israeli military officials and political leadership here have made no bones about it that they are driven by dismantling the Hamas military operation. And even Secretary Blinken here saying this afternoon in Israel that they cannot go back to pre- October 7th political conditions where Hamas can controls Gaza. So, I thought that was rather significant as well.",

Because what we heard from the secretary of state at the lectern right there, John and I were kind of noting it together, is you heard that he said mechanisms are in place to enable fuel to reach hospitals. He spoke to Bibi Netanyahu and others about concrete steps to better protect civilians, that they're committed to talking about a humanitarian pause in order to allow for more hostages to be released. But those concrete steps, it doesn't say yet that they're agreed to. It seems that there's a lot more work that needs to be going on behind the scenes.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, Kate, I mean, the secretary was clearly very moved, very shaken up by the images that the Israelis showed to him of the Hamas terror attack on October 7th. And that it seems very clear that that, you know, was a consistent message that the Israelis were sending to him during their meeting was, look, we are not conducting this kind of military operation in a vacuum. This is what they did to us and this is how we have to respond. And Blinken is clearly sympathetic to that argument.But on the other hand, the conversations behind the scenes between the Biden administration and the Israeli counterparts to include Blinken have been that you are going to lose international support. And it could happen within weeks, not months, if you continue carrying out the operation in this way. If the international community continues to see women and children being pulled from the rubble in the Gaza Strip, then that it's going to actually limit your ability to carry out your military objectives in a consistent way. And so the dueling messages here that he is sending, not only to the Israelis, but to, frankly, the American public, the rest of the world, are, look, we stand by Israel really for, you know, for -- the behind their operation here, but you have to do it right. And the bottom line comes down to, at this moment, the humanitarian pauses and the pauses that he wants to see in the fighting so that civilians can get out, so that aid can come in, and so the hostages are released. Now, the complication, as we have reported only in the last few minutes, is that Israel made very clear to Blinken that there would be no pause in the fighting, no pause in the airstrikes unless Hamas agreed to release more hostages. So, they're not going to give up their operation for nothing. They want to see concrete steps being taken by Hamas as well. And there has been some frustration within the Israeli government for how slowly, of course, Hamas has been releasing these hostages. So, there are just a lot of moving parts here. But I think the bottom line is that the administration is increasingly of the opinion that their position to not call for a ceasefire, not call for a longer stretch of a cessation of hostilities to protect civilians, is going to become increasingly untenable as this goes on.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think on the question of releasing hostages, a pause, that those discussions are still underway. And the other piece of those discussions are not just those that take place here in Israel, but take place on his next stop, which is going to be in Amman when he speaks to Jordanian leaders and other Arab leaders about completing that picture.Some sort of exchange of a pause in fighting, perhaps to get hostages out, but still not done yet. I think that's the deliverable he's looking for. One of them, they're not there yet, talk still underway. I will say that one commitment he did say he had, in fact, he said he used that term, a clear commitment, was that Israel would address settler violence in the West Bank against Palestinian civilians there because Blinken, throughout his comments, was striking this balance of saying the U.S. supports Israel's right to defend itself, to respond to these horrible attacks on October 7th, but at the same time to respect the lives of Palestinians. His words were that civilians should not suffer the consequences for Hamas' inhumanity. He went on to say that protection of civilians must take place not just in Gaza, but also in the West Bank, because this has been taking place even in the last several days. We've seen videos of Israeli settlers attacking Palestinian civilians, and sometimes when Israeli soldiers have tried to intervene, those settlers attacking Israeli soldiers as well. So, he did say he got a clear commitment for Israeli leaders to address that violence. What still seems to be underway are talks, negotiations on how to get at least some of those hostages out of Gaza and to meet what seems to be a demand to do so, some sort of pause in hostilities. But it is clear to your point, John, they're not there yet.",

So, it's hard to discern every individual thud that you hear.But now, if you look out into the distance, and this is looking back toward Northeast Tel Aviv here in the last few minutes, we've seen and we're seeing a large cloud of smoke emerging from somewhere. We do not have details as to what exactly this is, but this all we've started to take notice of here in the last few minutes. But it is a significant cloud of smoke. It is probably several dozen miles away from where we are, this vantage point here in Tel Aviv. So, all of this is -- you know, the concern that so many officials here have had in Israel, that there could be some sort of escalation. But we're trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at there, but we thought it was significant given the developments of the people who have been speaking here in the last few minutes, and how that's developing and what we're seeing on the ground here.",

It took many years for us to go after the terrorists responsible for 9/11.But to have vast bombing in civilian places -- and I acknowledge Secretary Blinken's point, which is absolutely correct, that Hamas is using civilians as human shields. But I don't think if you're using hundreds of civilians as a human shield and you have one terrorist, that that justifies a bombing which is going to have civilians and children and women and the hundreds as collateral damage. There are more surgical and precise ways of doing it and bringing these people to justice.

And that's an observation I think is rooted in fact. If you listen to comments you are hearing from around the world you don't hear these days reflections on the terror attack itself. Why do you think that that terror has receded as a force for so many?",

I personally have had heard gruesome stories of women, children brutally murdered in the October 7th attacks. But that does not mitigate the suffering and the pain that we're seeing today of women and children who are Palestinian who are being killed.And so what has dominated the news are the more recent killings and we have to find a way to end the cycle of violence. One of the things Secretary Blinken said that I completely agree with is that there has to be a two-state solution with a Palestinian state. For too long America and the world has thought we can just ignore the Palestinian issue, that we can have the Abraham Accords and go around Palestine, that we can pivot to Asia and that somehow the situation will disappear. That is not the case. There has to be Israeli security. There has to be Palestinian justice. And until we have that kind of peace process that James Baker started with the Oslo Accords, I don't think we're going to end the cycle of violence.",

It's shameful what the Republicans did, holding aid to Israel for the Iron Dome defensive weapons hostage to saying that if you want to support that, you have to support cuts in IRS tax enforcement. The two have nothing to do with each other, and they put that poison pill in the bill.There are many Democrats, including Democrats like me, who are calling for a stop to the bombing, who do believe that we should continue our aid to Israel, both for defensive technology. There are American citizens in Israel, and so America is engaged in the Middle East. I don't want China and Russia to be the mediators, but we need to have a package with the Senate, the House, and the president that can get broad bipartisan support.

It wasn't us. We had no idea what was going on. There are some major problems with that defense. One is that you've already got evidence before the judge from accountants and others and Michael Cohen, who was a lawyer, saying that this was a premeditated plan year after year. On top of that, you've also got Don Jr. who was certifying all of the statements. He was basically following what has become the standard practice in corporate law now is for the CEO or the CFO to essentially certify that he's kicked the tires on these financials. He's looked at the numbers. He's sat down with people and said, okay, this whole business about Seven Springs, where did you come up with that value? What happened with my dad's apartment? You've got 30,000 square feet and it's really only 11,000 square feet. He didn't do that and the judge is going to see through that in a minute. Then on top of it, with respect to the other butler involved here, Weisselberg, the guy who really did it, which is what they're going to claim, that person received $2 million from the Trump Organization after he left. Now, if you look at that $2 million, that's basically what his fine was, what his taxes were and his interest was in terms of his penalty for the criminal case. I mean, that, the government, is going to argue was hush money. It was to keep him quiet. This was no different than what Nixon did with the Watergate burglars. Back then the hush money was $1 million. Now it's $2 million. In 50 years, you expect a little inflation here.",
