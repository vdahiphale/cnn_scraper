      "sentences": "All right, just before 5In just a few hours, the U.S. Supreme Court will be issuing its next round of rulings. The high court has a stacked docket of decisions to make before its terms wraps up in the next week, including former President Trump's claim of immunity from criminal prosecution. That decision is likely to impact three pending criminal trials that he faces. He is, of course, the presumptive Republican nominee. Let's bring in Jess Bravin who covers the high court for The Wall Street Journal. Jess, good morning to you. Thank you so much for being here. Let's start with this immunity decision because, of course, we're expecting at 10:00 a.m. the court to come in. We're going to find out what cases that are left. These are, of course, their highest stakes, most important cases that they leave for the very end of the term. What are you watching for in terms of this immunity question? When you learn that it is actually coming what will you be particularly focused on?",

So that obviously is a huge win for Mr. Trump if he -- if he gets it.More likely, it will be a somewhat more nuanced decision where the court sees some area of criminal exposure for ex-presidents. And the question is going to be what do you have to do to find out what acts can be tried and what -- which are immune. And that is really going to be the question. The details are going to tell us whether there is a possibility of an actual trial or not before the election.",

They are able to completely separate any personal feelings or background they may have from the legal issues before them. The perception may be something different for the public and for the participants in the case. In fact, we know from polling that most Americans view the court as politically motivated rather than acting on legal principles. We -- again, who knows what's in the -- in the hearts of men and women?However, the issues in this court -- this case -- the connections between members of the court and the litigant, Donald Trump, are much closer than we've seen in, really, any cases, including ones where a president has appointed justices who are then ruling on a matter of personal importance to him. President Trump appointed three members of the court. Even when they were nominated there were questions about what is the degree of personal loyalty will they have to him because he has made that an important factor in the decisions he makes about who he is going to give to high office. And they all said no, none at all. We are there purely to look at legal issues. But we have seen, of course, that the wife of one justice, Ginni Thomas, Justice Thomas' wife, was urging Republican officials to reject Biden's victory after the election in 2020. And then we've seen Martha-Ann Alito, the wife of Justice Samuel Alito, flying flags at her properties that many associate with the Stop the Steal or MAGA movement. And it makes it almost quaint the kinds of things we were looking at during Bush v. Gore the last time we saw such an intricate connection between the Supreme Court and an election outcome. There, an offhand comment that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's husband made at an election watch party became a frontpage scandalous story in our paper --",

Wade will be overturned automatically. And that's, indeed, what happened. And President Trump was talking about that just last week -- about how he takes pride in that outcome. So -- and you see some Democrats trying to link these together, saying that the court is now just an arm of the Republican Party. It's doing things for their policy agenda. The justices is doing things for their candidate. Again, the court does not see it that way. They would never say that, and I don't think they believe that. That's how many people perceive it.",

Jamaal Bowman had been joined by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This is a very unique district in that it encompasses some of the wealthiest, frankly, less diverse places in Westchester County, New York with some lower income areas in the Bronx.

Obviously, the amount of money that was funneling into this campaign -- to this campaign -- this race. AIPAC spent more than 15 -- nearly $15 million on this case, focusing on Jamaal Bowman's comments about Israel. His criticism of the country's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.But more specifically, like you mentioned, I mean, his district has changed since he won in 2020 and it has become more white and less Black and it's covering more of that high-income Westchester County than it is the parts of the Bronx that really helped propel him to office. But more than that, I think Jamaal Bowman was seen as a vulnerable candidate for centrist Democrats hoping to go more to the moderate side to be able to talk to the constituent base that wants folks who are not more outspoken -- who are doing the job.
