Christin singer Lauren Daigle at a vigil in Nashville, this was last night, after postponing her concert to host prayers for the victims of the Covenant School shooting. Nine-year-old students and three adults lost their lives and police say the 28 year old shooter was heavily armed, carrying three firearms, including two assault-style weapons.Overnight, police executed a search warrant at the shooter's home where they seized a sawed off shotgun and a second shotgun. I want to bring in now Stephen Gutowski, he's a safety instruction and firearms reporter for thereload.com. Stephen, thank you for joining us this morning. We just -- we got the new information on what they found overnight and the weapons that were allegedly found at the scene. What more can you tell us about the weapons that the shooter had?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so the weapons that were recovered at the scene, there actually seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding from police about what they are. As you can see in these pictures here, you have a 9mm handgun, and AR-15 style pistol, and then a SUB2000, which is a pistol caliber carbine that shoots 9mm as well.And then what's interesting about those guns you mentioned being recovered at the shooter's home is the sawed off shotgun because if - if it is indeed a shotgun that has a barrel shorter than 18 inches, that would actually be subject to stricter federal regulations under the National Firearms Act. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: And, Stephen, I mean, you're a firearms expert. That's why we have you on this morning and -- to talk about these things because it is such an important part of this as we learn more about the shooting and what was brought to the actual school with the shooter. Three guns, we are told, two of them assault-style weapons, one handgun. What do you -- I mean that is a significant amount of firepower that this person had with them at the -- at the scene of this shooting.",

You know, that 14 minute response time where police immediately engaged the shooter, as they were still shooting, indicates that this person was trying to kill more people and, thankfully, was - was stopped at that point.",

The one on -- at the other end is a 9mm carbine, so it has a 16 inch barrel but it shoots that same ammunition. And the one in the middle is an AR-15. Now, we don't have a picture of it, but you described that they had recovered a sawed off shotgun from what the police have reported. That would be subject to a law called the National Firearms Act, where you'd have to have a registration with the ATF to own one of those firearms. You'd have to pay a $200 tax as well. So that -- potentially if the shooter hadn't registered that firearm, if it is indeed a short barrel rifle -- a shotgun, then, you know, they - they would be breaking federal law in that situation, which could, you know, have a penalty of a federal felony up to 10 years in prison. It's - it's - it'd be interesting to see more details about that firearm even if it wasn't used in the actual attack.",

And opposition leaders, they welcome the pause, but they're being cautious about it. Circumspect. They say that they are happy to engage in negotiations if they're done correctly with the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, as mediator (ph). Now, we've heard no word yet of when these meetings will take place, but the next parliamentary session is supposed to happen in just about four weeks with the Passover holiday in the middle. So, there's not a lot of time there. Meanwhile, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far right wing minister of national security, saying today that Netanyahu promised me that if we don't pass reform through negotiation, we will pass it as it stands. Keep in mind that Itamar Ben-Gvir, as part of agreeing to this pause, was promised his own national guard. That's a whole other issue in itself that this right wing minister was promised essentially his own national guard. But meanwhile the protesters, they say they are not stopping. They do not believe that Netanyahu will engage in real negotiations. They will continue protesting, they say, until these reforms are completely off the table. Don.",

It's a little bit north of the city of Philadelphia where that spill happened. Well, the Delaware is, of course, a big source of water for the city of Philadelphia. Then on Sunday, the city issued out of recommendation, saying folks should go out and get bottled water out of an abundance of caution. Well, that lead to an all-out run on water in supermarkets We saw empty shelves. But then later, that same afternoon, on Sunday, they said, actually, you don't need to buy bottled water. The city water is absolutely safe to drink. Well, we pressed the city yesterday on some of those mixed messages and asking if that would lead to distrust. Well, city officials acknowledged to us yesterday, they said that they may have over communicated and elevated folks sense of anxiety.
