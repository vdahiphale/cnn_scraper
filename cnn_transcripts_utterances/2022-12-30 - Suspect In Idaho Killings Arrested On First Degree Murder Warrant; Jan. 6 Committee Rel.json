New and long-awaited arrest in the horrific killings of four University of Idaho students in November. Bryan Christopher Kohberger is now facing first-degree murder charges in the stabbing deaths. That's according to an affidavit just in to CNN. The killings terrorize the small town of Moscow, Idaho, which hadn't seen a murder in seven years. The fear is so intense. Some students have been too scared to return to school. Investigators will hold a press conference they tell us very soon, and we'll take you there live. But first, CNN's Jean Casarez is in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, where the arrest was made. Have you been able to glean any more information about the person arrested and the charges he's facing?",

This is where the suspect has been housed. We (AUDIO GAP) on no bail. Bryan Christopher Kohbeger -- Kohberger is 28 years old. He was arrested at 1But here's what I want to emphasize. This is a small town, Pennsylvania. This is rural areas. This is not a big city at all. Now, we did just get a hold of the criminal complaint from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and it does say that the Pennsylvania State Police were assisting the Moscow police department, the Idaho State Police, the FBI, the homicide investigation, that there was an ongoing investigation of homicide, and that's why they were helping them. And he was taken into custody based upon an active arrest warrant out of that other state on charges of first-degree murder. And they are calling him in this complaint, a fugitive of justice, which is extremely significant because what it means is that the charges were filed in the other jurisdiction, which would be Idaho, and then the person left the jurisdiction and they are able to now hold him on those fugitive of justice charges. One more thing. There is going to be an extradition proceeding. Has it happened yet? We don't have documentation that it has. But it's an important proceeding. He must be represented by an attorney because he can make the choice to be extradited back to that state, which is Idaho, or refuse extradition. And that is an important part of this entire process to get him back to be heard on those charges that are originating out of Idaho.",

But don't be surprised if it's not a lot more than what we already have because there's going to be a prosecution in this particular case.

These are all people that had lives ahead of them, and that were looking forward to becoming you know, the citizens and do things that they wanted to do. And here we are, these young people, their lives cut short. And now police say they have the person they believe that took their lives.

Obviously, some text messages had came out between her and Mark Meadows, and she really sorts of tried to walk some of those back or was more apologetic with them in her interview with the committee. So, she's talking about -- you know, she's asked about these messages she exchanged with Mark Meadows about essentially pressing, you know, election contests. And she said I regret the tone and content of these texts. I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these e-mails unfortunate.You know, at one point, she said in a message that she was disgusted by Vice President Mike Pence. And she again sort of tried to explain why she said that. She said I was frustrated that I thought Vice President Pence might concede earlier than what President Trump was inclined to do. So, according to her interview, I wanted to hear Vice President Pence talk more about the fraud and irregularities in certain states that I thought was still lingering. And she still expresses these concerns about election fraud in her interview with the committee, even though she says she doesn't have any specific evidence of fraud, Sara.",

In the text, she openly encouraged Meadows to challenge the result of the 2020 election. What is your take on all this? Is she trying to be revising her own history, trying to make herself look better? Because it seemed like she meant when she sent those texts.MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, if she's trying to make herself look better, she's not doing very well, is she? She comes across as someone typical in the Trump world. And by that, I mean, immoral, heedlessly ignorant, and unpatriotic when it comes to our democracy. These are all people who knew better. And I would put Melania Trump in that category. She claims -- or those around her claim that in December, she was telling people to tell her husband the truth. Well, she knew what the truth was. Why didn't she tell him the truth? And the idea that the president -- then-president needed someone to inform him of the truth is wholly inaccurate, you know. Lastly, I would say scanning these documents, looking at people like Rudy Giuliani who makes ridiculous claims, it's astounding to me how frivolous these people were, and that they were in charge of the United States government.

The majority knows Biden, and the left is attempting the greatest Heist of our history.\"When you look at that, considering that her husband is a Supreme Court justice with a job that he will have for his entire life, what does this tell you about her, but also about a potential influence of her on him? D'ANTONIO: Well, I think this tells us that this is a wholly corrupt person. And what Supreme Court justice's spouse indulges in this kind of speculation and tries to push around the highest-level officials in our government, this is also reflective of her long-running campaign of influence in Washington. One could even say that she's always tried to leverage her relationship with her husband, a Supreme Court justice, in a way that is more than unseemly. So, I've heard people talking about the financial reporting that should be required of public officials. I've heard people talking about these spouses needing to be required to step back from this kind of activity. And we may need laws now because the people around Donald Trump have proven to us that the voluntary guardrails don't work for them. They're going to be indulging in this kind of behavior.
