If I showed the big board, also relatively good compared to what we have seen in the last two days. Strong corporate earnings are boosting the mood among investors after a rough August, as well as September. Those in the markets and these are the main events. An economic flashback: Fitch ratings predicts the US is headed for a 1990's style recession. French workers hit the streets to protest rising prices. And China's faltering economy leaves some questioning the leadership of Xi Jinping. Live from London, it is Tuesday, October 18th. I'm Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest, and I too, mean business. Tonight, investors on Wall Street are shaking off concerns about an upcoming recession. The Dow surge at the open bells, it has now come back down a bit as we were telling. The S&amp;P up more than two-thirds of one percent. Strong earnings reports from companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Lockheed Martin are helping fuel really this optimism. The ratings company, Fitch, is also offering hope -- some possible hope, I think it is fair to say, it said the expected downturn might not be as bad as earlier scenarios. But first, a potential energy crisis have economists warning of a 1970's- style recession, then rising inflation prompt and fears of an '80s-type recession. Now, economists say the potential downturn looks more like this era, if you remember it. (CLIP FROM NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK \"STEP BY STEP.\")",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, I don't remember that recession either, but Fitch is basically calling for a mild recession. They don't see aneconomic meltdown, like the one that we saw in 2020 or in 2008. So, that means that the unemployment rate would rise but it wouldn't skyrocket. Fitch sees the unemployment rate topping out at 5.4 percent in 2024, that's almost two percentage points above current levels. But you know, the last few economic downturns and you can see it right there on your screen. We saw far larger increases in the unemployment rate with that eye-popping 11.2 percentage point increase during the COVID recession. Again, Fitch is calling for a less than two percentage point increase this time. Now, we don't want to minimize the pain to real people here. Any job loss, of course, is painful, but we obviously would prefer a mild recession to a meltdown and there are some reasons why Fitch is cautiously optimistic here. One, it's that the jobs market in the United States is really hot right now. That helps. Consumer finances are pretty solid. They have less debt, relatively speaking than in past crises. The housing market is slowing down, but it is not imploding; and banks, because of regulation, they are a lot stronger than they used to be. It is a little bit crazy that we've been talking about a recession, though. I mean, it's only been two-and-a-half years since the last recession started. The last two economic expansions lasted around a decade, this one could be a lot shorter and that is really because of high inflation. Consumer prices are going up rapidly and that is forcing the Fed to slam the brakes on the economy. And not only that, but we have the war in Ukraine and that is of course driving up energy prices in Europe and causing perhaps an even deeper recession in Europe.",

Also, some of these Fed worries have started to ease a bit because Treasury yields have stopped going straight up. They have stabilized. The US dollar has stabilized a bit as well, that is helping. But we do have to put all of this in context. Yes, markets are big today, up way bigger yesterday. But it has been a terrible year for the US stock market. The S&amp;P 500 is still on track for its worst year since 2008. So, a bit more optimism on Wall Street, but you know, that's in the midst of a whole lot of pessimism.",

The CEO of Goldman Sachs was saying there is no exception. The bank announced a reorganization along with its latest earnings. Its shares are up on better than expected profits. It also said, it will combine its trading and investment banking divisions into one unit, and that is what it is doing, too -- just over two percent. That would help the reported income as deal making slows down. Meanwhile, a new survey from The Conference Board found an overwhelming consensus among CEOs, 98 percent, as you can see there in your screen, expect a recession in the US; 99 percent expect one in the Euro area.

And so, they are very concerned about those hits to profit margins. They are also concerned about how much inflation pressures they can push through to customers, certainly as customers are coming under strain, certainly as Central Banks, both in Europe and the US are raising interest rates to combat inflation, and especially in Europe, energy price inflation. So, I think there are a lot of things on the minds of CEOs right now and they are also very concerned about geopolitics and how geopolitics play into disrupting supply chains and manufacturing of key goods like food and energy and metals that go into the products that they're producing.",

So I think, you know, as interest rates are rising very quickly and Central Banks are trying to slow down that demand, part of that is to get businesses to shift gears and to, yes, prepare for a recession. So I don't think it's necessarily a self-fulfilling prophecy, where CEOs are talking themselves into a recession.

The idea, of course, is to stop countries going and trying to outbid each other, pushing up prices. So they think that as a bloc, they have that kind of purchasing power, that will bring down prices. But as I said, it is a fairly radical rethink. They have been talking about this for a while. They spent the last month -- the last few months really focusing on building up their storage and their gas storage supplies. Now, they're moving on to these sort of longer term solutions to the problem, essentially, that the gas market, the energy market as a whole was designed for a time when both supply and prices were stable, and we're not in that anymore.",
