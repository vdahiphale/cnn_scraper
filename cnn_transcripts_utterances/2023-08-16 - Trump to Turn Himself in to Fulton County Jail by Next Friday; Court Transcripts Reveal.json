New overnight, we now know where Donald Trump will likely surrender in Fulton County, Georgia, with just nine days left to turn himself in. The local sheriff there says the former president is expected to be arrested and booked at the Fulton County jail on 13 felony charges for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. It's not clear, though, when that will happen. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has ordered Trump and his 18 co-defendants to surrender by noon next Friday. One of those alleged co-conspirators, Rudy Giuliani, says he will turn himself in sometime next week. This as he is ramping up his attacks on the district attorney; also, slamming her for using RICO racketeering charges, the same kind that he used, really pioneered, to prosecute Mafia bosses in New York when he was the U.S. attorney back in the 1980s.

They also wanted the direct messages.And this is the first time we have ever heard that Donald Trump's Twitter account would have direct messages, private communications on that service, including ones, Poppy as you're mentioning, not just that he's sending to people, but ones that would have been deleted. And so this all comes out in the series of hearings in February of this year as a judge is trying to get Twitter to respond to this warrant that the Justice Department had for these Twitter pieces of data. And as the judge is looking for that and trying to figure out exactly what Twitter might have so that to make sure that they are complying with what the Justice Department is seeking, that's when this all comes out. And one of the Twitter lawyers even says in court, \"We were able to determine that there was some volume in that for this account,\" talking about direct messages. \"There are confidential communications.\" So this lawyer is asserting in court, yes, indeed, Donald Trump's Twitter account has direct messages. And then the Justice Department says -- they talk a little bit more about what they want, and there's just a list of what they were looking for, in different ways that they're trying to find messages; messages between government officials, between Trump and others in the government, between government officials and Twitter, and crucially, Phil and Poppy, four messages that would have been sent around the time that Donald Trump's Twitter was suspended.

Good morning to you.And firefighters still have tons of work ahead of them, but I think that the emotional gravity point, you know, that we're focused on here so deeply is the effort to identify the human remains that are found a couple miles behind the camera. And what we mean by that is that Governor Green was on the air with our terrific colleague Kaitlan Collins a few hours ago. And he very much set the tone and set the tempo and expectations for people here all throughout the island; that this not only will just be a few days to get all the wildfires under control, but it will be weeks until all of the dead are identified. So to that end, Phil and Poppy, we have a few numbers for you. Thirteen DNA profiles out of all of the bodies that have been found, that is what we have so far. Authorities are asking people to come into a community center right near Maui's central airport so they can develop more DNA profiles, make more DNA matches. So far, they only have 41 DNA samples to try to make those matches. Now, earlier yesterday, we heard from a man who took it upon himself to show up at Maui's central morgue to try to identify his father. His stepfather, I should say, was one of the people clinging to the rocks on Front Street; did not survive. His mother and his family dog did survive. Listen to what this man told us a couple hours ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's gone. I just went and identified the body. The police have really helped, but I have run into a lot of people that are standing tired. I'm tired, too. I haven't slept in six days.

Maura, I want to start with you, as somebody who is deeply engrained in kind of Republican politics, and the House Republican Conference. You look at the range. Will Hurd has made very clear from the start that Trump and Trump's behavior was going to be a central issue for him. Other Republican candidates who are higher up in the polls right now, still about 30 points down, have been very different and had a different posture. The different posture that, I think, befuddles people, to some degree, since you're running against the guy, they're clearly seeing something in the numbers, though, that says don't go down that path of criticizing him. Why? MAURA GILLESPIE, FORMER DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TO REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Their campaigns have done their research and, for whatever reason, they choose to not say the truth and to not call this out for what it is. This is not normal. The man has been indicted four times. And he's about to release his report on Monday, further proving that he won the election? It really does call into question his sense of judgment. His character, obviously, is on display here, as far as being indicted four times. But I think I was, you know, disappointed by Tim Scott's reaction. It's not surprising that the campaigns are looking for people to target their weaponization, because they're going to point out things like Stacey Abrams not conceding. They're going to point out things like the Fani Willis, her not being able to -- yes, not being able to question Doug Jones because of a fundraiser she had for his opponent. So they're going to call onto these things to say that this is corrupt and an abuse of power; because they don't want to actually address the elephant in the room, pun intended, which is Donald Trump.",

And every single time, he's been proven to lie.My question, and first I want to show this, because this is important. Governor Brian Kemp from Georgia, who is a Rock Ridge (ph) conservative, Republicans who like Republican policies like Brian Kemp, tweeted, quote, \"The 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen. For nearly three years now, anyone with evidence of fraud has failed to come forward under oath and prove anything in a court of law. Our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible and fair and will continue to be as long as I am governor. The future of our country is at stake in 2024. That must be our focus.\" This, however, is going to pull all of these candidates who have refused to say anything negative about Donald Trump down this rabbit hole of, is it fraudulent, is this report accurate? And we have seen this over and over again in the last seven years, where you give Trump space, if you're a Republican, because you don't want to upset his base.

But that ends up carrying you down a path where you're defining deviancy down, where you end up being complicit in a lie. And look, I look forward to the report. We all know what it's going to be. And your quote from Brian Kemp was exactly right. That's the refutation. It's court cases. It's individual states. It's audits. It's Republicans. And that needs to be said over and over again until all Donald Trump has left is a defense that he's in his own delusional world. But when candidates start unnecessarily, I think, like Tim Scott did, who's a -- who is better than this, I think. I agree with Bakari on this. Says it's un-American and unacceptable.
