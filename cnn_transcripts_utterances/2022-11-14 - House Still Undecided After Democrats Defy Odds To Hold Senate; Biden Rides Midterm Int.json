It is possible, it is possible we can project this race later tonight, no promises. But Katie Hobbs, the Democrat, has a 24,719 vote lead. Kari Lake is the Republican challenger. She keeps voicing confidence she will catch up as more votes come in. Wolf, tonight, we're expecting more votes from Maricopa County. That is Arizona's largest county by far, and more votes as well from Prima County, the second largest county. You'll notice, both of those are blue. The Democrat, Katie Hobbs, is leading in both, but Kari Lake believing she can make a comeback, especially in Maricopa, again, perhaps later tonight we'll get some.Now, let me come back to your question about the House. Let me pull out to the national map and take a look. And this is just -- wow, we are six days after Tuesday Election Day. Republicans are leading in 222 races, Democrats leading in 213. But this is the number that matters most, 212 races have been called for Republicans. They, Wolf, are still six shy of what Manu was just talking about, the 218 you need to have a House majority. Democrats are at 204. Now, can the Democrats pull this off mathematically? Yes. But what is the most likely scenario? A narrow Republican majority. Let's look. These are the 19 uncalled races, yet to call these races. You see them on the map. There is one in Maine. There is one in New York. Most of them are out here in the west, including in Alaska. Several of these perhaps when late votes come in later today, we may be able to project tonight as well, but just think about the math for Democrats. Republicans only need, as I said, Republicans are at 212. They only need six more. They're leading in ten. So, Democrats have to take away some of these races where the Republicans are leading. When you look at the map, it is possible, Wolf, possible, but, again, pretty tough. Lauren Boebert's district here in Western Colorado, she's obviously a Trump accolade, very well-known to conservative circles, not done but she's up by 1,122 votes. That's not a lot, but when you're at 99 percent of the estimated vote in, that is hard math to overcome. Let's pull out, I just want to look at a couple of these out in California. You look at this race right here, John Duarte only up by 84 votes. So, there is one maybe Democrats could get. David Valadao to the end, they're still counting mail-in ballots, they're not due until tomorrow, 2,800 votes again. So, is it possible Democrats get some of these races? Yes, Wolf. It is also possible though some of these blue flip red as those mail-in ballots come in. So, not mathematically eliminated yet the possibility of a Democrat's holding the House but if you look at this, Republicans are leading in ten races, ahead in 222, 212 called, six more would make Kevin McCarthy speaker. But as Manu noted, if Republicans, as is likely, get that majority, it is going to be tight.",

Jamie, let's begin with this fight for leadership that's going on among Republicans in the House of Representative and the Senate for that matter as well. I know you're well plugged in. What are you learning? JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Let's talk about the House. Kevin McCarthy is the leading candidate. And most of the people I spoke to, the Republicans who think that he will get there if they win the majority and he becomes speaker. That said, they are going to make him fight for it, every single inch of the way. I just heard from a Republican member of Congress who said he is still vulnerable. He's going to have to work for it. What is interesting though, Wolf, is it is not always predictable. We just heard in Manu's piece Matt Gaetz say that he would rather be water boarded by Liz Cheney, I think he's a little obsessed with Liz Cheney than vote for Kevin McCarthy. On the other hand, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is normally a bomb thrower, now says it is very risky if they don't support Kevin McCarthy.

Now, the shoe is on the other foot, doesn't change the fact he's going to be dealing with a complicated picture.

That remains unchanged for now, these core arguments.What is different now is this voter education that is happening. Both of these candidates really educating their voters about how the runoff process works, how much time that they have when the early vote starts and the date of this is December 6th. Senator Warnock up with an explainer video that he's pushing on YouTube really to target younger voters, and that is the challenge that they, not only do they have to get out all of the voters that voted in the general election, they now have to look and assess to see who didn't turn out and try to get those voters as well.",

You can move things through committee much faster, much easier with your simple majority in the committee, and that means judges, that means the president could have a post-midterm cabinet shakeup.Number two, if the Democrats lock that seat up in Georgia for six years, the Democratic map this year in the Senate was favorable to Democrats.

There is no reason that the Justice Department couldn't have personal records. In fact, President Trump lost a case in the Supreme Court, where the New York district attorney subpoenaed essentially personal records of President Trump. So, it doesn't make any difference.
