And this is very different from 2008 when the United States government was trying to pressure Germany and France into accepting Ukraine and Republic of Georgia into NATO and they were opposed. And then they put out some language to paper over this difference. This is now real. They all believe that Ukraine will be part of NATO. There is, however, of course disagreement as you hinted towards in your question. You know, there's a question of when whether Ukraine is ready today or whether it needs to do more work on its democracy, and so because they couldn't resolve those issues, they went as far as they could which I think is still a victory for Ukraine.",

Article 5 of the NATO treaty, an attack on one is an attack on all.So if Ukraine were to join NATO immediately as you're suggesting should be a possibility, doesn't that mean that immediately the United States and all the NATO countries would have to, like, send in troops to defend Ukraine?",

So, any disputed territory where there's hot war ongoing or where it's occupied by Russia wouldn't be covered by this, but then it would deter Russia from taking one more step into Ukraine, into the territory that the Ukrainian government does control and that would be the idea.The other reason to do it right now would be frankly to accelerate the process of getting to peace because I think Russians believe -- the Kremlin believes that if this drags on and Ukraine doesn't become a NATO member, the West will get tired because maybe Ukraine won't win the war outright. And so, they're banking on time being on their side, that somehow the support will weaken for Ukraine. TAPPER:  The British defense secretary told CNN earlier today that NATO member countries are struggling to find ways to keep ammunition supplied to Ukraine. As this war stretches past 500 days, what happens if the U.S. and other key allies say they can't keep supplying Ukraine with what Ukraine says they need to beat back the Russians?",

And the law that would take effect immediately unless there is legal action to stop that, and that's exactly what Planned Parenthood of the heartland, the regional Planned Parenthood operation there has said it intends to file for legal relief urging a judge or a court to stop that, essentially either before it's signed or at the same time it is signed, so we'll have to see if that legal action works.But, Jake, this is something that is really going back to 2018. In 2018, the Iowa legislature passed and the governor signed a bill into law that was blocked by the court. So this is simply trying to redo that, but, of course, a lot has changed since then. State by state across the country some 16 states have changed their abortion laws in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, that Dobbs decision last year. But if he signs it on Friday as she's expected to do, Jake, this is happening on the same day that most of the Republican presidential field of candidates with a few exceptions will be coming into Iowa to speak at an evangelical organization, a presidential town hall, so certainly this injects this into the Republican presidential race. And it also could potentially make some uncomfortable positions for some candidates who have not said if they support a six-week ban. Of course, former President Biden Mike Pence, he says he does support Nikki Haley and others have not been specific about the number of weeks they would support for abortion legislation. So certainly this puts the issue front and center in the Iowa caucuses, Jake.",

If a six-week ban, like the one we're seeing here in Iowa and other states like Florida, if that came across your desk, would you sign it? WILL HURD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Look, if a six-week ban came across my desk that means that -- and if Congress was able to pass something like that and it was being reflective of where a majority of the country is, I actually think where a majority of the country is around 15 weeks, after the first trimester. The other thing I think we should also be talking about is how do we ensure we have neonatal health at a gold star standard? How do we make sure that maternal health is the greatest in the world? With some of these restrictions, the fact that if you're a Black woman having a child in the United States of America, the death rates are similar in countries, in the developing world.

It's not an issue about not supporting the Republican nominee. I'm not going to support Donald Trump, and I can't lie to get access to a microphone. I've made it very clear that I can't support Donald Trump. He's a proven loser. He's lost the house in 2018. He lost the Senate and the White House in 2020, preventing a red wave from coming.

Well, they did exactly what you think with their ads, they reach right back at that taxpayer, targeting them with ads and information, knowing how much money they had, what had just happened in their lives, how they could reach them, how they could apply more sales pressure to that person there. One big question in all of this, Jake, is how much was a conscious decision made along the way, because many, many, many companies use pixel trackers just to improve their product in their mind, say, we want to reach our customers better, and how much of this was happening automatically? Because they're using a product from this company to deal with this taxpayer. That somehow tracks for them, but that tracking gets passed over to them, and they have it, so they sell stuff back here.
