A horrific chain of events and a fast rising death toll in Seoul, the capital city. At least 120 people now confirmed dead by emergency officials in Seoul. It happened at a Halloween festival. We want to show you some of the scenes but we have to warn you this video we're about to show you is very graphic. You can see complete chaos and terror on the scene there. You can see people performing CPR on some of the injured and maybe the dead who are on the ground where they fell. Right now still not clear exactly what happened, what caused these folks to collapse. But let's get right to CNN's Will Ripley, he is on the scene. Will, incredible work being there as all of this is unfolding. What can you tell us? What more do we know?",

And there's actually another briefing set to get under way any minute now. We're monitoring that and if we get any new numbers of casualties because we were told they are expected to go up considering that a lot of the people who were brought to area hospitals were in very bad shape when you talk about cardiac arrest, their heart stopped.So we'll keep you posted on that. But I have been able to speak to some people who were out here. And they give us a much clearer picture of how this could have possibly happened. You can see the scene itself is kind of clearing out now. A lot of people have been going home. Police have been on loud speakers telling people to go home safely as soon as possible and clear the area. But you still have hundreds of police officers and firefighters out here. And they are continuing to investigate. So we have now confirmed that this Halloween event was in fact outside. OK. So this hotel, the Hamilton Hotel, behind the hotel and along the side of the hotel, these very narrow streets. And I was given a couple of photos by a 22- year-old man Song Sehyun, OK, and he -- I talked to him. He was actually at the Halloween event a couple of hours before this crush happened. And so the pictures that he took were maybe one or two hours before the actual deadly incident. And hopefully we're able to show them for you on the screen. The street where this actually happened. All the police back here they're still blocking it off so we can't actually take you there. But you can see how narrow the street was and how thousands of people were packed in so tightly that they could not move. Let me play for you a portion of my conversation with him because he said that when he got stuck in this narrow street with all of those people jam-packed so tightly he said frankly it was terrifying.

Our sourcing at CNN tell us that the suspect went into the backside of the house and confronted Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.But as you mentioned, our colleague Jamie Gangel is reporting that the suspect was shouting where's Nancy, where's Nancy. She wasn't here at the time. But Mr. Police was violently assaulted. We're learning about how police were initially called to the scene. Mr. Pelosi was able to dial 911 during his confirmation and left the phone open. He was speaking in code. And it was an adept police dispatcher who realized that something was wrong. She sent police to this location. They arrived and were able to tackle that suspect but not before he severely wounded Mr. Pelosi. They were both taken to the hospital. Mr. Pelosi remains in the hospital at this hour. We've been looking into this individual's social media history. It is littered with conspiracy theories, far-right conspiracies about election lies, about COVID vaccines, about the January 6th insurrection. And of course this comes as we've seen all of these threats to lawmakers seemingly continue to come in this wave. The police chief here actually spoke yesterday very forcefully about that very topic.

His relatives have said that he was estranged from his family. An acquaintance said he seemed out of touch with reality. But it does appear he was posting these conspiracy theories online about the election and January 6th and everything else. But, you know, we were having this conversation with Michael Fanone in the last hour and talking about whether there is ample security, enough security, protecting members of Congress, leadership in Congress, their family members, people like Nancy Pelosi and her husband. But I wonder, Phil, in the climate, this highly charged, highly volatile climate that we're in, I suppose you could also make the case that police, no matter how many resources you put at it, can't be everywhere in the environment that we're in right now. [15:10:07] PHIL MUDD, CNN COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST: Boy, I'd deal with the latter, Jim. This is not about security. I'm sure there'll be a debate in the coming days. But start to multiply security by looking at what's happening in places like city councils and school boards that are discussing what's going on with children and some angry parents show up. You know, obviously there's hundreds of members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court. There's members of state legislatures. You cannot secure that many people especially when you start to throw in the question of families. I think cutting to the chase, to your latter point, about environment, I would be looking at the question of members of Congress and others and how they validate people who want to believe that the government is their enemy, who want to believe that the opposing political party is an enemy, who want to believe that the government is authorizing fake elections. Even if someone has a mental disability, you can't validate that viewpoint. Otherwise, you get incidents like this, Jim.",

So when I saw what happened to Paul, I can't imagine what Nancy must have been feeling when she was on that airplane because there's not just fear, you know, for family members but there's this fury, this anger of how dare somebody, you know, do this when you're a public official and you're trying to serve your constituents.

I think you're seeing that carry over. And I just think that this is -- sadly, this isn't a culmination of anything, Jim. This is a tragic data point in the violence that we've seen even before January 6th. Heck, we go back to the national bomber who thought there were reptilian humanoids.

Obama remembers his own midterm \"shellacking\" when the Democrats lost 63 in the House in the middle of his first term. Let's start there with Molly Jong-Fast, host of \"Fast Politics\" podcast, and CNN political commentator, S.E. Cupp. Great to see both of you. Appreciate it so much. Molly, we had a clip of Barack Obama on at the top of our 2:00 hour. He was talking about this dangerous political rhetoric we have in this country right now. And how it is really something that is a major factor in all of our lives now and is contributing to situations like we saw out in San Francisco, the attack on Paul Pelosi. How critical a comment do you think that was for the former president to make in this moment? MOLLY JONG-FAST, PODCAST HOST, \"FAST POLITICS WITH MOLLY JONG-FAST\" &amp; CONTRIBUTING WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": I think the more that any of us can talk about how important it is to take down the temperature and how important it is for people not to be violent. You this, this is a hot time in American politics. And everyone is really nervous. And what we need is normal political discourse. No drama. No incitement. I think what's good is we are seeing a lot of people from both parties trying to take down the tone and to say, this is not OK. And this is not what should be happening. And I think the more that we can do that the better. And Obama is a really gifted orator. I think sometimes we forget how gifted he is.

But when you look at conspiracy theories specifically, they're a drug,and we are in the midst of an epidemic. They are a mind-altering substance. When you look at the trajectory of someone like Lara Logan and the absolute bile coming out of her mouth, you can almost chart the rabbit hole she fell into. And she's not alone. I mean, this is metastasized in our electorate. When you and I talk about QAnon and pedophile rings and JFK Jr coming back from the dead, they sound crazy and absurd to us. But to others they are real. And when they believe them so deeply, some go ahead and act out on them violently in some cases. And that's -- that's some of the damage. The other damage is in families. I mean, some people have been completely cut off from families and friends because of their irrational thinking. And I wish that voting were the simple solution to this. Our voting does not make this go away. This is an absolute cancer. And I'm worried that we're going to get a lot more of it because political leaders are not taking this on. Republicans have decided to court QAnon because they said they liked Donald Trump. Republicans have decided to give comfort to these kinds of conspiracy theories that can manifest as anti-Semitism, racism and bigotry. No, I don't think they have come out strong enough.
