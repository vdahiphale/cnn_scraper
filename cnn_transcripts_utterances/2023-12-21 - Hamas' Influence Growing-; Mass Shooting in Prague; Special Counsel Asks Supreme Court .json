In this case, the bottom line is, do voters have a right when they cast their ballots in 2024, do they have a right to know whether Donald Trump is a convicted criminal, or do they deserve to wait until after the election to find that out? And so what the special counsel is saying in their filing today says -- here's what he says: \"The stakes are at least as high,\" referring to Nixon, \"if not higher. The resolution of the question presented is pivotal to whether the former president himself will stand trial, which is scheduled to begin in less than three months in the future. Enforcing federal criminal laws that prohibit such conduct is vital to protecting our constitutional processes and democracy itself.\" They go on to point out that Donald Trump has had plenty of time to prepare for that trial. And, of course, Brianna, as you know, the appeals court has already scheduled oral arguments on January 9. So it is possible that we may see a quick ruling from the appeals court. Jack Smith is taking no chances. He's saying the Supreme Court needs to at least take this case on now.",

But there are lots of arguments for pushing it through more quickly. And it's a little ironic that the former president, given how many times his administration asked to leapfrog over appellate courts in seeking emergency authorizations from the Supreme Court, is now saying to slow it down, not to mention that it's his motion, his motion to dismiss, that is up for consideration.

We saw how much money he made off of something as simple as a mug shot. I mean, he uses all of these sort of moments in time in the legal system, all separate cases, all completely different charges or civil cases or questions, but the same defense. People rally around him. I did talk with voters because the Colorado ruling came just a minutes before he walked on stage there, but they were reading their phones and things. Some of it is sort of confusing. Like, what does this mean? Why is he off the ballot? So I think we just have to realize that people are living their lives and not following all of these cases. I mean, we can barely keep up with all the different cases. So the one commonality is that they believe he's under attack. And Republican rivals are saying -- the most any of them are saying is, do you really want this drama and chaos going into 2024?

A third is brought by Fulton County local prosecutor. A fourth is brought by Manhattan's local prosecutor. And then there are a variety of civil matters brought against the former president. This Colorado matter is brought by a nonprofit group, a legal advocacy group that's not affiliated with the Democrats or any other political party.

These would have been scenes of extreme violence while this shooting took place.And, as you said, I think it's really important to put it into the context that these sorts of mass shootings are very rare here on the European continent. Now, the Czech Republic is a slight anomaly. There is much more liberal gun laws than there are elsewhere in Europe, but, still, this is not something they have seen in decades. And it's likely to prove to be the deadliest shooting in peacetime in the country's history, so extremely shocking scenes. We're finding out a little bit more, Boris and Brianna, about exactly what happened and who this young man was, philosophy student at the faculty of arts of the university, the Charles University in Prague, where he went on the rampage. And what we understand is that this 24-year-old student had killed his father in his home village a couple of hours from the Czech capital before making his way to his university. Now, police had been given a tip-off. They understood that he was planning to kill himself at the university. They cordoned off the building at which he was due to have a lecture this afternoon. And it was, in fact, in another building that he carried out his rampage. And the toll is quite horrifying. There are at least 15 dead. But of the 24 to 25 people that he managed to injure, nine of them are severely wounded. So this is a toll, sadly -- and police have been fairly clear about -- this that could yet rise. But it would have been a busy campus university in the afternoon when he went on his rampage. We don't know what sort of weapons he used. We do know that he was carrying a permit and had several weapons, firearms at his disposal, but extremely shocking scenes. And we know that the Czech prime minister, interior minister, due there on the scene, with lots of expressions of solidarity, but also a deep shock expressed by other European leaders throughout the course of the day -- Brianna and Boris.",

But Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary, really kind of summed up some of those concerns earlier this month. He said, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat. So I think it's very important to keep in mind that this kind of flurry of assessments is sort of floating around, as we see the Biden administration sort of increasingly make more and more pointed warnings to Israel, both in public and in private, about the need to protect civilians, even as they are supporting Israel's right to try to decapitate Hamas, from a leadership perspective.",

They will say Hamas is defeated, understanding totally that they have really pushed the horizon out in terms of destroying Hamas. And now the focus needs to be on the hostage issue. How do you get the hostages recovered? What cost is there in order to do that? Israel has indicated any terrorist now or anybody that's in jail right now in Israel is a known terrorist, and they're going to have to release them, which is almost a nonstarter. So I think what we're talking about, destruction of Hamas is going to take more time. They will defer to that. Let's get the hostages back.

Ironically, there's got to be an element of optimism coming out of this fight that things can be different. Whatever the solution looks like, whether it's a two-state -- could it be a one-state? Kind of doubt it. But what are the solutions that are possible, so you don't go back to this antebellum? You cannot go back to what 6 October looked like. The Israelis must understand that.
