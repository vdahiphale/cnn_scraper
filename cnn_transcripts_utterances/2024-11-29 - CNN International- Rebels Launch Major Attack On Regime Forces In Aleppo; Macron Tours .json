For the first time since the government recaptured Aleppo in 2016, the Syrian opposition forces are now inside this major city. Look at these pictures, stunning. Rebel fighters taking down Syrian flags at the statue of the Syrian President Assad's brother who died in a car accident in 1994. The opposition forces have launched a major attack earlier this week against Assad's regime. The significance here is it's the first major fighting between the rebels and the regime in four years. They claim to have taken control of dozens of villages on the western side of Aleppo. The regime and Russia are fighting back according to the White Helmets. It's a Syrian humanitarian organization. Russian Syrian airstrikes targeting the rebel held city of Idlib have killed at least four people and left six injured. Ben Wedeman's spent a considerable time on the ground over the years, covering the civil war. All right. Ben, simple. Why now? What happened? What changed?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly what we've seen now is that the Syrian regime is perhaps at its weakest point in years. Keep in mind that Hezbollah intervened in the Syrian civil war and really provided some of the best shock troops, a disciplined well-trained soldiers to fight on the behalf of the Syrian regime against the opposition. But as a result of the war between Hezbollah and Israel that began in October 8th of 2023, Hezbollah essentially pulled almost all of its forces out of Syria sent them to the south of Lebanon and so the Syrian regime has been left exposed and weakened.Now they still do have a presence of Russian forces, ground and air forces in Syria. And of course, there are Iranian advisors. But the Iranians have also been struck multiple times by the Israelis this year in particular. And we understand from the Iranian media that a brigadier general with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was killed in Aleppo earlier. So basically, the main backers of the Syrian regime are in a weak position and, of course, Russia is busy with the war in Ukraine. So certainly it hasn't been this exposed, the regime in years -- Richard.",

Ben Wedeman in Rome.For us tonight with me, Behnam Ben Taleblu, who is giving us some perspective on this senior fellow of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. And an interesting title of your organization when you look at the motley crew that we're talking about here in a sense and because you're talking about this axis of, you know, Iran through to Hezbollah, through to Russia and all of whom are in some shape or form involved in warfare elsewhere, and now we have, I guess, the last thing anybody really wanted was another tinder tinderbox, which is Syria and Aleppo. BEHNAM BEN TALEBLU, SENIOR FELLOW OF THE FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES:  Indeed. And it's a pleasure to be with you. As you mentioned that axis which the Islamic Republic of Iran actually styles itself as such, they call themselves, the axis of resistance with them at the helm and a constellation of proxies that they've either created or co-opted, and the sole state partner in that axis is the Assad regime in Syria, which the -- which the Islamic Republic has bailed out, a spending considerable money, national reputation and treasure, as well as the deep in partnership with Russia. But on the other side of the ledger, as you know of course, are Islamist insurgents, some of which were backed by turkey, that have adhered to this four year, not ceasefire but strategic pause in their campaign against Assad and against the Russians and against the Islamic republics proxy forces in the region. So it really is akin to this statement right now that some are saying, which is a repetition of a line ascribed to either Kissinger or Beijing about the Iran-Iraq war, which is in some way, it's a shame that both can't lose.",

It poses threats to Russian interests in Syria, even though it's changed its views on the Assad regime in Syria. And in fact, it was instrumental in creating military facts on the ground to later on diplomatically push for that pause in fighting four years ago, particularly in the northern part of the country, Turkey itself has had its proxy or partner forces in Syria actually fire on the Islamic Republics proxies. Hezbollah so it is a major military weight in the region, and not just against the Assad regime and its proxies, but against some of the Kurdish groups in the north, where turkey has tried to get them to disconnect cantons for quite some time now.",

And this has helped them to compartmentalize some of the rivalries and ideological discrepancies that exist within each actor.So these are forces that believe they have history on their side.

And when President Macron had announced that it would be done on the very night of the fire, as we watched it burn, Richard, from this very bridge, the flames coming up above that tower, everyone wondering whether the entire thing would collapse. He'd stood in front of it and said, look, we will rebuild Notre Dame and we'll do it in the next five years. It's taken a little bit more than that. A few extra months, but honestly, it was worth the wait.The splendor inside, beyond words. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over):  A new dawn for Notre Dame Cathedral, more than five and a half years after a fire tore through parts of the gothic structure in the heart of Paris, sparkling stonework highlighting the stunning results of the estimated $737 million restoration as it was unveiled to France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. After the 2019 blaze, the president had vowed to rebuild Notre Dame even more beautiful than it was. Entering the cathedral with his wife Brigitte on Friday, it was clear that France had achieved just that. It was at the same time repaired, restored and re-baptized, Macron said. Millions had watched in shock and horror as Notre Dame's 96-meter spire tumbled into the church during the 2019 blaze. Now its renaissance is complete. Touring the epicenter of the blaze, the medieval roof structure known as the forest, Macron saw the beams rebuilt by hand from 1,200 oak trees from across France. Among the highlights of Macron's tour, a mural in the north enclosure of the choir that was badly damaged in the fire, and the Virgin of Paris, a 14th century statue that became a symbol of resistance when it was found standing resolute surrounded by burnt wood and collapsed stone. And the beautiful Saint Marcel's Chapel, one of 29 chapels that have been lovingly restored. Viewing the 12-meter wide grand organ, Macron described it as sublime. More than 1,300 people involved in the restoration were invited inside, as the French president wrapped up his final visit to the site before its formal reopening. You have transformed ashes into art, he told them. The whole planet was upset that day in April, the shock of the reopening will be as big as that of the fire, he said, thanking the crowds.

If you cast your mind back to what it felt like to get inside the cathedral before it is extraordinary. More than 900 years old, the engineering feat of it is beyond reckoning. What they've managed to do as part of its refurbishment is clean it. The walls, the structure is gleaming, the colors are vibrant, the gold is perfect. The structures have been refurbished, the sculptures have been refurbished. And so, you stand even more awestruck than you did five years ago. It takes you back to the splendor of several centuries ago before the soot and the candles and the crowds and the dirt had accumulated and tarnished some of it.

And I think also, it's interesting to note that there's always been a physical link between government and industry here, especially around aviation. This goes back to the early days of the industry.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP JR., HOST, \"TRIGGERED\" PODCAST:  So we're going to break some news here because I literally had this conversation. I was flying back, I was on the plane I guess, with my father, either I think it was coming back from the SpaceX launch with Elon last week and I was sitting there and we were talking about like the podcast world and some of our friends and Rogan and guys like you. But we had the conversation about opening up the press room to a lot of these independent journalists. We've had that conversation like, that's a great idea, Don. I was like, I think we should do this and so that may be in the works. Let's see. That's going to blow up some heads. So, you know, we'll see. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
