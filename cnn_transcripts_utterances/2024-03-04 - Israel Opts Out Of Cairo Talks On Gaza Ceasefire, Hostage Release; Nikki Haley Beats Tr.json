He wants to show other Salvadorans in the U.S. that it is possible to return to their country and open a business, something that just a few years ago, he would not have considered. For years, El Salvador had little control over public safety. Local gangs, known as De Mares (ph), terrorize citizens and extorted businesses.

You could say that they're seeing red amid allegations that Singapore paid for an exclusive deal to secure Taylor Swift and to secure her blockbuster Eras Tour. And today, we heard from Singapore's culture minister, who addressed the Singaporean parliament all the controversy, saying that the grant is not as high as speculated, but we need to give our audiences the backstory here.So last week, a lawmaker in the Philippines called on his country, called on the foreign affairs department to pressure Singapore for an explanation on how they were able to secure Taylor Swift. Joey Salceda, let's bring up the statement for you. He said this quote, if this grant was given, this isn't what good neighbors do. He also goes on to say it was at the expense of neighboring countries which could not attract their own foreign concert goers and whose fans had to go to Singapore, unquote. Now, the allegations were made public earlier by the Thai prime minister, Srettha Thavisin. He spoke at this business forum in Bangkok on February 16th, and he said that Singapore pay Taylor Swift up to $3 million per show, allegedly on condition of a Singapore-only arrangement in Southeast Asia. And he added this, the comment you see on your screen there, quote, if I had known this, I would have brought this shows to Thailand, unquote. Now, Singapore did say it did award Taylor Swift a grant to perform there. And today, fresh comments we heard from its cultural minister, Edwin Tong, who addressed the grant saying this, let's bring up his comments for you, quote, now: There has been some online speculation as to the size of the grant. I can say that it is not accurate and not any where is high as speculated, unquote. On citing confidentiality reasons, he didn't reveal the size or the conditions of the grant. Now, this week, we know that Taylor Swift is playing in Singapore. She's playing six sold out nights to some 300,000 fans in the city state. This is her only stop in Southeast Asia and according to an economist at Maybank, Singapore's, major bank here, 7 in 10 concertgoers are coming in from overseas. They're spending up to $370 million, U.S., in the city-state. So, Singapore is getting this massive economic boost from Swiftonomics which its Asian neighbors know all too well.
