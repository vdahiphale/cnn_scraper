      "sentences": "Let's bring in political reporter at \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\" Patricia Murphy.Patricia, what did you think about this debate and do you think it is going to, at this point in time so close to the election, going to move the needle? PATRICIA MURPHY, POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION\": Yes, I thought this was a really strong debate for Stacey Abrams, specifically because of that hour long debate. More than 10 minutes of that was a back and forth on the abortion issue. That's a lot longer than they've ever debated on that issue before and it's something that really favors Abrams. The 2019 bill that was passed, that's Georgia's six week abortion ban, is broadly unpopular here in this state. So, if Abrams can keep the debate in the areas where she knows that most Georgians agree with her, that's where she wants to be, and that's where that debate was last night. Now, will this move the needle for any Georgians? I think the question is, will it move more Georgians to go vote. I think people's opinions of these candidates are pretty baked in, but I think Abrams, last night, was able to tell anybody who's worried about the abortion issue, that's an issue that - where they agree with her and where they can go make a difference. She said specifically, if I'm the governor, we've got the votes in the house and senate right now to repeal this bill. So, I think that was an important moment for her. I also think though we're hearing a lot from Republicans around this state about her specific comments on law enforcement, about those sheriffs wanting to take black people off of the streets. Republicans are going to hammer her on that. Crime is the number two issue here in the state, all across the state, and not just in metro areas. And so I think that's an area where Republicans feel like they're going to really be able to stop any momentum that she might have gotten last night.",

In May he beat Donald Trump's hand-picked candidate by more than 50 points. We did not see that coming. And certainly we didn't see this coming that Brian Kemp, who really was caricatured throughout 2018 by all Democrats, especially Stacey Abrams, as being sort of a tool of Donald Trump's.Through his own actions and really through no political gain that anybody saw in the moment in 2020, that has really inoculated him against that charge that he's a Trump crony. Obviously, he's not. And we've definitely seen some cross-over appeal, not just from independents but from some Democrats who said, listen, Brian Kemp did the only thing I wanted him to do in 2020, and that was stand up for the state of Georgia. So, we know that that's helped him a lot. Will it help him on Election Day? It's helping him so far. We'll see what happens, though.",

So, I wonder if you're hearing from voters -- do you see any situation where people may actually split their ticket, where they're voting for Kemp as governor but they're voting for the Democrat in the Senate race? MURPHYKemp/Warnock voters who some people say, I don't see how anybody could get there and support these two men at the same time whose politics are so very different. Most of those are Republican voters who tell us they just can't get there with Herschel Walker yet. It's a very easy race to nationalize, but because of the allegations that have come one after another after another on Herschel Walker, it's created just a very chaotic feeling around that campaign. So, for Raphael Warnock, who's an incumbent, those Republicans know what kind of a senator he's going to be. He's run a very issue focused, economic focused campaign so far. They feel better about Raphael Warnock than they do about Herschel Walker. Obviously, Herschel Walker is working really hard to turn out the Republican base to counter that. It's a small number of crossovers, but it's an important number. And if this does go to a runoff, we know it will be because of those GOP voters who just couldn't get there with Herschel Walker yet.",

What they found for these trials that they've been doing from about four companies is that more than - that so far it's showing more than 80 percent effective at preventing infections that require medical attention for the first season after the vaccine. So that's some of the results that they're getting. That is really promising. And when we look at children, they're a little bit further behind, but they're trying two things. They 're trying an antibody shot right after birth. Seventy-five percent effective at preventing RSV infections that would require medical attention. And trials for children are underway.

Unfortunately for Green Bay fans, they don't play this game on paper. Fortunately for Bills fans, I'll say it again, Josh Allen. He can run it. He scrambles 20 yards here. And, John, look at him put this DB on skates. I mean he's 6'5\", 235 pounds. It's simply not fair. And we all know he can throw the ball too. He's second in the league in pass yards behind Tom Brady. He's second in passing touchdowns behind Patrick Mahomes. That one there to Dawson Knox put them on the board first. Next possession, Bills star receiver Stephon Diggs puts a double move on Rasul Douglas and leaves him in the dust. Diggs is now tied for the league lead with seven receiving touchdowns on the year. The Packers did give some hope with Romeo Doubs making a spectacular catch here. Outstanding focus. But, in the end, Buffalo rumbles 27-17. They're atop the AFC at 6-1. Packers falling to 3-5 for the first time since 2006 back when Brett Favre was in his second to last season. John, you have to see this.
