There are few certainties in life, but you do know that when the tulips are out, it must be the Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank. For some three decades, I've been watching those tulips grow, maybe not those, but you get the idea, and each time, it is the similar sort of issues, but this year, optimism of spring is not being felt. There are banking crises, debt concerns, Ukraine, and we will have all of that because you're going to hear from Ukraine's Finance Minister. You're going to hear from the Director-General of the WTO, Ngozi, and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, all of whom will be with me during the course of the hour, as indeed will Julia Chatterley who will be just waiting in the wings. The IMF head Kristalina Georgieva has talked about global growth being weak, and with that weak growth comes greater problems, because if we are going to have higher interest rates for higher inflation for longer periods, then it will increase the debt vulnerabilities of emerging and developing economies. And so the IMF MD was quite clear when she spoke to me, those countries must come forward now, to put things right. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I'm in Place de la Bastille in Central Paris, and you can see that the riot cops are out in full force, and if we turn around, you can see they seem to be maybe detaining someone. There is some sort of action that's going on down here in this alleyway, as well. So you can see that there is still a lot of anger here on the streets. The people have dispersed more, and it sort of a cat and mouse game, if you will, right now, between the police and some of the protesters who keep coming out and chanting against the police. So it certainly seems as though if this was a political win, also for Emmanuel Macron, the people that are out here on the street right now, they don't seem to see it that way, and I think that's one of the things that a lot of the protesters that we saw today have been trying to make clear where I have been saying is that, despite the fact that the Constitutional Council, as you noted, voted to uphold the lifting at the retirement age from 62 to 64, a lot of the people are saying that they are going to continue to fight it. And I think what you're seeing here, right now on the streets of Paris, and what you've seen over the past couple of days, Richard, really shows that to a lot of people right now, especially a lot of the younger people, this is about more than just the reform of the retirement age or the lifting of the retirement age, a lot of people are very angry with the way that Emmanuel Macron has pushed that through and you alluded to some of it going to the special process. They are using executive powers, essentially bypassing a vote in Parliament and while all of that today was seemingly greenlighted by the Constitutional Council, it certainly has cost Emmanuel Macron a great deal politically. And a lot of people here are saying, if we pan around a little more, you can see some of the major police presence that is on the ground here. And a lot of these police officers, as you can see very much in riot gear, have been charging some of the crowds out here. While it may have been a victory legally today for Emmanuel Macron in pushing this agenda through, a lot of people that are saying that the political process here in this country has suffered a great deal because of that, because a lot of people from Emmanuel Macron's government have become deeply unpopular because of it. And also because for instance, politicians like Marine Le Pen, from the far right has already said, look, if you don't want something like this to happen in the future, you have to vote for Marine Le Pen rather than for someone like Emmanuel Macron because he's not going to be up for election anymore because he's already in his second term. So it really is damaging some people say for the political process. Nevertheless, this pension reform is going to come. Of course, Emmanuel Macron himself says it's absolutely necessary, he wants to be -- he will push it through. But if you listen to the unions, you listen to some of the folks here, they certainly are not happy with the outcome that we're seeing today, and you feel that out here on the streets of Paris tonight -- Richard.",

Thank you.Back in the World -- back at the World Trade Organization, the view is that subpar growth with trade for this year will continue. The reasons are somewhat obvious, perhaps geopolitical tensions, the Ukraine war, inflation, and monetary tightening. I talked to the WTO, Director-General Ngozi Okonju-Iweala, and despite all these rather serious headwinds, the DG reminded me trade is resilient. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NGOZI OKONJU-IWEALA, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION:\tIt's a question of is the glass half full or half empty? So it's a bit of both. On the one hand, World Trade has been resilient. In spite of all the ups and downs we've seen world trade has enabled us to move goods from places like the issue of food security, moving food from where it is made to where it is needed. It's allowed countries like Ethiopia who could not get access to grains in Ukraine and Russia to be able to move to the US and Argentina to buy food. So trade has helped build resilience, but on the other hand, it is slowing. Freight growth in trade is slowing.",

So next few, let's say years, so what should we do? We need to do a number -- we need to find ways to increase demand if we want trade to grow.

And well, you've got to have trust in your currency and your economy. OKONJU-IWEALA: Absolutely right, Richard, that's why the dollar keeps dominating. But as I said, there are countries who are coming up among the emerging markets, who are beginning to trade with each other in each other's currencies, but you need to have all those elements.
