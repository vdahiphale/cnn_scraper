Plus, just over four days until the government runs out of money and House Republicans are once again fighting among themselves. We'll go live to Capitol Hill. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt, to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 am here in Washington Monday, November 13. There are 63 days until the Iowa caucuses, just 357 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. The Republican presidential race has one less candidate today. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott suspended his campaign. The announcement late Sunday caught donors and aides by surprise. Just days earlier, Scott and four other Republican candidates had duped it out on the debate stage in Miami. Scott broke the news in a TV interview and left the door open to a future presidential run. Clearly the interviewer was as surprised as the rest of us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT, (R-SC): It will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign. I think the voters who are the most remarkable people on the planet have been really clear that they're telling me, not now, Tim. I don't think they're saying, Trey. No, but I do think they're saying not now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's like it's not exactly that simple, as someone who was on the other side of this two days ago. I think the key is and Tim spoke about this is, what issues do you take him on that you actually care about. If you take him on from a political point of view. If you take him on his good politics, that's when you see the base start to distrust you and actually reflects a kind of almost comes back at you.

People who take this so seriously, and they've been doing it for generations. It's where candidates come and walk through the snow and answer people's questions.

That's what the polls are saying.That's what people like James Carville and other pundits and other pollsters around the country increasingly saying the quiet part out loud. And as I reflect on my decision, it was singular. I'm doing this for a single reason to defeat Donald Trump. That's what I ran in 2018. I woke up the morning after the 2016 election. My daughters were in tears. I promised them I would do something. I flipped a district that had not been won by a Democrat since 1958. You were there, you were there right before the election in 2018. And that's why I did this. I was in the House Chamber on January 6, 2021, when a sitting president inspired an insurrection against his own country. I'm not going to sit down now. The only reason I serve in Congress is because I needed to resist a man who is probably the most dangerous in American history, if not world history. That's why I'm doing this and to sit down or shush up or get back in line. Now, I would be a dereliction of my duty. So, I'm entering the race because someone needed to do it. And now I'm in it to win it. But I asked the president to pass the torch, I asked other candidates names that everybody knows to do it, to jump onto the stage, they wouldn't do so. And as I reflect on the answer to the question, no, I'm going to be a creative to Democrats. That's the whole point. I'm running into primary. I'm not doing what Cornel West is doing. Not doing what Jill Stein is doing, not doing what Joe Manchin might do. I'm doing it the way that we should, which is to enter the Democratic primary. If the president beats me in New Hampshire and Michigan, all around the country, that's good. He looks strong. If I forced the president to have to get out in campaign, basically for the first time, because he didn't have to campaign in 2020. And he appears well, and he debates, and he's strong, makes a good case, that's good for him. I could win this. I intend to win this. Or I could open the door for others who might be better positioned to beat Donald Trump. So, looking at it from any of those four scenarios, this is a creative. Most importantly, if I do not succeed on March 6, I will wrap this up with grace, I will get behind either the president or whoever the eventual nominee is, with the same passion, the same energy, the same incentive, and the same need that I'm giving to my own campaign. Those are my five points. And I don't understand how somebody could look at that and say that would be somehow helping Donald Trump. I'm doing this to ensure he does not become president.",

He is a longshot. But he made clear to me that he's willing to invest, he wouldn't put a limit on the amount, the number of millions he's willing to invest. He can put money behind what he wants. And two, the Biden team moved to the primary and left President Biden off of the ballot in New Hampshire, a state that, you know, has a reputation for being independent, changing political narratives.

I think he's a bright person. I think he believes he's doing this for the right reasons. But, you know, he was born a year after the 1968 election. So, just to clear up some of the historical issues here. It was a different nominating process than you know, there were party bosses and primaries were important, but they weren't determinative. And right up until June, there was a question about who the nominee would be. And so, you know, that is not the way the primary system works today, it was completely revamped in 1972. And so, the kind of McCarthy scenario isn't quite the same. Secondly, no sitting president has ever endured a primary challenge, a serious primary challenge, and won the nomination, I'm sorry, won the general election. They have all won the nomination. And I'm very certain that if President Biden were to get a primary challenger and Phillips is one, you know, others, I think he would be the nominee of the Democratic Party. To me, this is all his decision as to whether to move forward or not. He's clearly made it. And now the question is whether he is going -- now that he's moving forward, whether he's going to move forward full speed ahead and start framing this as a comparative race and not a referendum on him, on himself. In terms of Phillips, I don't think he has -- I think this is -- he was tucked into this to some degree by some consultants and strategists. And that often happens in politics, but it feels more like a grift for them that an opportunity for him to me. The other thing that stood out to me was his comments on inflation and so on. He was with Biden on every one of these major policy decisions. So, he's going to have a hard time critiquing policies that he has wholeheartedly supported. I just think this is an ill-fated venture on his part, well meaning, but ill-fated.",

He's going to need some Democrats to step up and help get it across the finish line. There's a couple of reasons why they might actually go ahead and do that. One time is running out. This deadline is coming up on Friday at midnight. Two, this bill, despite the fact that it is sort of this two-step programming, where some government funding expires in mid-January, other government funding expires in early February. It doesn't include any spending cuts. And that is a big victory for Democrats. That had been a red line for them, something that they had made very clear that if a short-term spending bill included any cuts to government agencies, they weren't going to be backing it. So, despite the fact that this plan is not exactly what Democrats wanted, it does give them some room to keep having negotiations in January and February on a fuller one-year spending plan. Now, there is a little bit of daylight right now between the White House, the White House spokeswoman putting out a statement on Saturday, basically saying that this plan was not something that the White House liked. But on the other hand, like I noted, a lot of Democrats keeping that door open on Capitol Hill, because at the end of the day, Johnson is going to need House Democrats to get it passed out of his chamber. Meanwhile, the first hurdle for Johnson is going to be the fact that he has to get a procedural vote passed first before they go to the underlying bill. That process is going to get started in the House Rules Committee today. Then if that goes through the floor tomorrow, we're going to be watching very closely to see whether or not some of those conservatives who say that they're not supporting the underlying bill, whether they'll help with sort of this procedural step. Traditionally, it's the majority party who's responsible for passing those procedural votes. But if he cannot get the votes with conservatives, we'll be seeing whether or not Democrats stepped in to help or if he tries to pass this with a sub sent -- excuse me, a suspension of the rules, which requires a two thirds majority of the House.

But you also have, like Lauren pointed out, because there aren't spending cuts in this bill, you do have Democrats, a lot of Democrats keeping their powder dry. Dean Phillips, who you just talked to, said he would come back from the campaign trail to vote in favor of this plan later this week. So, we don't know how many of those Democrats would be out there, not wanting to kind of, you know, instigate this fight further and just kind of continue on with what Johnson wants to do.
