      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. And tonight, a major ruling on gun control in theUnited States as a Supreme Court holds a law barring domestic abusers from possessing firearms. We'll dig, of course, into the significance of this ruling. Then from flash flooding in China to deadly heat in Saudi Arabia and raging wildfires in Brazil, we'll have more on the extreme weather that's wreaking havoc right around the globe. Plus, more deadly attacks in Gaza as the U.N. Secretary-General warns of total lawlessness and chaos. That and much more ahead. But we start this hour with a major decision from the U.S. Supreme Court on gun ownership in a nearly unanimous opinion, which is rare for this usually divided court. Justices upheld a federal law that bans domestic abusers from owning a firearm. The ruling was 8 to 1 with only Justice Clarence Thomas dissenting. Chief Justice John Roberts all authored the opinion, writing that the court had no trouble coming to that conclusion. Let's turn to our justice correspondent Jessica Schneider in Washington. So, Jessica, a new unanimous decision. Just talk us through the whole decision and what it means.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this was really giving gun control advocates a somewhat surprising win today, Isa, this was an 8-1opinion. And in this, the justices upheld this gun regulation that prohibits people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns. This was a decision that was written by the Chief Justice John Roberts. And as you mentioned, Justice Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter, and what's key about that is that it was Justice Thomas who wrote the decision two years ago, giving broad power to own guns. That was in a case called Bruen. But today, the Chief Justice wrote it this way, saying our tradition of firearm regulation allows the government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others. So, ruling in favor of this law will be upheld. You know, there has been considerable confusion in the lower courts for the past two years after that Bruen decision in 2022, written by Justice Thomas, and that's because at that time two years ago, and it's been in effect ever since, the court said that in order to have a gun law upheld amid all these challenges, there needed to be some sort of similar precedent that was in place in the late 1700s and 1800s at the time of the nation's founding. So, there's been a lot of confusion at the lower courts and some of these laws have been struck down by the lower courts, including this one. But the Chief Justice today stressed in his opinion that while the Second Amendment right is very broad, it is not unlimited, and it makes sense that guns should be prohibited for people prone to violence. And that's exactly what this federal law does. It keeps guns out of the hands of people that courts have deemed credible threat when it comes to domestic violence. So, a big win for gun control advocates here, but it likely won't be the last time the Supreme Court has to weigh in on a gun law, Isa, because --",

Athena Jones, is in New York for us. And Athena, just give us a sense of how hot it is. ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Isa, well, it is very hot. Any skin that's exposed to the sun, you can feel it, feeling like it's beginning to burn just in a matter of seconds. Right now, the temperature on the Dallas is 93 degrees Fahrenheit, that's about just under 34 degrees Celsius. But with the humidity, it feels several degrees warmer, and that's what we're dealing with. For the 8 million people in New York and the more than 100 million people across a wide swath of the U.S. dealing with these heat alerts, the heat index here in New York is expected to reach or exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, that's 37, 38 Celsius today. Much of this area, the whole city, except for areas close to the water parts of Long Island are under heat advisory. And that, we also know that New York City may hit a June heat wave record seven consecutive days with the temperature at 90 degrees or higher, 90s, about 32 degrees Celsius for those who may be counting, we're in day two of this possible seven-day heat wave. If that happens, that will tie the longest stretch of heat in a decade and the longest ever in June. And the temperature in Central Park today is forecast at 94 degrees, that would be the warmest temperature in the last two years since July of 2022. D.C. is not escaping this either. Washington D.C., they could see a high of 100 degrees on Saturday, that would be the first 100 degree day since 2016. In fact, they're so concerned about the heat affecting even transit in D.C., that the transit officials have put out a warning, restricting the speed of above-ground trains on the rails to 35 miles per hour to try to keep them from overheating. So, bottom line here, this is -- these are dangerous temperatures. You can see here that folks gathered at this splash park, we've seen people coming and going all day to try to cool off in the water. Officials here in D.C. and here in New York, have opened hundreds of cooling centers, are advising folks to take precautions, avoid strenuous activity at the warmest times of day, like a ride around now. In the next several hours, a check on seniors, a check on those who are vulnerable, people who don't have air-conditioning, and make sure you can find your way to a cooling center or a shelter with air conditioning, should you begin to have some of the symptoms of heat stroke and heat exhaustion.

And last year, when there was hope that we'd stop feeding the peak demand for carbon Godzilla, we made it bigger by about 40 billion tons. And the hope is that we'll stop making it bigger sometime this year or next, and then slowly de-carbonize, and then we've got to figure out a way to chop up a big chunks of that carbon Godzilla and bury it back in the slow cycle beneath the earth from where it came from. But in the meantime, the bigger that thing gets, the hotter we get.

I wonder what the response has been thus far then from the White House and others to this latest accusation from Netanyahu that barely a trickle of military -- American military aid is coming to Israel. What are you hearing from your sources? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're hearing -- I mean, I spoke to one person who tracks this very carefully in Congress, who called this a complete fabrication. I mean, just when it looked like this spat was taking a breather, it was reignited today with these new comments from Netanyahu that barely a trickle of aid of weaponry is getting in. And we heard in his video a few days ago in which he talked about how it was inconceivable that the U.S. would withhold these weapons, and then there's this flurry of rejections from senior administration officials, the White House press secretary saying a few days ago that they genuinely don't know what he was talking about. And that frustration in public was echoed behind the scenes. I spoke with a senior Biden administration official who  said that the anger is palpable. So, clearly, this relationship taking a real hit in this moment. But Netanyahu said in an outlet called \"Punchbowl News\" earlier today, that really these shipments of weaponry, of U.S. weapons had really slowed down. I want to read you part of what he said. He's talking about a meeting that he had just a few days ago with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He said that he was told by the Israeli Defense Department officials that barely a trickle is coming in. Blinken is said to have responded, \"Well, everything is in process. We're doing everything to untangle it and to clear up the bottlenecks.\" And then Netanyahu responded, \"well, that's what I expect to happen. Let's make sure that does happen.\" So, demand from the Israeli Prime Minister that the U.S. speed up their weapons deliveries. Again, that congressional source who I spoke with said that there has been no slow-down with the shipments of ammunition, of missiles, of all kinds of weaponry have continued to pace, of course, with much criticism for the United States. And for those who are saying that this is being directed at a domestic Israeli audience, I would just note again, he said this in a very Washington outlet called \"Punchbowl\". This is very much directed to the Washington media and political ecosystem, if you will. One more thing, Isa, we know that Prime Minister Netanyahu is coming here to Washington in just a few weeks, he's due to speak with Congress. This has been a very controversial invitation. It was done at the behest of the speaker of the House. We're hearing an increasing number of Democrats who don't want to attend this. It is still unclear, I should note, whether or not Netanyahu will be meeting with President Biden. And of course, it would be extremely remarkable if the Israeli Prime Minister were to come here and not meet with Biden, we don't have much clarity on that for the time-being, Isa.",

And it really is about reclaiming, I would say, the sensible meaning of the Second Amendment, because this case is all about the importance of regulation and why reasonable regulations, in particular, are OK under our Constitution and not banned. For a long time, the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment really wasn't about individual gun ownership at all. In fact, for the vast majority of our history, and then in 2008, in the Heller case, Justice Scalia wrote an opinion saying it is an individual right, despite what the text says, I think, contrary to that. But he did say that. And then the Supreme Court, with Thomas writing an opinion, upped the level of protection in a case about New York's gun laws, and now they've backed off, thankfully.",

And eight justices saw that and said, no, we're not going to do things the way Thomas recommends in this dissent. For him, he really wants an exact match, that you'd have to go back to the 18th century and find a gun law that was about domestic violence in the way that the one at issue here was in the case today. And the justices rightly are saying, no, we're going to look for principles of regulation that might be similar. And you can find those throughout American history because, after all, the preamble of the Constitution talks about the need for We, The People, to ensure domestic tranquility. And that's exactly what Americans have done through a good amount of our history. And so looking for the principle, that's the idea here as opposed to Thomas's way of looking for this exact match.",

Police are investigating the alleged rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl. The prosecutor says three boys, aged 12 and 13, have been taken into custody. Politicians from all sides have weighed in with President Emmanuel Macron condemning a, \"Scourge of anti-Semitism.\" While France's upcoming election could have massive implications for the country's role in the European Union as well as in NATO, CNN's Melissa Bell examines the role anti-Semitism is now playing as a key election issue. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's an alleged gang rape that has sent shockwaves through France. That of a 12-year-old Jewish girl who was heading home in a Paris suburb on Saturday afternoon when three boys, all 12 and 13 years old, approached her and forced her into this abandoned building, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, citing police sources. As two of the three boys allegedly raped her, anti-Semitic insults were also allegedly used, including calling her, a \"Dirty Jew.\" The boys have been taken into custody, according to the local prosecutor. It comes at a critical time in France with an election called to test the rise of the right, but that has put the future of the government itself on the line, an attack that has sparked intense political debate on anti- Semitism further heightened by Israel's war in Gaza. President Emmanuel Macron has condemned a scourge of anti-Semitism that he says is festering in French schools. According to France's interior ministry, anti-Semitic incidents in France rose 284 percent from 2022 to 2023. But this attack has brought demonstrators to Paris's city hall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): As is often the case, anti-Semitism is a barometer of a country's democratic health. And right now, it says something about French society. BELL (voice-over): More protests are planned this weekend as anti-Semitism now takes center stage as a political issue just days before the country heads to the polls. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.

It was essential for them to win. They're now right back in the thick of things. They have all the chances to go to the next round and go very far in this tournament.
