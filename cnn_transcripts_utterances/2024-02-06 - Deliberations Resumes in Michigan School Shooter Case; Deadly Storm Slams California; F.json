Jury deliberations are expected to soon resume in Jennifer Crumbley's manslaughter trial.In 2021, Crumbley's son, Ethan, shot and killed four students at Oxford High School. And now, in this first-of-a-kind trial, the jurors must reach a unanimous verdict on whether or not she, his mother, can be held responsible for that mass shooting as well as he has been. Joining us now, CNN's Jean Casarez is in Pontiac, Michigan, and with me right here in New York, in the studio, defense attorney Misty Marris. We're going to talk to both of you. I'm going to start with you, Jean. Jean, what can you tell us about what the jury - the jury has only deliberated for six hours, but six hours is something. And now they're going into day two. What do you know?",

So, this jury has started their second day of deliberations here at the Oakland County Circuit Courthouse.And the questions yesterday, there were two of them, and they were really smart questions, Sara. I mean they -- they were going to the heart of the material, and they really wanted to understand the legalese of all of this. You know, involuntary manslaughter is the only charge. There are no lesser includeds at all. But the prosecution has two theories of involuntary manslaughter. And jurors don't have to be unanimous on what theory they believe beyond a reasonable doubt warrants conviction, they just have to be unanimous that they all believe there should be a conviction here. Well, the first theory is gross negligence. And the first element of gross negligence is that Jennifer Crumbley knew the danger that her son presented to another and did nothing about it. The second theory is a legal duty. And this comes from the state of Michigan, because in Michigan a parent has the legal duty to not allow their son, their child, minor child, to harm anyone. And if they are aware of any potentiality there, they must do something about it to stop it. Now, both these theories have one thing in common, foreseeability. That the parent needs to be able to see, foreseeability, that their minor child could cause injury to another.",

And is Jennifer Crumbley responsible? Did she fail to take action to allow this gun and these bullets to be accessible to her son? So, the question -- very astute question, Sara. The jury asked, can we draw an inference from evidence that was not shown in the trial? For instance, how did the shooter actually get access to the gun? There was no testimony relating to that, as we know. The shooter did not testify. And so they asked if they could draw an inference based on that area. So that tells me they are really analyzing that aspect, which we saw so much from the defense relating to Jennifer Crumbley's responsibilities with the gun versus her husband's.",
