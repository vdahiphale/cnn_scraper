One of the most important voices in the soccer community falls silent. Remembering beloved sports journalist Grant Wahl who died suddenly at the World Cup at just 49 years old. Plus, Dr. Anthony Fauci warns of mandate fatigue, but a rising number of cases of respiratory illnesses is leading to a new debate. Is it time to mask up again? And we're going to ask someone who was recently released in a prisoner swap. What the journey ahead may look like for Brittney Griner now that she's been free from Russia? You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. Well, he was a beloved star in the world of soccer without scoring a single goal. Tonight, the sports world is mourning American soccer journalist, Grant Wahl. He was a preeminent writer respected around the world and was only 49 years old. Wahl collapsed in the press area during Friday's Argentina-Netherlands quarterfinals match. And today in his place, a memorial of white flowers. But he was much more than a writer. He was a tireless ambassador for the sport, a writer who never ignored inconvenient truths about the sport he loved. CNN's Don Riddell has the latest from Qatar. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ANCHOR: At the most extraordinary World Cup game, the most devastating news. As the quarterfinal match between Argentina and the Netherlands went into extra time, American soccer writer and broadcaster, Grant Wahl, died after collapsing suddenly in the stadium. Just days before, the 49-year-old had spoken in his podcast about feeling unwell during the tournament. My body, I think, told me, even after the U.S. went out, dude, you are not sleeping enough. And it rebelled on me. And so I've had a case of bronchitis this week. I've been to the medical clinic at the media center twice now. After collapsing on Friday night, on-site medics reportedly spent 20 to 25 minutes treating Wahl. News of his sudden death quickly sent shockwaves throughout the football community.",

But we don't know whether these two things are necessarily related. People get viral illnesses all the time. This is the season when many people have colds or the flu or other things. And especially for somebody who's generally young, and what it sounds like pretty healthy. It's extremely rare for them to die, much less to die suddenly from that viral illness. And also for people who do die, it ends up -- it's not usually sudden. In fact, there is gradual deterioration, somebody may be getting short of breath, they're in the hospital, et cetera. So that sudden death, it could be related. I mean, there is -- there are possibilities, maybe the viral illness, and we don't know this, but maybe the viral illness somehow affected the heart in some way. But there are other possibilities, too, including whether the sudden death could be caused by a sudden heart rhythm problem or a heart attack or a blood clot. Again, we just don't know.

But what we do know is what Grant had talked about, he had talked about not feeling well in a podcast. He said that there was a lot of coughing especially among journalists that sometimes it sounded like, quote, a death rattle.And I'm wondering, you know, we just heard from that podcast where he was saying, you know, look like, I'm not surprised he would push through this, even though he wasn't feeling well. This is the World -- you know, the World Cup is like, you know, the election, basically, or the Super Bowl. I mean, it's such a big deal.

And so I don't want to, in any way, imply that he could have done something differently that might have prevented this outcome.I'd say more generally about viral illnesses and fatigue. It really depends on how someone it best copes with that with the illness themselves. Because people cope with illnesses differently. Some people rest is really good for them, and they need to take time off from work, they need to make sure that they stay in bed. And that's what will help them. Other people, myself included, want to exercise even as we have viral illnesses, because that's also what keeps us energized and that helps us to recuperate as well. So I would say in general, listen to your body, know yourself the best. If you think you need to rest, get that rest. Many people don't, will push through either because of work or personal life or preference. And that alone is not -- is probably not going to cause somebody to deteriorate. But that -- all that said, be careful, be on the lookout in particular for worrisome symptoms, for example, worsening shortness of breath or chest pain or pressure.

But right now, as we just were talking about the flu, RSV, and COVID- 19 are spiking across the United States at the same time.

But also people come in for car accidents, heart attacks, and so forth. And so that is a problem.I'm also concerned for people who are particularly vulnerable. So newborns, older individuals, people who are immunocompromised, they are at much higher risk for severe outcomes. And if there's a lot of virus around them, that's very concerning to them. In terms of what people should do, certainly, if you are in this high risk category, you need to make sure that you are -- that you have received your flu vaccine, if you're eligible that you have gotten the COVID booster if you're eligible. You also should consider in masking, especially wearing a high-quality, well-fitting N-95 or equivalent masks in all indoor crowded settings. If you are one of these people who are most vulnerable. For everybody else, you should also think about masking in high-risk settings. So maybe you're not masking everywhere, but bring the mask with you and put it on when you're boarding your flight. And it's a very crowded space with lots of people packed together. Or maybe you're not wearing a mask during a conference or in a boardroom presentation. But you could still be wearing a mask in a crowded elevator or a train station. Those types of things can help to reduce risk for us, but especially for people around us who are in those extremely vulnerable categories. So there is a lot of talk about re-masking. Dr. Anthony Fauci warns of mandate fatigue. Here's what he said, \"Obviously, you would like people to use good judgment to protect themselves and their family and that community without necessarily having to mandate anything. Because you know there is a fatigue about being mandated. People don't like to be told what to do.\" So what do you think, Doctor Wen? Do you think the masks mandates of old can realistically be brought back?",

And there has to be an extremely high bar, really a five-alarm fire. And if we are bringing them back without that kind of emergency being present, then what happens when that actually happens? As in what happens if there's a new variant or new virus that's extremely deadly that we don't have vaccines or treatments for? And we really want people to mask up at that point. They're not going to listen to us then. Right now, we actually have other tools our -- at our disposal. We have vaccines for COVID and for the flu. We have treatments that are highly effective and safe. And we have other things including asking people who are highly vulnerable to make sure that they protect themselves through N-95, K-95 et cetera, well-fitting masks. And so I really would recommend that people mask in high-risk settings for vulnerable individuals to take additional precautions. But I think that the bar, especially for government mandates needs to be really high.",

      "sentences": "Well tonight, the future is now.A new artificial intelligence chatbot, Chat GPT has fascinated and terrified the internet with its incredible writing ability. From essays to news articles, even complex computer codes, this thing is scary good. So as a test, the show asked it to write a poem about this show and see what it would come up with. Well, an instant later, and I mean an instant, this is what I came up with. Check it out. \"In the CNN NEWSROOM with Pamela Brown, a steady voice that carries through the town. She brings us news from near and far informing us with her journalistic charm.\" I don't know about how true that is about the journalistic charm, but that's pretty impressive that it just shot that out so quickly. So the question is, are we ready for this brave new world? Let's discuss with author and futurist, Ian Khan. All right, so let's dive right into it, both the promises and perils of this technology. I want to start though with the good here. Make the case for how chatbots like Chat GPT can improve our lives.",

But there is also concern about, you know, it could become a tool for misinformation, that it could be used to write college essays, will replace programmers, teachers, dare I say, TV hosts. How serious do you take these concerns?",

But we need controls and those controls have to come from universities, institutions, organizations, because it's just the machine at the end of the day. It's just technology that's finding these keywords out of billions and billions of keywords, and putting them together based on some logic. It has no intelligence of its own. It's not a sentient AI. It's just an artificial machine that's just putting one and one together without knowing what it means.",

You can have AI create artistic portraits of you by giving it several selfies. So I downloaded it today. Let's put ours on the screen. You've also done it. Pretty cool. Although, I will say yours looks a lot more like you than I think mine looks like me. But the bottom line here, that debate aside, unless you want to weigh in, there are problems, right? There is privacy concerns about giving apps this kind of information, and there are also concerns by artists who are saying that technology is profiting from learning their style and copying it. What's your take?",

This is going to pave way for the creator economy because guess what? People and their creativity is still needed and computers and technology cannot do it. I really like what Lensa does. It does a great job of taking these millions of designs and taking your and my picture and people's pictures and putting out portraits of them. Amazing. But this is this is very small in terms of automation of technology and putting one and one together. I think it's going to create more opportunities for us to think -- you know, it cannot replace a Picasso. A Picasso will always be a Picasso and Lensa AI art will always be Lensa AI art.

But anyway, Ian Khan, thank you for that conversation. We appreciate it. And still ahead, some Moroccan magic and World Cup history. What the African nation pulled off that no other team on the continent has before in the global soccer tournament.
