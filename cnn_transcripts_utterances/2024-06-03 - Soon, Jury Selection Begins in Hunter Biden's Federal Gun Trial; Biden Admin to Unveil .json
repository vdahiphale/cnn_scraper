Very shortly, within walking distance of his father's campaign office, Hunter Biden will be the first child of a sitting president to face such criminal proceedings. The 54-year-old is charged with illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs. Prosecutors say he bought the gun in October of 2018. Biden had the gun for about 11 days.Overnight, the judge overseeing the trial dealt a blow to his defense blocking one witness and a key piece of evidence that lawyers had hoped to use all just hours before jury selection is supposed to begin. CNN's Marshall Cohen is standing by live outside the court this morning. Marshall, walk us through what we're going to see.",

Biden will make history when he walks into the federal courthouse right behind me in Wilmington, Delaware, he will become the first son of the sitting president of this country to go on trial. It's never happened before.He is facing three felony charges that were filed by Special Counsel David Weiss, who has been investigating him since 2018, two counts of lying on federal gun forms and one count of unlawful possession of a gun. John, it's against federal law for a drug user or drug addicts to buy a gun, and that's what the prosecutors say Hunter Biden did here. He's been very open about his lifelong struggles with addiction, but the prosecutors are going to try to convict him by demonstrating that he was using drugs when he bought that gun at a Wilmington gun shop. If he's convicted of all these charges, he could face prison time up to 25 years. But, of course, his father does have the power of the pardon. But that's not where we're at today. Today is just the start of this process. Jury selection is happening, starting at 8:30, John. There are 250 Delaware residents that have been summoned to this courthouse. They will be questioned about their political activities. They will be asked if they can be fair and impartial. And eventually, they need a jury of 12 to hear this case.",

She did deal a blow to the president's son and his chances of beating this case. She decided to exclude a key witness that they wanted to call an expert on addiction that could have poked some holes in the prosecutor's theories about his state of mind, and she also won't let Hunter Biden's team introduce a key piece of evidence that they thought could tarnish the credibility of some of those employees at the gun store that sold him the revolver.So, it got a little bit tougher for the president's son last night, and the proceedings kick off here at 8:30.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, sources have told us that President Biden could announce this new border executive action as soon as tomorrow. In fact, some sources have told us the White House has started reaching out to mayors from cities along the southern border to potentially join Biden as he makes this announcement.Now, the president has been weighing potential executive action relating to the border since those bipartisan border talks failed a bit earlier this year. And in recent weeks, administration officials have been working on an executive action that would dramatically limit the way that asylum seekers would seek asylum at the U.S. southern border. Now, this policy could be reminiscent of a controversial measure former President Donald Trump used while he was in office, using a preexisting authority to try to clamp down on border crossings. White House officials have yet to confirm that the president will make this announcement this week. A White House spokesperson simply saying, quote, as we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system. But it all comes as the president and his team are trying to confront a politically vexing issue for the president ahead of November's election, and, importantly, before that first debate with Trump here on CNN, a bit later this month. Americans have increasingly shown concern about immigration issues at a time when the former president has really tried to seized on the border as a key issue in his campaign. Now, the White House and the president have also taken a more aggressive approach when it comes to dealing with the U.S. southern border, especially after Republicans tanked those bipartisan border talks at the urging of former President Donald Trump. Biden has really said that they will try to hold Republicans accountable for the fact that they did not get on board with this bipartisan plan. Now, it is worth noting that arrest at the U.S. southern border have been down this year in part due to Mexico's stepping up their own enforcement along the U.S. southern border. But administration officials are also well aware that there could be a surge in border crossing as the summer months continue. Now, as you noted, sources had previously told us that the White House had been waiting to roll out this executive action until Mexico's presidential election yesterday. That ended with the election of President-Elect Claudia Sheinbaum. Of course, she would be a key partner to any White House when it comes to trying to address these border issues. We will see whether President Biden has any plans to call her a bit later in today. But we're still waiting to hear what exactly the details of President Biden's border plan will be at a time when he's trying to tackle this issue head on heading into November's election.",

If on this case in New York, many legal experts believe that since he's a first time criminal offender, that wouldn't be the case and also in terms of some of the charges that he's facing. But what he clearly is trying to do is to build the political pressure. The Trump campaign believes that it has benefited politically from this rallying around of Republicans, a massive fundraising spurt since the verdict came down.I think what you also have to note is that these comments do take on a darker tone than some of Trump's previous commentary on issues like this just because of what we saw that happened after the January 6th mob attack on Congress by some of his supporters. So, he knows what he's doing and it's pretty clear that the message he's trying to get across, whether it will be successful, I think that's another question.",

So, that shows the power the Morena Party has gained in this past six years. Most of the voters we talked to during the election day, and even prior to that, they told us that they recognize the significance of having a woman, but that was not the main issue that drove him to the polls. They told us what they really want to see is how she is going to govern. They hope that she can step away from under the shadow of Lopez Obrador, who has been a friend and mentor. He was the one who named her a secretary of the environment in the year 2000, when he was the mayor of Mexico City. And then six years ago, when he won the presidency, she was elected mayor of Mexico City, and they have been close allies ever since. She has pledged to continue the policies of President Lopez Obrador, but that is yet to be seen how she's going to implement, especially the relationship with the United States and neighbor and main partner of Mexico. So, this is something that voters are going to be watching closely once she takes over in October. But also their main concern is security. So, they are going to want to see some changes after we had such a violent electoral process. So, this is the background of the woman who will lead Mexico for the next six years.
