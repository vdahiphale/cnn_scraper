And I can tell you, these people probably rushed home so that they can be in their warm beds and so that they can start off the New Year right with sleep and with their families.And speaking of food, Kristie, I actually have one more surprise for you here tonight. You might remember this from last year. I have here Osechi Ryori made by our fantastic, talented producer Yumi. And in here are some of my favorite New Year's cuisine. Actually, I just want to show you this. This is shrimp here. And this shrimp is supposed to represent longevity because, I hope you can see the symbolism, it kind of looks like an old person with a rounded back, and this is just one of my favorite foods to eat on New Year's Day. There's just so much in here. We also have the colors of the Japanese flag. I know this is pink, but this is supposed to be red, white and red to represent the Japanese flag and also to represent prosperity and purity. And, Kristie, again, this is just some of the amazing food that we get to eat on New Year's Day. And I just cannot wait to dig in. Kristie.",

But the magic happens when the fireworks go off because the pyrotechnic displays here, Brianna, are massive. We know that this show is going to be about 12 minutes long. It's going to span 4,000 feet across the Victoria Harbour. The pyrotechnics will be fired from, what, five barges, 16 pontoons. You're going to see fireworks being fired off of the iconic skyscrapers behind me. It's going to be called the Symphony of Happiness. And there's one effect that I'm really looking forward to seeing, and it's going to be rainbow smoke with the glittering silver fireworks mingling with it. So, one to watch, Brianna.",
