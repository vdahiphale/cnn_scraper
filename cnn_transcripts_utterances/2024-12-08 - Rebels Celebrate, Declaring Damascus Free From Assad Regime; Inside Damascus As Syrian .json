Rebels have taken hold of the capital of Damascus, one of several major cities they took control of in a lightning advance. Bashar al-Assad fled the presidential palace. That residence a symbol of his ruthless reign has now been burned and ransacked. At this moment, Assad and his family are in Moscow after being granted asylum in Russia. That's according to a source. And the entire world now waits to see what happens next in Syria. CNN's chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has more on Assad's fall from power. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Decades of savage, horrific rule, over in a matter of days. Thousands of Syrians celebrated in the streets of Damascus after rebel forces advanced on the capital early Sunday morning, declaring it free of President Bashar al-Assad.",

Russia undermining its long- term ally by announcing he had fled the country and was granted asylum in Moscow.Hours of jubilation followed as civilians and rebels entered the presidential palace, looting furniture with children running about, a sign of how every day the suffering he inflicted had been. Some even touring the presidential kitchen in a land where starvation was once a weapon. What would you like, one woman says while filming. Our people are hungry. Take whatever you want. Traces of Assad were being dismantled across the country. This statue of the man who had children gassed in a gutter basement 11 years ago toppled in the eastern city of Tartus. His image torn down from buildings in Damascus and on top of the gates of Homs city center. Symbolically where protesters tore apart his image more than a decade ago in a scene that defined the civil war's early days. Inspired by the seismic shifts of the Arab Spring, Syrians rose up in 2011 demanding democracy but were met with live rounds and eventually jet planes, chemical weapons and mass executions and torture. Hundreds of thousands were killed, millions displaced. As rebels swept through the capital on Sunday, images surfaced of prisoners being released from the notorious Sadnaya prison from which so few emerged. Dubbed the human slaughterhouse by Amnesty International. The militant figure leading this rebel offensive is Abu Mohammed al- Jolani, seen here prostrating in prayer upon entering Damascus. Once affiliated with al Qaeda, Jolani has been suggesting he has matured from his extremist roots, though there are deep concerns about what kind of new Syria may now emerge. At one of the oldest mosques in the world in Damascus, he was received with applause and jeers as he held total victory. ABU MOHAMMED AL-JOLANI, SYRIAN REBEL LEADER (through translator): This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation. This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region.",

And Wolf, my cameraman, Scott McWhinnie, just found this on the ground, literally, as we were listening to that clip. This is the old flag of the Syrian regime, which has two green stars. The rebels' flag has three green stars, but this one has now been -- literally we just found it on the floor. I guess a real moment where you see how much things have changed just in the past 24 hours. In terms of the security situation on the streets, I would just add, we anticipated that we might see quite a lot of checkpoints as we came into the city. We didn't. We did see a group of men. They did not appear to be armed, but they asked us what we were doing, where we were going, and now that we are sort of ensconced in our place where we're staying for the night, we have seen a couple of patrols. I saw two men armed and I went up to them and asked them where they were from. They told me they were from Idlib, which is in the northern part of the country. And we saw a man on the street go up and wanted to pose for a photograph of them, which I think sort of speaks to the moment. There is obviously jubilation, elation, but also this sense of you can't compute. It was so fast, so breathtaking. It's astonishing. And I think people are taking some time to try to process the magnitude. Keep in mind, Wolf, we're talking about 53 years of Assad rule, 53 years of a brutal police state. And I can't tell you how many Syrians have said to me, Wolf, that, you know, we understand that there are concerns about the rebels and the makeup of the rebels and the fact that some of them are Islamists, and some of them are even jihadists, or have been affiliated with al Qaeda or a proscribed organizations. But, let us have this moment. Let us celebrate the fact that this brutal dictator who has ruthlessly killed hundreds of thousands of people, who has gassed children with lethal nerve agents, who has locked people in prisons and tortured and beaten them to death, that he is finally gone, and that whatever may come and whatever the anxiety, this is a new chapter for Syria -- Wolf.

Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is a jihadist. He is someone who is affiliated with al Qaeda. He's been telegraphing to the world that he and the group he leads, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has changed. But how much have they changed? The reports coming out of Idlib which they have administered for the better part of the last decade are not necessarily encouraging. But of course, Syrians want this moment to celebrate. I know Syrian refugees who are holding their breath in Washington, D.C. at this moment, hoping that everything turns out well. But they understand how difficult this is going to be. And, of course, for the United States, Iraq casts a very, very long shadow. This was a regime change by Syrians themselves. But those scenes of looting in Damascus may not -- are not a harbinger of a constructive future if they're allowed to continue, and how HTS handles this, and Abu Mohammed al-Jolani handles this power vacuum will tell us much about what the trajectory of post- Assad Syria will be.",

Let's start first, though, with these US airstrikes against ISIS in Syria today, a lot of them, about 75. Give us a sense of where those targets were and the types of weapons being used here. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Absolutely, Jessica, it's great to be with you again. Basically, what we're talking about is this area right in here. This is part of the Eastern Syrian Desert and its fairly near the Al-Tanf US Base. And the basic idea is that the targets were ISIS areas that we had probably a meeting of ISIS leaders and where we had the intelligence indicators that they were doing this. They also were looking at the possible melding of various ISIS groups to then take advantage of the situation in the rest of Syria where the rebels were going and the types of weapons that we use, the weapons platforms included the A-10, the B-52 and the F-15 all of these highly capable aircraft.

This will position those Israeli troops between these newly victorious rebel forces and the communities inside the Israeli held Golan Heights. Now, this buffer zone is Syrian territory, but the Israeli prime minister said that he ordered troops into that zone after the Syrian troops on the other end of that buffer zone abandoned their positions.

The Israeli prime minister in that video message also sought to take some credit for what has happened inside of Syria, saying that the fall of the Assad regime here by these rebels is a \"direct result\" of Israel's actions against Iran and its proxy in the region, Hezbollah. Both Hezbollah and Iran have, of course propped up the Assad regime throughout the course of this 13-year Civil War. And Israel, we know, has significantly weakened Hezbollah's capabilities, both in Lebanon but also inside of Syria. As for the Iranian regime, perhaps distracted by the other events in the region, distracted by Israel itself, and of course we know that the fall of the Assad regime will amount to a significant blow for Iran as well. And so, that's where the question leads, in terms of the future of Syria and the future of its relations with Israel. Netanyahu said that he is extending a, quote, hand of peace to all Syrians across the border and that he would like to establish, \"neighborly and peaceful relations.\" The real question, though, is going to be what kind of government actually emerges inside of Syria? And will it be one that will preserve what has effectively been a 50-year detente between Israel and Syria or will it take another tack. And critically, for Israeli officials, will be the question of what happens to the weapons that have flowed from Iran via Syria into Hezbollah's hands inside of Lebanon. There had been some hope inside the Israeli government that perhaps the Assad regime would cut off that flow of weapons, secure its border with Lebanon. That, of course is off the table now. And so the question is, will these rebel forces now secure the border with Lebanon and prevent Iranian weapons from getting to Hezbollah via Syria. Jeremy Diamond, CNN Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
