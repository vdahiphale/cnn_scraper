      "sentences": "Well, Boris, the last two hours has been relatively silent. The jury's behind closed doors deliberating. Donald Trump and his team are in their room. Prosecutors are in their room.And so it's just the media that's sitting in the courtroom waiting for the buzzer to go off to see what the next development in this trial will be. But they have been working behind closed doors for two hours. One of the new things that they asked the judge for today were headphones, an indication that they wanted to plug into the laptop and listen to some of the evidence. We have heard actually a lot of evidence that has been audio or video. And that includes Donald Trump's campaign speeches, Michael Cohen's podcasts, and then recorded phone conversations between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson -- that was Stormy Daniels' attorney -- and then the recorded phone -- excuse me -- the recorded in-person conversation between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. We don't know which one of these or how many of them they're going to be listening to, but it was something that they asked for. The judge offered them speakers or headphones, speakers so that multiple individuals could listen at once. And the jury foreman said they would take both of those options. So that was the last thing we heard from them before they went back behind those closed doors to continue their deliberations. We're at a lunch break right now. They can deliberate if they want to, but they don't need to. And they all have to be together in order to deliberate. So this is still kind of a moving target. But we will not hear any notes or any developments in this next hour, because we are at a lunch break. So, the next thing that we will do when we get back inside at 2:00 is then wait to see if there's additional notes today or if there aren't. It remains to be seen. Today, in the courtroom it was just a smaller group accompanying former President Donald Trump. His son Eric Trump was with him, as well as one of his friends, Steve Witkoff, a real estate executive. And I saw Trump just before he was walking out of the courtroom to go into their room where they are waiting this out. He flashed a thumbs up to Witkoff, who walked out with him, so a smaller entourage today for the former president as he's waiting in the courthouse to see what the next steps in these deliberations will bring -- Boris, Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna.So they got some more information today about the weeds of the actual facts, but they also asked the judge for a little more information about the charges that they ultimately will be delivering a verdict on. Let's walk through those charges, because they're more complicated here than in the normal case. Now, step one, the base charge is falsifying business records, which is basically what it sounds like. They took these payments, which were really meant to reimburse Stormy Daniels as hush money, and they tried to call them, label them as legal fees. That's the prosecution's theory. But then part two that the prosecution has to prove is they did that in order to commit or further another crime. The prosecution's theory is that that another crime is a violation of New York state campaign law. And that law says that you cannot try to influence an election by unlawful means. Now, this is the part where it gets really complicated. Prosecutors have given the jury a menu of three possible -- quote -- \"unlawful means,\" one of them, federal campaign laws. Another one is falsification of still other business records. And the last one is tax fraud. But, realistically, the prosecution spent next to no time on these two theories. It's really, let's be realistic here, about federal campaign finance laws. And just to remind people of the core transactions here that form the basis of the charges, about a week before the 2016 election, Michael Cohen paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money. He essentially paid out of his own pocket. He took a loan off of his own mortgage, paid her. And then, over the year that followed, Donald Trump and the Trump Organization, they reimbursed Michael Cohen a total of $420,000. And, again, the theory is, this here was really a campaign contribution designed to silence Stormy Daniels. And, this here, they tried to make it look like legal fees or retainers. That's the falsification with an intent to influence the election. So, a couple of things. The jury is back there now. The six alternates, they have been split off. They're still technically on duty, but they're not in the deliberation room. These 12 people are in the room by themselves, no judge. The judge instructed them, but he's not in there with them, no court reporter, no nothing. They have to reach unanimity to render a verdict. It has to be 12-0 guilty or 12-0 not guilty. Anything else will be a hung jury.",

This morning, they got almost half of the entire legal instruction read back to them. That happens all the time. Jurors will say, can you give us the part about reasonable doubt again? Can you give us the part about witness credibility? So the judge spent about 45 minutes this morning giving them -- repeating the legal instructions. You can see the jury ask for specific evidence or testimony. Now, here, they're not going to ask for evidence, because they have it. That's the laptop that they have, but they certainly can and have asked for testimony. This morning, they wanted more testimony relating to David Pecker and Michael Cohen. We could see more notes along that. Miscellaneous notes, Kara was just talking about, I find this interesting. They wanted headphones and speakers. I mean, look, it tells me they're listening to the tapes. There's a handful of tapes in this case, so you can deduce that much. And then, finally, they will presumably at some point tell us, we have a verdict. And if they do that, the judge's instructions to them are, send me a note saying we have a verdict, but don't tell me what it is. They like the whole drama of it. If there's a verdict, everyone will rush into place. We will rush into place, and then it will be formally read. But another -- the other thing I just want to highlight, we're not at this point, we have not seen this, but, sometimes, juries in these miscellaneous categories will send a note -- I have had this happen to me -- it's not great, as a prosecutor -- saying, we're stuck. What do we do? We can't get to unanimity. At that point, the judge will give them what we call an Allen charge, an extra charge basically saying, if humanly possible, you need to get back there and try to reach a unanimous verdict. So we have already started to see some of these come through. We don't know how often they could come through. We could get four more today. We could get no more today. We got to stay flexible.",

And then you get this ambiguous and complex law that each side is trying to get the jurors to have different interpretations of. So it is a lot. And I think one of the instructions that struck me was, you're allowed to take notes, but then, when you bring them back in the deliberation, you're not allowed to rely on somebody else's notes. So, when that happens, they were said that you have to attach significance to the actual testimony or the evidence. So that might be why. Some of the jurors might be thinking about their notes, but then a juror who maybe didn't take those notes is saying, well, I had a different recollection. And maybe that's why they're asking for more information, for more testimony. But there's just so much out there. It's so much out there for one person. And then you think about it. You have to get 12 people to agree on it. And it's hard to get 12 people to agree on anything.

But it's the commonsense aspect that you just referenced, that, if some jurors have a really strong feeling based on evidence, and they think that they can get to this point, that they can connect the dots, they want to know if that will fit within the definition of circumstantial evidence.

Of course, this week outside of the courthouse, we saw Robert De Niro. There's also been a huge fund- raising event announced with Julia Roberts and George Clooney. So that's pretty much as A-list as you can get. But in this polarized, politicized world, particularly with how controversial the war in the Middle East has gotten, I hear from a number of celebrity publicists, agents, Hollywood strategists that celebrities are very wary to speak out. I worked on this reporting with our colleague Priscilla Alvarez, and we spoke to a dozen people who are working with celebrities and working with the Biden campaign. And they all say that there is absolutely hesitation out there, which is different than in years past. One celebrity publicist tells me -- quote -- \"It's a different world than it was 10 years ago. You can't make anyone happy. You can't win.\" Another publicist tells me: \"It'll be the usual suspects, but, four years ago, who were you if you weren't speaking out?\" The war has become so polarizing that it's gotten to the point that there's just no winning, particularly in this social media world. Take Mariah Carey, for example. Back in December, around the holidays -- she's the queen of Christmas, right? And she went to the Oval Office to spread some holiday cheer. It was an innocuous post. She said nothing about Israel or Gaza, and yet her comments were flooded with people accusing her of genocide just for standing next to the president. So that is the point where we have gotten for celebrities. And a lot of them just say, it's not worth the risk. Now, speaking of the war, Gen Z is a big concern this year with getting out to the polls. We saw the campus protests last month. And the war has really become a huge issue for Gen Z. And the campaign is hoping that a lot of Gen Z celebrities will speak out, but, so far, none have.",
