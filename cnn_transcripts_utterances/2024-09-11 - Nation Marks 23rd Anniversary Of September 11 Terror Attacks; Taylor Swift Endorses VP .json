They were here at this site in Lower Manhattan together. They shook hands in a moment, in a piece of video that is going to be seen over and over again. From there, Kamala Harris and President Biden, they left to move on to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the site of the Flight 93 crashing. And Donald Trump and J. D. Vance, they stopped by -- I think we have video of it, they stopped by one of the firehouses here, one of the many firehouses that responded where one of the first responders, when the, -- on September 11th, they're stopping by. It is Engine 4 Ladder 15 stopping by there and then they'll be heading to Shanksville.

And people need to remember that there were firefighters who literally were rushing into the Twin Towers to pull people out to get people out when those towers were coming down.

It's clear -- thank you, Olivia, for your point that he was really upset, which is why he ran to the spin room to try to create and control a narrative. But I actually don't think it helped. I think it harmed him even more. And Vice President Harris was quite disruptive on that stage and disrupting the way in which he always tries to dominate women, right? And with you sitting here, Olivia, I'm just thinking about the range in which this coalition that wants to not only vote for Vice President Harris, move past Donald Trump. It ranges from Republicans who are tired of him, who have the courage to stand up. You as well as Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney. All the way over to the left to -- there are a lot of uncommitted voters who said they still want to vote for Vice President Harris, they want to see more, obviously, on the issue in Gaza.
