Our White House reporter who was in the room is OUTFRONT. And is social media the new smoking? Surgeon general tonight calling for warning labels on Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. Is it enough? Surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, Putin's power trip. So the Russian president is tonight just hours away from arriving in North Korea, tonight, touting an unbreakable partnership. In new comments just released, Putin telling a North Korean newspaper that the Russian-North Korean alliance is based on principles of equality, mutual respect, and trust. Putin battering up Kim as the North Korean president rolls out the red carpet for Putin. Let's just show you some new satellite images. What appears to be, as far as we can see. So this is Pyongyang, large military parade preparations going on in the capital grandstands are growing up, going up, you can see those sort of along the edge. Construction taking place in one of the main squares in the city as well. And this partnership newly close, is cemented in one key thing, taking down the United States. Look no farther than what Russian state television is pushing tonight.

Look for yourself what they've shown on Russian state media television is on the left and on the right is what you see in North Korea. These are simulations of U.S. cities going up in a giant mushroom cloud of nuclear annihilation nuclear strikes taking out U.S. cities. It's grotesque, and the Russian-North Korean military partnership is deepening now, beyond rhetoric and video to reality. Kim paid Putin a visit last year, touring several secretive space and military facilities, at one point toasting Putin and vowing to have him back and what he called Putin's, quotes, sacred struggle against the band of evil in the west. And just three months ago, North Korea TV showed Kim and his daughter, they were back in Pyongyang riding in a luxurious new limousine, a limo that was a gift from Putin. And on Russian state television now, they are fawning over Kim. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): In the West, there persistently calling him a dictator.

Moscow-Pyongyang ties today, the strongest since the Cold War, a grave and growing threats, say Seoul and Washington. They accused Kim of supplying weapons to Putin's army in Ukraine, in exchange for advanced military technology, possibly boosting Kim's ballistic missile and spy satellite programs, which could make Kim's growing nuclear arsenal more accurate, experts warn. For years, North Korea has been threatening to use nukes against the U.S. in and the event of war. In April, Kim was quoted in state media. Now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before. The relationship really is built on a transactional relationship, not on mutual trust.

But there are additional steps that we can take as well. If your parent and kids are already on social media, establishing technology free zones in their day to protect sleep, in-person interaction, physical activity. This is really vital that can look like making mealtimes tech free, making our time an hour before bedtime throughout the night, tech free, device free zones as well. But the bottom line, Erin, is you and I had both recognize that this is hard to do alone. And as parents, if we can come together, have each other's backs and make a pact that let in place these rules for our families. It's easier for us.

It has more confines for the inmates that are kept there also violent offenders can be kept in a low security prison, like the one Bannon is going to be reporting to in just a couple of weeks in Danbury, Connecticut. But, Erin, the reason is because all of this is complicated by a case Steve Bannon is facing in New York where he's going to trial on this accusation of defrauding donors hers to a foundation he was on top of.
