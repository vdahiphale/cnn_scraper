And this morning his attorney says they will not accept a plea deal. Sources tell CNN that Trump faces more than 30 counts in a case that centers around alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.According to multiple sources, Trump will turn himself in next Tuesday appearing in a New York courtroom for his arraignment. Ahead of that, the NYPD is making major security preps. All officers are being told to report to work in uniform prepared for deployment today. We want to show you live pictures now of supporters who have gathered in Mar-a- Lago. Let's get straight to Paula Reid now live in New York for the latest on the indictment. Paula, walk us through what's going to happen next.",

The charges remain under seal until the arraignment which as of right now is expected to happen on Tuesday. Now, I'm also told that Trump's lawyers do not intend to try to push or even ask for the unsealing of that indictment any sooner.But on Tuesday, they said he will fully cooperate who will go through the standard process, which includes fingerprinting, photographs and appearance before a judge, though he is already attacking that judge on social media something that his lawyers are likely not pleased with. But following this initial appearance, his lawyers have vowed to fight. They say they're going to file motions to dismiss. They want to defeat this case before it ever gets to trial. Now several sources close to the case tell us that there is a lot of document -- documentary evidence supporting this case. And it's not just relying on witnesses was one of the key witnesses in this case, Michael Cohen. He was back last night and this morning, getting media interviews. Let's take a listen to what he told her colleagues last night, Amara. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER PERSONAL ATTORNEY TO DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I am a convicted felon. I am a disbarred lawyer. But I also brought the documents. There's plenty of testimony, corroborating testimony to go around. And come Tuesday --",

He declined to comment last night saying, look, I'm likely to be a witness in this trial.But speaking of witnesses, Amara, there was we've learned at least one other witness who went before the grand jury before they voted on this indictment yesterday, and we don't know who that person is. So that's a big mystery sitting out there. Is it someone who could as Michael Cohen suggested, corroborate his story or was it a witness that they brought in for another reason. But clearly, they were able to button up their case even after that surprise defense witness as they successfully got this indictment, but we'll see if they can successfully prosecute this case.",

She's the ex-daughter-in-law, a longtime CFO of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg.So she would have had some very interesting dinner conversations. And she has an estranged ex-daughter-in-law with an axe to grind. She's been talking to prosecutors. So I think they may have extra counts that we didn't anticipate involving other types of financial fraud. And Jennifer Weisselberg could be a key witness at trial, but the best witness would be Allen Weisselberg. And he is near the end of his prison term in Rikers. And there's reports that the prosecutors are threatening to add new insurance fraud charges against him, which would extend his stay in that facility perhaps at the end of his life.",

I'll read you part of the letter it says in part, as committee chairman, you could use the stature of your office to denounce these attacks and urge respect for the fairness of our justice system and for the work of the impartial grand jury. Instead, you and many of your colleagues have chosen to collaborate with Mr. Trump's efforts to vilify and denigrate the integrity of elected state prosecutors and trial judges and made unfounded allegations that the office's investigation conducted via an independent grand jury of average citizens serving New York is politically motivated. Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy along with his Republican leaders on his team have pushed back very quickly in the aftermath of the news last night saying it was a sham investigation. It was outrageous in the words of some.
