The Israeli Military has carried out airstrikes on what it says are targets belonging to Hamas militants in Gaza and Southern Lebanon.Then French President Emmanuel Macron is wrapping up a high stakes visit to China. But upon his return to France, you'll have to deal with the aftermath of another violent day of protests. And the symbol of Ukrainian pride, a giant cargo plane was destroyed by Russian troops in the first hours of the war, the Ukraine vows it will fly again. Israel has ordered the mobilization of its reserve forces amid rising tensions. It came hours after Israel conducted airstrikes against targets in Southern Lebanon and in Gaza. Israeli forces say they struck Hamas sites including weapons, manufacturing facilities, and tunnel infrastructure. In retaliation for a barrage of rocket fire, which hit Israeli territory on Thursday? In these images from Gaza, you can see damage to buildings and cars. The Palestinian Ministry of Health however, says that the Children's Hospital was also held hit. They flare up in hostilities during a religious holiday period is understandably worrying those on the ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Hadas Gold is near the Israeli Lebanese border. I mean, the fact that it stretched into Lebanon was a worrying new development. HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENTAlthough the airspace is still closed up here for civilian aircraft, the Israeli Military saying that it struck what made took pains to point out where Palestinian targets in Southern Lebanon and from what we understand these were in open areas, and they were no injuries reported in Southern Lebanon. It's important to distinguish that the Israeli Military is not saying or targeting Hezbollah as part of these airstrikes, because that could really tip the situation over into something so much bigger and so much more dangerous. And in fact, most we have been hearing from the Lebanese Prime Minister as well from the Israeli Military, both saying that they have no interest in escalating this further. And so far, Hezbollah has not denied or taken responsibility for any part of those more than 30 rockets that were fired into Israeli territory yesterday. Most of the action has actually been over Gaza, because Israel is again, pointing the finger at Palestinian militant groups like Hamas, like Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Israeli military, launching airstrikes against Hamas targets it said in Gaza, including what they said were tunnels, weapons, manufacturing sites, militants, they're firing more than 40 rockets back towards Israel in response. But again, thankfully, no injuries reported on either side, although, as you noted, there have been damages on both sides, including to a pediatric hospital in Gaza. Meantime, though, in the occupied West Bank, two Israeli women were shot and killed a third actually their mother was shot and critically injured in the occupied West Bank while they were driving in their car. This is just going to show you the multiple fronts that are ongoing here and how the situation of one event in one place can very quickly escalate and turn this into something so much bigger than it already is. But for right now, it's been a tense come up here. We have not seen any response from militants in Lebanon in reaction to their airstrikes. As of right now, although we do know that the Israeli Air Force has called up its reservists. It seems to be more of a precautionary measure than any sort of indication that something bigger may be taking place, Max.",

British intelligence says Moscow's forces have likely entered the center of Bakhmut and are now threatening a key supply routes.On Thursday, Ukraine's General Staff said the besieged Eastern city remains at the epicenter of fighting.

      "sentences": "I mean, clearly, this has been the front line grind for months now. The key battle that Russia states will be a symbolic victory for it partially something that mercenary leader Prigozhin tried to accomplish with his Wagner units.Now they appear to have been assisted more and working according to this same British intelligence report in greater harmony with traditional Russian Military to try and move further into the center intense fighting now street by street, some of it around the railway station in the city center. And quite clearly, now Ukraine has been pushed to the west side of that city, yet they are still holding on. And Moscow's major issue here is it as long said how this will be a vital victory for them, it has failed to pull that off so far. The limited strategic value of Bakhmut has long been talked about as well. So essentially, even if we do see Russian forces, take control of large parts of the west of the city even possibly threaten the supply route that Ukrainian forces still have to resupply, what remains of their troops inside the city. Even that victory itself will be of questionable games, potentially enabling Russia to move into other parts of the Donbas they seek as well. But it does appear, according to this British intelligence report that they think Russia may be getting some momentum here, but that is after months of stalling possibly thousands of lives lost here. And the broader question too, if you step back from the sort of micro assessment of street by street fighting in Bakhmut. Ukraine's managed to tie Russian forces down in achieving this victory that they wanted to be so symbolic for them for months, and that potentially some will argue has enabled Ukraine separately to focus on the larger counter offensive that may be days, maybe weeks away from now. Long talked about in Ukrainian and other circles too, as a decisive moment potentially, in this war, but it does appear as of today that the battle in Bakhmut is gently possibly edging in Russia's favor has reversed in times past though as well. And each month this continues to grind on it's a greater drain on Russia's already depleted resources, Max.",

Meanwhile, President Tsai is returning home at the same time, a bipartisan congressional delegation is in Taipei being led by U.S. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul. McCaul warned China that it should think twice before considering an invasion of Taiwan.Now French President Emmanuel Macron is nearing the end of his three- day state visit to China, with war in Ukraine topping the agenda. Earlier he traveled to the Southern City of Guangzhou, where he was met by hundreds of students at the University. Mr. Macron later had dinner with President Xi, and soon he is expected to meet with Chinese investors before heading home. CNN's Marc Stewart joins us from Tokyo.

      "sentences": "Oh, hi there, Max. This was a visit that was really based on two concepts, one diplomacy and two deal making. Let's first talk about diplomacy, no wholesale shift in position from China. In fact, both sides really held firm with France, blaming Russia and its invasion of Ukraine for really disrupting the peace and stability in Europe, and no condemnation by President Xi of Russia for its invasion.However, French diplomatic sources tell us that President Xi has expressed interest he said he would take a call between he and Volodymyr Zelenskyy when the time is right. So that's where things stand on the diplomatic front and then there is this issue of deal- making. President Macron did not travel to China by himself. He brought with him a delegation of about 50 French business people. Late tonight we can confirm that France and Chinese Shipbuilding Company have now agreed to a multi-billion-dollar deal. So that is significant as both economies try to rebound post pandemic. In addition, you mentioned that visit to Guangzhou a chance for President Macron to see the manufacturing might of China. This is a visit that was billed by the French as one for conversation and discussion. And Max, that seems to be the tone that has held through all of this.",

      "sentences": "The White House said on Thursday that it would be transmitting to certain congressional committees a long awaited after action report outlining lessons learned from the lead up to the withdrawal of Afghanistan and of course the aftermath as well as that abrogate bombing that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members as that very chaotic evacuation was taking place.Now this report is classified and members of Congress are going to be able to read a hard copy of it. But they of course will not be able to disseminate it widely. However, the White House is kind of getting out ahead of this and they release their own summary of their perspectives of the lead up to the withdrawal and the lessons that they believe the administration has learned since. [08:20:00] Namely among those lessons, are the fact that they will now begin evacuations much sooner than they did with Afghanistan. They say that they delayed those evacuations, essentially, because they did not want the world to lose confidence in the Afghan government and for the Afghan government to collapse. Well, now they say that they're prioritizing faster evacuations and they're also working more aggressively to communicate the risks to Americans who may be in these situations where the security environment is deteriorating very rapidly, as we saw with that rapid Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. So while the White House says that they will be taking these lessons learned and applying them elsewhere, they also are arguing very fervently that this was a bad hand that was dealt to them by the Trump administration. And they say that everything that they did was really a reaction to deals that President Trump made with the Taliban that forced the Americans to withdraw from Afghanistan reduce their presence there and thereby leave the Afghan government and the Americans in country a lot weaker. That is the argument the White House is making. Obviously, this after action report, going to Congress they will remain classified. But it remains to be seen of course, whether any of this will be made public for now, however, the administration really pointing the finger back at their predecessors.
