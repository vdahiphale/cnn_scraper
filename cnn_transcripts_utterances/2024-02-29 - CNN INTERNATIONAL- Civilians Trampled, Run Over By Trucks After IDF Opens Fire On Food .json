Palestinian health officials say that at least 104 people were killed today in a \"massacre.\" As crowds of people desperate for food rushed toward aid trucks, Israeli tanks and drones opened fire, and that triggered panic and further casualties as some trucks frantically trying to escape ran into the crowds. A senior Hamas member warns that the killings could derail talks for a hostage deal and ceasefire. Let's bring in CNN's Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward live for us in London. Clarissa, there are differing accounts about what happened. What more can you share with us, and what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "So, as you mentioned, there are differing accounts. We're hearing from a Palestinian journalist who was there at the scene, that essentially huge crowds of people started to swarm this convoy of roughly 30 trucks that had come in to northern Gaza very early in the morning. This is, of course, some of the toughest parts of Gaza. It's where the hardest fighting has been, the fewest people remain, the most desperate and critical humanitarian situation remains. And it's been very, very difficult to get aid to this area. And you could see in those extraordinary images just swarms of people.Now, we're hearing from the IDF. They say that there were two separate incidents, and that essentially, in one of the incidents that there was a sort of stampede, that there was an issue with the trucks actually crashing into people as they had sort of descended upon the different trucks. They said that there was a second incident in which the IDF became concerned that people were heading towards a tank and started to fire off in the air. And so, you're hearing these two different narratives. But, at the end of the day, Rahel, it is very clear how this situation happened, why it happened, whether the vast majority of deaths were caused by the stampede, whether they were caused by IDF bullets. The reality is they were caused because the situation in Gaza has reached such a situation, such a crucial point of desperation with UN officials talking about it being now in northern Gaza, specifically, one step away from famine, and no end in sight as this latest horrific incident really, potentially threatens to derail these hostage deal, ceasefire deal negotiations all together, Rahel.",

This is a conflict in which Israel is the dominant occupying power, and it is the responsibility of Israel to ensure that aid is distributed effectively to the civilian population. This is an issue that American and officials as well as aid agencies have been warning the Israelis about for many weeks and months, that this would become more and more of a problem unless you allow for the free flow of aid into this area. It is only natural that people are desperate. You are going to see looting. It is only natural that you are going to see a spike in criminal activity. Some of this aid is being siphoned off and sold in the markets.The only way to stop that kind of activity is to flood the zone with aid. Now, we just spoke with a UN officer who has spent time in Gaza over the last few months. He says the only way you can distribute aid at scale in this kind of a situation is to have a ceasefire, to have a ceasefire whereby international aid organizations are given enough time, enough of the heads up to prepare for this moment to bring in vast quantities of aid. Currently, their store rooms might have two or three days' worth of aid in them at any given time. You have 300,000 people living in northern Gaza at the moment in the most desperate and dire of circumstances. You have the UN office that coordinates humanitarian aid, saying that they are one step away from famine. The UN official that we just spoke to said that 15 percent of people now in northern Gaza are suffering from acute malnutrition, 15 percent as compared to five percent, according to this UN official in the south. Six children died in one hospital in northern Gaza last week of dehydration and malnutrition. And this is not something new. This is something that international aid organizations have been screaming from the rooftops about for quite some time now. So, for Colonel Lerner to imply that this is not Israel's problem, this is not Israel's responsibility, and it is not Israel's fault, is simply in contravention of international humanitarian law, Rahel.",

It's also becoming a huge geopolitical issue for America in terms of its reputation on the world stage. And of course, it's becoming a huge issue for Israel in terms of its reputation being tarnished on the world stage.And so, I do think that while this incident is horrifying and threatens to derail the progress that has been made in those talks that would lead to a hostage deal, that would lead to a ceasefire, it is also potentially some kind of a watershed moment and that it will not be possible for governments in the West and particularly for the White House to continue to advocate that their policy is working with regards to this subject.

There is little doubt that there was a huge death toll here, the Health Ministry saying more than 100 people were killed in this horrific incident. The White House, before those remarks from President Biden, had called this a serious incident, and they're looking into the reports.But, the main thing that we're hearing now, Rahel, from senior U.S. officials is that this adds urgency to these ceasefire talks that the U.S. has been helping mediate alongside Qatar and Egypt. You remember a couple of days ago, President Biden said that he expected that a ceasefire could be in place as early as Monday. Just now in those remarks on the South Lawn before he got on the helicopter, he said that that is not likely, but hope springs eternal. And he acknowledged that this incident today, this horrifically deadly incident complicates those talks. Now, I think the big question today, Rahel, is whether that will -- this will derail those talks and push them back, or whether it will accelerate them? At least one senior official I've spoken with believes that it will speed them up. But, Hamas has also warned that this could really deal a blow to those talks. So, that remains to be seen. But, without question, this desperate need for aid that was exhibited earlier today emphasizes the desire and the real need for the U.S. and the other parties to get to a temporary truce in Gaza.

That's in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Most of the aid is coming in to the southern part of the Gaza Strip. It was very difficult to get up to the north. There are discussions about opening up a crossing in northern Gaza between Israel and Gaza. I would imagine that the talks around that gets stepped up.But, certainly, what we can imagine happening behind the scenes is these three main mediators, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, calling both Hamas and Israel, saying, we need to get to a deal. We need to get to a ceasefire so that the hostages can get released, so that Palestinian prisoners can get released, so that there can be a pause in the fighting that these Palestinians so desperately need after almost five months of war, and so that the humanitarian aid can get in and to where it needs to be.

What they all want to do is they want to make sure that we fund Border Patrol, make sure that we have technology at the ports of entry and in between, and they want to make sure that we come up with a solution. They get tired of all this politics. What they want to do is they want to stop seeing people coming in between ports of entry. If they want to go at a port and ask for asylum, and if they qualify under the law, let them go ahead and do that. But, people don't want to see people crossing the ranch lands or people sleeping in the streets of border communities, like we've seen for so many years.So, it's one of those things that they're asking us to work together. And unfortunately, we had a border deal. The Senate deal was a good deal. But, as we know, the other party rejected it because the former President told them to reject it.

And I'll give you another example that's worked very well.Remember, in December, we had 10,000 or 12,000 people a day cut in half. You know what happened? We didn't add border wall. We didn't add any new Border Patrol technology. What happened was, the U.S. was able to convince Mexico to do its job, and that is stopping people from coming to our border.

The Enclaves Health Ministry says that more than 100 people were killed while they were waiting for food. Israel says that its troops opened fire after feeling threatened. A local journalist says that the majority of the deaths resulted from trucks ramming into people as drivers tried to get away from the gunfire. An Israeli military spokesperson claimed that there were two separate incidents. He says that trucks were first rushed by crowds and rolled over people before Israeli forces opened fire on a group of Palestinians that approached them.I want to continue this conversation and now bring in U.S. Senator Chris Coons from Capitol Hill. He was just in the Middle East just last week. Senator Coons, thank you for the time today. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Rahel, this is yet another tragic story out of Gaza, and it is a cautionary tale, a reminder that as the humanitarian circumstances get worse and worse, people on the edge of starvation are going to assault the trucks that are trying to get in to deliver humanitarian aid. This is a catastrophe. And it is frankly urgent that the IDF and the Israeli government clarify how they are going to help deliver more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and what their plans are for a potential assault on Rafah in the coming weeks. When I was in Israel and met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he made it clear that he had gotten the message from President Biden that they have to do a better job of protecting civilians from harm. I understand the IDF has an important mission in combatting Hamas. But, Hamas is embedded in the civilian population, in some cases, literally under the civilian population in Gaza. And the IDF has an obligation under international law to conduct themselves in a way that minimizes civilian casualties. This tragedy --",

But, this is a critical moment. I stand by what I said. In about 10 days, the holy month of Ramadan begins, and throughout this region, incidents like this that are being seen on television screens and on social media around the world will inflame the West Bank, the south of Lebanon, the north of Israel, the Palestinian camps in Jordan, and people concerned about the humanitarian situation here around the world.I urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to recognize that its closest ally, the United States, will continue to stand by Israel, but they must respect their obligation to protect civilians and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. I think the United States should begin delivering humanitarian aid directly into Gaza by airdrop or sealift if we are not able to persuade our close ally Israel to open up more routes of access.",

I'm wondering, certainly, there was a message sent in Michigan from the Arab community there about the White House's stance to the war in Gaza. I'm wondering if you think that we can expect to see a shifting stance from the White House, from President Biden moving forward, especially in light of what happened this morning. COONSGaza made it clear to Israel that the United States will back Israel and its defense, its obligation to protect its citizens, but expects them to allow humanitarian aid, facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza and to protect civilians. Roughly 30,000 people have died in Gaza. Maybe 10,000 of them were Hamas fighters, but 20,000 of them were likely innocent women and children, Palestinians. I would expect that President Biden to the extent he changes direction or tone, it will be because of the circumstances on the ground. Obviously, there was a message sent by voters in Michigan. And I know -- I'm certainly attuned to that. Many of us who are supporters of our President are attuned to that. This is tearing apart American families, those who have real concerns about the path forward in Gaza. And I think we are doing our very best to balance respect for the hostages who are still being held by Hamas, respect for Israelis whose sense of safety was shattered by the brutal attacks of October 7, and a deep respect for America's role in the world. We have long been the largest donor to Palestinian assistance through UNRWA. The United States gives more to the care and feeding of Palestinians in camps in Jordan and Syria and Israel than any other nation. And this conflict is putting that into sharp relief, the tension between these two long-standing commitments of the United States.",
