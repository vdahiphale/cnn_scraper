Three American service members have been killed and more than 30 others injured after what U.S. officials say was an overnight drone attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan. This is near the border with Syria and Iraq. PPresident Biden is blaming Iran-backed militant groups and vowing to hold them responsible. This marks the first time U.S. troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. Right now, CIA Director Bill Burns is in Europe preparing for key talks on a possible hostage deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza. We've got a team of reporters tracking all these latest developments, both here at home and abroad. Let's start with CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who's with me here in the studio. Natasha, there's been some sense that perhaps this was only a matter of time before these Iran-backed militias were able to successfully strike U.S. service members in a way that left some casualties like this. Obviously, a critical moment in what's taking place in that region right now. What more are you learning?",

This is something that has been happening on a near daily basis.You have seen these rockets and drones being fired by these Iran- backed groups towards American personnel and trying to kill them, according to officials that we've spoken to. But this is different because they finally, sadly, succeeded. And three U.S. Army soldiers were told were killed in this drone attack and upwards of 30 other U.S. personnel were injured when this drone kind of landed in the vicinity of the living quarters of this military base, which is in northeast Jordan, right on the border there with Syria. And what we are hearing as a reaction from, you know, the President Biden, from Secretary of Defense Austin, is we are going to respond. That has been the consistent statement ever since this news broke early this morning about how -- where things are going to go from here. The question now is are they going to respond by hitting the Iran- backed militant group that they say is responsible for this or are they going to stage some kind of attack that is larger than that, perhaps hitting Iran itself as many Republican lawmakers are now calling for. Something that obviously the president and his administration would want to avoid, but this is a very serious escalation that likely will require a more forceful response.",

That really lends some urgency here to try and come up with an agreement that would essentially bring down the tensions somewhat and allow some space for the U.S. and its partners in the region to come up with some sort of plan to end this conflict permanently. The CIA Director, Bill Burns, has acted as President Biden's point person on this issue. He is in Paris today in talks with his intelligence counterparts from Egypt and Israel. The contours of this deal include a phased release of the hostages in exchange for a longer cessation of hostilities. American officials have been very careful to set expectations. For example, John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said on Friday that there was no imminent developments in the offing here.

When you look at just the pace and the scale of the meetings that have been happening over the last couple of weeks, culminating with this summit in France today between the head of the CIA and intelligence chiefs from Israel, Egypt, and the prime minister of Qatar, you can really get the sense that there is something under the surface that may come above.And so, in Israel here today, what we are hearing is that they view these meetings today as constructive. They believe that there has been progress, but at the same time, they are underscoring the fact that significant gaps still remain between them and Hamas. And the primary sticking point, of course, is over the duration of a cessation of hostilities. Israel has put on the table the longest cessation of hostilities to date, up to two months in exchange for the phased release of these hostages. But Hamas, up until now, has still been demanding an all-out end to the war, an attempt to try and salvage their position inside the Gaza Strip. But the Israeli Prime Minister, no doubt, is under mounting pressure here domestically. Thousands of people last night protesting in Tel Aviv for elections and also calling for a hostage deal now. But the Israeli Prime Minister is also facing pressure from his right flank as well. Minister Ben-Gvir, for example, saying if he ends the war that he will exit the government. And there is certainly a concern about what will happen if there is a two-month pause in the fighting? How can Israel then resume the war? That will certainly be a challenge if indeed that comes to pass. Jim?",

It's very clear Iran does not want to direct conflict. Hezbollah does not want to direct conflict with Israel. So, they've been attacking on the margins. And to the extent that they're able to continue to get away with that, they inflict costs on us without any consequences to them, and that makes it more likely that that's going to continue. But I do want to circle back to Israel's policy with the Palestinians. Prime Minister Netanyahu's position that there'll never be a Palestinian state and his desire to continue to try and weaken all Palestinians, not just Hamas, really strengthens Iran right now. And Prime Minister Netanyahu needs to think about a different policy in terms of how they deal with their very legitimate conflict with Hamas in a way that doesn't empower the Houthis and Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, Hezbollah and Iran itself.

We have to find a way, as I said, to change their calculus.Right now, they think they can promote their proxies to attack us with no consequences. If that doesn't change, these attacks will continue. Now I do believe again, because Iran, you know, they are a very weak government right now. The protests continue to go on. They had their own terrorist attack from ISIS within Iran. they're not in a position for a larger conflict, but again, that's something that the leadership at the National Security Council of DOD and the White House will have to carefully calculate in the days ahead.",

Is that ever really going to happen?But the alternative is to say that there's just no future for the Palestinians, period. Better to have the hope of some type of viable Palestinian state than no hope at all. We're not going to get there tomorrow. The blocs, again, coming from the Palestinians, coming from Hamas, a number of different sources are great, but we have to show that we're moving towards it. This is crucial for our Arab partners, for Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Jordan. They are worried about Iran. They want to work towards greater peace. But if there is no future for the Palestinians, the pressure on those Arab governments is such that they're not in a position to negotiate with Israel, to work with us as much as they otherwise would. It's very complicated, but that's a simple truth. There has to be some future for the Palestinians in this to up our leverage and stop Iran from being in the strong position that they're currently in.",

And then we went to our routine anatomy scan at about 19 weeks pregnant, and it was at that ultrasound that we found out the worst news that any parent does not want to hear. Our daughter, we were having a little girl, we named her Miley Rose (ph), we found out that pretty much every major organ in her body did not form correctly and was not functioning. Also, she stopped growing at 15 weeks and there was little to no amniotic fluid surrounding her.So, my pregnancy was deemed incompatible with life and that she was non-viable in or out of the womb. I was told that I had two options. I could continue my pregnancy but put myself at risk for miscarriage, still birth, or if she did survive birth, she'd be going into hospice care immediately after the pass. But continuing my pregnancy, my doctor told me that the longer I stayed pregnant, the worse Miley (ph) would get and the higher risk my health would become. Now, at this point, I already have a daughter here who is five. Her name is Adelie (ph), and I didn't want to put myself at risk of leaving her without a mom.

But moving forward, I've talked to so many other lawmakers and ex- lawmakers, and they said that the more I push, the better chance I have, but I need to make sure I word things correctly if I want to get it to be a nonpartisan bill, which is what I want to happen. If I do win my election, I want to be able to work with people across the aisle to make this across-the-board decision and not just a liberal or a democratic decision.",

The U.S. is working to identify exactly which militia group carried out a deadly drone attack on a small U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops and injured more than 30 others. This happened near the border with Syria and Iraq.And joining me now to talk about this, CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton and former Middle East negotiator for the State Department, Aaron David Miller. Colonel, I guess -- let me go to you first. Your reaction to this deadly attack on U.S. troops? There have been these moments that we've seen over the last several weeks where these Iran-backed militias have been wreaking havoc, have been a nuisance to U.S. forces in the region. Obviously, this time, it's much more serious and it may bring about a U.S. response.",

This is a really serious escalation at this point and what it has done, because of the deaths of at least three American service members and the injuries of 30 more, 30-plus soldiers, it is clearly raising the ante here.And the group that did this, whichever one it was, is clearly asking for a response from the U.S. and what that, of course, means, it remains to be seen. But, you know, one of the key suspects here is probably Kata'ib Hezbollah, the group in Iraq that is the main Iranian proxy there. It could be one of the other Iranian proxies, but it clearly points to a possible escalation in that direction.",

So, Tower 22 is right on the Jordan-Syria border but it is also close to what they call the tripoint where three countries come together, in this case Syria, Iraq, and Jordan. Because of that, it's in a unique position where it can oversee a lot of the smuggling routes that have been there for thousands of years between all of the different areas within Syria, Jordan, and Iraq. And it is at a very strategic location, has provided a lot of supplies to Al Tanf, which is the primary base in this part of Syria that has been used against the ISIS forces that we fought against over the last few years. ACOSTA: And Aaron, President Biden has been briefed on the attack. He has released a statement valiantly to hold those responsible accountable. We are already seeing calls from Republican lawmakers for a strike inside Iran. As a matter of fact, we talked to Congressman (INAUDIBLE) at the top of the hour, and he said that perhaps some sites in Iran should be considered for some sort of proportionate response. What might that do to the situation that obviously has been simmering with a lot of tensions over the last several weeks and, obviously, things could get way more escalated if something like that happens?",

So, something like attacking naval assets in the Persian Gulf, something like that, which kind of goes up to the line. But, you know, they could do that or they could stick with hitting the proxies in either Iraq or Syria. But if there's a hand that is hidden, that is revealed for, let's say, the contact from Tehran that perhaps directed this attack, then they have to consider going all that way to send a message to the Iranians.",

The Israelis actually, I think, are under an enormous amount of pressure, rising pressure from the hostage families, growing casualties, the IDF's understanding that they may well have reached the limit of the most intense kinetic phase.And a pause, two months, which the Israelis could resume against Hamas leadership would, in fact, do a couple things. It would allow a surge, not a dribble, of humanitarian assistance, which is badly needed in the Gaza. It would free the 100-plus hostages that remain and the return of the 20 or 30 that the Israelis believe are no longer living, either killed on October 7, their bodies taken to Gaza to trade for Palestinian prisoners or died in captivity. I think it will offer some respite badly needed. Will what's happening with respect to this attack in time derail that? I don't think so. I think if Hamas and the Israelis all both want to pause, then the U.S. is well-positioned, I think, right now to try to deliver one.
