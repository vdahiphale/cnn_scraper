      "sentences": "It's 8A big announcement out of Washington, the Justice Department charging three people in connection with an Iranian plot to kill Donald Trump. According to court documents, Iranian officials wanted Trump watched and ultimately assassinated. Prosecutors say around October 7th, the main suspect, Farhad Shakeri was told to stop focusing on other assassination plots and focus only on Trump. He was to continue with that plot against Trump until after the election under the Iranian belief that Trump would not win. Shakeri is now at large in Iran. Two other suspects are Americans and were arrested in New York. The U.S. government has repeatedly raised concerns that Iran might try to retaliate for the 2020 U.S. drone strike, which Trump ordered as president and killed General Qassem Soleimani. Joining us now is Karim Sadjadpour, expert on Iran senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Good to have you on as always. I wonder -- when you look at this plot, an act of war by Iran in effect?",

And so now Iran has been plotting to assassinate President Trump, and they've been trying to assassinate the individuals who will compose his national security brain trust for the last four years.So, you know, all of us are at the end of the day, governments are run by human beings.

If you're Prime Minister Netanyahu to say that you know, that gives us license to, you know, continue our military campaign, even more severely to defeat our adversary, or you could take it to say that. Okay. You know president Trump is now going to exercise even more restraint over Israel than the Biden administration has. But I think, you know fundamentally, whether it comes to Israel's war in Gaza and Lebanon or the Russia-Ukraine war, his instincts, Trump's instincts are want to are to want to simply do deals to, to stop these conflicts -- much easier said than done.",

Instead of thinking about, you know, four separate Cold Wars, you have to think about, you know, how these countries are linked and to think about, you know, what is the strategy that actually strengthens the differences between them rather than strengthens their partnership.And certainly one of the connections here is Syria.

On Thursday, he announced his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, will become the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff. Before accepting the job, Wiles wanted a promise that she would be the gatekeeper and have control over who had access to the president inside the Oval Office.Billionaire Elon Musk seems to be making a return on his investment after lining up Trump's campaign, a remarkable number. CNN's told Musk joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the very day after the election. The president-elect has 73 days until he heads back to the White House and is expected to start naming more cabinet picks in the coming days. Steve Contorno is tracking the Trump team's next political moves, joins us now from St. Petersburg Florida. First, what exactly did Musk, Trump and Zelenskyy talk about?

First, if I could just ask you on the politics of this, do Democrats still have a chance of getting the House or is that far -- is that farfetched at this point? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA):  Not far fetched at all? Democrats absolutely have a chance, and we have to ensure that we are supporting and resourcing our candidates who are doing recounts or litigation, because the goal is every lawful vote needs to be counted and we need to ensure that the will of the voters in California and Arizona and elsewhere are heard, and there's absolutely a path to a majority, albeit a narrow one.",

You consider too extreme clearly harder in the minority in the House particularly as tariffs and taxes are in play next year.We're going to have to triage the most profound and irreversible damage that he can do. I look particularly at politicizing the military, which is a 250-year history since George Washington handed over his sword to the Continental Congress, that we have had a nonpartisan military. Donald Trump clearly wants to reverse that. We will have to find a bipartisan coalition of the Reagan remnants of the Republican senators and House members to stand with us against those attempts. Same thing with RFK in Health and Human Services. He could degrade our gold standard regulatory and biomedical research apparatus at the FDA and the NIH. We've got to stand against that.

And I think the People's Liberation Army would tell you that it's very challenging. I think they've told Xi Jinping that's very challenging.So I think it is defeatist to say that Taiwan does not have a chance.

I mean, listen, the markets have already been booming for years, right? I mean, they've been high, but they've gone up again since Trump's victory. Why, exactly? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Because of a raft of policies that are perceived to becoming the economy's way, that will juice up and boost growth. Everything from investments in A.I., removal of restrictions on drilling, lower government regulation that will make financial services more profitable, the Trump agenda across the board is going to be one of business-friendly policies, particularly about things like removing regulation, and that should increase profitability, earnings per share and so on and so forth. There is also, of course, this feeling that the Fed -- well, we know the Fed is cutting interest rates. It's already done it this week and that will continue. Growth is good. So the economic landscape is not only rosy from the previous administration, but Donald Trump's policies will give it a boost as well.",

By the way, there you see the markets and you get an idea of how they are performing. But this idea of far-reaching tariffs across imported goods which could hit all sorts of companies, which is why, for instance Steve Madden, the shoe company, announced it is shifting a large part of production from China to other countries. It's known as trust shoring, even near- shoring. The idea is make your products in places where they won't be so hit by, they will be hit by tariffs because they're not being made in the U.S., but they won't be hit by the swingeing tariffs likely to be introduced against Chinese exported goods.",

So yes, you're looking at deficit spending at a much higher level for the foreseeable future. But for the moment -- but here's the point, Jim, here's the point, as Kamala Harris would say, for the moment, the other economies like Europe, the U.K., parts of Asia are in a worse situation.
