With four days to go before Election Day, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is eliciting more star power to get her message out to voters. Last hour, Harris wrapped up a rally in Las Vegas where she was joined by actress and singer Jennifer Lopez. Earlier in the day, the vice president spoke to an enthusiastic crowd in Reno, Nevada. In both speeches, Harris warned about what she called the dangers of another Donald Trump presidency.

But we know that pollsters are trying to address that, that some of these Trump voters, which tend to be unlikely voters, weren't accounted for in the previous election cycles, and now pollsters have tried to adjust for that. The other thing is that the polls don't really capture voterenthusiasm, and they don't capture what's going on the ground. I mean, that's at least what's being reported. That it's a pretty thin operation for Donald Trump. I think he assumes that people that vote for him are gonna vote for him no matter what. They're very motivated to vote for him. But the Democrats have a much more sophisticated and extensive campaign and they're knocking on doors and they're trying to get the vote out. And really at this point, the polls don't matter much. They haven't changed much. They have been pretty much the same for the last six weeks, eight weeks even. But what really matters is the drive to get voters to vote, and we've already seen record levels of early voting. So there's a lot of enthusiasm, particularly on the Democrat side. Sure, Trump is incredibly confident because the polls look so good for him. But in some ways, some of his last messages, he almost sounds desperate, like don't make me waste a day being here. You need to vote for me. An interesting way to close a campaign.",

Do you think that might help Democrats in terms of reaching more Republican women who might be on the fence? LINDSTAEDTwomen are going to do, what white women are going to do, and Trump has hemorrhaged support from this particular group. He was leading by seven, eight points in the last election, and some polls showed that with white women, he's maybe leading by a point or instead even. These types of comments don't help that he's gonna protect you whether you like it or not. I mean, this is coming from someone who was convicted of sexual assault described on tape that he's going to assault women by the privates and grab them by their privates. All this stuff doesn't play well with women and I can't imagine that's what he wants to close on because women vote more than men do. They vote more than men by three or four points. And we're seeing that this is the trend I would be looking at the most. If the female voter turnout is really high, this is not gonna be good for Trump and we'll have to look at it in comparison to what male turnout is. That's his base, it's mostly white males. And part of his base is not the type of voter that tends to vote all the time. So that's why he's trying to get enthusiasm with that whole Madison Square Garden Macho Fest. He's hoping that that's going to bring out his supporters, but at the same time he's really turning of female voters.",

So some of these people are listening, they're voting early. The Democrats usually have an advantage with early voting because Democrats tend to prefer to vote early, but these record numbers are good for Harris.The bigger the turnout from Harris's perspective, the better chances that she has of doing well because that's where you see the enthusiasm, all that effort in getting people out to vote. That's where that really matters. And so I think both teams are probably claiming victory with that. But for Harris's team, you've got to be optimistic looking at some of these numbers.",

Musk's lawyer says the Tesla CEO is too busy to show up anywhere on short notice. The D.A.'s representative called Musk's absence of the hearing cowardly and irresponsible. The D.A. has called for an emergency hearing into the matter. A federal grand jury is meeting to investigate criminal charges against music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, that's according to three sources. On Thursday, jurors were expected to hear from a witness who claims to have videos that show Combs potentially victimizing celebrities. Combs has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transporting to engage in prostitution. He denies all wrongdoing including accusations in more than two dozen civil cases. The rapper Young Thug has been released from custody and won't serve time in jail following his racketeering trial here in Atlanta, Georgia. As part of a plea deal, he was sentenced to time served on Thursday. He pleaded guilty to some charges and no contest to others. Prosecutors accused Young Thug, real name Jeffrey Williams, of leading a violent street gang which could have put him behind bars for the rest of his life. In the end, he served more than 900 days behind bars and will be on probation for 15 years.

It makes it very clear whenever there are questions, that this is a us specific matter, and arguments could be made for both candidates perhaps Beijing likes the anti-alliance feel of Donald Trump or a potential Trump presidency. Yet at the same time perhaps appreciating some of the diplomacy and the regular communication that we have seen in the Democratic administration with Biden and possibly going back to Harris, if she indeed wins.
