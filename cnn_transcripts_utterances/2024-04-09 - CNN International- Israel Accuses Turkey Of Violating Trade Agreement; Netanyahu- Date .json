We are now seeing really the extent of the destruction of to months, of course, of fierce fighting as residents, trickle back into the city, entire blocks there, as you can see, a wasteland. Israeli forces withdrew on Sunday from what they called a Hamas stronghold. We are seeing similar scenes around al Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Gaza civil defense says nearly 400 bodies have been recovered so far. That's after a two-week siege. Experts from the World Health Organization are on-site trying to help identify the decomposing remains. The IDF says its troops are now regrouping for other missions, including in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinian civilians are sheltering. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a date has been set to enter Rafah, but he won't disclose it, insisting, quote, no force in the world will stop his troops from finishing the job against Hamas. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel isn't sharing any of the specifics. Have a listen to what he said earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: No, we do not have a date for any Rafah operation, at least one that's been communicated to us by the Israelis. On the contrary, what we have is an ongoing conversation with Israel about any Rafah operation. The president has been very clear about our concerns, our deep concerns about Israel's ability to move civilians out of harms, out of harms way to care for them, once they're out of harms way. And to have any kind of major military operation that doesn't do real harm to civilians, to children, to women, to men. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And yet there is a theory so that were already in the operational phase that this will happen and there'll be some decision made that, you know, aid agencies of the United Nations can keep these people safe. Well, there's two problems with this.One, legally, Israel as the occupying power has the responsibility not just to facilitate aid and that's not being facilitated. People are shot as they are accessing aid convoys. We have most of the restrictions going to the north. That's why there is imminent famine. But there's also that responsibility to therefore ensure there are toilets and showers. Rafah, as we've said on your program, Isa, Rafah has around one shower for every three-and-a-half thousand people, that would probably turn to 10,000 people if they move somewhere else. So, no, there's no provisions in these. And why is there no provisions? Because civilians and children have throughout this conflict being second-class citizens at best. If there was a genuine attempt only to target militants and not to have a situation where 1 percent of Gaza's child population has been killed and historic new low, if there was a real intend to protect children from the militants, then they would, of course, be tents and showers and bathrooms and hospitals. The first hospital that we will see go in round is the largest standing hospital. And that's directly in the line of fire. Is there a provision being made for other health care at a time when children need health care more than ever? No. No, there's not. And that speaks to the intent and the complete disregard for children.",

There is many, many fictions occurring in- between that, so that's a major problem.That could be fixed by opening up crossing in the north. We're told there will now be crossing opened in the north. We were told that on the 21st of February. That hasn't happened. We're told Erez will open in the north, Isa. My great fear, UNICEF, the U.N.'s great fear is that, that crossing will open because an offensive in Rafah will absolutely devastate any opportunity to get aid through there. So we are at a game of counting trucks. The reality is people in the north are at a level of imminent famine. We've seen children fall into catastrophic hunger at a number that we haven't seen anywhere before. And again, it speaks to intent. We don't have an intentionally good effort to get as much aid as we can to those in need. We have the -- we have smoke and mirrors in numbers. And then on the ground, every possible obstruction speaking to whether UNRWA as the largest U.N. agency and supplying 50 percent of food to the north, hasn't got supplies in to the north since January or UNICEF supporting only children every time we load a convoy with life-saving medicines or nutritional food, we have to unload that and reload it four times before it gets to those children we serve.

This isn't just the Israelis having a military operation there.It is part of Hamas's strategy to use those civilians as shields. First of all, that's been stated from the very beginning, but they really don't care how many civilians are hurt because that contributes to their strategy of making Israel look bad. Israel looks bad because in this case, they are conducting the operation which Hamas wants them to conduct. And I know that sounds very confusing. But when you had those civilians interspersed within the terrorists -- I mean, as a military commander, in other locations, I'll name Iraq where I serve, it's very difficult to say, hey, this individual walking down the street is a civilian versus a terrorist, which one? How do you separate that when you're talking about a million and a half people? How do you separate the good Palestinians from those who are supporting Hamas and who are actually part of the terrorist outfit? This is the challenge of this kind of counterterrorism operation, which has somewhat developed into a counterinsurgency because more and more of the Palestinian civilians were being hurt and killed are saying why are we allowing the Israeli government to do this? And the only reason they are is because they don't have a government of their own. And unfortunately, they're being overwhelmed by Israel's fight against Hamas.",

The state Supreme Court of Arizona has ruled that a century-old law banning nearly all abortions is enforced. When that measure which prohibits abortion except in cases where it's necessary to save the mother's life, carries a prison sentence of two to five years for abortion providers. Now, the court rules that the law now replaces Arizona's 15-week ban, but it won't take effect just yet. The court put its ruling on hold for two weeks and send the case back to lower court to hear the additional arguments. And Natasha Chen joins me now for the details from Los Angeles. Natasha, of course, you and I were talking about this in the last hour. I mean, this is a major ruling upholding its, you know, scratching my head here. 90s century band just talk us through the courts opinion first and foremost. NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Right. It's very confusing because they're all two seemingly two opposing rules in Arizona that this court was trying to clarify here and today, we understand that they are upholding this law that dates back to 1864, but was codified in 1901. What happens here is no one who provided abortion prior to this ruling will be subject to the penalty you described that two to five-year prison sentence. And this opinion, like you said, doesn't take effect for 14 calendar days. But this is, of course, a huge back-and-forth, a very winding road for the people of Arizona. And there is still more to be argued here about the constitutionality of this old law. This ruling today wasn't so much about whether that law is constitutional, it's whether it's still enforceable and we're getting strong reactions from people. The attorney general of Arizona saying this is unconscionable and an affront of freedom, also saying that as long as she is attorney general, no woman or doctor will be prosecuted under this, quote, draconian law in the state. So you have an attorney general there saying that there won't be an enforcement of a -- won't be prosecution of this and we have also at the same time a group of citizens trying to gather signatures to put this to voters in November. They are gathering signatures to try to enshrining abortion rights in the state's constitution. Because as it is, as you mentioned, this law dating back to 1860 says that nearly all abortions are banned except for the case when it is necessary to save the life of a mother, and the abortion provider can be put in prison for two to five years. Without Roe versus Wade, there's no independent right either in the state of Arizona or in federal law that would serve as the basis for the 15-week ban that the state passed in 2022. That's the courts argument. And therefore, this older law they say was on hiatus while Roe versus Wade was in effect essentially. And now it is back in effect, and that's why we start looking at something that was written into law before Arizona was a state, when women did not have the right to vote.",
