Now Austin is recovering well, and is in good spirits, according to the Pentagon press secretary. But outrage has been growing over the fact that the Pentagon did not publicly reveal that Austin was in the hospital until four days after he first checked in. The White House and President Biden, meanwhile, did not learn that Austin was hospitalized until last Thursday. And despite Austin's deputy, Kathleen Hicks, taking over some of his duties while on vacation in Puerto Rico, she was also not aware that he was hospitalized until days after he was admitted to Walter Reed. Now, Pentagon press secretary General Pat Ryder told CNN on Sunday that Austin, quote, \"has no plans to resign\" over the episode. And the White House insists that Biden still has full confidence in the secretary. An official told CNN that the two had a, quote, \"cordial conversation\" on Saturday evening, in which Biden told Austin that he looked forward to having him back at work. But still, questions remain as to why Austin and his team tried so hard to keep this condition a secret, and many Pentagon officials are now deeply frustrated that they were left in the dark. And some worry that it could have posed a national security risk, because the president and senior military leaders, including those in the chain of command, were not aware of Austin's whereabouts. Now Austin, for his part, did release a statement on Saturday night, praising the, quote, \"amazing staff at Walter Reed\" for the care he has received and said that he is, quote, \"on the mend\" and looking forward to returning to work.

The buildings they were in reduced to nothing more than rubble. \"Two houses have been destroyed to the ground,\" this official says.

Search operations are ongoing.\" Ukraine says Russia has stepped up attacks both on the ground and in the air in the past weeks, killing nearly 120 civilians and wounding almost 500 more since December 29th, according to the U.N. The U.S. claims Russia has even used missiles procured from North Korea to attack Kharkiv, in Northeastern Ukraine. Moscow hasn't commented so far, and Ukrainian authorities investigating the wreckage say they haven't yet come to a final conclusion about the missile's origin. \"Most likely, this missile was either supplied by North Korea, or was produced recently using blueprints and technology supplied by Russia to third countries or to North Korea,\" this official says.

That's a massive number that we're talking about and a huge boost to Maldives's economy.Now coming back to this controversy, it all started last week when the Indian prime minister was visiting Lakshadweep, which is a part of India, just off the Southwestern coast of India. It's a chain of islands there. And he was promoting tourism there. And he was talking about the pristine beaches out there. After that, there was a lot of conversation on social media on how Lakshadweep could be a destination for tourists from India to visit instead of Maldives. To which you had those three officials that you just spoke about, going on social media and making those comments against the Indian prime minister. That led to a huge furor in Indian social media, again, with a lot of them even wanting to boycott tourism to Maldives. There were hash tags doing the rounds, stating that maybe India is a better destination than Maldives, particularly Lakshadweep, after the prime minister made his visit there. Now straight after that, because of the tensions rising between Maldives and India ever since the election of the president there last year, there was a comment, rather statement that came out from the government there. And I'm going to read from it, what the Maldives government said. \"The government of Madives is aware of the derogatory remarks on social media platforms against foreign leaders and high-ranking individuals. These opinions are personal and do not represent the views of the government of Maldives.\" So clearly, distancing themselves from those three officials and then suspending them. What's interesting here is they've been suspended and not sacked, though there has been a lot of demand by Indians on social media that these three individuals should be sacked. Now straight after that, we have seen that there has been this apology, or rather this comment from the Maldives government. The president is also on a trip to China that started last evening. He's on a state visit. According to analysts, Michael, there's always been an \"India first\" policy with the previous government of Maldives. But with this president, it's more for \"China first\" policy. And this has been seen as a snub to India, with this visit to China. Now, we also spoke to an analyst, Michael Kugelman, who puts into perspective the geopolitical significance of Maldives and why there is this competition in the Indian Ocean to make their footprint stronger in the region.
