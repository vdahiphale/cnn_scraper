I asked Iran expert and senior fellow for the Carnegie endowment, Karim Sajjapour, about its ballistic missile volley. Plus, on another front, Israel's ground offensive against Hezbollah. We get the view from the Lebanese foreign minister. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning that Iran, quote, \"will pay\" after firing around 200 ballistic missiles at military targets last night. Iran said it was in response to a raft of assassinations by Israel against its proxies and members of its own armed forces. Israel says along with its allies it intercepted almost all the incoming, and three military bases that were struck are already up and running again. When it comes to retaliation, the U.S. president, Joe Biden, says he does not support an attack on Iran's nuclear sites. Meantime, on its northern front, Israel is sending in more forces to fight against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The IDF says at least eight of its troops have been killed since their ground offensive began, while Lebanon says a thousand people have been killed in the past two weeks, with a million displaced. Now, almost swept from the headlines is Gaza. Very little mention of the remaining Israeli hostages there, or the nearly 90 Palestinians killed in the enclave just last night alone. We'll get crucial perspective from this throughout the region. But first, let's focus on Israel, and we are joined by former Israeli Prime Minister and former army chief Ehud Barak. Welcome back to our program, Prime Minister. So, I want to ask you, what are Israel's options now? What would you be thinking about were you still in position?",

It will help to understand the region, in spite of the fact that there is -- also his speech is only half of the truth. It's not the whole picture. But I can tell you the following, the founding father of Israel, Ben- Gurion, set a three maxims for going to war. Always have a superpower on your side, make the war very short, aggressive, assertive through the enemy's ground in order to end it quickly so you can still have legitimacy and to harvest the achievements in the battlefield be translated into diplomatic and political ones. And number three, always before, during, and after war hold firm your grip on the moral high ground. Israel is not alone in the world. We are strong, but not only potent. We need the world. We need North America. We need Western Europe. We need the likeminded countries. Altogether, some 40 countries on Earth. And never forget it. So, Netanyahu behaves as if he rejects aggressively all these three maxims one by one in the running of the world. That's why, in spite of the strength and he will take some of the credit of recent achievement of the last two weeks, but also, we always be responsible for the tragedy on 7th of October for running the most failing work since they were still in Gaza, the hostages are still there, as you have mentioned. And the right way had been, and is still the same, to put an end to the whole story in the south, to rescue the hostages, to come into this alliance, to bring inter Arab force into the Gaza Strip. The real victory over Sinwar is not to kill all his terrorists or to kill more Gazans, innocent Gazans. It is only if he's replaced by someone else, and that was neglected by Netanyahu from day one. The same applies in the north. We can enter. We have to do something. We cannot pretend to conquer Lebanon or to have a total victory in Lebanon. Again, Hezbollah should be -- it will end with certain internationally arranged political diplomatic arrangements.",

He offered a very, very far-reaching peace agreement to the Palestinians, which they did not take up in 2000 at Camp David. But I want to know in your period as the key official on this issue at the State Department, did you ever war game this kind of multifront battle that is happening right now? And did you, and do you believe that the United States would be the indispensable wingman, so to speak, if, for instance, Israel was going to go and strike targets in Iran and all the rest of it?

      "sentences": "Right. That's certainly a critical question. Israel does not need our active military support for a retaliatory response to the fusilladelaunched against Israel by Iran yesterday, depending on what target it chooses. If Israel does want to go after nuclear infrastructure, that would require some additional help from the United States. And President Biden, as you mentioned earlier, has said that he does not support such action. But in the long-term, if this is a regional war, if it does expand, Israel could potentially prevail in that conflict without active U.S. participation, but it could not prevail at an acceptable cost. And what I mean by that is the number of casualties that Israel would sustain, Israeli civilians, as well as Israeli soldiers would be prohibitive. And Israel's power projection capability is quite impressive via the air, but they don't have the same expeditionary capacity with the IDF ground forces. The idea of the IDF deploying in large numbers to Iran or to Yemen is something that is well beyond anything Israel has ever contemplated. We have thought about these scenarios. And from the very start of the war, one of our primary objectives was preventing the war in Gaza from metastasizing into a regional war because of the immense level of risk that's involved. Unfortunately, and despite efforts to prevent it from spreading, we seem to be closer to that point, if not at that point than ever before. And managing that escalation risk while ensuring that we're not creating incentives for Iran or other actors to join the fray is going to be a very difficult balancing act.",

Because again, on one hand, there is a Khamenei doctrine, which is when you're under pressure, either domestically or externally, don't give into pressure, don't retreat because that's going to encourage the pressure. But also, as Hannah Arendt said, even the most radical revolutionary becomes a conservative the day after the revolution because they have a lot to lose. They want to preserve something.
