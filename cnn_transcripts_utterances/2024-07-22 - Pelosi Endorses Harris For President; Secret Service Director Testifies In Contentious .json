Right around then, the Trump campaign realized that the Democratic hand-wringing over the Biden's debate performance wasn't going to end. And so they started researching the potential replacement Democrats. They started really zeroing in on Vice President Harris as the most likely person to replace Joe Biden. They did that internal poll, pitting Donald Trump against Harris and seeing how they locked in certain swing states. And now they've started already on their messaging and attacking Vice President Harris. You are seeing -- you saw at the convention, she was the most attacked person on that stage, other than Joe Biden. That was something that the Democrats that the Trump campaign had reached out to surrogates, suggesting that they do. We also have seen new ad from a super PAC supporting Donald Trump, which has already on the air in four different states, in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where they are going to try to hurt her early and often, try to identify her before she can get up on the airwaves herself. And we're going to see now from Senator J.D. Vance, in his first appearance as a candidate by himself, he is going to be testing some of those lines. We're going to get an early window into how he intends and the Trump campaign intends to attack Senator Harris going forward. This is a big event for him. It's in his hometown of Middleton, obviously, the setting of his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" And it's going to be the first chance for Republican voters to really hear from him just by himself.",

She's been asked about overwatch at the rally. But she's not providing details. And some of this is quite performative, of course, on the part of some of these members of Congress. But there's also a very legitimate frustration with her appearance there today. ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yes, I think that the keyword there, Brianna is \"legitimate.\" So I have to say, I mean, my heart goes out to her. This is a really tough day. Anyone who's running an agency and has had to go before Congress and answer these questions in the aftermath of some sort of problem, it's never pleasant. So, and I feel bad for on that count. However, I think she's made some really serious tactical mistakes in the way that she has chosen not to provide factual information that she has. And the provision of which would not jeopardize really any sort of an ongoing criminal investigation. Often, we are in the unenviable position of having to say we can't share information because it's part of a criminal investigation. A defendant's rights are at risk. We don't want to compromise evidence that might be used in the investigation. That's sort of thing. That is obviously not the case here. She could have come in today and said, I don't have complete information, we haven't finished our investigations, but I will share with you what we know so far. With the caveat that some of these facts may change as we learn more, and just been more transparent about what she knows and doesn't know. And I think things would have gone a little bit better. You know, they're there to perform and beat up on her, no matter what she says. So you would have seen some of that anyway. But, yes, I think some mistakes were made here on the part of the Secret Service director.",

And I don't know -- maybe you can give us some idea of this. I don't know if that's normal, that she should or should not go to the site.

So there's no rule book for this one.Especially when they realized what a, what a challenging spot she was in on the communication side of this. Just to go out there to send that message, first and foremost, to her troops that she cares, that she wanted to see it for herself. That she has that deep an interest in the facts and what happened and getting to the bottom of this, that she went out they are put her own hands on it. I mean, that would have been very effective and important thing to do. It would have also helped her today in her answer to that question. But again, another decision or an omission of a decision that really has come back to hurt her and put her in a very bad light. I think she's an honorable person and has served our country well for many, many years. I don't want to -- I don't want to throw all kinds of rocks there. But, boy, it seems like she's in a very, very tough spot on this right now.",
