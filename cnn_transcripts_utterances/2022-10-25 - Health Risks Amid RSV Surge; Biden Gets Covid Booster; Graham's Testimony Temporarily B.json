So, in terms of the cases, Elizabeth, where do they stand this morning and are we starting to see an impact now beyond just children's hospital beds but on other emergency care services at these hospitals?",

      "sentences": "So, Erica, we are. They're being felt impacts throughout hospital systems.Let's take a look at this numbers. You can see from this graph that cases have gone up dramatically. Now, RSV cases always go up when the weather gets colder, but this is especially dramatic, especially early. So, this is really unusual and I think in many ways caught hospitals off guard. So, let's take a look at the effects in hospitals. For example, Seattle Children's emergency department, they're at 200 percent capacity. Rhode Island's Hasbro Children's Hospital, 125 percent capacity. In Illinois there are only 6 percent of pediatric intensive care unit beds available. So, what this means is that when children are showing up at some emergency rooms and they're not -- for whatever reason, and they're not in dire condition, they're having to wait for hours and hours and hours. Well, we've also been told by some parents that their children were scheduled to have a certain procedure for something and they've been told no you can't because the hospital is too busy. So, the one thing that parents -- the most important things that parents can do is they can get their children vaccinated against the flu. You do not want your children to get the flu. Children die of the flu every year and you don't want to have the guilt of taking up a hospital bed when it probably wasn't necessary. Get your child vaccinated against the flu. Flu season is picking up. We have this double problem now of RV and flu. Do your part. Get your child vaccinated. Get yourself vaccinated. Erica. HILL: Yes. Yes, you could always do them both together. That's always my reminder. I do it with my kids.",

Well, you may recall he had Covid a little over three months ago, so waiting that period of time is recommended before getting the booster.

And the White House insists that more need to get these shots, especially as the winter and holiday season is approaching. So, today, the president will talk about some of the government campaigns to try to encourage these booster shots, as well as bring together some leaders of major pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens, to talk about their efforts as well. Now, earlier today, Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the Covid-19 response here at the White House, said that the White House is very concerned about that convergence of Covid-19, flu and RSV, and argued that getting this booster shot will help lessen the strain on the hospital system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ASHISH JHA, WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We can't control everything, but there are things we can control. The two most important things right now are going out and getting the influenza shot, the flu shot, and going out and getting the new updated Covid shot. If people do those two things, then that really reduces the burden on the health care system and allows us to focus on taking care of kids with RSV. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I use that term justice very loosely, of course, because justice has alluded this case from the start. The rule of law has alluded this case from the start. Increasingly, the rule of law is absent in Russia writ large. That's why we made the determination a number of months ago that Brittney Griner is wrongfully held, just as is Paul Whelan, another American citizen who's been held in Russia for far too long.As you alluded to, we did put forward what we called a substantial proposal a number of months ago to Russian authorities. Secretary Blinken made public the news of that substantial proposal right here in this briefing room a few months ago now. We continue to engage with the Russians. Those conversations have taken place even in recent days. This has not been a static process.

We are confident that bipartisan support will continue.When it comes to diplomacy, no one wants to see an end to this war more than our Ukrainian partners. And our Ukrainian partners, including, up to, and including President Zelenskyy have made clear that this war can only end through diplomacy and dialogue. The Ukrainians have repeatedly made that clear. Unfortunately, as you alluded to, it takes two to engage in dialogue. We have never heard a reciprocal message from the Russians that they are ready to engage in the sort of dialogue and diplomacy that we'll needed to end this war. Ultimately that is going to have to be diplomacy between Ukraine and Russia. In the meantime, we are there to support Ukraine. We're going to empower them on the battlefield that ultimately will empower them at the negotiating table if and when that develops. And when that negotiating table emerges, we will be right there with Ukraine as they engage in that diplomacy.",
