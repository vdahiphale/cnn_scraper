They cross to Mexico for just that, for medical procedures.According to the President of Mexico, he says that these individuals, once they crossed into Mexico, they were caught between two groups that were having some sort of confrontation that that's when the kidnapping happened. Now, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation, telling CNN and confirming that these Americans actually were in Mexico for a medical procedure and this was based on receipts that were found inside the car. Now according to the FBI, the four Americans crossed over to Mexico on Friday, and they were driving a minivan, a white minivan with North Carolina license plates. Now, that video that we just showed you, it's very raw, it's very dramatic. Be very careful if - in watching this video because it is graphic. It is not clear whether these are the individuals who are the Americans that are being held at gunpoint and loaded onto a car - onto the bed of a pickup truck. What we can tell you is that the FBI will not confirm that these images are indeed authentic, but CNN has confirmed by - with a US official who knows - who's familiar with the investigation, excuse me, that these are - that this is indeed the scene and also we have geo located those images and indeed this is the scene. We just don't know whether these are the actual Americans, but you see that it is a very intense scene. The video was very raw. The FBI has announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the Americans and also for the arrest of the individuals who are responsible. Now right now there is a press conference that is ongoing in Tamaulipas, Mexico. We're supposed to learn more from authorities there. From a snippet that I was able to hear right before going on air, Bianna and Victor, they were talking about authorities there going through some video, perhaps surveillance cameras and then, of course, that they are committed to finding the individuals who did this and, of course, to locating the missing Americans, Bianna and Victor.",

We did see that new video from the Wagner Group. Remember, Wagner has been really leading the charge when it comes to Russian forces around Bakhmut. They removed the Ukrainian flag from a monument. They planted their own flag, not the Russian flag, but the Wagner flag and raised their guns in the air. Meanwhile, we did hear from President Zelenskyy's office tonight saying that they continue to defend their positions, defend the city and they talked about reinforcing their positions. They didn't talk about surrender. But we have spent a lot of time in that area over the past few days. We've spent a lot of time on the main supply route between the neighboring town of Chasiv Yar and Bakhmut. There's a lot of military traffic on that road. I can tell you that it is getting very difficult to move in and out of Bakhmut. It is getting attacked by Russian forces. They blew up a bridge on that main supply route just a couple of days ago. We were told by local officials today that military engineers have erected a temporary bridge. So troops are able to move forward and back, people are able to come out and go in, but it is getting much more difficult. And Victor and Bianna, you're starting to hear this line, despite the fact that no withdrawal has been announced that even if Ukraine were to withdraw, that this would not actually be a strategic victory for Russia, that they will have lost so many men, they would have taken over this city that doesn't actually have any strategic value, that Ukraine is actually - was able to degrade Russian forces and buy time for a planned counter offensive, that at the end of the day, according to us and Ukrainian officials, it would not be that strategic victory for Russia, but it really would be a loss for Ukraine. They also have lost a lot of men in this fight. They have lost professional soldiers, why - while on the Russian side, so many of the people who have been killed have been convicts in the mercenary group. So at the end of the day, this would be a symbolic victory for Russia, but it really is up for debate how strategic it would be. One last thing, I did speak with the Deputy Mayor of Bakhmut today who said there are still some 4,000 to 5,000 people who are still in the city. They're trying to get as many out as possible around five to 10 per day, if they're lucky. The people in there he says they simply don't want to leave because they say they don't know where they would go that they don't have any money. They're scared. They're scared to go out on that road. And he said that his overwhelming feeling when thinking about his city right now is fear and sadness, Victor and Bianna.",

Ukraine realizing if they don't fight them on the line in Bakhmut and they decide at some point to withdraw and to move back towards the west, that'll simply be the new line at which they fight the Russians and that perhaps another reason that they've decided to hold or at least fight for the City of Bakhmut as long as possible as both sides suffer very high losses here, Bianna and Victor.",

This is an advantageous way to hold for as long as they can.Look, Bianna, there's no doubt that the Russians have superiority of artillery. Secretary Austin has acknowledged that. The thing is they're firing - they have more artillery troops and they're firing more ammunition on a daily basis than the Ukrainians. We just got to get a more help. And until that time, they're going to have a hard time holding, and the Ukrainians are taking casualties. But this is war, and it's their country and they want to hold it.",

Assuming that Ukrainians at some point do retreat, here's what he wrote: \"The reality is that if the Russians do capture Bakhmut, they are seizing rubble. It is a town with minimal strategic importance with almost no remaining infrastructure to support an occupying force. That the Russians have invested so much, and its capture speaks volumes about their poor strategy in this war.\" Would you agree with that assessment?",

If you had 500,000 people and you lost 30,000 people, 40,000 people in a month when you took Bakhmut, you might say that's insignificant if you were a Russian commander.Now, if you're an American commander or Ukrainian commander, and you're losing 30,000 troops over that piece of ground, that's really significant. But if you're a Russian commander and they're pushing those troops forward and say use them up, use them up, use them up and you got to break through in Bakhmut or you significantly degrade the Ukrainians on balance from the Russian perspective, it might be worth it.

They're driving the economy off the cliff, they're going to cause a recession. But also from other people who are worried that the Fed isn't doing enough because inflation remains high, despite as you can see on your screen, all of those interest rate hikes. Now, this testimony tomorrow and also on Wednesday from Powell it's just one important event that's happening, what is shaping up to be a consequential week for the economy.
