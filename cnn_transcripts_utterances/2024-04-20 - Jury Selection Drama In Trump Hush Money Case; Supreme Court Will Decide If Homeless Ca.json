They're going to argue Donald Trump's intent here was to interfere, of course with the campaign, to hide the information the allegation about stormy Daniels affair from the public. But I think Donald Trump's defense, I don't -- I do not actually agree that he needs to take the stand in order to make that defense. I think he can do it, as you said, through the prosecution witnesses.And the closest example we have to this is the John Edwards trial back in 2012. He made a similar defense ultimately successfully, where he said his team argued the reason for the payments was to protect against personal humiliation. John Edwards never took the stand. They managed to do that through the prosecution's old witnesses. By the way, the witnesses, Michael Cohen doesn't have to say Donald Trump wanted to protect his family, he won't say that. But as long as they establish that Donald Trump had a wife and children, and any normal human being would be embarrassed by the this disclosure, that's enough for the defendant to make that argument.",

The anti-Trump sentiment is so prevalent in the county, and during the process, it came to the surface. So all the jurors, who expressed that they didn't like Donald Trump, they didn't like what he stood for, they said bad things about him, he repels them, they're eliminated, many of them self-eliminated. And then when it got down to the process, they answered more questions and they were given more targeted questioning. So finally, even at the point where the lawyers got to use their strikes, they got to get rid of another 10 other jurors. So at this point, it's looking like a good open minded neutral jury, you have some business types, you have couple people in finance or somebody in sales that might connect in some way with Donald Trump. There's two lawyers on the jury. So at this point, I think he's got to be feeling pretty good about the jury giving him and maintaining his presumption of innocence.",

The United States Supreme Court will hear arguments on Monday to determine if cities across the nation can enforce laws that curb homeless encampments from forming in public spaces, from parks to sidewalks and school grounds. This landmark decision will be the most critical ruling addressing the homeless crisis in America in more than 40 years.At the center of this national debate is Grants Pass Oregon, where the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling that blocked the city from enforcing a ban on public camps for the homeless. The court's ruling from a previous case found that punishing the homeless was considered cruel and unusual punishment and unconstitutional unless the municipality enforcing that rule could provide a bed for its entire homeless population. Advocates for the homeless argue there aren't public shelters to accommodate everyone living many homeless people know where to go. Proponents for the stricter policies against homeless encampments argue that these living conditions are dangerous because 1000s of people are dying in the streets while issues like mental health, drug addiction, and housing costs remain unsolved. Joining me now is the attorney who will be making the first oral arguments of this high profile case on behalf of the City of Grants Pass Oregon, Theane Evangelis. She's a partner in the firm of Gibson Dunn. Council, welcome back. There's an awful lot riding on this case, right? I mean, the eyes of all cities and municipalities are looking at the Supreme Court to try and bring some parameters to this discussion. THEANE EVANGELIS, REPRESENTING GRANTS PASS, O.R.: That's right, the stakes could not be higher. This case is about making sure that cities have the tools they need to address an escalating crisis on our streets and public spaces. This is an issue of public health and safety. And the court decisions all across the western United States have made things so much worse. They've created a tragedy on our streets and in our parks.",

And we think that it's cruel to leave people on the streets in these conditions.We think that we need to intervene, and we need to have the ability to keep public spaces safe and clean for everyone. And it's true, homelessness is a complex policy issue. These are policy decisions that need to be made on a local level, balancing all of the competing needs of our communities.

Friday, the university compounded its initial error, in my view, of canceling one commencement speaker by now canceling all of them. And in doing so, they harmed a rich tradition of colleges hosting speakers with a variety of the views. The controversy began when after awarding a graduation day speech to the valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, the university then canceled that speech citing unspecified security concerns. Tabassum, who studied biomedical engineering with an interest in global health care equity, had posted a link on Instagram to a pro-Palestinian Web site criticizing Israel. The link contained content that some pro-Israel groups considered to be anti-Semitic. Those groups then launched a campaign against her. In canceling her appearance, USC wrote in a release, \"The intensity of feelings fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement. Tabassum said this to CNN's Abby Phillip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASNA TABASSUM, VALEDICTORIAN WHO'S SPEECH HAS BEEN CANCELED BY USC: I think there's a nuance here.
