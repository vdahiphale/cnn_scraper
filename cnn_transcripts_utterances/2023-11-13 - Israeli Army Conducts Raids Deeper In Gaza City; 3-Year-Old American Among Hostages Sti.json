Time is running out for patients in Gaza's hospitals as life-saving equipment is shut down due to critical fuel shortages. And as the humanitarian crisis grows, Israeli leaders doubling down on their goal to eliminate Hamas.Plus, the U.S. and Chinese presidents will meet on the sidelines of a major summit in San Francisco this week. We'll discuss what's at stake as Xi Jinping makes his first visit to the United States in years. We begin in the Middle East, where the medical situation in Gaza is growing even more dire by the hour as Israel steps up its war against Hamas. Israeli forces say they went deeper into Gaza City on Sunday, reaching the outskirts of the Al-Shati refugee camp and conducting raids in multiple areas. The IDF says it's arrested 20 alleged Hamas members, including some accused of taking part in the October 7 attacks on Israel. In the meantime, multiple hospitals in Gaza closing due to airstrikes and lack of fuel. Health officials and aid agencies say patients, staff and thousands of displaced civilians trapped inside Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, due to fighting nearby. The Israeli military says it put 300 liters of fuel at the entrance to the Al-Shifa Hospital complex on Sunday, providing this video of the fuel being carried by soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify the contents of the video. The IDF says Hamas blocked the hospital from receiving the fuel, but the director of the Al-Shifa Hospital says the staff had been too scared to go out to get it. And he also said the fuel would have provided power to run the generators for only about 30 minutes. Nada Bashir has more on the dire situation in Gaza hospitals and a warning some of the video you're about to see is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voiceover): These are the sounds of the final gasps from Gaza's collapsing healthcare system. Medical staff in Gaza City working under near relentless Israeli bombardment for over a month. But now this chorus of frantic voices seen here working under torchlight, tells its own gut wrenching story. The-Al Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza, has now collapsed. The hospital no longer operational, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. But these scenes are all too familiar across the besieged Gaza Strip. The vast majority of hospitals here are already completely out of service, the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah says, and those remaining now on a cliff edge. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There is a direct injury in the head, internal bleeding, and we can't do surgeries. No surgeries, no oxygen, no electricity. We work manually. We are using a manual resuscitator. It is a clear injury. It needs an urgent surgery, a life-saving one. He is less than a year old.",

And so that is what Israel is up against. At the same time, as I have said and as President Biden and Secretary Blinken have said, we are democracies.

Officials say they are continuing to gather more information about the deadly crash. Mr. Austin and top defense officials from Japan and South Korea have agreed on a plan for real time data sharing on North Korean missile launches starting next month. That's according to South Korea's Defense Ministry. The agreement came during annual security talks in Seoul, which Austin has been attending. They've largely focused on ways the three countries can counter threats from North Korea, including a strategy in which the United States will use its military and nuclear assets to deter Pyongyang and defend allies. While Austin and his South Korean counterparts also signed documents updating their country's bilateral deterrence strategy.

Greatly appreciate your reporting.Now, joining me from Taipei, Taiwan, is Bethany Allen, China reporter for Axios and author of \"Beijing Rules, How China Weaponized its Economy to Confront the World.\" So good to have you with us, Bethany. The American and Chinese president is due to talk for the first time in more than a year, and it's been a very tense year. What will you be watching for? BETHANY ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN, AXIOS CHINA REPORTER: Well, first of all, I will be watching to see if they do indeed announce that there will be a resumption of military to military communications. This is something that, according to our reporting at Axios, that both leaders are preparing to launch if they're able to come to that consensus. Now, the reason this is so important is that this is the top issue between the U.S. and China. This is the money issue. Will these two countries come be embroiled in a military conflict? And one of the best ways to prevent that from happening is to have stronger ties and communication between the militaries. We've seen that this year, earlier this year with the spy balloon incident and the refusal of the Chinese side to pick up a phone call from the U.S. Defense secretary. We've seen that in recent weeks, as there have been some dangerous maneuvers over the South China Sea between the Chinese Air force and the U.S. side. What analysts repeat over and over is that the risks of an unintentional military conflict are one of the biggest things that two sides can resolve. Second is I would look for some other kinds of deliverable on climate cooperation. This is something that the U.S. has maintained that they are very interested in. working with China on. The climate envoy John Kerry has continued to meet his Chinese counterpart, and there may be some chance that the Chinese side would also agree to work with the U.S. on trying to prevent Chinese made fentanyl from coming into the US. This is also something that the Chinese side. Last year, after Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, they cut off a working group on fentanyl. So I would be looking at that.

So it's going to be another really crucial year.I want to ask you just in, you know, obviously President Biden's foreign policy strategy from the get go has been to focus on China, rally the world's support for Ukraine and pivot away from the Mideast. Now, of course, we're living through this moment where the world's eyes are on the conflict in the Mideast. And there are many accusations in the global south about U.S. double standards. I'm wondering, does China stand to benefit from this moment, for lack of a better terminology? Does it strengthen its position in the global South? ALLEN-EBRAHIMIAN: I think that's a very nuanced answer, but if we want to speak somewhat simply, I think yes, especially when it comes to the Israel-Hamas conflict, because many countries and many populations in the global south do feel a sense of solidarity with the people in Gaza. And to see that the U.S. is supporting Israel, you know, despite the large tonnage of bombs that Israel is dropping on the Gaza Strip, I think to global south audiences it can feel like another redux of a U.S. backed imperialistic war. Now, of course, to be clear, Hamas as a terrorist organization committed a massacre in Israel. And I don't think that's certainly popular in China, you know, there's no animosity in China towards Israel. But this sense that Beijing's leaders have presenting an alternative pole, another sort of strength source of power in the world that can offer an alternative to what the U.S. offers and has traditionally offered in the Middle East is very appealing. And even to speak, you know, less broadly than the global south among Arab populations that the Chinese government has already been targeting through the Belt and Road Initiative and other such initiatives. Certainly this has great appeal to see that Beijing is not taking Hamas' side, but has refused to condemn Hamas and has criticized Israel and the U.S. for what Beijing says is going beyond the measures that would have been appropriate in such a case.",

We are talking depths of about ten kilometers at absolute best. What that usually signifies is movement of magma underneath the ground. Now it doesn't guarantee a volcanic eruption but the key thing to notice is this particular area is one of the most seismically active areas on the planet. It's that link between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates. Now because of the flurry of earthquake activity on that southwestern side, Iceland did declare a state of emergency, evacuating the town of Grindavik, again in anticipation that something may or may not happen in the coming hours and the days. Now, one thing that is going to be looked at and kept a close eye on not only now but over the next few days because we have seen this in the past. If it does trigger some type of volcanic eruption, the concern becomes all of those particulates going up into the air and any impacts it may have on air travel. Right now we've got two different systems out over the Atlantic. Storm Debbie, which is making its way towards the U.K. and a secondary low- pressure system. Both of those systems as they continue to slide the next couple of days are going to keep most of the winds around Iceland pushing down towards the west and southwest. Which means if there was some type of eruption, it's going to keep those particulates away from mainland Europe. However, a lot of that can change and it also depends if and when there even is some type of eruption. So certainly something we will have to keep a close eye on in the coming days. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
