We're going to begin this morning, though, with that high-stakes meeting that we have just learned about.Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin next Monday. This is going to be Xi's first trip to Russia since Putin invaded Ukraine over a year ago. Beijing has attempted to present itself as a neutral party, maybe even a peace broker in all of this as this war. But they've also been providing economic and diplomatic support to the Kremlin. And CNN reported last month that the U.S. does have intelligence suggesting China is considering providing Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine. We're also getting new details this morning on that dramatic video you saw yesterday, the U.S. drone that was forced down by a Russian fighter jet over the Black Sea. But the U.S. and Moscow are now in the hunt for the wreckage. Russia got there first. The U.S. does believe Russia has now recovered some of that debris. We have team coverage here. CNN's Ivan Watson is live in Kharkiv, Ukraine. But first, let's go to CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who is at the Pentagon. Natasha, you know, this meeting potentially has incredibly implications.

This growing military partnership where we have seen China provide technology, as well as equipment to the Russians but have not yet provided that lethal aid. That is the big piece of this that U.S. officials are watching for, that weaponry that China is apparently considering providing but has not yet taken that step. Now, the -- Russians and Chinese did declare a no-limits partnership at the beginning of the war. The partnership has only grown ever since. Xi and Putin, the president of Russia, they have spoken many, many times since the war began. Xi Jinping has actually not yet spoken to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, which is something that the U.S. has been urging him to do. The Chinese also introduced a 12-point so-called peace plan for the war in Ukraine that U.S. officials are extremely skeptical of.

But look, we are learning that the U.S., amid all of this drama, is assessing its drone operations over the Black Sea. Because they don't want this to happen again.

It's also working with Oracle to give that company oversight of its content moderation algorithms. But the concern from Washington is that any Chinese company, by law, has to give data over to China. And so even though TikTok says they're doing all these things to mitigate concern, if they still have Chinese shareholders, of which there are a lot, they're going to be beholden to this law, and that poses a national security risk.",

Does it mean that every single shareholder in the company right now needs to outright sell the company fully to a U.S. firm? Does it mean that the folks who have Chinese citizenship, who would be beholden to a law like that would have to sell their stakes? So that would be most of the employees and the founders. It's about 40 percent.But what will it do, Don? It would ensure that a U.S. company has oversight, essentially, of how this app works. Meaning it would have oversight over the data privacy of U.S. users and have a content algorithms work. In the past, we've seen two examples where this could actually be pretty helpful. In 2019, there was a \"Guardian\" report that TikTok in the U.S. was filtering out algorithms that were spreading negative messages around the CCP. Algorithms, hashtags, messages, etc. And then also, more recently, there is a report that the ByteDance employees were using the app to spy on U.S. journalists. So those are two concrete examples. Both of which, by the way, TikTok executives have admitted have occurred and, you know, are true, where if there was ownership by a U.S. company, that would be less likely to happen.",

Basically, it would allow Oracle, which is an American company, to store the data of American users on the app. And it says it would safeguard against influence from China, arguing, you know, the data behind -- the idea behind it is that it won't matter what the Chinese law says or any law, because they're taking U.S. user data and and putting it out of their reach.But are they really?

Right, Kaitlan?If the company that actually outright owns it is American, then, of course, you can ensure their word when they say they've migrated all the data over. If it's not an American company, there's a concern that they're not telling the truth. Another big issue here is the algorithm. You know, Chinese government has tried so hard to protect the I.P. of Chinese tech companies. Part of the concern that they have with ByteDance selling a stake or selling the app would be would they be able to sell the algorithm?
