And in fact, we have some quotes here about, excuse me,  about things like, we will root out my political opponents that live like vermin,  that was Trump, and Hitler said, pests and vermin, immigrants are poisoning the blood of the country. Hitler contamination of the blood and inferior race will lead to the fall of Germany.",

But that's also the same realization that George W. Bush had in 2004, that Barack Obama had in 2012. Every successful incumbent reelection has been based on framing this as a choice.

They have all often said Biden campaign people and people -- Democrats that once Trump becomes more of a focus, then voters will remember what it was like back then when he was in power. But Biden has been -- has not said that much that often about Trump. Yes, he hits him every now and then, but he has not been pounding that message, and it's interesting that it's taken them so long to come to it.",

And also, look what he said he was going to do that he didn't do. And look at that record. And if they'd started doing it in, let's say, September, October, when a lot of the political chattering class was talking about why aren't they doing it more, that it just would have become part of what was in the ether.

You know, and presidents are always hemmed in. And they're very, you know, it's difficult for them to get out of their bubble as much.So it's definitely the strategy. It's probably the only winning strategy has -- as Ramesh was just saying there that it's what Bush did, it's what Obama did. Obviously, it's what Reagan did, but I still think that it overlooks the challenges of Biden really consolidating his own base and his own party. But one thing that when I have conversation with Biden advisers, they say they're looking forward to the primary process being over. So people actually see that Biden is the nominee as well.
