So people have a terrifying night that is still ongoing on the West coast. 35 mile per hour latest winds with the storm.But look at the rainfall totals. This is really impressive coming out of San Bernardino County. Raywood Flats, over 10 and a half inches of rain. Keep in mind, that elevation, about 7,000 feet. But that water needs to go somewhere. Right? Unfortunately, it funnels down into the communities and valleys below. We have roughly about 9 million people under a flash flood warning right now. And this includes portions of Los Angeles County. And I want you to see just the amount of moisture that moved in with Hilary as it started to impact the region late yesterday and into the overnight hours. This is almost streaming, some of this moisture, in from the Pacific Ocean. Look at that population: 7 million Americans. Well, here's why this is important. There is a mountain range here that's called the Transverse Mountains. And basically, the rainfall running perpendicular to the mountain ranges. So acting like a sponge. It's literally pushing against that wall, the mountain, and it is extracting all the available water out of it. And that water is in the form of heavy rain that funnels into the narrow channels, and it rapidly rises. The creeks, the river beds and unfortunately the dry desert that is at the base of these mountain ranges. This is a rainfall accumulation estimate from our radar. And you can see just outside of L.A. over 5 inches of rain. That's a significant amount of precipitation in a heavily-concreted area. So impermeable surfaces. This water has nowhere to go but flow on the surface and, unfortunately, cause that flash flooding. Hey, look, it's not just Southern California. It's Nevada. It's Idaho. It's all the way into Montana. This is all moisture associated with post Tropical Clone Hilary that continues to wallop the West Coast. Where does it go from here? Well, we have another 12 hours or so of more rain over the West before it starts to rain itself out. And the flash -- flash-flooding threat continues right through this morning into midday -- Victor, Poppy.",

Before that, we're likely to see activity as soon as today, because there will be lawyers that want to negotiate on behalf of their clients, even before their clients need to come in so that that can be as seamless as is possible when the arrests do happen at the jail. This jail is a very populated jail. It has about 2,500 people in it. It's also a place that's been quite beleaguered over time. It has quite a bit of issues, historically, with the treatment of different people who are being held there in detention. And so nobody wants to spend very much time in the jail at all. And so to get around that or to make that as seamless as possible, there are going to be different lawyers coming in to meet with the district attorney here, Fani Willis, near the courthouse where her offices would be. That's what we expect, at least. And whenever they negotiate, they will negotiate, essentially, bail terms to make everything go very smoothly and also to get them to that arraignment as quickly as possible, as well.",

He's pointed out to the court already that he's not charged in the federal case in D.C., where the Justice Department has charged Donald Trump. He's not even a co-conspirator there. And, thus, because what he was doing for Trump in the White House at the time was part of his official duties, that all should get tossed.
