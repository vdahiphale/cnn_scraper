But I'm actually 250 miles to the north of that area in the north of Israel, where there is a possibility, a very dangerous possibility of a second front opening because we're just very close to the border with Lebanon and Syria and there are big concerns in Israel and elsewhere across the region as well. That once that land invasion begins, countries or groups like the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, may choose to enter the war and strike targets inside northern Israel.Certainly, the Israeli Defense Forces say that they're not going to be taken by surprise on this occasion. They've deployed forces in this region. We're with a battalion of Israeli troops close to the Lebanese border right now. They've also got elements of their iron dome missile defense system in place here in northern Israel. But the big concern is that Hezbollah, if it does enter the war, has a vast arsenal of missiles. And, you know, it could, you know, really change the sort of geopolitical situation in the region if Hezbollah attacks and if Israel makes good on its promise to strike back, potentially to destroy Lebanon if that happens.",

And in that arena, you have Hezbollah, you have Iran, the Iranian foreign minister who was in Beirut just a few days ago. And I think Iran and Hezbollah are watching the situation in Gaza. Certainly, they are keeping the -- that front a bit warm to keep the Israelis sort of distracted and keep some of their forces in the north, but I don't think they've made a decision to escalate into opening a second front.

Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. See how Saudi Arabia is in touch with Tehran. Saudi Arabia was also beginning to look at talks with Israel before all of this erupted. And of course, Cairo in Egypt is a very important capital as well, since it's a territory about the southern Gaza Strip. So there's a lot of attempts to find a diplomatic pathway.

I mean, first, we have to understand that Hamas and its backers, Hezbollah and Iran, probably designed the action of Hamas in order to elicit a ground invasion and an attack. They, you know, any military planner would know that any such attack inside Israel would automatically create a reaction.So one has to wonder, you know, what Hamas has in store. Certainly, they've been preparing for, you know, an invasion for many, many years. Hezbollah has a lot of experience with Israeli invasions. So one must keep in mind that Hamas will not be taken by surprise. And while civilians have nowhere to hide, I'm sure Hamas fighters, Hamas officials have many places to hide, have many escape routes. And I doubt that, you know, an Israeli action will be able to stamp out Hamas or defeat it completely. Also, I mean, Israel is really reacting to a very, very horrific attack on its citizens and its civilians, as well as some military personnel. But so far, it's largely a reaction. One can see what they wish to do, but it's not very clear that they have an end game in mind. If they do succeed in occupying the -- in the whole territory, holding that territory is very, very difficult and costly. There's no other third party which would easily come back into this territory and try to govern it. So that's why I think the diplomacy, the U.S.-led diplomacy, regional diplomacy after the first few days and weeks of this episode, there's going to have to be some serious, you know, negotiation and diplomacy, including to release of the 150 captives.",

Palestinian officials say at least 53 people have been killed, more than 1,000 injured. CNN's Becky Anderson reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): A disturbing sight. An Israeli settler shooting a Palestinian point blank in the South Hebron Hills. While the man who was shot in this video did survive, many others who confronted with settler violence across the occupied West Bank recently have not. CNN has reached out to Israel's police for comment on this shooting but has not received a response. Nearly a week into the war between Hamas and Israel, at least 47 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by settlers and Israeli forces, with hundreds of others injured. Fears that the violence would spill over into this area are beginning to feel very real. At the heart of the conflict, this place, Al-Aqsa Mosque, usually filled with tens of thousands of worshippers, gathered for Friday prayers. Today, almost empty. The Israeli police restricting access to the compound only letting in the elderly. 57-year-old Untama (ph) says, seeing the compound so empty is upsetting. The atmosphere was so tense. It was difficult getting in, she says. We are just going there to pray. We're not going to fight. We're not going to war. What is a worshipper expected to do? Meantime, piles of prayer mats as younger Palestinians were forced to worship on the streets. Abbas (ph) was one of them. He says, this feels like an inflection point in this decades-long conflict. It's very different this time around, he says. This time it feels more difficult. May God grant us relief. Fridays can be fraught here. Over the years, all too often, these streets have witnessed clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. And today, stun grenades, tear gas, and skunk water used to disperse local residents and worshippers. Munir Kamal (ph) was reportedly one of them. His nephew, Qasem (ph), said that his uncle was attacked by Israeli police as he tried to pray close to his home after being barred from Al-Aqsa. Like many civilians here, Qasem (ph) fears for his family's safety. What's happening is very ugly. I can't explain it to my kids. I'm trying to distract them, so they don't get scared, Qasem says. So, many people here scared about what happens next. They robbed us of our homeland, and now they punish us here in Al- Aqsa, and they punish the people of Gaza. They annihilated this small, tight space. Why? Why do they deserve that, she says. Becky Anderson, CNN, East Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's called combat in hell because you have to like walk down the street and get punched in the face to find where the enemy is. And then once you find them, most of your weapons really challenged to punch through steel, concrete, reinforced, you know, concrete. So that's why you see much more use of artillery.

But if you can move all throughout the city under those tunnels, they'll have planned for -- to attack you once pop up behind you, move to the next building and that's why it just takes so long.

When you look at what has been a fairly steady creeping rise in anti-Semitism over the course of the last 20 years, and I'm speaking here, Michael, of acts, but speech as well, as measured not least by the European Unions' commission. There has been always.When you look at spikes in anti-Semitic acts and speech in Europe, there is a correlation with spikes in tension in the Middle East. So even as you saw tensions flare in the Middle East, the fear was that that would once again spread here to Europe and that is exactly what happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over): Far from the front lines of the Israel-Hamas war, many European Jews say they're not just feeling the pain of what's happening there, but also fearing the potential ramifications much closer to home. In France, at the Great Synagogue in Marseille, a prayer is held for the people of Israel. It's a fervent prayer after reports of anti- Semitic incidents in parts of Europe, after Hamas launched its assault on Israel more than a week ago and Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza. MARC MEIMOUN, WORSHIPPER (through translator): First of all, it's important to be present whenever the Jewish people are in danger. Unfortunately, we're used to this kind of gathering, this kind of prayer. We're tired of it all. Nevertheless, we have to respond in unity. BELL (voice-over): France is home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as well as the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged his citizens to remain united, though French police used water cannon and tear gas to break up a recent rally in support of the Palestinian people, which had been banned by French officials citing concerns about public order. But there are fears of further unrest in France. 10,000 police officers have been deployed to protect synagogues and Jewish schools. And on Friday, France raised its security alert to the highest level after a knife attack at a school, the French interior minister says, was linked to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The U.K. is also stepping up security after reports of increased anti- Semitic incidents. The Community Security Trust, a British non-profit organization that monitors anti-Semitism, says the number of incidents reported to them in the past week has increased by more than 300 percent compared to the same period last year. Tensions at times spilling out onto the streets of London where flyers of Israelis reportedly kidnapped by Hamas were torn down.",
