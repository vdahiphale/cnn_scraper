Sources telling CNN the president-elect is considering one of his fiercest allies, Kash Patel for FBI director.This as we're tracking all the fallout from Trump's other provocative picks. We will tell you why House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing back on calls to release an ethics investigation into Trump's choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. And it's deadline day for Rudy Giuliani, the former Trump attorney and former New York City mayor on the clock to turn over valuable assets to election workers that he defamed or faced possible jail time. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our coverage begins tonight with the Trump transition. It's been a very busy week, full of provocative picks, and it appears the president-elect might be on the verge of yet another very provocative pick. Let's get straight to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's outside Trump transition headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida, for us, Kristen, Trump is weighing a very controversial name to lead the FBI.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf. We are told that MAGA allies are trying to push for Kash Patel, someone who has been a loyalist to Donald Trump, a loyalist to the cause for several years to try and lead the FBI.Now, it's uncertain how exactly Donald Trump is going to handle this. But one thing we know about Kash Patel is he's somebody who, forward- facing, has essentially said the same thing that Donald Trump has said that he wants to do, dismantle the FBI, take apart the Department of Justice. And now after he named attorney general Matt Gaetz, it certainly seems as though that could be a possibility that he would choose Kash Patel. One thing to keep in mind here, when you talk to members of Donald Trump's inner circle, they really are split on Patel. You do have a faction of people who believe he's a loyalist, that he believes he's good in this position, but there's also people who believe that he's gone too far and also that he's unconfirmable for a position at the FBI. Obviously, we'll have to wait and see. However, as we've seen this week, Wolf, Donald Trump doesn't seem to really put that much stock into who is confirmable or not. Just a little bit of a rundown of people who he has nominated for various positions, as we said, Matt Gaetz, we know that at one point or at some point that it's likely that this ethics complaint is going to come out. We'll see how that affects the confirmation process and going through that approval process. We know that there are Republicans who were shocked by that decision. The other one to keep an eye on is Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. We do know that these claims, our investigative team putting forward reporting, that California officials confirmed that there was a police investigation into sexual assault involving Hegseth back in 2017. So, that could impact any kind of confirmation there. And the other one, RFK. RFK Jr. is someone who is considered, largely up until Donald Trump named him, unconfirmable by a number of people. I mean, remember, he is an anti-vaxxer who has pushed conspiracy theories around health. But Donald Trump said on the campaign trail he was going to put RFK in charge of health, and he did. So, clearly, he's sticking by his candidates for now.",

We're all sitting in D.C. saying that these qualifications need to come from a place of experience, and we measure it in a certain way. Donald Trump's coming in and saying, we're going to blow this up. And you see this from the DOGE, you know, efficiency committee that he's put together and a lot of these other things. And my question remains, you know, how do we actually determine in this new mandate what is qualified and what isn't? Because I think that that's going to be what Trump is going to say is, I don't want people that go in and can maneuver the bureaucracy and pull these levers. I want people to go in and blow it up. And so that's what people elected him to do. And I think that's what you're seeing with a lot of these confirmation picks. BLITZER: Very controversial ones. Jasmine Wright is with us.

And so they want to see what the Ethics Committee has been investigating for the last two or some odd years, even some of what the Department of Justice who were first investigating him and then dropped it, what they came to the conclusion for to try to make their decisions because they obviously have a huge responsibility.Yes, they will be under a lot of pressure from Republicans and from Trump himself to confirm Matt Gaetz, but they're under a lot of pressure to go through the facts and come to their own conclusions whether or not they want to obstruct or block him. And so they want all the information possible, and that includes that ethics investigation. Now, of course, we heard Speaker Mike Johnson saying today, you know, basically kind of leaning on the House Ethics Committee, something that we haven't necessarily seen before, and say, you know, I don't think it would be within the best interest for them to release it. But, of course, it's going to be up to the people on the committee and other Republicans, and even with some Democrats, whether or not that happens.",

And I asked Senator Susan Collins, who's very concerned. She said, well, all of this stuff will come out in the FBI background check and the investigation that we do.

Do you have any sense that your Republican colleagues are willing to stand up to Trump on this issue? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, if we're going to have to see, many of them have expressed concern. Many of them privately have expressed shock, even discussed given Congressman Gaetz reputation and the nearly released House Ethics report, which is believed to contain details about personal misconduct and character flaws. Let's remember, we're not talking about a reality T.V. show here. We're talking about the U.S. Department of Justice, which he's been nominated to lead, an agency that has 115,000 employees in every state in the union, and a budget of more than $60 billion dollars, and is responsible for fighting terrorism, fighting crime, keeping us safe, implementing a wide range of federal criminal laws. And I understand that President-elect Trump did win the election. He has a mandate. And, typically, a president is entitled to his picks for his cabinet. But the Constitution gives to the Senate an advice and consent rule, which means where there are nominees that Republicans and Democrats find they can work with, we should confirm them. When there are folks who have the character, the experience of the relevant capabilities, we should confirm them. But where there are profound questions about their capabilities and their ethics, we should hesitate or stop them from being confirmed. I'll remind you, it just takes 50 votes now in the Senate to confirm someone for the cabinet. So, if President Trump is demanding recess appointments, what's that mean about his confidence that he can get the 53 Republican senators in the next Congress to confirm his cabinet picks?",

That typically happens when we have a confirmation hearing, for example, for a justice of the Supreme Court, or for a very senior law enforcement official.

And there are some reasons to believe that she might compromise American intelligence and sources and methods. That's something that I would expect. The intelligence committee would look at in great detail. We can't have someone who can't clear a background check entrusted with America's crown jewels of our intelligence services.And the director of National Intelligence is responsible for the president's daily briefing for coordinating intelligence materials across all of our different intelligence agencies and for the proper functioning and coordination of our intelligence community and decision-making around our national security. I'll remind you, Wolf, that there are other nominees who've been put forward by President-elect Trump, like my colleague in the Senate, Senator Marco Rubio, who will get a decent fair hearing in the Senate, who fit the more traditional mold of folks who are qualified, but by their experience with classified material on the Intelligence Committee, with foreign policy on the Foreign Relations Committee, on which Senator Rubio and I have served together for many years. I am not steadfastly opposed to confirming any Trump nominee. I may well support Senator Rubio if nominated and if we have a confirmation hearing. But the folks we're talking about, Tulsi Gabbard and Matt Gaetz, have obvious flaws in terms of a lack of senior management capability, a lack of subject matter expertise, and likely a lack of the character required to handle such critical national security roles in the next administration.",

But we do know that we see his allies out there continuing to sort of bang this drum, that this is an opportunity for Donald Trump to get retribution.

You know, the FBI's initial investigation in the Trump world didn't start with some foreign dossier. It started because four people in Trump's orbit had these sketchy ties to the Russians, one of which was bragging about having some kind of insight reportedly into the Russians hacking of the DNC.And so as it relates to Kash Patel himself, I'm hearing two things. The first comes down to a question of independence. You know, I served under three FBI directors for decades before that. There was always this distance between the White House and the FBI, because this is an agency with incredible powers. And so there is a real question about someone like Kash Patel, who has reportedly spread numerous conspiracy theories about the FBI, whether he will maintain that distance. And then the second question comes down to the future of the FBI itself. This has people there concerned. I'll let people in on a secret here. You know, there are 38,000 people inside the FBI other than maybe a handful in Washington. None of those people wake up each day thinking about the FBI director. They put their head down, they do their work, they solve their cases. And all of those people know that if anyone in leadership were to tell them to do something unethical or illegal, they could scream from the rooftops without fear of retribution. It's important here because we're now hearing rumors that Trump could change the federal hiring processes to perhaps clear out and fire people at will inside the FBI and install his own political loyalists. That would obviously threaten the independence and potentially turn the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world into the private investigative arm of one person.",

And it's right in the statute. And all of those things I think are really, you know, a real question.I think the SSCI is going to have some very hard questions, for example, you know, why did she co-sponsor legislation with Matt Gaetz that was to end, remove the criminal prosecution against Edward Snowden, who is the biggest leaker of the most sensitive information ever and now is living in Moscow on the dime of Vladimir Putin?

Some sources close to the transition, close to Donald Trump, telling us that, essentially, his nomination came together so quickly, there was little to know actual internal vetting when it came to Hegseth.Now, these allegations actually led to Susie Wiles, the head of the transition, having a phone call on Thursday with Hegseth, questioning him about the allegations and asking if there was anything else that the team needed to know about before they moved forward. Now, source that I talked to insisted that despite these allegations, that Donald Trump, that the transition was sticking by Hegseth's nomination. Just a reminder, one of the things that we had reported on was how sources close to Donald Trump, actually, some of them didn't even know that Hegseth was in consideration to be the secretary of defense.

I know as a vaccine expert, and you are one of the best, you're particularly concerned about RFK, Jr. leading the nation's health policy. He says he wouldn't take away vaccines, but explain -- explain why his skepticism alone is so dangerous. DR. PAUL OFFIT, DIRECTOR, VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER, Well, it's not skepticism. It's cynicism. I would argue that that I'm a vaccine skeptic, that everybody who sits around the table at the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee is a skeptic. Show us the data. Prove a vaccine is safe. Prove it's effective. He's not a skeptic. He's a cynic. He doesn't believe the data. You can show him reams of data and he still doesn't believe it. He says that vaccines cause autism even though dozens of studies say that it doesn't. He said that that the polio vaccine has killed more people than it saved. He said that no vaccine is beneficial, even though vaccines have caused us to live 30 years longer than we did 100 years ago. What do you do with the science denialists?
