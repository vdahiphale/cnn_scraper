And what we are hearing from Blinken himself and U.S. officials is that one of the topics of conversation will be governance reform, so pushing the Palestinian Authority to effectively change the way it operates, potentially change those at the top.What we know at this point is that the U.S. would like the Palestinian Authority to play a role in the day after the war in Gaza ends to be able to govern the people of Gaza, but Israel has insisted that's simply not going to happen, saying that they don't believe that the Palestinian Authority has the credibility or has the power to be able to prevent a resurgence, for example, of Hamas or other militant groups within Gaza itself. So, the problem for the U.S. Secretary of State is he has been very clear to Israel that a two-state solution an Israeli state alongside a Palestinian state is the only way forward to secure the support of Arab countries around the region. But at this point he does need to figure out, and so do those in the region, what exactly the governance of Gaza will be once Israeli military and Israeli soldiers pull out. Now we do know that Mahmoud Abbas is 88-years-old, he's been in power for many years of the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank but not Gaza. And he hasn't been taken part in an election since 2005, and it is believed that he does not have the support of many Palestinian people. So he has specified that there does need to be governance reform. That the government needs to look at itself and reform in order to gain back that credibility, that power, in order to be able to put them forward to be able to govern in Gaza as well. Another issue that will likely come up is of course the violence that we have seen in the West Bank.

DANIEL NOBOA, ECUADORIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The time is over for when those convicted of drug trafficking and murder tell the government what to do. OPPMANN (voice-over): The government implemented a curfew and mobilized a manhunt of 3,000 police officers and members of the armed forces to search for the escaped gang leader. The gang struck back on Tuesday raiding the TV station, taking police and prison guards hostage, setting off bombs and attacking a university. Ecuador had long been spared the epidemic of violence carried out by drug cartels throughout much of the region. But as the country has increasingly become a key transshipment point for illegal drugs heading to Europe and the U.S., local gangs partnered with cartels have battled each other and the government for control. In 2023, presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated after naming individuals he said were involved in the drug trade.

OPPMANN (voice-over): The country's president, Noboa, on Tuesday declared several of the gang's terrorist organizations in order to the armed forces to, quote, neutralize the violence.
