Republicans claim tonight's vote was about Garland's refusal to hand over audio tapes of President Biden's interview by the special counsel in the classified documents case. The DOJ has, of course, released transcript of the interview. Republicans, though, want the tapes, too. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): It's time for Merrick Garland to stop stonewalling and released the Biden tapes. REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): So, the question that should be asked is, what are they hiding and why?

HILL: Yeah, intense, it certainly was. Manu, appreciate the reporting. Thank you. OUTFRONT now, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Senator, good to have you with us tonight. I do want to note for transparency here, CNN is suing for access to the Biden audio tapes. Your Senate colleague, Democrat Mark Warner told the \"AP\", quote, you've got to release the audio. Do you agree? SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): I think that the attorney general has an obligation to follow the direction of the president of the United States when the president of the United States asserts executive privilege. You can't go after the agent when the principal has said, no, this is an executive privilege matter. That's the thing you sue over. You sue the president and say in a civil case to a court, hey, this was an improper assertion of executive privilege. The rich thing here is that Republicans continuously obstructed us. The Trump administration continually obstructed Congress over and over and over again, over 100 times, as I recall, and virtually never did President Trump actually asserts executive privilege. So it was asserted by all of his minions, but he never actually made the assertion. Here, the president did what the Reagan memo from years ago requires the president to do and make the assertion. Once he's done that, that binds the attorney general, I believe and going after the attorney general is improper and unfair.",
