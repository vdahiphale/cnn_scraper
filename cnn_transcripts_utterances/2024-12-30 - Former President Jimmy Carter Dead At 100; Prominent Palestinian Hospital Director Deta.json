And former president, Jimmy Carter has died at the age of 100. He was known around the world for his human rights advocacy, especially in this region, when it came to the Israeli occupation of Palestinians. And as that conflict continues to this day, Israeli forces raided the last functioning hospital in northern Gaza, emptying it out of medical staff and patients, arbitrarily detaining hundreds of people. Well, the sounds of sobbing and anguish echoing through a South Korean airport on Monday as families of the victims killed when a passenger jet crash landed over the weekend waited for their loved ones to be identified. Well, preparations for a state funeral are now underway in the United States for former president, Jimmy Carter. He died, of course, on Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. The Carter Center says that he was surrounded by his family when he passed away. Well, Carter was the only former U.S. president to reach 100 years old, and he is being remembered for his commitment to faith, to family, democracy, and to human rights, and for his decades of work at home and abroad after he left the White House. Well, the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken paid tribute. Saying that Carter understood how the fates of Americans were tied to people in other countries, and that Carter's efforts showed what can be achieved through, \"tireless and principled diplomacy.\" Let's start with CNN's Nic Robertson now, who takes a look at the impact of those efforts. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIMMY CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I, Jimmy Carter, do solemnly swear -- NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Jimmy Carter's presidency lived in the shadow of America's Cold War with the Soviet Union. But he refused to be constrained by East West communist versus capitalist tensions.",

In his foreign policies, he pushed for nuclear nonproliferation, democratic values and human rights. He cut off military supplies to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and dial back support for other Latin American leaders in Nicaragua, Argentina, and Brazil. One of his signature White House legacies was the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. The return the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. He also calmed Mideast tensions. Brought together Israeli and Arab leaders at Camp David, opening the door to the Israeli-Egypt Camp David Accords. He normalized relations with China, weakened U.S. ties to Taiwan in a vain hope Beijing would weaken ties with Moscow. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the last year of his presidency, he toughened his Soviet stance. Backed the Afghan mujahideen in a war against the Red Army. The same year, 1979 Islamic revolution in neighboring Iran dealt Carter a double domestic blow. Spiked oil prices and led to a humiliating, failed raid Operation Eagle Claw in April 1980, to rescue Americans captured by the theocratic revolutionaries in Tehran.",

He helped found a group of seasoned international diplomats known as The Elders, whose work spanned the Mideast and far beyond. He helped the charity, Habitat for Humanity, change lives, building affordable homes, often showing up to help with construction himself. In 2002, he was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights and to promote economic and social development.

We talked to one shop owner who said, when he got sick, Jimmy sat down with him for over an hour and just went back and forth about politics and life and really made sure he was okay. Even reflected that when he died, he wanted to make sure these shops were open. So, when tourists came to town, they had a chance to get memorabilia and make sure that downtown was thriving. And you think about this peanut farmer who went on to the Naval Academy, who then went on to be president, the outside growth of what he was able to do, even outside the presidency, is so large that even people who grew up after his presidency know him for something.

But President Jimmy Carter wasn't afraid to take it on, inviting two of the world's fiercest enemies to the White House retreat at Camp David in 1978. Jimmy Carter had been derided for his administration's foreign policy failures, partly because he's considered to have lost a U.S. friendly Iran to the ayatollahs. But the Camp David Accords were his geopolitical triumph. He managed to strike a deal between Israel's Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat.

So, yes, he was very much an outlier and a populist running against the establishment. And this, of course, was one of the reasons why he was elected in 1976. But it was also a reason why he was only a one-term president. He alienated some of the powers that be in Washington and took tough political decisions that alienated some of his own democratic constituency.",

We just played the report fromChristian Amanpour, my colleague on the Camp David Accords, the coming together of Israel and Egypt so many years ago and still today, that is enduring at a time when so little else is, to a degree enduring in this region. And we still seek an Israeli Palestinian solution at this point, or at least, many will say, in this region, a solution to the Palestinian plight. You know Jimmy Carter, and you've written so deeply about him. What did he make of where things are at now, and what would he hope his legacy in this region might be going forward?",

But Ithink it's important to say that President Carter always believed that he had also negotiated an agreement with Menachem Begin, the Israeli prime minister, to have a five-year freeze on all Jewish settlements -- built settlements in the West Bank. He thought he had a deal on that, which would have been a road map to a Palestinian autonomy and eventually a two-state solution. And so, you know, this is one of his great regrets, that Menachem Begin sort of reneged on that part of the negotiations. And he -- Carter spent the rest of his life warning the Israelis that by building more settlements in the West Bank, they were walking down the road towards apartheid. And he got a lot of criticism for doing this, but look at where we are at. You know, he's turned out to be extremely prophetic and tough minded in his analysis of what was going on in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine.",
