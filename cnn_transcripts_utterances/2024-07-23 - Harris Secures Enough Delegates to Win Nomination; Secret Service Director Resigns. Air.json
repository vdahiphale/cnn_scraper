MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  Listen. This election, as I noted at the outset, is going to be about policies, not personalities. This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris and her ethnicity or her gender. It had nothing to do with this whatsoever. This is about who can deliver for the American people and get us out of the mess that we're in. Every area of public policy is a disaster because the Biden-Harris administration made it that way. And that's what this election is about. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Governor, let's just jump right into this. It didn't take long for a racially charged grenade to get tossed into this campaign. What's your response when you're hearing some of this stuff coming from members of Congress here in Washington?GOV. JOHN CARNEY (D-DE):  Well, first of all, it's ridiculous. It is what we would expect from the other side, from the Trump campaign. This campaign is going to be about the contrast between the vice president, Kamala Harris, and former President Trump. And Kamala Harris is going to come out on top on that. But what's amazing to me is, first, that all the accolades that the president has been getting, making a decision on behalf of the people of the United States and not his own self-interest to turn the keys over, if you will, to the vice president. The enthusiasm and energy that was present yesterday with her visit here in Wilmington was incredible, and it's obviously caught fire across the country with the $100 million that they've raised just in 48 hours with the vice president lining up the support that she needs to earn the nomination that, as she said, she would. She's incredible, and she's going to really inject -- and already has incredible energy and enthusiasm in this campaign, and this thing has turned around completely.",

Cheatle did take full responsibility for the failures that day during yesterday's hearing, calling it a colossal failure on the part of the U.S. Secret Service and on her -- and for her personally. Of course, taking that responsibility was not enough to keep her in the job of director. She, today, facing a chorus of people calling on her to resign, ultimately tendering her resignation, according to a U.S. official.",

You don't see a lot of bipartisanship in Washington these days, but there was bipartisan outrage at this hearing yesterday.And one of the questions that she just could not answer was why there were not Secret Service agents on the roof of that building that was, what, 150 yards away from the former president at that rally a couple of weeks ago.",

And the question of why was the -- or how was the shooter allowed to get on that roof with a clear shot at Former President Trump was one of the main things both the ranking member and the chairman of that committee asking today's witnesses.So, that remains really the biggest unknown in all of this. How did this happen? How was the security so poor that this 20-year-old was allowed to get up on the roof and take a clear shot at Donald Trump?

Zach, let me have you just stand by for just a moment. I want to get Jonathan Wackrow our law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service agent.Jonathan, your reaction to all of this. I know there was some concern in having the director step down in between two different political conventions, I mean, that obviously -- that means the Secret Service is going to have some turnover now. It's going to have a shakeup at the top of the agency heading into the DNC. But what's your reaction to all this?",

So, the institution has been preparing for the DNC and the political activity that surrounds it for, you know, years now, regardless of who's at the top spot. So, I don't think you'll see any direct impact on that.But in terms of, you know, the director stepping down, this is the right call. Yesterday's testimony was a disaster, to say the least. And it really undermined the credibility of the women and men of the Secret Service that are putting their lives on the line every single day. I mean, from the very beginning of this incident, the director, you know, was absent. Really, you know, we did not hear from the director immediately following the shooting. So, the post incident management from pillar to post by the director was -- you know, was lacking and the leadership of the Secret Service in this moment of a crisis was also in a vacuum. So, this is the right call. The Secret Service will be able to move on from this. But after yesterday's testimony, there was no other option than for the director to step down.",

And this could be through a new administration.But, you know, the Secret Service every single day is facing a new threat environment. And we've heard this from just this assassination attempt. We have adversaries, whether they're 20-year-old individuals or foreign, you know, proxy groups that are targeting our protectees, putting forth new technology, such as drone technology in terms of the way that they are looking to attack us. We have to be at the forefront, you know, combating those attempts, whether it's technology, manpower, you know, we have to put forth a greater intelligence capability to understand the threats that we're, you know, facing every single day.

They have a long history together as she had served on the president's security detail in the Secret Service while he was and then we'll have a as vice president.

The Secret Service has a no fail mission, yet it failed historically on Director Cheatle's watch. At yesterday's Oversight Committee hearing, Director Cheatle instilled no confidence that she has the ability to ensure the Secret Service can meet its protective mission. Egregious security failures leading up to and in the Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally resulted in the assassination attempt of President Trump, the murder of an innocent victim, and harm to others in the crowd. While Director Cheatle's resignation is a step toward accountability, we need a full accounting of how these security failures happened so that we can prevent them going forward. We should note, that just this morning, the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, announced that there would be a bipartisan task force to continue the investigation around what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, and to get more information to protect protectees in the future.

The reality is, is that the women and men that protect the former president, now the Republican nominee, you know, are a career Secret Service agents. They are politically agnostic. They don't, you know, align to, you know, politics or a political agenda. You know, what they do is they operate day in and day out in a threat-based paradigm and apply the level of protection that is necessary to protect the former president.Obviously, there were security failures and, you know, there's no way to, you know, say that otherwise. That led to, you know, the attack and the assassination attempt. That needs to be resolved. That needs to be led by a new director and a new oversight of the agency to ensure that there are no systemic problems that had -- you know, within the agency itself that led to this moment. But, you know, to sort of, you know, intimate that the -- this was a coordinated effort by the Biden administration is just, you know, trying to capitalize on the moment. And I actually will give the former president credit that, you know, he has the utmost respect for the women and men that surround him day in and day out. I do know that. I've heard that from his detail, and that's widely known.

You know, it's unfortunate, the reality is the Secret Service is in the middle of an extremely protective campaign season.

PAUL ECKLOFF, FORMER U.S. SECRET SERVICE AGENT:  Well, I believe that this was inevitable. The bipartisan calls for her resignation yesterday were resounding. I believe the hearing was unproductive because it was vitriolic and it was designed for things not to improve the Secret Service. However, that being said, Director Cheatle needed to step down. I think what's important now is to focus on how we move the Secret Service forward and help it improve.

The protective model that we have applied?You know, it's not a secret that the Secret Service, you know, has been resource constrained for years. And that needs to be looked at. Did that denigrate of the protective model over time. Again, it's going to take the right, you know, people to answer that question. We -- you know, even though it was difficult to try to get to that answer yesterday, it needed to be expressed that, you know, we do have an understanding of what went wrong. And I think to Paul's point that he mentioned just a little while ago, is that, you know, the Secret Service needs to look back at, you know, former agents and in the community that does support the Secret Service -- the active Secret Service on a day in and day out basis and leverage them for resources in this very trying time.",
