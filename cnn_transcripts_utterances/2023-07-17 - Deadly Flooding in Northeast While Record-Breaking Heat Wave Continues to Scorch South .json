There were ground stops there in New York yesterday. And the FAA is especially hard hit right now just because of the shortage of air traffic controllers there, making the airspace especially crowded. But we also saw ground stops in Philadelphia. This even trickled down into D.C. I want you to listen now to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. He puts a pretty blunt warning on all of this.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  So, the big thing about this, Phil, is that this is the connection, this is the most symbolic connection that Russia has to Crimea. They built this back when Russia had annexed Crimea. Putin opened it himself. He was part of the dedication ceremony. And this is the place where all the Russian military forces get their resupply from almost all of their resupply comes this way, some of it comes this way. But for the most part, this is the area that is really important for the Russian resupply effort for the entire war in Ukraine, especially the southern front.",

It does supply, as I mentioned, all the military supplies, the fuel, the goods, all the things they need. All the Russian forces get this. It is also the longest bridge in Europe. It's over 10 miles long for the road portion, over 11 miles long for the rail portion. And it does both, of course, rail and road traffic.Now, when you look at the damage right here, you can see that this would be a major cause of delays. That split right there makes it impossible for road traffic to continue. And the big thing here with this, Phil, is that if they can't get this operational, it's going to really stop the war effort for the Russians. They're going to have a heck of a time maintaining their position in the southern front.",

The governor's campaign spokesperson confirming that some staffers have been cut for, quote, nimble and candidate- driven campaign.Now, this is coming as financial disclosures show some warning signs for DeSantis. Although he raised an impressive $20 million in the second quarter, he has burned through $8 million of it since entering the race. Plus, less than 15 percent of his contributions have come from small donors. Now, according to a report from Hannah Knowles at The Washington Post, more than seven weeks in skepticism about the Florida governor's 2024 bid has grown. And some people who have advised and supported DeSantis have raised private concerns about his message and the effectiveness and insularity of his campaign operation. The doubts extend to long, friendly Fox News, and its owner, the conservative media magnate, Rupert Murdoch. Well, now, the Florida governor appears to be shaking up his media strategy. He'll be interviewed by our own Jake Tapper tomorrow right here on CNN in a rare interview for DeSantis, who usually only speaks to Fox and other friendly conservative outlets. And joining us now is that reporter from The Washington Post, Hannah Knowles, also with us, Senior Contributor at Axios Margaret Talev. Ladies, thank you both for joining us.
