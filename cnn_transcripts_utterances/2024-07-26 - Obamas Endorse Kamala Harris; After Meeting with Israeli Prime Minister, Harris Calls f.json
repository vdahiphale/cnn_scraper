The Obamas join every other major Democratic figure in uniting behind the vice president. It includes the Bidens; the Clintons; Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. In a statement released this morning, the Obamas write this: quote, \"There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people. At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.\" And the Harris campaign may have more reason to hope. This morning a new poll of likely voters conducted by \"The New York Times.\" It finds no clear leader between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. That's our parlance here at CNN. Just one point separates the candidates here. And that stands in pretty stark contrast to the same poll conducted just three weeks ago when this was a different race. In the wake of his performance at the CNN debate, Joe Biden found himself six points behind Donald Trump. There was a very clear leader then, and there is no clear leader now. Joining me now to discuss, CNN senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche is here; Ashley Etienne, the former communications director for Vice President Harris; and Republican strategist Sarah Longwell joins us. Welcome to all of you. So, the Obamas did hold off on doing this, Kayla, partly -- my understanding is -- everybody kind of wanted this to roll out in a sequential way. This was widely expected. But at the same time, it gets -- it gets everybody on the same team.",

But then let's look at what happens when you add in third-party candidates. You get 44, 43, 5 percent. I mean, it -- clearly, her being there is -- is changing the calculus on how a third party is affecting things. What are you hearing from voters about how this race has changed?",

I don't see her around. I was excited about her, but now I just -- she's invisible. That -- for a long time, I think that was the reason people were nervous about her. Because they felt like there was this negative impression. And the only time you did see here is when Republicans were doing, like, a mean supercut of her laughing or something. But if you're listening, actually, what you hear is all the upside, because the voters didn't know her, which meant she had this opportunity to completely reintroduce herself to the country and have them take a fresh look at her. And what's happening right now in the focus groups we've done subsequently with swing voters, which I think we're going to listen to, is you're starting to hear people saying, yes, give me your pitch. Because they were, like, so desperate for something else besides a race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, that even if they were, you know, not sure how they felt about her, they were like, OK, give me your best shot.

And she has a much smaller budget. So she doesn't have the travel budget. She doesn't have the expertise in-house that someone like a president or even an agency would. And so, the argument from some people who have been in the fold with her was that -- not necessarily that she was set up to fail, but that the infrastructure around her was not necessarily benefiting her. Certainly, those are people who want to see her succeed now. But I think that her -- her record on the border and immigration is going to come under very harsh scrutiny in the next few months.

It was the very first thing that she said. And she talked -- she talked very emphatically about the need for an immediate ceasefire, which at the time was under negotiations, just as on a temporary basis. And she did in that speech say that Israel had a right to defend itself, but it was seen as buried in those remarks. And there was a lot of tension within the White House about whether she was coming across as breaking with the president in those remarks. And I was told at the time, and even recently, that she's not substantively different than the president. She's tonally different. She is more emphatic about the things that she cares about. And she does believe that there's room for both sides of this debate in a way that the president and his own team were very slow to embrace that throughout the course of this conflict. She had a very clear goal in those comments yesterday, and that was to put her mark on the administration's position and to step out and identify her own position on Israel, on Gaza. And it was something that had been at the center of many discussions in the campaign. I mean, the national finance committee chair told donors Wednesday, they said, what is her position on Israel.

And I think she is doing a pretty good job of trying to find the sweetspot, more for Democrats than the total electorate. But certainly, Democrats want to hear an acknowledgment of the suffering in Gaza. And I think she is coming out now, and she is emphasizing her support for Israel while mentioning the suffering in Gaza, which I think for the Democratic coalition feels like the right space. And I just saw a poll this morning out of Michigan in which she is now -- there was a nine-point swing toward her. I think Biden just had too much baggage with voters on this. They were too angry at him among Democrats. When I do focus groups with, you know, young Democrats, it was the only thing that you would hear them talk about. And so, she's got an opportunity to reset. And I do also think voters might give her some grace. They might give her a little more latitude than they would have Joe Biden, because they feel like maybe she's slightly more with them.",
