The Israeli military says, it hasn't identified any aerial threat, at least as of yet. But the American Embassy is warning its personnel to shelter in place until further notice.My colleagues are across the globe, reporting on all of the breaking developments. But I want to start in Washington, at the White House. CNN's Arlette Saenz is there. Arlette, what are you hearing from your sources?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, very stark warning coming from the White House today. As a senior White House official tells us, the U.S. believes Iran is planning an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel. In this statement, the senior White House official said that the U.S. is working with Israel to shore up its defenses.A U.S. official telling us that the U.S. would be prepared to help Israel intercept anything that Iran launches their way, as there is concern about what this could mean for the tension and the conflict in the region at large. This, of course, could ratchet up the fears about an all-out war emerging in the region. Now, at the same time, the U.S. is also -- white -- senior White House official in this statement saying that, a direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran. So, we will see exactly what this defense in response could be if Iran does move forward with this attack. Now, our colleague Jeremy Diamond is reporting that Israel has assessed that Iran is likely to attack three Israeli bases, as well as an intelligence base just north of Tel Aviv. A source familiar with the discussion said that the U.S. warned Israel of the potential for this attack by Iran a bit earlier today and said that it could come in the next 12 hours. It comes at a moment of heightened tension, specifically between Israel and Iranian backed Hezbollah. You have seen and heard from U.S. officials expressing concern in recent days that Iran could potentially be planning some type of attack against Israel. And at the same time, the U.S. has made clear that any -- if Iran or any of its partners or proxies tries to use this moment of high tension to target any American personnel or American interests that the U.S. would be prepared to respond to defend their people. The Pentagon has talked about how they have significant capabilities in the region, talking about how they have a carrier strike group there as well. As the Pentagon has made moves to try and reinforce some of the true presence in the region as well. But it does come at a very complicated time. As you have seen, President Biden really trying to push for some type of diplomatic solution to ease these tensions that have been taking place, but so far, that has gained no traction. So, the White House is watching the situation very closely, saying that they are ready to stand and support Israel to defend any type of attack, while also trying to balance the concerns that are out there about what this could mean for a potential wider war in the region as things move forward.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. To a degree it is, Dana, it is deterrence by disclosure. They're letting people know that we know what Iran is about to do. There are indicators, there are intelligence indicators that launch sites are getting ready, that missiles are being ready. So, this could be the case, but this is going to be a more complex operation, I believe.If Iran has said they're going to strike two air bases in an intelligence facility, those are mostly in northern Iraq. The kind of bases that -- I'm sorry, Northern Israel, the kind of bases that Israel has used to attack Hezbollah. Those are also defended by both David Sling and the arrow air defense system, not the Iron Dome. Iron Dome is not going to be able to do anything against these kind of ballistic missiles. But the thing is, the warning is short. When you launch a ballistic missile the thousand miles between Iran to Israel, it takes about 12 minutes to get there. And they can only be knocked down by air defense system above the Iron Dome. So, the high-altitude kinds of things. They move very fast. Those missiles that Iran might launch move as fast as 15 mach. So, you're talking about a quick pull, a quick overflight, over probably Iraq, an area that the U.S. systems that are on ships can't reach. So, you're talking about complete dependence on the Israeli air defense. And you see the targets, the potential targets of air bases and intelligence facilities will have air defenders around them, because those are very valuable point targets to the Israelis.",

There it's very difficult to take -- to destroy a ballistic missile with a fighter jet. It can be done, but it's much more difficult. The attack that occurred in April combined ballistic missiles, cruise missiles that move very slowly, as well as drones that move very slowly.So, those are the kind of air-to-air targets that you can hit with help from western jets from the United States and other countries. But when we're talking about ballistic missiles, it's more difficult to hit those with jets, so they have to be taken down by air defense systems. And more than likely, those missiles are going to be traveling over the territory of Iraq, and there's not a whole lot of air defense systems from the United States or western countries there.",

So, you know, I'm really watching to see how they defend the positions that their presidential candidates have staked out, and how much they sort of dive into what they -- what they believe. We've seen already Vance come out and say that Trump told him something. And then Trump coming out a day later and saying, actually, I didn't tell him that at all.

It is plain to see the economy, immigration.
