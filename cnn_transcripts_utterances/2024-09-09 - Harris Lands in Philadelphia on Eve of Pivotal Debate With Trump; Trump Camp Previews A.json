The vice president predicting that Trump will lie and insult her on stage and declaring she's ready to respond to what she calls his tired playbook. A top Harris campaign adviser joins us live this hour.Also tonight, the Trump team is previewing the former president's attack strategy during the debate, a top spokesman arguing that Harris must own everything from the Biden administration and suggesting that Trump may be planning some surprises. As we count down to the Trump-Harris showdown we're studying their past debates against other opponents and we're getting clues about how they may handle their historic clash against one another. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And we begin with the breaking news, Vice President Kamala Harris landing moments ago in the city that will host her first and potentially only debate against former President Donald Trump. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez and CNN's Kristen Holmes are both in Philadelphia at the site of tomorrow night's pivotal debate. Let's go to Priscilla first. She's covering the Harris campaign for us. Priscilla, Harris shared some insight into how she's preparing to face off against Trump.",

Now, of course, all of this will bookend what was days of preparation in Pittsburgh, the vice president doing mock sessions there and also working very closely with her team to also identify areas in which the former president may have flip-flopped on policies. That's something that we may expect to hear from her on the debate stage tomorrow.

So, Kamala Harris needs to make sure also to fact-check Donald Trump. Donald Trump rarely gets fact-checked. He certainly didn't get fact-checked in the CNN debate because Joe Biden just couldn't do it that night.

It's laying out this vision to her key audience, which is those undecided, disaffected voters. She's got to -- as Ana said, she's got to hold Donald Trump accountable to his record.

And that 28 percent, they may know in their hearts which way they're leaning right now, but that's a relatively small group of voters in the end that are going to actually change their minds to moving even just a couple thousand in a couple of the key swing states.

We all expect him to act like Donald Trump has acted since he's been on the public stage, basically obnoxious, braggadocious, throwing ad hominem attacks. We all expect that. What we want to see is how Kamala Harris, who has never been in a debate stage at this level, how she performs.And as far as the polls, Wolf, I got to tell you, I'm old enough to remember when polls told me Hillary Clinton was going to win in 2016. And I'm old enough to remember when polls told me that there was going to be a big red wave in 2022. So, I think voters are onto this now. And Kamala Harris says, I consider myself the underdog.

Well, first of all, that was such a great piece by Brian because it did jog all of our collective memories about all of these moments that both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have had in recent years, really, in the past, you know, five years, even though they haven't debated one another.It is, I think we cannot talk enough about the fact that this debate is going to be like the one that we did in June, really different from some of those that gave us those moments where they were interacting. And it is because the Harris campaign lost their attempt to change the rules and take away that muted mic rule that was put in place by the Biden campaign. I mean, they're the ones who came up with that because they were afraid that Donald Trump would walk all over -- would talk all over, not walk all over, talk all over Joe Biden like he had in a couple of debates in 2020. And it turned out that the muted mic provided some guardrails for Donald Trump that his campaign immediately saw as beneficial to him. It made him more disciplined. And so that's why it's going to be hard to get those moments.

And, you know this, Wolf, when you're the vice president, you don't really get to make your own policy. That happens when you're at the top of the ticket, which she is doing now.I would imagine in talking to people in and around the Harris campaign, that when Donald Trump does that, she's got a whole host of options to come back at him with not the least of which is that he used to be self-described as pro-choice, and then he became anti- abortion, and he appointed three justices to the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v.

And the reason is because this is what led to the end of Reconstruction, the tumult, the chaos, the violence and led to the Jim Crow laws that we saw in this country for a century in the south.And what I learned from this is something that I wish that I knew more about before I covered the 2020 election, and certainly the beginning of 2021, January 6th, is that when there is fraud, when there is corruption, back then it was real fraud and real corruption, not alleged fraud and corruption that there wasn't evidence for. At least the courts didn't get any when Donald Trump was claiming it. But what it does is it sows such doubt in the electorate that people don't know what to believe and really, really bad things can happen. And in this case, there was just one example of many things that happened. There was a massacre. 150 black men were killed. And there were two governors sworn in, two legislature sworn in. Nobody could figure out who was actually in charge.
