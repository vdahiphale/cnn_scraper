And then after that, all these plagiarism allegations came out. And I think it was a combination of these two factors that kind of led to this massive, you know, outcry in public, which, you know, eventually led today to her resignation. So, I think both those factors are important. You know, as a Jewish student, I've been very dismayed by the university's response to the anti-Semitism on campus. It's not just about her. It's about the whole university. And it's about, you know, a broader discourse of anti-Semitism in general.

It doesn't really affect my day-to-day life. What matters for me is the anti-Semitism on campus. When there are students who are chanting for an intifada, when there are students who are posting on social media that they think Jews control social media, when there are students who are championing terrorism and posting, you know, pictures of emojis of, you know, heads of babies separated from their torsos, that's what affects me, and that's what affects my peers. Not, you know, the politics of the president. And so, you know, Claudine Gay's resignation is not going to solve the issue of anti-Semitism on campus. We need a definitive culture shift.",

This is the narrowest point where the Red Sea comes into the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. This area is very easily controlled by forces in Lebanon as well, excuse me, in Yemen, as well as anybody else. So that's why the U.S. has deployed forces throughout this region. And the Iranians are now responding to this by sending their destroyer that allows them to have more coordination with the Houthis who are based in Yemen and of course are a major proxy of the Iranians in this area. So, what we're talking about here is Iran exercising influence throughout the southern area, the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, as well as all the way up the Red Sea, potentially.",

So, I would say, yes, there are some issues that are related to this in terms of influence, but the U.S. is not going to be without a presence, a naval presence in this area.

And when you look at all the different things that have happened around Kyiv, you've got airstrikes not only in the center of Kyiv, but in places like Vyshneve and the Fastiv district, and, of course, over in Kharkiv, which is Ukraine's second-largest city. And what this means is that both Russia and Iran are working together to try to really create havoc within Ukraine.And what that means from a Ukrainian perspective is all of their infrastructure is at risk. Their critical infrastructure for the winter, the heating capacity, the power capacity, all of those things are at risk because the Iranians are providing the Russians with these weapons.

The coast guard plane was actually flying out to help in recovery efforts.Joining us now, we have CNN's Richard Quest, an aviation analyst, Miles O'Brien with us.

I mean, it'll either be air traffic control gave a wrong instruction or it'll be one of the pilots missing, misheard, or misunderstood. So, we know where the error is; the error is going to be at that early part. But then, once the 350 has hit the dash and it is now on fire, this is where the both the miraculous and the ordinary hit together. In a sense, this is what is supposed to happen. The plane is meant to be able to go on fire for at least 90 seconds, and everybody is supposed to be getting off safe and sound.It's known as a survivable accident, and the moment you get a survivable accident like this, the regulations say with half the doors inoperable, you have to be able to evacuate the aircraft within 90 seconds. We saw it with an Air France A340 some years ago in Toronto, similar case. And I think that the tragedy, well, the awfulness of the mistake that caused it, followed by the tragedy of those who died on the coast guard plane, can only be matched by putting it bluntly. The system worked. It got people of the planes. It's a miracle, yes. But this is what's supposed to happen in these scenarios. It's miraculous, nonetheless.",

Miles, a passenger on the plane said that they did not \"feel a shock or anything\"; they only realized that the plane was a problem right before the announcement to evacuate. How do you see this as the system functioning as it's supposed to when it seems crazy that you see the flames coming out from the bottom of the plane, and everyone made it out okay?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Yeah, I mean, obviously something went wrong here or you wouldn't be talking about it. But the fact that everybody got out is an extraordinary thing. I don't necessarily believe in miracles. This is a lot of hard work and planning and design work. For decades, the aviation industry has been focused on reducing the flammability of interior cabin materials, the upholstery on the seats and the inside cabin walls themselves. That has bought some time for passengers, assuming there is an orderly evacuation. Let's give a hat tip to the cabin flight crew for making sure that that happened, that people didn't reach up for their carry-on bags, that they just went down those slides and did it in 90 seconds. It was a textbook case. You couldn't come up with a simulation that was better. But we will ultimately find out why these two planes were in the same place at the same time causing this. It could have been so much worse.",

But given what we've seen on previous occasions, and Richard was alluding to a similar crash that happened last decade, how likely is it that some miscommunication with air traffic control took place, whether by the operators or by the pilots?O'BRIEN: I think, Boris, you can take that one to the bank. There's confusion here. You have one frequency, one air traffic controller talking to the landing aircraft. On another frequency is another air traffic controller talking to the aircraft on the ground. And there can be confusion. It's dark. Throw in one other factor here. How long was that flight crew on that Coast Guard aircraft flying? Had they done repeated missions to Niigata that day? Were they tired? Were they stressed? One other factor to consider, and these are the things that we look at in aviation to improve it. The Airbus A350 is one of the first airliners with dual head-up displays. That's a little piece of glass that appears in front of the crew and overlays crucial information, flight data information, sort of augmented information, so they don't have to keep looking down at the instruments as they land. Well, an unintended consequence of that safety measure is it makes it harder to see what is a pretty dark aircraft that might be beneath you. So, maybe there'll be a recommendation that the landing pilot has the head-up display, and the non-landing pilot, the one who's monitoring, doesn't use the head-up display. Things like this are what make aviation safe for the next time.",
