We have this, like, shortage of confidence in the system. So, that's why we have officials really around the world going from weakest link to weakest link in the system, trying to put out the fire before it spreads.And so, let's look at this UBS-Credit Suisse deal. So, UBS coming to the rescue, $3.2 billion deal, buying this ailing rival. The Swiss government is being forced to sweeten the deal, right. They're putting up $9 billion to take on potential losses that UBS could face, the central bank is providing up to $200 billion of loan. So, this is the first marriage of systemically important, global banks since the 2008 crisis. And it's kind of forced marriage because regulator, basically, pushed UBS to do this, right. They didn't want to buy Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse has been a trainwreck for years. But regulators, basically, forced them to. I mean, this would be like if John's doing the Patriots, was told by the NFL to buy my New York Jets because the Jets just keep losing and it's bad the league. And the Patriots are basically saying, sure, but we're not going to pay full price.",

Agencies downgraded the credit ratings of First Republic over the weekend, Moody's cut it into junk -- actual junk, S&amp;P lowered it further into junk.But one bit of encouraging news, we did get this weekend is U.S. official telling Phil Mattingly and I, that deposits at the small and medium-sized banks, they've stabilized, which is a very good sign.

That -- they would make that baby weigh about 200 pounds.So, the big solution here is to put your child in a strapped in front- facing or rear facing child seat. The FAA has specific instructions on its website. In fact, you should be able to make sure that your seat is certified to be on a commercial airliner, look at the label on the side, in the red lettering, it should say, this can be on an airplane, and that is what the flight attendants want. They don't want anybody hurt or killed in one of these incidents. It's something they've been pushing for, for a really long time. It even dates back to the Flight 232 accident which was back in 1989. And on-board, four lap babies were on that flight, three of them were injured, one was killed. Erica, John.",

They're focused on recruitment and training for black men, trying to get black men that on-the-job training so that they feel comfortable teaching in the classroom and they can learn the ropes of teaching and get that on- the-job training.
