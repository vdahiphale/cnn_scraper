You are receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And this year you're sharing the honor with several others, 18 others, including civil rights hey Medgar Evers, who fought desegregation in Mississippi before he was shot in the back by a white supremacist in 1963. What does this mean to you to receive this honor?",

And as I said to President Biden when he called me to tell me he was conferring this honor upon me, I just hope to live long enough to prove myself deserving of it. I thank him so much for the recognition. I congratulate the other 18 people who will get this. Medgar Every is still living. I hope the widow of Medgar Every, I hope that she gets to enjoy this as well. I've gotten to know her very well over the years. I did not know Medgar personally, but at the time he was killed, I was already active as president of my youth chapter of the NAACP at the time he was murdered. And so this is a great honor to be in the same company there with him, as well as the others who will be honored today.",

This morning, a forensic analyst returns to the stand to wait in all the authenticity of several phone conversations that former Trump fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen secretly recorded. In one of them, Trump is heard telling Cohen two pay with cash for a hush money deal with former \"Playboy\" model Karen McDougal. There's also a recording of Cohen's phone call with Stormy Daniels. Her former attorney, Keith Davidson, who has been on the stand for a couple of days now, the cross- examination of Davidson turned very tense as the defense tried to paint him as an extortionist profiting off celebrity deals.CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside court for us. Brynn, each side seems to be using these recordings, trying to use them, of course, to their own advantage. How important have they been for the prosecution in particular?",

      "sentences": "Yes, listen, Sara, the prosecution has to show two jurors that Trump knew that these payments were being made as hush money payments, right? Those are the charges against him are the falsifying the business records before this election and that he knowingly did this. So that's why these records according is are being brought in right now, to make that point.In one of those conversations that was played for jurors, it was between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson. And Davidson testified that Cohen essentially -- or that Trump, essentially told Trump that he hated the fact that we did it in regards to Stormy Daniels non- disclosure agreements. So that was an important one for jurors to hear. Another one was that conversation you just pointed out between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. For the first time jurors heard Trump in his own voice. Take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) [08:05:06] MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY:  What about me? And I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it. And my comment to him was, but every person that you've spoken to told you it was the right move.

      "sentences": "All right, so that's a different actual recording that was played. That's not the one that we actually hear Donald Trump. But in the one you hear Donald Trump, he essentially is talking about the deal with Karen McDougal and the payment that happened between Cohen and David Pecker, who was a witness on the stand earlier in this trial. So again, this is so important for prosecutors to lay out for jurors as this trial continues.On the defense side, they were admitting audio tapes as well. Basically, the defense was trying to show that Cohen really wanted a spot in the White House, and that these deals were advantageous to him. So there was a lot that goes into those recordings. I suspect we might even hear more as we continue hearing from testimony of from a forensic analysts who was on the stand when court adjourned yesterday. But really quickly, Sarah, as you mentioned prior to that, we heard some really intense cross-examination of Keith Davidson, the attorneys for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, where the defense was really trying to show that he has a pattern of helping shady clients try to get money out of celebrities. They brought up the names of Hulk Hogan and Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen. So certainly got some heated moments there in court, and we'll see how that all plays out today. It's actually going to end a little bit earlier today because one juror has an appointment. So a short break about 3:45 today.",

This is video from just moments ago.The protests on college campuses have also stretched, not just across the country, but also overseas with regard to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. In France, riot police have evacuated the main hall of Paris' Science Po University after a sit-in forced that campus to close and there was a scary moment at Portland State University, a man there, you see that white car, a man there is now taken into custody after police say he nearly drove straight into a crowd of protesters, even pepper spraying people who tried to confront him, not clear yet from police, if they believe that the protestors were a target, but still terrifying. Law enforcement did also work to clear out a library on that campus that had been overrun by demonstrators, at least 30 people were arrested. And just in to CNN, the Biden administration is ramping up its response to the unrest. We talked about President Biden speaking out, but now Education Secretary Miguel Cardona is sending a letter to university presidents this morning. CNN's Arlette Saenz is back with us from the White House. Arlette, what is the Education Secretary's message?",

      "sentences": "Right. Good morning, Sara, and that is one of the principal complaints from family members in a GoFundMe post for one of these Americans, Ryan Watson, the family saying that TSA never noticed that ammo when they were leaving the United States and in fact, TSA confirmed that to CNN that they failed to detect that ammo during a security screening at an Oklahoma City airport, and that TSA is addressing that oversight internally.So let me backtrack a little bit and start with Ryan and Valerie Watson. They were celebrating a friend's 40th birthday and actually trying to go home. They were at an airport there in Turks &amp; Caicos trying to return home when airport security found ammo inside of their luggage. According to a GoFundMe, the family says that they unknowingly left that ammo in a duffel bag after a deer hunting trips. So a hunter here, Valerie, was released on bail, but Ryan was forced to pay $15,000.00 to post that bond and then had to relinquish his passport. So, he is still there in Turks &amp; Caicos. It is very important that here in the US, you can actually travel with guns and ammo inside of check luggage. But in Turks &amp; Caicos, that is strictly forbidden and it can be a very costly mistake. Violators face a minimum of 12 years in prison. I also want to show you the other Americans, if we bring up that list again, there is Tyler Wenrich, 31 years old of Virginia, he is still in custody. He has not posted bond according to the government there. Michael Evans, 72 years old of Texas. Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania, also similar story, hunter detained while trying to fly home. His wife, telling our affiliate WPXI that it was an honest mistake. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHLEY HAGERICH, HUSBAND DETAINED IN TURKS &amp; CAICOS:  That is a bag that my husband has used numerous times on hunting trips and going to hunting camp and it was just leftover in a secure pouch and you know, it's just forgotten about and people make mistakes. And in this sense, the crime just doesn't fit the sentencing and the repercussions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
