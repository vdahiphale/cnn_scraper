In the next 30 minutes or so, that is when the Chinese government, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, holds its daily press briefing. Perhaps we will get some more figures about the death toll, about the destruction and exactly what the Chinese government is doing to respond.It was just about an hour ago that we received a statement from Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who called for an all-out effort when it comes to rescue as well as any kind of recovery victims. There are a number of challenges that we have seen being posed, namely from this video because of the extent of the damage, especially to infrastructure. There have been power outages, there have been communication problems with phone lines. Not to mention some of the roads have been covered in rubble, making it very difficult for the rescue teams to help people who may be in need. Another issue is the weather. Of course, it is winter time, no snow on the ground, but very cold temperatures, and we are just a few hours away from nightfall. The Chinese government has, as you've been seeing from some of those pictures, mobilized a number of forces. Helicopters, soldiers, military personnel, have all been told to be ready to deploy, as we saw from some of the video. Already, people have been put into action. A drone also has been made available to get a better idea from above as to the extent of what the damage exactly is. This happened -- the epicenter, at least, happened in a very remote area, the largest city about 100 miles away that being Shigatse. That is notable because there is a scenic point to see, Mount Everest. That area has also been closed indefinitely. Let me also tell you that we have been scouring social media, and we are hearing from people who said that they felt tremors and that they were asleep and that it woke them up. One person commenting that they saw rocks fall. So, Rosemary, the next 30 minutes or so, we should get an update from Chinese social from Chinese government officials. This all happening about two weeks prior to the start of the Chinese New Year, a very special, a sacred time of year here in China. At least one person commenting on the timing of all of this relating to what should be a very joyous time ahead in China, Rosemary.",

But last month, even Trudeau's finance minister and longtime ally, Chrystia Freeland, resigned from his cabinet, leaving him on even shakier ground with a blunt resignation letter accusing the prime minister of using costly political gimmicks at the expense of Canada's fiscal health. Freeland added that the government needed to start pushing back against America First economic nationalism. A former high school teacher and the eldest son of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada's most well-known prime ministers, Trudeau was elected three times. He became a poster child for the country's progressive agenda on the global stage, seen as an antidote to Trump during the incoming U.S. president's first term. His government pursued policies on alleviating child poverty, gender equity, cutting middle class taxes, and the legalization of cannabis. And while he was generally praised for his handling of the pandemic, voter sentiment has soured since. High inflation, an affordable housing crisis, and an increase in legal immigration have tested Trudeau's government.",

But I think the major precipitating event was really the resignation of Chrystia Freeland, who is Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister.She resigned for a variety of reasons, but she left with a scathing letter that you made public, which really questioned the direction that Trudeau was taking the country, particularly as Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated south of the Canadian border here on January 20th. So, the timing has been building for a while, but I think it just became clear that with elections that have to be held this year.

But what he's done is something that's slightly different. He's actually resigned as leader of the Liberal Party, but says that he'll remain as Prime Minister until the Liberals determine who their next leader will be and who the next prime minister would be.And that's really important, because in doing so, he suspended their parliament, which means that the country is really put on hold politically, until the Liberals decide their own intra caucus politics. It's a really important scenario because the country is going through some important changes. Not to say again, the relationship is shifting with the United States. So, as the country goes through some political instability, you're going to have a new prime minister and then presumably you'll have to have a new election after that. So, you could actually have three Canadian Prime Ministers this year, 2025. It's a process that really adds some instability north of the U.S. border.",

Nonetheless, you hear folks like Mr. Freeland named as potential replacements for Trudeau. There are a number of others as well. We'll have to see how that works going forward.

Perhaps Trump is referring to the fact that Biden is taking a series of last-minute actions that Trump disagrees with, like protecting the coasts on both east and west coast from oil drilling, which I think most people in America would support.

The Lebanese military says it's now started to deploy its own forces there, in coordination with the U.N. interim force in Lebanon which is monitoring the end of hostilities in the region. The deal that ended the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah calls for the Iran-backed fighters to withdraw from South Lebanon, which Israel argues isn't happening fast enough.CNN's Tamara Qiblawi reports on why the Litani River in Lebanon is so significant to the truce. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TAMARA QIBLAWI, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIONS WRITER (on camera): This is the Litani River. It flows from Lebanon's Beqaa Valley through its rolling hills and into the Mediterranean just a few kilometers from Israel's northern border. Now this is also at the heart of the U.S. brokerage agreement, designed to end the conflict that raged between Israel and Lebanon last fall and to prevent another one from erupting. To the south of here, this is where Hezbollah has maintained a robust presence of Iran-backed fighters for more than 40 years, facing off with Israeli forces in and around the Lebanon-Israel border. But all of that is set to change dramatically if a fragile truce between Israel and Lebanon is to be maintained. Hezbollah has agreed to withdraw its forces to the north of this river, creating a de facto buffer zone with Israel. Hezbollah has about 20 more days to carry out its side of the bargain the. Israel says this isn't happening fast enough that Hezbollah is dragging its feet. QIBLAWI (voice-over): And Israel has breached the agreement hundreds of times, mostly near the border since the end of the war around 40 days ago. Israel is also meant to withdraw from Lebanon under the terms of the deal. QIBLAWI (on camera): Now, Israel is also threatening to pull out of the cease fire agreement completely and to keep Israeli troops in Lebanon until further notice. It's an incredibly delicate phase that could trigger further violence or a lasting calm and it could determine whether this river stands at the threshold of Lebanon's past or its future.
