      "sentences": "That is new. Ukraine has been pushing for some time now for stronger support from its NATO allies, particularly from the United States. We heard yesterday from President Joe Biden, as you saw there speaking, announcing that there would be further air defense support coming not only from the U.S., but from Germany and Romania, all each providing a Patriot battery to support the air defense systems of Ukraine. Italy has also pledged support, as well as other countries which have pledged short and medium range systems as well to support Ukraine.So there has been that continued push from the NATO alliance to continue to support Ukraine. Of course, this comes just days after we saw Russia launch a barrage of missile attacks on Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, where at least 33 people were killed on Monday in Kyiv alone. And of course, we saw that devastating strike on the children's hospital in the capital. Of course, Russia has so far denied responsibility for that strike.",

Ukraine has, of course, denied this.And in fact, CNN has spoken to weapons experts who have taken a look at the footage of the scene and say that they believe that this is consistent with a missile strike, not an anti-aircraft missile. And of course, we've also heard from U.N. human rights experts who have echoed this. They believe Russia was responsible for this strike. So of course, there is that mounting pressure for more to be done to support Ukraine. That's certainly been coming from the Ukrainian authorities for some time now. And of course, when it comes to the NATO alliance overall, there have been those concerns, those tensions, as you mentioned, around the possible pulling out from the NATO alliance of the United States if indeed we do see another Trump presidency. So that was certainly a key focus as well, particularly for Ukraine, which is so dependent on NATO support. And we heard from the Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, speaking yesterday as well. He urged all members of the alliance to continue their support for Ukraine.",

And so we're seeing that continued push for more international support.That's certainly the message that we've been hearing from Stoltenberg, from other world leaders, that the world cannot forget Ukraine at this stage, that there cannot be any sort of relaxation on that position, that there needs to be that continued military support. Particularly, of course, for Ukraine on the front lines, but particularly when it comes to its air defense systems, because what we are seeing is Russia now targeting further inland, particularly in Kyiv, of course, with missiles and drone attacks.",

This year, a team of soldiers and sherpas not only removed tons of trash from Mount Everest, but also the bodies of climbers in recent years. This year, a team of soldiers and sherpas not only removed tons of trash from Mount Everest, but also the bodies of climbers who died.CNN's Michael Holmes reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Thousands of people have tried to climb Mount Everest, some successful. Others have lost everything trying. But it's not the glory of summiting the tallest peak in the world that's motivating these climbers. It's about cleaning up the mountain that's a beacon to hundreds of adventurers a year. Once again, a cleanup team of soldiers, sherpas and porters braved some of Everest's most inhospitable conditions to remove hazards that have collected along the route. One of the team leaders says it is dangerous, but increasingly urgent work. MAJOR ADITYA KARKI, LEAD, MOUNTAIN CLEAN-UP CAMPAIGN 2024 (through translator): Because of the effects of global warming. The bodies and trash are becoming more visible as the snow cover thins. HOLMES (voice-over): The team recently battled Everest's frigid temperatures, whipping winds and altitudes with low oxygen levels to remove 11 tons of garbage from the mountain, and at times uncovering much more difficult things. Viewers might find the next image disturbing. It took painstaking work, hours, if not days, to dig out some of the bodies of dead climbers entombed in the ice. KARKI (through translator): We have to bring them back as much as possible. And if we keep leaving them behind, our mountains will turn into a graveyard in the future. We have to bring them back. HOLMES (voice-over): The bodies were flown to Kathmandu for identification, the trash sent to sorting facilities to try to recycle what's salvageable. New rules now require climbers to haul their own garbage off the mountain. But there's still a backlog of unwanted materials on Everest, some from decades ago. SHILSHILA ACHARYA, DIRECTOR, AVNI VENTURES (through translator): The garbage collected is what climbers leave behind on the mountains. Mostly, there are packaging of food, like can and tin and plastic. Apart from that, there are shoes, clothes, and tents. There's also a lot of broken glass and some ropes. HOLMES (voice-over): The lead sherpa of the recovery team estimates there could be 40 to 50 tons of garbage near the summit of the mountain, layers deep and frozen solid, an almost insurmountable task to remove. But just like climbing the mountain itself, if there's a will, it can be done. Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But that didn't last long. Because Spain's young 16-year-old football star, Lamine Yamal, scored a long- distance goal. Which everyone's talking about. Making him the youngest player to ever score in a men's European championship.Four minutes later, Spain scored a second goal. France tried to recover but it wasn't successful. Spain will play either England or the Netherlands. We're playing tonight. In that final on Sunday. Argentina have earned a spot in the Copa America finals. After a high- stakes match against Canada on Tuesday. It ends a fairytale season for Canada who performed better than expected in that tournament. But the FIFA number one ranked team 2022 World Cup winners and holder of 15 Copa titles wouldn't back down. Argentina will face off against either Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday. With that decision being made in the last semi-final game which is on Wednesday today. And the stories in the spotlight this hour. Some visitors to Buckingham Palace in London this summer will get to visit the room behind the famous balcony the British royal family often poses on. For the first time, the palace is opening the east wing which includes the room where the iconic balcony is located. Visitors won't be able to stand on the balcony but they can look through the curtain down the Mall. Access to this section has been made possible after five years of renovations as part of the ongoing Buckingham Palace resurfacing program. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
