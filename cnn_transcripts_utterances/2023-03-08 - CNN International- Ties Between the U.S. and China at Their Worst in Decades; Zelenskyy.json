But they appear, at least initially, determined not to engage in a back and forth.However, there is no question the very direct comments, the very direct rhetoric coming from both President Xi and the Chinese foreign minister were noticed and seemed intentional. However, when I asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre what the potential intent was, what U.S. officials are thinking. She made clear that they weren't going to weigh in on what they thought the Chinese leaders were actually doing, and that their position -- their really approach up to this point, and the approach of President Biden haven't shifted at all. Take a listen. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The presidents approach to China has not changed. And again, we've been very clear, we do not seek conflict. And we do not want conflict. What we're seeking is competition. And we've been very clear about that these past two years. The president will always defend American interests, as you all know. But he has been clear, we want -- we need to keep open lines of communication.",

      "sentences": "I think it's extremely difficult to imagine that Ukraine can hold on to Bakhmut for much longer. But we've had many presidents in this conflict, of course. What we know as of this morning is we have this audio message from Yevgeny Prigozhin -- who is of course head of the Wagner Mercenary Group. The group that is really spearheading this attack, this fight in Bakhmut. In that audio message he claims that the east of the city has now been taken by Russian forces.And that makes sense, sort of jives with the video that we saw released yesterday -- which I just want to pull up for you. And it shows tanks and members of the Wagner Mercenary Group putting their flag up on this monument that is in the eastern part of the city. That's been geolocated by CNN. Now, Ukraine, its military, has also given an update this morning. They say they repelled around 100 attacks by Russian forces. And they say these near constant attacks continue. But they're still holding that line of resistance. But I want to break down a little bit what President Zelenskyy says to our Wolf Blitzer in that interview about the importance of this. That evening he concedes -- President Zelenskyy concedes that it doesn't have much strategic tactical value for Russia, but it's a symbolic win. But he does talk about the possibility of it giving an open road that Bakhmut be used as a launching pad to push further into the country. Now military analysts will tell you, that's unlikely. Even if Russia is able to take Bakhmut, it makes very little difference on the ground, because of just how much they've lost in the months-long war that it's taken to take this one city. I mean, it's really mind- boggling the devastation. Thousands of troops killed on both sides. NATO says for everyone Ukrainian soldier killed five Russian troops were killed. The city largely decimated or destroyed, so homes, businesses, all flattened really. And you have this wasteland that's being fought over. And the military lost in that, you have to think about the weapons that have been depleted over six months. All of that means is that, yes, President Putin might be able to declare a win if they take Bakhmut, but it's very unlikely that that win could turn to something more.",

So, they seem to be coming increasingly common.What happened in Janine, as you, say the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, saying they were targeting, in their words, a Hamas terrorist operative. The man that they say killed those two Israeli settler brothers on February the 26th. And then in the gun battle that ensued, a further five Palestinians were killed. Now Hamas, the military group that of course controls the Gaza Strip, it has subsequently said, yes, this man not only was a member of theirs, but was indeed responsible for killing those two Israeli brothers on February 26th. But they also hail the other five Palestinians killed in Jenin yesterday, as in its words, fighter martyrs. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, hailed the operation and warned once again in his words, whoever harms us will pay the price. We've subsequently also heard from the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. He has expressed further concerns about the escalating violence. He has said that he's also condemned settler violence against Palestinians, which we saw in the wake of those two Israeli brothers being killed, when settlers went on the rampage in that same village of Huwara, and also condemning Palestinian attacks against Israelis. The State Department spokesman, Ned Price, for his part said that Israel has legitimate right to defend its people and its territory against all forms of aggression, including those from terrorist groups. But he also called for a de-escalation. And I suppose what a lot of people are doing is trying to remind Israel and the Palestinians of the commitments or the undertaking they made, in this meeting they had of the Jordanian Red Sea Port of Aqaba, just the other week in order to de-escalate tensions.
