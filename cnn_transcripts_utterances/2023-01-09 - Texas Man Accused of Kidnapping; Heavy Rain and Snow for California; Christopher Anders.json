And based on the interviews that the investigators had with the victim in this case, where she alleges that on Christmas Eve, December 24th, she connected with Mills on the dating app Bumble and that he came by her apartment, picked her up, and they went back to his apartment. And that's where, according to the court documents, he immediately tried to engage in sexual intercourse. The victim told investigators that he -- she refused the advances and that then Mills began to physically assault her, punching her, slapping her and even at one point using a screwdriver to inflict damage on the woman as well. The court documents reveal that the woman was found with bruised eyes, bruises all over her body, as well as cuts to her neck and throat.Despite all of this, five days later, Mills, according to the court documents, decided to leave his apartment and go see his father, and that is when the woman was able to escape. And despite all of this, the attorney for Mills says that no one should rush to judgment in this case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS DENUNA, ZACHARY MILLS' ATTORNEY: Not to be insensitive to the complaining witness at all or anything like that or for anyone who may have actually experienced these traumatic events, but I think also it's important to know that there are two sides to this story. My client is presumed innocent, as is afforded to him through the Constitution and due process. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Charles, I think, feels rather guilty for having forced his - or persuaded his sons to walk behind their mother's coffin. That's still something that's very triggering for both boys.

The church didn't marry them, they were married in a civil ceremony. But now the Church of England puts the crown on the king's head. And that has never happened with a divorced king before.And when it's a situation like this, where both the queen and the king would have been -- we all know about what happened, the affair they had, it destroyed the marriage with Diana, it's just going to get sticky. And the British people (INAUDIBLE) behind Camilla becoming queen and I'm - I'm -- if William and Harry aren't, then this really casts appall over the ceremony that's going to be coming up in May. So, we'll see how Charles reacts. And, by the way, Charles is very, you know, very defensive when it comes to Camilla. He's not going to like whatever negative remarks are made by Harry about Camilla. So, we'll see how he reacts. And he can react by taking away titles.

Today, for instance, from here, Kramatorsk, we could see Russian jets flying over that area and Ukrainian air defenses trying to take them down.Now, we spent the weekend in Kramatorsk. We spent the night in a basement/bomb shelter. And what we saw, as far as the civilian population goes, they are shell shocked. This is a city where for months there has been intense bombardment. According to local officials, more than 60 percent of the city has been destroyed. Only 10 percent of the population remains. There's no electricity, no running water, no heat, no telecommunications. But people hang on. We were in one of those shelters where people go where there are generators and there is wood stoves and satellite link ups. But what we saw was people really in a daze. Just barely capable of functioning. Volunteers are providing them with hot drinks, with a warm meal, with medicine if they need it, but those volunteers are overwhelmed with the scale of the situation. In fact, we had orthodox Christmas Eve dinner with three of the only seven doctors left in Bakhmut, the city that used to have 300 doctors.
