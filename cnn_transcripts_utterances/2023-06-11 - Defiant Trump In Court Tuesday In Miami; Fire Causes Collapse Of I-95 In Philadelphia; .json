I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with the countdown to Donald Trump's court appearance exactly 48 hours from now. Trump is set to appear in a federal court in Miami. The former president is facing 37 counts over the mishandling of classified documents and obstructing an investigation after he left office. That did not stop Trump from hitting the campaign trail this weekend where he lashed out against the indictment, calling it a political hit job and calling Special Counsel Jack Smith, deranged.

He was totally wrong that he had the right to have those documents. Those documents are among the most sensitive secrets that the country has. They have to be in the custody of the archivist.

He is totally in the wrong because of the national security risk of having documents outside of the hands of the federal government, even though he was the former president or he was the president of the United States, and then is now the former president.But that is ultimately going to be something that a jury will decide. Is Donald Trump -- are these charges worthy for Donald Trump? Should he be convicted of them? And so that is why we're here in Miami, because the process to go to court, to go to trial, to stand before that jury and to hear the evidence, all of that is going to be something that is going to be looked at in this court and weighed in this court about what evidence could be coming in and it starts with Donald Trump's arraignment in about 48 hours from now, two days, at the Miami federal courthouse. There is going to be a whole process getting him down here. So Donald Trump is going to be traveling to Miami tomorrow and then staying at his resort, very nearby. He is going to be huddling with lawyers preparing for that appearance. And then on Tuesday, in the afternoon, will come into the federal courthouse, face the judge and the prosecutors here, plead not guilty as he has said many times he plans to do, and then on Tuesday night, he is going to return out of the state of Florida back up to his other resort in Bedminster, New Jersey. Now remember, that is not the site where Donald Trump first spoke after he was arraigned on other criminal charges in New York State. That took place at Mar-a-Lago, but Mar-a-Lago being the center of this indictment, it is not going to be at the center of the action in the next few days. Donald Trump is not visiting there -- Fred.

This morning just before 6:30 AM, first responders got the call. There was an accident on the ramp leading up to I-95. The city said it was a tanker truck that caught fire underneath and that fire was so hot, as I said I-95 northbound eventually collapsed and officials say that those southbound lanes, they have also been compromised. Thankfully, at this point, still no report of anyone injured after the collapse, but a lot of fallout today. Still, there were manholes exploding because of potentially compromised gas lines in the area. The Coast Guard saying they are investigating there may have been 8,500 gallons of gasoline spilled into nearby water and of course, as we've been saying, this is a huge traffic artery for Philadelphians and folks driving through this part of the city.

Well, they've since then said, they've won a couple of other villages back in that same region. It's sort of on the southeastern part of the frontline. So the Ukrainians there certainly seem to believe that they have a lot of momentum going for them as they've opened up several other fronts in the south of the country as well. So it does appear as though they are piling the pressure on the Russians, and this comes, Fredricka after the Ukrainian offensive action seemed to have gotten off to a rocky start. You'll recall that at the end of last week, the Russians posted a couple of videos apparently showing some destroyed Western vehicles, armored vehicles, including Bradley infantry fighting vehicles that the Russian said that they had shot down that as they were trying to advance towards Russian positions. So it certainly seems as though right now, the Ukrainians gaining just that little bit more of momentum. Big question, of course, on the ground is, is this the large counteroffensive? And, you know, we just heard from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy there saying that the counteroffensive actions had begun. Well, today, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, put out a video of himself just sitting in his chair saying nothing for several seconds, and then that video saying, plans love silence. In other words, the Ukrainian saying that if this is the big counteroffensive, they certainly don't intend to talk about it. But you know, you know, as we've been looking at generally the situation here in the war in Ukraine, right now, we can say that there is pretty much no place on a very long frontline between the Russians and Ukrainians, where the Russians have the initiative, but there are a lot of places where the Ukrainians are piling on the pressure. And we've talked about some of them in the south of the country, but in the east of the country in Bakhmut, for instance, which of course is a town that's seen heavy fighting for several months. The Ukrainians over the past couple of days have said that they have made significant gains as well there. So right now, the fighting, extremely intense. We saw that on the frontline. We were in a town on the frontline on Friday in various regions along the frontline, and right now, it definitely seems as though the Ukrainians are the ones who have the momentum and the initiative going for them -- Fredricka.",

Now all of these areas still have the same threats. That's damaging winds and the potential for some large hail. Some areas could even get up to around tennis ball size. We also can't rule out the potential for an isolated tornado. Now for some of these areas, that first wave already started this morning. Now, we're starting to see those secondary waves this afternoon and even an additional wave that really starts to take shape tonight and will linger through the overnight hours.

Also, because we've had multiple waves of rain for some of these areas, that potential for flooding also exists. Two separate areas, one across the Tennessee and the Ohio Valleys, that secondary one out to the west that does include cities like Salt Lake, as well as Denver. Most of these areas picking up one, maybe to two inches, but there will be a couple of spots that could pick up three or even four inches total from what they had yesterday, and also including today. One bit of good news, however, is the rain is not just here in the US, but also into Canada. That's really helping to mitigate a lot of the wildfires that have been ongoing there for several weeks. And we're also going to see a significant improvement in the smoke is well. This is a smoke forecast graphic where you see the blue and green color, that's all those smoke particles as they make their way through the air.

He has been one of the leading voices of the Black Lives Matter movement since its inception in 2014. So good to see you. I mean, in the in the early 2010s, you know, there were a number of tragic killings -- Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown -- that inspire the Black lives movement. So what was it about Ferguson, you know, where Michael Brown was killed, where you were very involved that that movement really ignited?",

What we did have that people didn't have before us was a set of tools like the internet and social media that allowed us to scale up the conversation to get as many people involved with not a lot of friction in ways that they just didn't have before.I can tweet and talk to ten thousand, five hundred thousand, a million people in one click in a way that they just could not do and in any decade before 2014. You think about 2014, remember, there was no Facebook Live, there was no Instagram Live, there was no Twitter video in 2014. There was not even live streaming really in 2014. You know, it was like -- it was a wild moment. We were doing six second binds to tell everybody what's happening, but even those tools are more than what the people had before us. WHITFIELD: Yes. Well, that was something else, I thought that was notable, too, is especially after Ferguson, it also, you know, helped shine a light on a variety of injustices from people who were being jailed after being pulled over because of expired tags, and come to find out it wasn't an anomaly, but it was happening a lot. In what way do you think this movement, this moment, opened the eyes of a lot of people.",

They were like, hey, this didn't make sense. You know, even I, I didn't know that, you know, the police, on average kill three people a day. I didn't know that until the protests began. So people started to question a whole lot of things. And importantly, in this moment, women, the queer community, the trans community, like so many people were visibly present, visibly leading in ways that just weren't celebrated in the 60s, ways that weren't celebrated in the 70s. And in this moment, people are saying, hey, I see something that doesn't make sense. I'm going to do something about it.",

And obviously, the death of George Floyd was a watershed moment where more people are like, okay, it's not just Ferguson, it is not just Baltimore, not just one city, and it's the country that has a problem.I think that after 2020, it is how do we think about structural change differently? What does that look like? So remember, 19 states after 2020 restrict the use of force laws. There are a set of states like Maryland and Maine that have done incredible work restricting no-knock raids, following the killing of Breonna Taylor. Minneapolis has the best restriction on no-knock raids in the country at the city level. There are places working on those issues now. So there is change happening, and I'm heartened to think of all the activists in those early days when we didn't know anything was going to result in anything but telling the truth, staying outside night after night in Ferguson.",
