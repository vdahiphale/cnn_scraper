It was playing well with his crowd on Saturday.And look, a lot of what you heard in that speech is what you're going to hear on Tuesday when he faces off with Kamala Harris on the debate stage. When I talked to Donald Trump's campaign about his preparation, they say these types of events, his rallies, the townhalls such as the \"Fox News\" town hall he did last week with Sean Hannity, that is his version of preparing. But of course, even though they have an aversion to the word preparation, they say he likes to do informal (ph) policy sessions. He is preparing behind the scenes.

It's a big moment for her. Her team is very high in her chances, but they're also frustrated that we're going to have these mics muted rule. They were hoping the mics would be unmuted and they can portray Donald Trump as someone who is interrupting her and even as an unhinged person as they wanted to say. Trump, on another hand, this is a big moment for him too. As you just heard from Alayna, he really wants to focus on the fact that Harris, quote, \"covered up\" for Biden's deficiencies. That's his way of saying in my mind that he wants to be running against Joe Biden. He sees Joe Biden is easier opponent and he hasn't quite figured out how to attack Kamala Harris in this moment in time.

As you just said, most Republicans, the vast majority of Republicans, over 95 percent, will be supporting Donald Trump. That's because they're Republicans. But there is this key sliver of maybe anti-Trump vote, never Trump vote, that could swing Harris. And all it takes is a couple of thousand in swing states the \"New York Times-Siena\" poll just laid it out. This is going to be an insanely close election. So, if Harris can ship where the margins and get people who really respect Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney to vote for her that could be all the difference. And the same token, however, I think Donald Trump's campaign is trying to make a similar outreach. How successful that might be, who knows, but look, they're having Robert F.

And we know as we look at them there, that is those who are accused in a standing trial, that there's very compelling evidence in the case. There'll be video that is introduced to the jury that will allow them to see and judge for themselves with respect to the conduct. The real defense would be if they were justified in any way in doing it. And when you look at people who are beating him to the point where there's not resistance that would justify the strikes, where they're celebrating it, where they're engaging in force in terms of kicking and punching and pepper spraying and tasing that far exceeds the proportionality of any threat he was posing, it presents an uphill battle. In addition to that, Amara, we're going to see video that the public hasn't seen. And so, if you believe that you've been repelled, right, as a 13th juror, so to speak, and you're evaluating the evidence we have seen, imagine the additional evidence.

And, you know, the reality of that question will either play out in the courtroom or it won't, because certainly the police's indication has been reckless driving, that he was driving recklessly.The argument by prosecutors is that simply a pretext, that there was no real underlying ability or reason why he would have been stopped. And even if there was an adequate, specific reason to your question, does it then justify, even if you do evade? And so, you know, again, everyone has a right to be defended. The two other officers, as you noted at the outset of the segment, Amara, you know, look, there'll be evidence that's presented, not only what we see, but the other officers may testify with regard to what they said. So, it's going to be a tough case, I think, for the defense.",
