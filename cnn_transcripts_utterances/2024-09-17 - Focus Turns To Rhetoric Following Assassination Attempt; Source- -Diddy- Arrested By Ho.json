The two shared what the White House calls a cordial phone call yesterday. Trump said it was a very nice call in a statement to CNN. The pleasantries, though, short-lived. Trump now blaming the left for the latest apparent attempt on his life. He posted this. \"Politics in our country are at a whole new level of hatred, abuse, and distrust. Because of the Communist left rhetoric the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse.\" And he doubled down on that blame during an interview on the platform formerly known as Twitter last night.

And so how do you -- what is the safe way to talk about that? What is the correct way to share your concerns with American voters without the kind of fearmongering that becomes dangerous? On the other hand, you see former President Trump himself using much more violence and pointed language consistently over time. And so the idea that he's asking the other party to embrace an approach that he, himself, has not embraced, that goes to the idea of the violence. The -- there's an element of -- there are two stories going on at the same time. One is that there was another apparent attempt on his life, and the other is the fearmongering around immigration issues, which has a violent bent to it itself.

Music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs expected to be processed in a Manhattan court after he was arrested last night. A source telling CNN the music producer was arrested by Homeland Security agents at a Manhattan hotel. And right now, the charges he's facing are still not known but an indictment is expected to be unsealed later on this morning. Combs' lawyer says he temporarily relocated to New York in anticipation of these charges. The arrest comes after months of scandal for Combs. He was the target of a monthslong human trafficking probe and was hit with multiple lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, including from his ex- girlfriend Cassie. CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson joins me now. Joey, good morning to you. This, of course, came after there was a release by CNN of a video of Diddy being violent toward Cassie after, of course, that was settled out of court. It was her lawsuit that seemed to spark all of this unraveling for him. What more do we know about what he faces here? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR (via Skype):  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Kasie. Good morning to you. And so there's a lot we don't know but some we do. We do know that there was a grand jury that convened and that indicted him. Now, the significance of that is that a grand jury doesn't condemn anybody to guilt. What is does is show two things. There's reason to believe that a crime was committed, and 2) the subject of that investigation before the grand jury committed them. Now, inconsistent with that, what happens is they don't -- that is, grand jurors -- vote by unanimous, right, consent to get an indictment. It's a majority. And standards of proof are far different. However, what I believe is that consistent with what we do know is that there were raids on his homes in California and in Miami. During those raids what we know is that the federal government seized many things -- certainly, evidence that will be used here and certainly, evidence before the grand jury. Third thing. In addition to whatever they seize -- perhaps potential video and other evidence, which would be suggestive of potential crimes -- that people have to go and testify before the grand jury. That means give testimony relevant to factual allegations and assertions. Finally, what allegations may they be? There are several lawsuits, as you just mentioned, and I think those lawsuits, Kasie, served as a treasure-trove and a roadmap with respect to potential drug -- you know, drug issues, violent issues. Again, all allegations -- issues consistent with commercial sexual exploitation, various parties, and other things where people may have been exploited. Perhaps some underage issues. And so, again, all of these allegations, all of these noted in the lawsuits, we'll see what they do in terms of appearing in this indictment that will be unsealed later this morning.",

Authorities say Routh spent 12 hours outside the former president's West Palm Beach golf course until a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a weapon and opened fire. The disaster was averted but the acting director of the Secret Service tells reporters it's time for the agency to change its approach. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD ROWE JR., ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICE:  I have ordered a paradigm shift. The Secret Service's protective methodologies work, and they are sound, and we saw that yesterday. But the way we are positioned right now in this dynamic threat environment, it has given me guidance to say you know what, we need to look at what our protective methodology is.

Thank you so much for being here. Can you explain a little bit more of what he means by that? How they are thinking about changing? How they do this? JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT (via Skype):  Well listen, when he talks about the paradigm shift from reactive to (INAUDIBLE) this model I'm not really sure. Because I know that the women and men of the Secret Service, whether they're agents or officers, have always been ready with challenge in an aggressive and threat environment. But what I think that the acting director is trying to get to is that we are living in a very dynamic and almost unpredictable threat environment that is changing very quickly for the Secret Service. Just take former President Donald Trump, for instance. You know, he does not fit the typical model of a former president, such as Obama, Clinton, or Bush where their threat profile diminishes the further, they get away from the office of the presidency. Former President Trump, on the other hand -- his threat profile almost seemingly has increased since he has left office. Why? Because he's continuously in the public eye. He is running for office again. And he has this lingering threat from Iran that is trying to seek retaliation for actions that he took while he was in office. All of that threat profile of the former president needs to be addressed in how the Secret Service actually applies its protective methodologies and a protective model to the former president. So the assistant -- you know, the director of the Secret Service is right in saying hey, there needs to be a recalibration here, but that recalibration has to be done very quickly because we see how dynamic this threat environment actually is and when these threats can materialize.",

It's applied to people, process, and technology.More funding will allow for more hiring of officers and agents who execute the mission every single day. The technology is key right now. We're seeing our adversaries utilizing advanced technology to try to launch attacks. The Secret Service needs to develop the countermeasures to thwart those types of attacks such as drones, for instance. And then process. You know, really thinking about what is the strategy of the Secret Service moving forward and how does it not react to the changing threat environment, but how does it anticipate the threat environment changing for our protectees and put the right structures in place so we're not back on our heels; we're more leaning into what we face on a day-to-day basis. So the Secret Service, since I joined in 2001 to today, has always been under-resourced but it -- this is the moment. This is a seminal moment for the Secret Service to really change the way that it operates and get more resources that are necessary for the frontline agents and officers that are out there who are charged with this remarkable responsibility of protecting our national leaders.",

We saw that going all the way back to Kennedy.And the difference between then and now is that we have the resources. We have the capabilities to get a better viewpoint because of digital technology of how these threats that are facing our political leaders are developing, metastasizing, and organizing to launch attacks.

But on the third and three play, Barkley dropped a short pass that stopped the clock with a minute-46 left.

He hit receiver Darnell Mooney for 21 yards. And then the very next play, Cousins dropping back and finding Mooney again, this time for 26 yards.
