These strikes are in response to the dozens of rockets launched from southern Lebanon into Israel yesterday. It is the most intense violence at the Israeli-Lebanese border since 2006.And we're learning more about the two Israeli women who were killed in a shooting on a West Bank Road this morning. The two young women were sisters. They were just 16 years old and 20 years old. Their mother was also in the car with them. She is in critical condition at this hour. CNN's Hadas Gold is near the Israel-Lebanon border and CNN's Fred Pleitgen is near the Israel border with Gaza. Hadas, I want to start with you. Has there been some reaction from Lebanon today after the airstrikes?",

And we're hearing from both Lebanese government officials as well as Israeli military officials that they want to deescalate the situation, they don't want to see anything further. So it is notable, situation here up north by the Lebanese border is still very tense, the airspace is still closed, but life goes on as normal. The residents here have not been told to stay close to shelter. So still a very potentially volatile situation and also we should keep an eye on in the next couple of hours. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah is expected to give a speech. So far, Hezbollah has not taken responsibility for these rockets that were launched, although the Israeli military will say nothing happens in southern Lebanon, without Hezbollah's at least tacit approval. So it will be very interesting to see what the Hezbollah leader has to say about the events that have taken place over the last few days. Sara.",

Can you give us some sense, Fred of what is happening where you are?FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR International CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's also an extremely tense situation down here further south at the border between Israel and Gaza. In fact, if we pan over there, you can see that we're actually really close to the border beyond those fortifications, that back there is already Gaza. And one of the things that I'm hearing as I stand here, Sara, is Israeli drones, or what appear to be Israeli drones flying overhead the entire time. And that just gives you an indication on how high - on how high an alert the Israelis are at this point in time as again, the Israelis say that right now, the situation remains extremely volatile here on the ground. There have of course been those Israeli strikes that took place overnight on what the Israelis say was some tunnel infrastructure, some research and development facilities, as they put it, for Hamas to make rockets, for instance, but then also some launching areas as well. Nevertheless, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces told me earlier that the Israelis don't want all of this to further escalate. Here's what he said. LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: We want to deescalate. I mean, there's a very, very sensitive weekend ahead with Passover, Ramadan and Easter all aligning. And we're looking for - hoping for a quiet weekend although we had another attack right after the prayers in Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley. But we look - we're looking to deescalate.",

What do you make of that, what is a pretty clear message?IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER, EURASIA GROUP: Well, we haven't seen this kind of activity across the Israel-Lebanon border in almost 20 years, 2006. You know, you've got 10,000 U.N. observers/peacekeepers there. Both sides have wanted to keep the border, pretty quiet. So I think the surprise here is the fact that you've seen missile strikes. This is not from the occupied territories, this is directly from Lebanon, it's hard to imagine that you'd see that many missile strikes without Hezbollah being aware and giving their at least tacit approval. So that - that's the surprise. But I mean, in our - is it going to be over in terms of you know, just this, you know, one back and forth? We don't know the answer.

If you think about, you know, the military balance of power. It's kind of like the way we think of the United States and ultimately, not China. It's not Russia. It's the damage we do to ourselves.
