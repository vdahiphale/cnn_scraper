I want to bring in Natasha Lindstaedt, who's a professor of government at the University of Essex in England. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, Natasha, as we say, a fiery political speech, really different from previous State of the Union speeches. What's that to you? NATASHA LINDSTAEDT, PROF. OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX: Well, you're right. It is different than State of the Union speeches, which are mostly about recommending legislation to Congress. This was the speech of Biden's life. He really had to prove to the American public that he's fit to lead for another four years. And he had to show a lot of energy and he had to be quick on his feet. He had to strike the right balance. And I think he did a fantastic job last night. He was able to touch upon the key points that he needed to. And he was able to joke a little bit about his age. But I think you saw throughout, he didn't have any major gaps. He didn't have any hiccups. He stayed really focused and he surely delivered at least what the campaign wanted him to do. As you mentioned, he didn't call out Trump by name, but he had some really key points of illustrating how dangerous a Trump second term could be by goading Russia, for example, to go after U.S. allies, U.S.-NATO allies if they didn't pay up. And I actually think the best line of the speech was you can't love your country only when you win. That's really key to understanding the basics of democracy, that democracy isn't always about winning. It's about understanding to be tolerant of the other side. And he pointed out that the Republicans and Trump were rewriting history about what happened on January 6th, that this really was the biggest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War.",

It definitely energized the Democratic base, energized Biden supporters, and it possibly could change the mind of those that are undecided. I mean, there were times during the speech you could see some Republicans nodding their heads, either in agreement or just couldn't really disagree with what Biden was saying about, in particular, the immigration bill and a few other issues. There are other times, as was mentioned in the report in the split screen, they weren't applauding. And that, in some ways, does look unpatriotic.

But that, in the words of President Biden, it is in Hamas' hands right now. And indeed, in his State of the Union address, he said quite specifically that if Hamas were to free the hostages, lay down its arms and also hand over those responsible for its October the 7th terrorist attacks, that this war would be over tomorrow. Instead, because there has been no deal in place, the concern now is that Israel will proceed with its ground operation in Rafah, where there are around a million, million and a half people who have taken shelter, where Israel says the remaining battalions, the last bastion of Hamas remains and therefore needs to be destroyed. So there are concerns that that is now going to be the next step and that that, of course, could also impact the negotiations for a hostage and truce deal, negotiations which, as I say, are at an impasse but haven't completely broken down yet.

The U.S. has also used sanctions against Chinese entities over a number of issues, from allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang to the illicit fentanyl trade to support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And Wang did add, the Chinese foreign minister, that there have been improvements in this fraught relationship, especially since Biden and Xi met in San Francisco in November. And we have seen some improvement in the tone of the relationship in the form of high-level military communications have resumed. A working group has been set up to address the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. But last month, Wang Yi, China called on U.S. to lift sanctions. That is a sore point for China.

You know, I don't think that you can effectively walk forward -- you can't walk forward with positivity and confidence if you're always looking backwards.(END VIDEOTAPE) COREN (on camera):  And, Kim, as we heard from aviation engineer, Richard Godfrey, he is certain that MH370 can be found, thanks to four pieces of information and that information is from Boeing, from Inmarsat, the satellite company that tracked MH370 every hour it was still in the air, from data, from oceanographers. And finally from whisper data, which is new technology using radio, amateur signals. Now he said all of these four different data align and that is why he believes there is now an accurate crash location. He also said that the black box must be recovered because then there'll be able to establish exactly what happened. So the world can learn, you know, lessons for the future and safety of aviation, but more importantly, so that the families can lay their loved ones to rest and to learn the truth -- Kim.",
