Donald Trump's selection of Congressman Matt Gaetz to be attorney general sent shock waves through Washington and the country yesterday. Gaetz has earned notoriety for a variety of political stunts over the years. Here he was on Capitol Hill, wearing a gas mask during the COVID pandemic. But it's been his sexual, not political exploits, that have landed him in trouble in recent years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): He was accused of sleeping with an underaged girl. But there's a reason why no one in the conference came and defended him, because we had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor that all of us had walked away of the girls that he had slept with.

But now that he's resigned from Congress, after being tapped by Trump to head the Justice Department, the investigation is effectively over, and it's not clear whether the report will ever be made public.

We all know that. Putting that aside, can they vote to release it? I think the answer is yes. I mean, they can do, essentially, what they want. There was an incident a couple years ago where a House committee released Donald Trump's tax returns. And I was critical of the House Committee, because they essentially ad-libbed that rule. They said, Well, we want to release it. Let's take a vote, and they very solemnly released the tax returns, which I thought was a -- excuse me, a convenient one-off. [06:20:02] So, yes, they can release it. But here's the thing that I don't get. If the idea is, well, let's nominate Gaetz. We'll strip the House of jurisdiction, and so this report can't come out. If he's up for A.G., all of that's going to be in play. I mean, when I was a lowly, you know, regular DOJ prosecutor, they talked to my parents' neighbors about whether I ever smoked weed.

I would be stunned if it would vote to release the report, because that would be a bit of a finger in the eye to the president-elect. I would also be stunned if Matt Gaetz came back in January, because that wouldn't help him in his confirmation process, probably. But who knows? We're all sort of stunned by a lot of things.

Namely Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula. So, yesterday, we talked about how, if this storm moved over that part of the world before entering the Gulf of Mexico, it would disorganize the storm and mean a weaker storm for the Southeastern U.S. That's, in fact, what we're seeing this morning as a little bit further West than what we had originally forecast yesterday. But this is bringing extremely heavy rainfall to this area, flash floods and mudslides, potentially with Tropical Depression 19 as it hovers near the coast of Honduras through this weekend and then moves greatly inland across the Yucatan Peninsula. So, what that means, as it enters the Bay of Campeche, the Southern Gulf of Mexico, it will be a much more disorganized storm versus as if it was to split the difference between Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula, stay over open waters, and what was forecast yesterday potentially impact Florida, as what was a tropical storm or hurricane, by the second half of next week. Regardless, this is going to bring a lot of rain to the area. But as it shifts to the Southeastern U.S. for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week, it should be a greatly weaker storm, and it should also just be more of a rain and gusty wind threat. Now, moving on, we've got a storm system that's moving into the Northeast that hopefully would bring some rainfall to the drought conditions and the wildfire areas across New England. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The storm system is going to slide South and bring no relief in terms of rain to places like New Jersey and New York today -- Kasie.",
