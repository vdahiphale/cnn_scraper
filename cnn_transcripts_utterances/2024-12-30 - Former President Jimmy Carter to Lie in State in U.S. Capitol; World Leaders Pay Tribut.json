Plus, what investigators are now learning about that deadly crash of a passenger plane in South Korea. Officials are confirming the pilot reported a bird strike shortly before the doomed emergency landing. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in \"The Situation Room.\" Tonight, the nation's capital is preparing to honor a unique figure in U.S. political history, the 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter. Carter's death at the age of 100 has set the wheels in motion for a state funeral some 10 days from now. That will include a eulogy by President Biden. CNN's Rafael Romo is over at the Carter Center in Atlanta for us. But first, I want to go to our senior White House correspondent, Kayla Tausche.

We have learned that as President Carter is remembered across the country in the coming days, it will begin with a processional in southern Georgia this Saturday. Services at the Georgia State Capitol and the Carter Center, of course, his post- presidency diplomatic hub. Then he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda here in Washington,D.C. from January 7th to January 9th before that official state funeral here in Washington, D.C. on January 9th. Following that, Carter will return home to Plains, Georgia for a private internment. President Joe Biden will be among those eulogizing former President Carter, the 39th President of the United States, in those services on January 9th. Of course, Biden ascended to the Senate just before Carter sought the presidency. He campaigned for then candidate Carter who was serving as Georgia's governor at the time, and the two developed a decades-long friendship. They often spoke on the phone, and they would campaign and counsel each other over the course of those years. Just after taking office on his 100th day in office, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visited the Carters in Plains, Georgia, to thank their old friends. And after that visit, Biden told reporters at the time, it was great to see President Carter. He reminded me that I was the first person to endorse him outside of Georgia, and we sat and talked about the old days. In October of this year, President Biden released a video commemorating President Carter's 100th birthday. At that time, he called him a moral force for our nation and the world and a beloved friend. And just this Sunday, after news of President Carter's death, Biden stepped away from his family vacation to deliver roughly 10 minutes of remarks talking about his friend and what he believed the legacy Carter will leave. During those remarks, Biden said that he would be remembered for his simple decency as a humanitarian and a statesman. And certainly now, Wolf, we know that we will hear much more from President Biden himself when he delivers that eulogy next week.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, first of all, he -- with the assistance of Walter Mondale, upgraded and changed the role of the vice president of the United States, making the vice president a major advisor on policy. Jimmy Carter also started the process of important deregulation of our economy. It's often assumed that Ronald Reagan, his successor, started that process, but in fact Jimmy Carter did it.Now, why did Jimmy Carter do it? Because Jimmy Carter was a small businessman, and he understood that at times federal regulations and sometimes state regulations undermined his ability to engage in efficient business. And so once he reached Washington, he worked with allies in Congress, not just Democrats, Republicans too, to deregulate the trucking industry, the aviation industry, the telecom industry, and ultimately the energy industry. And finally, Jimmy Carter. changed his mind about the nature of the Soviet threat. He didn't change it when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. He actually began to rethink his assumptions before. And as a result, he supported defense procurement, including the acceleration of the stealth technology that had already been worked on in the Ford administration. So to some extent, the foundations for the Reagan defense buildup started under Jimmy Carter. And finally, Jimmy Carter, based on his religious faith, based on the fact that he had served in the U.S. military during World War II, and of course was a Cold War president, he deeply wanted to find peaceful solutions to difficult international problems. And through his role in brokering the Egypt-Israeli Camp David Accord, he proved that peace was possible even in the Cold War.",

Can you imagine Jimmy Carter walking by someone who needs something and just keep walking? Can you imagine Jimmy Carter referring to someone by the way they look or the way they talk? I can't. I can't.And I think that was very true. Carter was a man of deep faith and principle that flowed from his faith. And that informed who he was as a person and who he was as a public figure, both as president and after his presidency. He centered human rights and civil rights in his policy and in his activities after. And in some ways, he traveled the world and he never passed by someone who needed help. But I will say one thing, and it's interesting the scheduling of this state funeral which of course is totally appropriate, but it strikes me that one difference between Joe Biden and Jimmy Carter was, that Jimmy Carter spent four years in Washington, but Joe Biden spent half a century. Jimmy Carter was at the consummate outsider. Joe Biden is the consummate insider. And there was never a real comfort between Carter and that town because he came with a promise to take on the conventional politics of that moment and to heal the country after Watergate and Vietnam. And that put him in conflict with a lot of the power brokers in Washington. He pushed ethics rules that existed for decades, including disclosing his own income taxes, Inspectors general independent of agencies to monitor what agencies with what we're doing. He took on some of the sweetheart kind of deals in Washington and some of the projects that were wasteful, that were of particular interest of members of congress. He didn't have liquor at White House events, you know, the lubricant of Washington commerce and politics. So, in many ways he left Washington as an outsider and he returns to Washington for this final time as an outsider as he is by all of humanity, but still someone who kept faith with his promise to take on some of the worst elements of our government.",

That's not to say his presidency was perfect. David has hinted at the fact that Jimmy Carter was not a typical politician. One could even argue he was an anti-politician. He didn't like to schmooze.In many ways, he couldn't be more different from Joe Biden in the sense that the way they approach the question of building a governing coalition, at least when Joe Biden was in the Senate. Nevertheless, despite not being a politician's politician, Jimmy Carter and his team were able to develop and achieve a remarkable legislative legacy.

The only way to move anything forward here is to have teamwork to stick together. Republicans need to start that process with the Speaker's vote.",
