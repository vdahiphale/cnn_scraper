If the president is indicted, his numbers will go up among Republicans, that they feel that he is the victim of partisan attack, they will feel that he is being unfairly treated, and they are more likely to rally around him than to abandon him.We saw the same thing in Mar-a-Lago a few months ago. I don't think that his opponents really grasp the idea that Donald Trump is the best victim in politics that I've ever seen in the 35 years that I've been working. That's number one. Number two is that Governor DeSantis is a legitimate opponent of his. And what really matters is states that really matter for all of this: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. I don't care what the national numbers show. They only care what these four states show because that's what kicks it off. And third, I hate to say this and it's wrong, but in the end, perception is reality. It doesn't matter what the president did. It doesn't really matter what he said. It's what we think he did and what we think he said that matters. And there is a segment, as David Wilk (ph) I'm sure confirmed, there's a segment of the Republican Party, perhaps a third, that is prepared to believe whatever Donald Trump says and agree with whatever he does. So, do not expect the collapse of his candidacy if he's indicted. In fact, expect the support to grow.",

I mean, they're -- they're retreat -- they've been in a retreat since Sunday and there is not anything else they've been able to talk about except reacting to whether Trump is going to get indicted, what's he going to get indicted for, how do you feel about his indictment.

We have a person who is, unfortunately, deceased and with symptoms while she was alive of arsenic poisoning. So clearly, there's a great need for an autopsy. Now, I understand that James Craig did not want an autopsy done, and now we understand why he didn't want that done. But I can tell you that postmortem, you can detect and even quantitate the amount of arsenic that you find in the body. There is very sophisticated instrumentation. We just haven't seen an autopsy report yet, but the toxicology is going to be part of that. And so that is the other piece that we need. We know he ordered the arsenic. Apparently, he also ordered cyanide, potassium cyanide, which is a very, very potent poison, very rapidly acting poison. He had it sent to his medical office.
