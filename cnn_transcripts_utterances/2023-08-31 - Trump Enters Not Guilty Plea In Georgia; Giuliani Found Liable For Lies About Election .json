Mitch McConnell freezes on camera and stop speaking mid-sentence. New CNN reporting spotlights a behind the scenes frenzy to reassure Republicans that the leader is OK, and he can still do his job. And Clarence Thomas fesses up to what we already knew that he lived like the rich and famous and on the dime of actual billionaires who had business before the court. I'm Dana Bash, let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with that breaking news out of Fulton County, Georgia. Donald Trump formally entered a plea of not guilty. That happens just happened minutes ago. He did it in a new court filing. And it means, we won't see him inside an actual courtroom next week on September 6, when some of Mr. Trump's co-defendants are expected to be arraigned. Let's go to CNN's Zack Cohen. So, Zack, what exactly did the former president file? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, Dana. Donald Trump pleading not guilty in this case. And it takes some perspective here. This is the fourth time Donald Trump has now entered a not guilty plea in response to criminal charges since he's left office just a couple years ago. And that's a pretty remarkable uncharted territory right now. But, you know, this is the most recent case that went to Georgia, where he is charged with, you know, allegedly trying to overturn the presidential election results there. It remains to be seen how this might impact a trial. There's a lot of moving pieces still that could determine timing. But look, the Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis stands by her position that she wants to try Donald Trump and the 18 other co-defendants in this case all together. Trump is really just one of a handful of defendants who have entered a not guilty plea so far, but we do expect there will be more to come. And you know, it remains to be seen if Fani Willis will be able to try all 19 including Trump together at some point.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, there are two ways that an arraignment can happen. And waivers the most traditional way that an arraignment is going to go, people are going to waive, no one needs to come to court, you're not going to waste an attorney's time.The alternative to that is what's referred to as formal arraignment, and I thought that former President Trump might try to do formal arraignment. And that's the situation where the judge or the assistant district attorney reads the entire indictment into the record. And at the end of it and the defendant enters their plea, generally says, not guilty. So here, what benefit the former president might have had for a formal arraignment is that he could have come in, had the indictment read and then made a very dramatic statement of not guilty, perhaps leaning forward like he did in his mugshot. However, this is a 90 what, 96, 98-page long indictment. So, the former president would have had to sit there for approximately an hour and a half to two hours before he could have that dramatic moment. And of course, you know, probably all the cameras are turned away. So, I think that's why there's waiver. There's no dramatic moment here unless you're hanging out for about two hours, listening to somebody read.",

Yes, he has to sit in the courtroom for an hour and a half.But he understands the spectacle that he creates because he's done it now twice in the four cases that he's had to deal with.

So, you know, given the opportunity to perhaps be on the road and hold another rally versus sitting in a courtroom for the better part of the day, you know, with a number of his other co-defendants. I think Donald Trump decided to skip it this time.",

How the judge wrote off Giuliani's legal excuses as having more holes than Swiss cheese. And that's 50 years in litigation should, at least that's what he did when he was practicing as an attorney. It should have taught him that lip service will never satisfy a court of law.Former federal prosecutor Shan Wu joins the table as well. Shan, what do you make of this decision by the judge when it comes to, this is a civil case right now going on in Georgia for these two women who were very much defamed, and their lives were turned upside down to describe it in real detail when they were testifying before the January 6 committee?",

He submitted this pleading, he called it really a nolo contemporary pleading, which usually means is no contest. And he basically admitted that what he said was false. But he still wanted to say he had a right to say it under the First Amendment.So, that's sort of a textbook case of defamation. That you know you're saying something false. And yet you strongly assert you have the right to say it. It's not like it was by accident or something like that. So, I think that's really going to hurt him on the damages issue. Compensatory tens of millions will be little bit hard to figure out how they get to that that's usually your out-of-pocket damages. You had an injury, you got treatment, maybe mental distress counseling. But on the punitive, so I think he's looking at a world of hurt there, because the judge is going to be pissed off at him.",

And so, what the judge basically said is, if you fail to obey the discovery rules, at some point, there's going to be a sanction. And that means that your answer is going to be struck. And so, what happens at that point, once your answers strike, we're down to one issue, no longer liability, but rather how damaged were these poll workers.And so, he's still entitled to a little bit of a trial at this point, or at least the damages hearing the opposite to figure out what those amounts are. But that's a pretty serious sanction. That's the highest sanction you can get in a civil litigation when you're a defendant is to have your answer struck. So, it's a very big deal.",

There are still questions about what that underlying cause is his office said that he had consulted a doctor before that Bank's event, but no word on what the diagnosis from the physician was from that visit. It all comes, Dana, as questions continue to persist by McConnell's own political future. He has indicated that he will continue to serve as leader as he has for the past 16 years through the end of next year. But the question is what will happen at the end of this current congress? Will he continue to serve as leader in the new Congress. And talking to Republicans, there's a growing doubt that Senator McConnell will continue to stay as leader in the after this coming Congress, which could open up the first contest of leadership fight for this very important position, the first time since 2007.

They're playing out in front of cameras. And it makes you wonder how often is this happening behind the cameras. And his aides, when they come to aside seem to not be totally fazed by it as if it might have happened before. I think politically, Jonah, you're absolutely right, that in the short-term, he is fine. No, Republicans are calling for him to step down. But it's a different question when his term is leader is up, whether he's going to want to run and whether he would have the support to do so. And health challenges aside. He also is facing the ire of Trump world. That's another factor he did face in this last leadership election, his most serious challenge to date. So, I think there are a lot of questions about what he wants to do. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: A lot of questions and the transparency issue is something that's come up in the past with other members and dealing with health issues as well. I remember we discussed that with Senator Fetterman as well, during the campaign. We discussed it with Feinstein as well. The question around just what is happening behind the scenes and how is the Sanders status when we don't see him is something that's going to be a question moving forward. And I think your point, as well as just what this means broadly, politically. You know, members of the public, we already see that they are concerned about the president's age. They are concerned that their elected officials don't represent them based on various demographics. So, when they see clips like this, it's hard to think that this really builds trust when it comes to the voter base, knowing that their elected officials represent them and are in full down (Ph)",
