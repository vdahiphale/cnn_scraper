Right now, as we wait to hear from President Biden, we are joined by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Mr. Speaker, thanks for being with us tonight. What are you hoping to hear from President Biden tonight? REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Well, it is a dark time in the history of the country. This is a dangerous time and we've been suggesting that all elected officials from the president on down really try to draw the country together. We need a unified message. We need to turn the temperature down and I think it is a time for moral clarity. I mean, I think everyone in elected office has a responsibility in all of this and we need to remind this country that we are all together. There is no place for this rhetoric that has heated up the political environment and it leads to this kind of action and we all have to do our part. So I hope that he will take that seriously.",

Certainly among presidents, maybe at least since Abraham Lincoln, Civil War era, and that takes a toll. I mean, when my colleagues go out, Democratic colleagues and say democracy will end, the Republic will be in an emergency stage if Donald Trump wins for president, it is just not true. It is another election. And when they say that kind of rhetoric and they heat did up like that, there are people out there that take these things to heart and they act upon them. Politicians are not responsible for that, but we do have a responsibility to be responsible. I mean, we are not asking for much. Let's just dial the rhetoric down. Let's have a vigorous debate.

Whether you're a postman, whether you're having political debates at the office, you should think about what you say because words matter.

So what I can tell you is this building where the shooter had shot former president Trump was outside the security perimeter. So the question in that moment becomes, was it checked and was a local law enforcement officer assigned to the building? Anderson, when I went through this incident with several members of law enforcement, they looked at the proximity of that building, just 150 yards from the podium, and where the former president was speaking and were alarmed at how close that building was and that it was outside the security perimeter. So those are the big questions, Anderson. And moving forward, what we continue to press are sources on is in what way this building factored into the security plans. So for example, did they look at it and decide for whatever reason it did not present a vulnerability, for example? Was it locked? Was it impossible for someone to get inside?

Donald Trump has already put out fundraising posters with a sign that the Secret Service wrapped around him and his fist up. They're going to use it on this stage. They also, Jake, have a tremendous opportunity. The election is 16 weeks from Tuesday. Donald Trump is ahead. Donald Trump is ahead a little bit. The national polls or it's tied if you would say no clear leader in some of the national polls. But it's almost time to set the national polls aside unless there's a huge swing in them and just go state-by-state through the battleground states. This is why Democrats are so nervous. Trump is ahead by three points, five points, sometimes six points in the battleground states, sometimes it's one or two. But he has several paths. I can give you several viable path for Donald Trump to get to 270. I can give you one, maybe two for Joe Biden at this point. So if they use that stage correctly to talk about the cost of living, to talk about the personal contrast if they think that's a strength for them, to talk about issues that matter to the American people, they can take them modestly that they have now and make it a bigger lead.

Kennedy was killed and then Lyndon Johnson was somehow able to go to a Joint Session of Congress not long after and talk about the most important memorial to John Lennedy would be the passage of his domestic program, which had been stuck in Congress. And it took us forward. It made the country feel that we were movingin a good direction. Similarly, I was alive in 1968 when Martin Luther King was killed and Robert Kennedy went before a group in Indianapolis up a big rally of African-Americans and had to tell them that Martin Luther King had died but he said it in such an extraordinary way. He said he understood that there might be a feeling for hate, there might be a feeling for revenge. He understood that because he had lost a brother, but he hoped that they would understand more importantly that Martin Luther King's life was lived for love and for justice. And it turned out that he was so effective with those words that, although riots went all throughout the rest of the country, Indianapolis was one of the few cities that stayed calm that night. And then of course only two months later, Robert Kennedy himself was killed. America felt, as I know, having lived through the '60s that we were reeling, how could this possibly happen? And then we go many years forward and a lot of people weren't alive even in 1991 when in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was hit by his assassin potential, and he then was able to mobilize to his humor, his grace, and going to a joint session of Congress where the cheering went on and on and was able to put forward his economic program which then was able to get through because he was able to deal with that crisis. So we've seen these times, but we've also seen that somehow, somehow good things came out of them. And that's what we've got to remember as we feel reeling right now.",

It's an important moment. It was used when John Kennedy was talking about the Cuban missile crisis. It was used when Eisenhower was defending his decision to send troops for Little Rock. It was used when Ronald Reagan had to talk about the challenge or crisis. Those were moments when the president fills a vacuum and using it tonight to talk about cooling down the rhetoric. Perhaps president -- former president Trump will do the same in his convention. Speaker Johnson did it in comparison to Senator Vance and Senator Scott. Senator Scott talked right away about somehow that the attack was aided and abetted by the radical left and the corporate media. I mean, that doesn't help when a lot of people were yelling during this whole rally against the media as if it was their fault that some of this was happening. So if we can get the major leaders at least to agree and maybe that will be what former president Trump talks about when he's there, then maybe just maybe those who want to talk in a more difficult direction will feel at least worried about hesitating if their leaders are not going in that direction.",
