      "sentences": "And, Frank, you can go up and show where there crane did collapse. They said the cab started to smoke - it filled up with smoke. And he said once he saw the crane operator evacuate that cab, that's when he knew it was not a good sign. So, he said that's when the building started to quickly evacuate of all those workers who are now all standing on the streets here around me.And they -- one of the workers described to me that actually as they were trying to escape that building, they could feel the rumble of that crane swinging, as you see in that dramatic video, hitting that opposite side building and then eventually collapsing. And I was told again from these workers that because there are spotters on the ground, they were able to get everyone out of the way. And that may be actually what helped prevent so many injuries on the ground after this crane collapsed. And you heard from the mayor, you heard from those officials that this could have been a lot worse. So, it does seem that five people were injured, including some firefighters responding here to the scene. It doesn't sound like there were any violations with this construction that was going on at this particular building. But certainly there's a lot of questions about what went wrong. It does appear to the workers, though, it was some sort of mechanical issue as they were loading that heavy concrete to bring up to one of those top floors where this crane was operating. But again, five injuries and we'll continue to figure out exactly what's going to happen here on the scene. You can imagine the traffic around here is just incredibly horrible for people who are trying to get to work in this midtown area. But most of these streets are cleared from people and it's just emergency vehicles and onlookers of this incredible incident that happened here in midtown Manhattan.",

And 6,000 to 7,000 of these sudden cardiac arrests occur roughly every year. About 40 percent, 39, 40 percent are related to - to sports in some ways. So, we know it's more common in men. We know it's more common in sports. And basketball is the sport that it's most closely associated with.As you get older, sports become less of a - of a factor. And once you get over the age of 35 or so what is called a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, a blockage of blood vessels in the arteries that lead to the heart, that becomes a more common cause of these heart problems. So sudden cardiac arrest in younger players, 6,000 to 7,000, most closely aligned with sports, but it changes, John, as you get older.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a good point, a good question.So, sudden cardiac arrest, think of that more like an electrical problem. If, you know, you look at the heart, you've got electrical -- electricity that's moving through the heart, that actually gets the chambers of the heart to coordinate pumping on time. Pumping in a specific rhythm. That is like an electrical abnormality. It can cause a sudden problem. Somebody might actually just lose consciousness, lose their pulse. They're - they're just not responsive. That's the sort of thing where defibrillation, CPR, is so critically important. Which it sounds like happened here. And it happened really quickly, which makes a big difference in terms of overall recovery. A heart attack, think of that more like a plumbing or a circulation problem, where you've got these blood vessels on top of the heart, the coronary blood vessels, and one of them may become blocked or occluded, a plaque or a blood clot, something can do that, and cause a heart attack where parts of the muscle tissue die. Now, when you have a heart attack on a myocardial infarction, that can lead to a cardiac arrest. But not all cardiac arrests are due to heart attacks or MIs, myocardial infarctions.",

It is about UFOs, unidentified flying objects, though they are now called UAPs, which used to mean unidentified aerial phenomena but now apparently means unidentified anomalous phenomena. But I digress.The committee holding these hearings calls UFOs, or UAPs, both versions, a potential national security threat. As of May, the Defense Department said it was tracking more than 800 cases of unidentified UAPs. Very shortly this House Oversight Subcommittee will hear from three witnesses who all previously served in the U.S. military. Former Navy Pilot Ryan Graves has reported multiple encounters. CNN has received a preview from his opening statements. One of the things he says is, the UAP we encountered and tracked on multiple sensors behaved in ways that surpassed our understanding and technology. I am formally trained - I am a formally trained engineer and have no explanation for this. With us now is Democratic Congressman Andre Carson from Indiana, who held ground-breaking hearings about UAPs last year when he led a different committee. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. There was a suggestion by the people holding this committee, the members holding this committee this morning, that there is information being withheld from the American people, startling information, including perhaps the presence of alien spaceships in Defense Department custody. What evidence have you seen that information is being withheld from the American people? REP. ANDRE CARSON (D-IN): Well, I want to say that I'm very happy that more public attention is focused on the issue of UAPs. This time on the House Oversight Committee. However, I would advise my Republican friends leading this effort to do a lot more listening and not jumping to unfounded conclusions, though we understand the importance this - of this issue. I've been sounding the alarm for years. I held the first hearing in 50 years since Project Blue Book. But we have to be careful about the kinds of questions that are raised. We shouldn't attempt to gain political points because our adversaries are listening. Our adversaries and opponents are watching. They're looking for context clues to put together things in terms of where we're placing assets globally. And so we have to be very careful because our national security is at risk.",

There are like 6 billion smartphones in a world. Each one has a high resolution camera and video system. We're crowd sourcing an alien invasion were to one ever occur. I'm not convinced it's aliens but it's a fun mystery. Go check it out. Go look for it.If you're abducted you could stream that. And then he tweeted, you know, cute cat videos go viral instantly. Nearly 7 billion smartphones in the world. Imagine video of an extraterrestrial ship landing with aliens disembarking. I'm thinking that would go viral, too. Basically what' he's saying is, if - if there are visitations and spaceships and the like, don't you think we'd get a better look at them than the grainy video that we're showing up here on the wall?",
