People had their apartment windows shattered. Remarkably, the Ukrainian military says there has been no significant damage to the power grid. There are rolling blackouts affecting people who live here in Kyiv and all over Ukraine. The power grid is far from stable, it's going to be quite some time, as crews continue to work to try to repair these facilities that have been damaged by these attacks, weaponizing winter, targeting the power grid, making civilians' lives miserable, as the temperatures plunge. The start of winter is just days away, even though in this instance, the Ukrainians did shoot down, they say 13 drones fired from Russia. These are Iranian made drones that explode upon impact. There were incidents just within the last week, where some of the drones didn't make it through. For example, in southern Ukraine region of Odessa, 1.5 million people were plunged into darkness last weekend when, out of 15 drones that were launched by Russia, five of them did hit their targets. There is certainly welcome news here in Kyiv, that reporting by CNN that the Patriot missile defense systems will be arriving at some point in this country. But of course, that comes with its own set of challenges and risks, including threats from the Russians that this will make NATO and the United States complicit in escalating this war -- Will Ripley, CNN, Kyiv.
