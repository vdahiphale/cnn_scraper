In no particular order, there has been questions about the constitutionality of this charge and, basically, involving your past drug use or drug history or addiction and limiting your Second Amendment right.So, it has been decided out of the 5th Circuit which does not cover the state of Delaware, but it has been challenged another level, number one. Number two, I think it's safe to say that, despite what some people might want to see happen against the Bidens, from an objective standard, do you not see this charge as a stand-alone charge for somebody who has filled out paperwork saying that they don't have a drug addiction or are not using drugs, when they in fact are, when it is as a firearm. I think what is critical here is that states start to say marijuana recreational use is okay like the state of Missouri. If it's okay in the state of Missouri that you possess a firearm and you're using marijuana, well then, you are in violation of this law, and I can't imagine, you know, a senator like Josh Hawley is going to say, my constituents should be prosecuted for illegally using marijuana, at a given time, and then possessing a firearm or saying on a piece of paper, I don't use drugs. It's a little bit extreme, if it's not associated with a shooting or big drug dealer or sort of kingpin. So, it's safe to say that. Last but not least, the point that he made about whether or not the agreement still stands, I think that is probably the more difficult to argue for him, because it's not on an island. It's part of a bigger picture, part of the bigger case. But, there are some valid concerns about it. He is innocent imported proven guilty, email committed to crime technically, but this is really not something that we're going to see that often.",

But I would tend to think that this gets resolved and little to no jail time, because, again, this is a stand-alone island, you know? You don't see it that way as a stand-alone case, and when you look at the entirety of what he did from possessing that gun for 11 days, this is not the most serious of federal crimes that should send this young -- not young man, he's little over (INAUDIBLE), this man -- any man, forget your age, any woman, any person, to prison for any significant period of time.

So, it is a huge issue there.We have this meeting, didn't we, recently between Kim Jong-un and Putin as well. We've been talking about that on the show. Kim Jong-un is still in Russia. I think that, you know, Zelenskyy is a force on the international stage, he's got this amazing charisma.
