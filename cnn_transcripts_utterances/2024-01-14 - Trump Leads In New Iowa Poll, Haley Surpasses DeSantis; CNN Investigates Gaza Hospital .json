And a just released poll finds Donald Trump continues to keep his iron grip on Iowa Republicans.The final \"Des Moines Register\"/NBC News/Mediacom of likely GOP caucusgoers shows Donald Trump support at a whopping 48 percent. Nikki Haley, a distant second with 20 percent, Ron DeSantis, third at 16 percent. But Iowa is coping with a vicious winter storm which has brought blizzard conditions and brutal cold across the state. Candidates have been forced to cancel multiple campaign events during this final weekend push before the caucuses. The arctic blast will be in place Monday and there are concerns about turnout. The high temperature in much of Iowa that day is forecast to be negative 2 degrees Fahrenheit, or negative 16 degrees Celsius. CNN's chief U.S. national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny is there in Iowa. He got more on the results of the new poll of likely Republican caucusgoers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  With two days to go before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican presidential nominating contest, Donald Trump still remains far and away frontrunner in Iowa, according to the new \"Des Moines Register\"/NBC News poll. This Iowa poll which has a storied history of capturing the final movements in this race shows Donald Trump at 48 percent in the poll. The race for second place is fascinating, with Nikki Haley edging out Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just narrowly, 20 percent followed by 16 percent. The rest of the field is far below, Vivek Ramaswamy 8 percent, the rest goes down from there. But it is the top of the field, showing that Donald Trump still has an overwhelming lead of the race, his supporters the most committed. The reason this matters, weather has been a central concern, blizzard warnings and dangerously cold weather, the committed supporters may be the answer to who shows up on the caucuses here on Monday night in Iowa. But Haley is riding a wave of momentum, although the poll finds that her supporters are not as committed or enthusiastic as others. It also shows that some 68 percent of people have made up their minds, a quarter of Iowa voters have not made up their minds. So, there's still room for movement in this race. But bottom line, this is still Donald Trump's race to lose, there is no doubt. Also, this poll raises expectations of it. He's 28 points ahead of his leading rival, so his margin of victory should he have one on Monday night should be judged against that number. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Des Moines. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, those are really interesting and different questions. I mean, DeSantis has put in the maximum effort in Iowa. He's visited all 99 counties. He's built this big organization. He's corralled the support of more of the state's political leadership than anyone else, including the governor and most of the leading evangelical leaders, in a state where evangelical voters might be 65 percent of the total turnout.If he comes in third, it's hard to see a rationale for him to continue at that point. Even if he narrowly beats Haley for second, that probably is the end of the road. If he can't compete effectively against Trump here, you have to ask yourself, where would he? The problem Haley has got, if DeSantis drops out, it's not clear she gets the bulk of those voters. They might end up with Trump. I mean, Haley's situation reminds me of John McCain, not in 2008 when he won the nomination but 2000 when he lost the nomination. His initial surge was fuelled mostly by independent voters. That surge gave him an opportunity to make a case to core Republicans against the frontrunner, George W. Bush. Ultimately, he couldn't make a race of it. That race was decided in South Carolina. I really feel like we're heading to something like that again this year where Haley is likely to emerge after Iowa/New Hampshire as the one last viable alternative to Trump, but to have done it mostly on the votes of independents. And to really make a race of this, she's going to have to give Republicans a stronger argument than she's been willing to try so far. HOLMES:  Yeah, Iowa is a deeply red state. Recent polling averages show a lot of love, of course, for Trump in that regard.",

In fact, the last three Iowa winners, none of them won a dozen states and none of them won the nomination. Now, that trend may break this year with Trump.The reason Iowa has not been a good predictor of the eventual Republican winner is because the last candidates won here in a similar way. They borrowed into the state and focused above all on maximizing their support among evangelical Christians, who as I said are the biggest share of the vote here. But once they painted themselves in that corner, they had troubled reaching out beyond that community in other states and really couldn't make a go of it. A problem that was apparent immediately in New Hampshire. One thing I'll be watching for on Monday is in the exit poll, who wins the voters, the minority of voters who are not evangelical Christians because that winner has usually won the nomination. And, again, the problem for Haley, who I think is very much on track to be the last standing alternative to Trump in ten days from now or so after New Hampshire, is that she has to peel away more Republicans. And to do that, she has to make a stronger case against Trump than she's willing to do so far. All of the arguments against Trump, almost of arguments are value free. There's no value judgment, I'm a stronger candidate. We need generational change. Ultimately, she has to make a case to Republican voters about why they should not to go with someone who they view in essence as the incumbent in the race.",

The first two months of war decimated Gaza's health care system, as Israel launched an air, then land offensive on the north of the strip.

Several, including the two largest in Gaza, Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, were directly attacked by Israel Defense Forces, this evidence suggests.
