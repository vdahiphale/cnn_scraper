The allies will focus on Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine and Kyiv's push to join NATO during two days of high stakes talks. The White House says the group will send a united positive signal on Ukraine's part to membership but declined to provide a timetable. And an official says Mr. Biden will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday. Cheers in Vilnius on the eve of the summit, amid a rapid reversal by Turkey on Sweden's bid to join NATO. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced that Turkey has now dropped objections to Sweden becoming a member, after standing in the way of that of more than a year. Stockholm in turn, appears to be supporting Turkish membership in the European Union, according to Turkey's statement news agency. CNN correspondents are tracking all of these developments. Clare Sebastian is live for us here in London, but we begin with Melissa Bell, who is standing by in Lithuania for us. Melissa, this is quite the reversal that we're seeing from Turkey. It's been a real sticking point and bone of contention now for over a year. Talk to us about the significance of that and what might have driven that decision.",

After all, Bianca, if the question of Sweden's accession to NATO, decided as it was a year ago, could be blocked and dominate the next couple days, what hope was there of actually considering the question of Ukraine's? So, a crucial first stumbling block, and right up until the last minute, of course, these divisions have dominated the run up. And the fact that they should've been resolved as we saw that bi-lat began between the American president and the Lithuanian host, was celebrated this morning by the national security adviser, saying that I was with a head full of steam that they could now go into the summit.I'd like you to have a listen, first of all though, Bianca, to what the Swedish Prime Minister had to say yesterday after that crucial meeting that paves the way for this year long deadlock now to be resolved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ULF KRISTERSSON, SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I'm very happy the three of us, the president of Turkey and the secretary general of NATO and myself have shaken hands over this joint statement. We are thus taking a very big step towards a formal ratification of Sweden's membership in NATO. It has been a good day for Sweden. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This will move Ukraine closer to NATO.To strengthen the political ties with the establishment of the NATO and Ukraine council. We will have the inaugural meeting tomorrow with President Zelenskyy. And then to remove the requirement for membership action plan. This will turn the membership process for Ukraine from a two-step process into a one-step process. So, all of this will send a positive and strong message. Then allies will also make important decisions to further strengthen our deterrence and defense, with new defense plans and more forces on high readiness. We also agree -- that I also expect that allies will agree a more ambitious defense investment pledge, where two percent of GDP for defense will be a minimum. And then lastly, I look forward to also welcoming our Indo-Pacific partners at this summit. This will demonstrate that securities, not regional security, it's global.

The text in the communique will be made public within hours, later on today, when all allies agree on the text. But I expect that allies will agree a message which is clear on the need to move Ukraine closer to NATO, with making sure their forces are interoperable with the NATO Ukraine council, and also removing their comments for a membership action plan. This is all about moving Ukraine closer to NATO membership, which will be extremely important for Ukraine, and also demonstrates the unity and the strength of the message that NATO allies are sending to Ukraine.",

And I think what you just heard from the secretary general there was a lot of confidence that when the 31 members, plus Sweden, meet later today, they will agree on that fairly maximalist version of what the Ukrainians could've hope for. Clearly, what President Biden had set out, speaking to CNN a couple of days ago, is the impossibility of considering Ukrainian accession while the conflict continues, simply because NATO would by definition be drawn into a conflict with Russia, that is a nonstarter. And what he explained -- the American president -- is that there were brought to an image on that. But there are profound divisions on how strong the signal should be about when Ukraine can join. What you just heard from Jens Stoltenberg was a very confident tone that they will be able to send the strongest signal that Kyiv could possibly have hope for -- Bianca.",

So, it's a really delicate balance.Ukraine, I think it's worth working back from what they don't want. What they don't want is more of what they've had over the last 15 years, as the Lithuanian president laid out quite early this morning. More those mantras that Ukraine can join someday. Everything that we heard since that Bucharest summit in 2008. And frankly, Russia has invaded twice since that. So, it's clear that did not work as a deterrent. So they need something more concrete. They need these security guarantees. They want a strong signal, which is of course what Jens Stoltenberg is promising. There was an interesting moment this morning, a Ukrainian politician stood up in front of Jens Stoltenberg said look, millions of Ukrainians want to hear the word invitation. They want to hear that. They've been waiting for that. Are we going to hear that? And Stoltenberg said we'll just wait and see the text of the communique. You know, we're going to send a strong signal. So, he wasn't going to be drawn in that. But I think the language in this communique will be really critical. And as Melissa pointed out, the optics as well, as Zelenskyy, as we expect he will, turning up at the summit, meeting with President Biden, a summit, by the way, happening really on Russia's doorstep.",
