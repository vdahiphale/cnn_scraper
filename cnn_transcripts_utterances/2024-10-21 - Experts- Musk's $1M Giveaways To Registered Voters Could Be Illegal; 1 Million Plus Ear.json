Nice to have you here with us. But there was a -- there's a lot going on, on the Twitter, or X, as it's now known, between you and Elon Musk over the weekend. So I just want to tell the folks at home, this is going to take me a minute, but I think it's important that we lay all of this out for our viewers.So you were firing back at him after he questioned the integrity of your voter roles and said that there were more voters than citizens in the state. You posted, let's be clear, Elon Musk is spreading dangerous disinformation. Then you went on to break down the numbers showing that he's pushing this misleading number, which includes 1.2 million inactive records slated for removal in accordance with the law, ending with don't feed the trolls. Musk then fired back writing, shame on you, blatantly lying to the public, saying you only plan to remove those ineligible -- ineligible voters after the elections, and that's why he says there are far more people registered to vote than there are eligible voters. We can't forget, of course, that Elon Musk now owns X with some 200 million followers. The fact that all of this is playing out, and he is continuing to push this disinformation, how concerning is that to you ahead of the election? JOCELYN BENSON (D-MI), SECRETARY OF STATE: It's very concerning, in -- in part, because, you know, this is a significant platform, and gosh, I wish that folks with such large platforms such as his would use it to spread accurate information about our elections. I understand the nuances and the challenges of doing that, but if you have enough time to Google me and look up my middle name, which he clearly did, you should be able to find out the facts of our elections and post those as well. In my view, I'm going to just keep working to make sure citizens know that our elections are secure, that we I.D. every voter, that we vote on paper ballots, and that we have many layers in place to ensure our results will be accurate.",

He's a law professor at the University of Notre Dame and also an election law expert. OK, so Derek, is this move by Elon Musk, so he's saying, I'm giving away $1 million a day. All you have to do is basically sign this petition in support of my Super PAC and, oh, by the way, only people in these very important battleground states are eligible. Is this legal?",

That's all it is.But on the flip side, that -- that contest is not only open only to those in those swing states, it's only open to those who are registered voters. And so is this an inducement to get people to vote? Is this an incentive to get them to vote? And if that's the case, then it looks like the $1 million a day, the lottery, is being geared toward people who are voting or who are registering to vote, and therefore that's the -- that's the thing that the federal law is concerned about paying people to register to vote. So that's what the debates been about. HILL: So as you noted, there's been this debate all weekend. Do you anticipate seeing any action on this? And -- and what would that involve?

All right, let's take a look at some of the polling out of the Tar Heel State. Look, it's close. It's close. You can find polls that have a tie, two of them. You can find a poll that has Harris up three. Maybe you prefer Donald Trump. We got you a little bit over here, Trump plus three.But the bottom line is, it's close. It is close in the Tar Heel State. Now, what I think is so important about the fact that the Tar Heel State is so close, is this is much more of a must win for Donald Trump than it is for Kamala Harris. Because of Kamala Harris wins in the great state of North Carolina, she has a 91 percent chance of winning the election, not quite certain, but closer to certainty than it is for Donald Trump. Donald Trump, if he wins in the great state of North Carolina, only has an 81 percent chance of winning the election. What essentially that means is, is that North Carolina is much more of a pillar to Donald Trump's map -- map to 270 electoral votes than it is for Kamala Harris. Now, why might that be? Well, you are hinting at it at the top, which is if you look over the past few election cycles in North Carolina, you see a lot more red on the screen than you see blue. The only Democrat, in fact, to win it since 1980 was Barack Obama back in 2008. He won it by well less than a point. Romney won it by two. Trump won it by four in 2016. But last time around, you see this margin tighter, tighter, tighter. And I think that is part of the reason why Democrats think they have an opportunity this time around, because if they can move the ball just a little bit, then all of a sudden you got Kamala Harris winning in the great state of North Carolina, Erica.",
