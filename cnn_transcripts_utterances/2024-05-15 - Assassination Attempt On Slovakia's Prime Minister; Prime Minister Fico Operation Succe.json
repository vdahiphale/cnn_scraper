Consumer prices were up 3.4 percent in April year over year. That was in line with expectations. Housing and fuel costs account for much of the increase on a monthly basis, though the price of groceries actually fell. It's been a year since the last time we saw that. The Federal Reserve is waiting to see meaningful progress on inflation before it starts cutting interest rates. Joining us now, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. Mark, always a pleasure to have you on the show. An exuberant response, I think, from stock market investors today. Do you match that in what you're saying? There's a clear hope here that after, what, three months of hotter than expected readings, the path of inflation now can begin to come down once again. How confident are you? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well, you know, it's hard to be as upbeat as the stock market. What a day, right? I mean, we had new highs on the S&amp;P 500, and I think on the NASDAQ too. So, a lot of giddy investors out there. But it was good news. Yes, I know, particularly in the context of the kind of hot inflation numbers we've been getting since the beginning of the year. This felt really good because it came in -- you know, there's a lot of concern that we get another hot number and we did, we got a reasonably good one. And I think the most important aspect of the report is it feels like all the trend lines here look pretty good, that, you know, we're going to see inflation continue to moderate, get back down to something that the Fed would feel more comfortable with. And ultimately, the key thing here is lower interest rates. We've got to get the Fed cutting rates. And I think that's what stock investors are now beginning to discount more significantly.",

And I know they tend to focus on what is significantly lower and has less weighting of housing, which has been such a key component of keeping inflation at these levels, which is that the PCE number, but they're not there yet.

That's what people think inflation is going to be in the future.

They don't want to just make a mistake and start easing prematurely and inflation picking up again. But, you know, Julia, I'm beginning to get more and more confident that they've hit their targets. They've hit their goals. You know, we're really close now. I don't think I sacrificed the economy to the altar of, you know, much lower inflation because we're just about there.

Number one, the news that Biden and then Trump would accept these debates turned the news cycle on a dime today, as did the fact that this first debate, hosted by CNN, will take place in Georgia, which is a significant detail because it's a critical swing state that Biden flipped in 2020, but it was also central. It was a backdrop of sorts to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And there's been one maxim that the Biden campaign has long believed, and that is that the electorate is not energized, it's not paying attention to this race, but they will start paying attention when the two candidates are side by side, and the Biden campaign believes that they will get a boost from voters once voters finally realize that this is a choice between these two candidates. Now comes the preparation. Six weeks until the big day, that first debate on June 27th. Biden's longtime aide, his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, tell CNN that he will be taking a hiatus from his day job to help prepare.

Then you have another storm that's developing over in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles where you have another severe thunderstorm watch in effect there. That storm system is going to continue to flourish overnight. Look at it as it brings some of the heavy rain and the strong winds towards Dallas by tomorrow morning. Then, as we go later in the day tomorrow, from Eastern Texas, from Houston, over into New Orleans, that's where we're looking at, that heavy rain, that nightmare scenario of the heavy rain on already saturated soils. We're talking about widespread three to six inches of rain, could even find some totals even higher than that. We have two days of a moderate risk. That's a level three out of four, very high risk of excessive rain, flash flooding. We're talking about rivers overflowing, urban flooding as well. We already have some of these flood watches that are in effect as we go through this event. And we put the rivers on here too. And you can see where the rivers are already aggravated. They're already flooding, and it hasn't rained yet. That's because they had some pretty significant problems of rain just a few days ago, just a few weeks ago. We have had a very wet start to the year. I mean, look at all of these places that are seven inches above average in Montgomery, five inches above average in Atlanta, a foot above average in Jackson. And we do know that this is the trend. We find that these deluge days, these water precipitation events are about 37 percent wetter in the area there in the southeast since 1958. And when we get wetter storms, because our atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture, this can mean more flood loss, more flood damage. $32 billion on average across the country. When you look at Louisiana in particular, that is under the gun for this flooding, they spend about $995 million in flood damage.

It's yet another sign of Russia and China's strong relationship. The West has criticized Beijing for allegedly supporting Russia's defense industry. The grandson of Jimmy Carter says the former president is approaching the end of his life. No U.S. president has ever lived as long as Carter, who is now 99 years old. He spent over a year in hospice care after surviving a number of serious health issues in recent years.
