As you heard in that piece, Meta, which has a very substantial communications department, had no comment on this story today, which is quite unusual for a company that likes to defend itself. The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, however, which gave $500 million to Harvard, just in the past few hours, put out a new statement that said that they had no involvement in heard Dr. Donovan's departure from Harvard and was unaware of that development before public reporting on it. Look, Harvard is strongly, strongly denying this, I will say from speaking to other researchers in this space, this is a kind of -- they weren't entirely surprised when they heard this about Dr. Donovan. And just taking a step back further from this, this is all coming as we're going to 2024 disinformation, researchers, people who are calling out this sort of stuff, how it's happening on social media, where it's coming from, how it's affecting people. They're being attacked on all sides because you have the Republicans in the House of Representatives who are subpoenaing them. They're getting sued left, right and center. There really is an attack on academic freedom, generally, in this country, in this space, which is really a crucial space, particularly going into 2024.",
