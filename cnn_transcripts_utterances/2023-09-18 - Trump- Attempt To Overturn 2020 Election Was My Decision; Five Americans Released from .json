Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with the legal and political twofer, how the former president may have undermined a likely defense in his federal election subversion case, and potentially alienated supporters on a central issue to many evangelicals. One could cost him votes, the other perhaps his freedom, both from a single interview with NBC's Kristen Welker, which aired yesterday. On the legal side, he made it harder for his defense attorneys in the January 6 election diversion case, to claim that he was merely acting on advice of counsel in trying to overturn the election that he lost. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS: You called some of your outside lawyers, you said they had crazy theories. Why were you listening to them? Were you listening them because they were telling you what you wanted to hear?",

ANDERSON (on camera): For years their fate tied to tensions between the two countries, but with the help of a common friend in Qatar, breakthrough diplomacy brought us to this very moment. ANDERSON (voice over): Iran freed the dual citizens in a deal to release five Iranians held in US prisons, and to unblock $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds from South Korea. That cash moving from Seoul to Switzerland before being transferred to Doha, after the Biden administration last week issued a sanctions waiver clearing the way for the money to move. The role of Qatar now changing from mediator to guarantor ensuring Washington's demands that Iran's billions are strictly controlled, and spent only on humanitarian goods, like food and medicine. But critics worry even with Doha's oversight, the moneys could be spent however Tehran decides. There is also concern this latest deal enables what many critics have dubbed Tehran's hostage diplomacy.

That left significant questions not only about its military future in and around Ukraine, but also its often secretive and very lucrative operations throughout Africa. The Central African Republic has been home to Wagner forces for years now. Clarissa Ward actually reported on their activities there four years ago. She's now gone back to see what Prigozhin's death has done to Wagner's lucrative mission there in CAR.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the Central African Republic, the message from Wagner is clear. It's business as usual. Less than one month after their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash, mass mercenaries still guard the president and cut an intimidating figure on the streets of the capital. Faces covered, as Wagner protocol dictates, they are unapproachable and untouchable. These are the first images of Wagner fighters in the country since Prigozhin's death.
