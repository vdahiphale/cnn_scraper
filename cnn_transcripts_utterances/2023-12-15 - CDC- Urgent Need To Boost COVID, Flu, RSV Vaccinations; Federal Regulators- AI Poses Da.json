People are sort of paying attention a little bit but, clearly, not enough.Take a look at flu, first of all, and just compare this year's vaccination rates compared to last year's vaccination rates. As you look at those numbers we've never been great about getting a lot of people vaccinated for flu. It's always been well below 50 percent, but it's dropped off even more this year as compared to last year. That's for kids and for adults. If you look at COVID, specifically -- and I -- and we made this graph to sort of show you from the beginning of vaccinations to where we are now. What you find is that initially, people were pretty good about getting their initial -- that's the red line at the top -- getting that first shot. And then even completing the first booster at that point -- the first sort of primary series of shots. But the bottom right corner -- that is the updated vaccine, and fewer than 20 percent of the country, really, across the board, has gotten that. And then, RSV, as you mentioned -- this is a new vaccine recommended for people 60 and older. And again, less than 16 percent have gotten that. So that's concerning. Obviously, as we're going into the season where these viruses are continuing to spread more and more, the CDC has warned -- is issuing this health alert because we want to get more people vaccinated. ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR:  There's also -- I was really struck by the number of hospitalizations. The spikes that we're seeing in hospitalizations --",

So, people who have been saying look, it's in the back of my mind. I haven't gotten my vaccination yet. I should go ahead and do that.

Think about having those antivirals -- access to those.But take a look at this map. You remember that map -- we said think of respiratory disease like you would think of a weather map. There are certain areas of the country that are going to be harder hit. The South is harder hit right now versus the North, but there will be these increases in the north. Think about that as you may be traveling for the holidays and things like that. If you are having gatherings, in addition to the obvious things, ventilation and air circulation really important.

I mean, lightning- fast ability to craft song lyrics or write stories, or even conjure up images out of nowhere. So there's a lot of good that can be done, but there's also some dangers.And U.S. officials -- they are sounding increasingly nervous about some of the risks to AI in the real world, including financial markets that are at the heart of this economy. I'm going to give you just a few examples. One of them is sometimes, AI can actually bias decisions. I know this is something that Melinda Gates recently told Poppy that she's worried about. Think about that in the banking scenario. I mean, imagine getting denied for a mortgage or a car loan by essentially a robot because of the color of your skin or because of your gender. Another issue here is cyber. There's a risk that some of these AI tools that banks use could actually get tricked by hackers, essentially letting the bad guys into the banks. So maybe you wouldn't be able to get access to your bank account. That's another issue. I'll leave with one more. Have you heard about hallucinations?",

Recently, in New York, a lawyer filed a lawsuit cite -- with a legal brief citing four cases that turned out to be bogus. The source for those bogus cases was ChatGPT.So you can see how if you put all of this in the banking scenario it could get a little bit tricky. So regulators are essentially putting the industry on high alert, saying that they're on the case.

In 40 days, we're going to have a pretty good answer to the question can Trump be stopped? Can he be slowed, or will he win the first two and then forget about it? If he wins Iowa and New Hampshire forget about it.About half of the party doesn't want him. And you see a lot of the -- Shanen there -- Shanen Ebersole -- she voted for Trump twice. She liked a lot of the things he did. She just can't take the drama. She can't take the toxic. She has liberal friends. She's in a really rural conservative country. She says her liberal friends are scared. And so, she's just a decent, hardworking great American. She has debates with her husband about this. A lot of families debate this. All the data tells you Trump is way ahead not just in Iowa but everywhere. But just go back to the Obama election. Hillary can't lose. Trump can't win. Biden was dead after the early primaries in 2020. Voters sometimes surprise us, which is why we keep doing these trips.",

Well, then Trump wins, right? And so, there's this almost strategic chess game in conversations with friends where you have voters who say I'm for Haley, but if I find out all five of you are for DeSantis, I'll come to you because I want one Trump. They know -- they know that if Trump gets a big win out of Iowa that he'll probably steamroll to the nomination. So there's actually some strategic chess going on in the conversations where people who want one candidate are willing to go to somebody else if they think that person would rise up and jump.

So, pink Christmas trees not something that is typical. But this year, if you are looking for a pink Christmas tree, look no further. Go online. You will see plenty of options. Now, we should say that the commercial success of Barbie is by design. Mattel, for its part, has said that it had locked in 160 partnerships. Everything from pasta to burgers, to candles you can find pink if you are into that sort of thing. Now, broadly speaking, for the holiday shopping season, the National Retail Federation says that it expects sales to be strong -- three to four percent higher than 2022. It expects Barbie to be a popular toy this Christmas season for boys and girls. But yeah, this is a wave -- this pink wave that Mattel is trying to just keep riding even into the holiday shopping season and into 2024.",
