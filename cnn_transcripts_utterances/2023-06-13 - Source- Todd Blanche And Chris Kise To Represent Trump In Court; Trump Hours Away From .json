Federal prosecutors say he hoarded classified documents at Mar-a-Lago containing some of the nation's most sensitive secrets, including details about America's nuclear program. He allegedly kept them in places like a bathroom and a shower. Behind the scenes Trump's legal team has been scrambling to find lawyers in Florida to represent him in the case. Special Counsel Jack Smith also beefing up his team. He added at least two prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Miami.We have all this covered with our team coverage throughout the course of this hour. Our panel of experts, Scott Jennings, Van Jones, Laura Coates, and John Miller are standing by. Kaitlan Collins is live outside the courthouse in Miami.

He was on the phone all day yesterday and has been making calls for about the last week trying to add a new Florida- based attorney to his team. Of course, given this is where he is facing these federal charges that you laid out there, Phil.But we are told as of now no one new has been added to the team as of this moment. Certainly, they have been trying to do so. They were hoping to do so by today but it wasn't seen as a hard deadline. So instead the two attorneys that you will see with former President Trump today when he comes here to court are Todd Blanche and Chris Kise. Todd Blanche has only been on the former president's legal team since about April. Chris Kise was actually brought on to handle the documents case in part last fall but he was pretty quickly sidelined with that whole matter. The dynamic here has changed, though, because two of the top attorneys who were handling this, Jim Trusty and John Rowley, as we know, resigned abruptly last week when they heard that Trump was looking to bring in a new Florida-based attorney. So that remains to be seen what that looks like. But we do know what the scene will be like here today. We may not actually see Trump going into the courthouse today like we did in New York. That's because of how they are structuring security and how he is going to be brought in. We do know that once he is in there, of course, he will be arraigned on these charges that he is facing, this 37-count indictment that was unveiled last week. Trump himself is at his club in Doral. He had dinner last night with several of his aides, including the two attorneys who are going to be in the courtroom with him today. He will be uttering those words, \"not guilty,\" for the second time in just a matter of months. And of course all of this comes as the big question is what happens after this. Once they have the next court date, which we do expect will be in front of that Trump-appointed judge, Judge Aileen Cannon.",

I wasn't part of any conspiracy.There is going to be a moment of truth that's going to come sooner or later where Walt Nauta has to make the decision, do I stay with Donald Trump as his codefendant in this trial, or do I get a lawyer who is not part of the Trump defense team and ask the judge to be severed because I would like to be tried separately because our interests have split here.

When they charge the case as a prosecutor, you are not charging at this level with an eye towards maybe coaxing you to come over and see the quote-unquote light. That should have already happened. One of the reasons you have him charged right now is because it has not happened.And remember, in the indictment, you have got a person called Trump employee number two, which means that there is some corroboration that says I saw what you were doing, I have told either a grand jury or otherwise, and that could be enough to avoid having to say, look, if you don't flip, I still got you on the hook.

      "sentences": "Understood. I actually want to start with your point number two here. Presidential Records Act has never mentioned in the indictment. There is nothing about personal records here. The indictment is based on 31 documents that are the purview of agency they come from agency documents. And no matter what the President says, or does once he left leaves office, this would not fall under the PRA in any way, shape, or form.So, I guess what I'm asking you about here is these specific documents that are National Security information that come from specific agencies and are not personal records of the president. Why do you feel like those were his -- not only just to take with him, but then repeatedly keep from both Nauta and prosecutors and the FBI when they asked for them repeatedly?",

      "sentences": "Well, two things you say the word repeatedly, we don't know that. Because you weren't involved in those negotiations with his attorneys, and neither do I. That's an accusation from Jack Smith, a couple of things on that piece. The President took the documents when he left the White House. According to wide reporting, his attorneys removed the boxes when they left the White House on their way to Mar- a-Lago.The President's attorneys were also in negotiations with the National Archives, back and forth about what was there and reviewing those documents. And the reason why the Presidential Records Act is important is because the President has the ability to review those records for up to five years and has broad latitude to review them. That's why I say that. The reason why they never bring up the presidential records that are in the indictment, in my view, is because if you put that in the context of what they're trying to charge him with the Espionage Act, then it just looks plain ridiculous. Last point I'll make on this, the President of the United States and even former presidents of the United States. They were the Executive Branch. So, to charge them with a violation of the Espionage Act, there is an extremely high bar to do that. And it's not clear even Jack Smith has that. Like I said, look at his track record when he's charged other political officials, and it didn't cut mustard.",

      "sentences": "All right. So, I want to take just one of the points that you made there, even if you stipulate several of them. The President was only charged related to documents that came after the search of his Mar-a-Lago residence. Everything else before that time, and there were hundreds of documents that the 15 boxes that his attorneys had turned over. Other documents that had been turned over before and after that, were not charged. There was nothing in the indictment related to those which seems to make the application give the application that had he just given these back.There would not have been an indictment, or at least not an indictment, tied to what we've seen in these 40 plus pages. Do you see -- is that something that you would agree with? Is that a stipulation that's fair? This only came, you say that it's just speculation that these were just negotiations that were occurring. No. I mean, I think it's pretty well documented both in letters from attorneys, letters from Nauta, and also in this indictment. And he wasn't charged on anything that had been voluntarily handed back even after some of those negotiations.",
