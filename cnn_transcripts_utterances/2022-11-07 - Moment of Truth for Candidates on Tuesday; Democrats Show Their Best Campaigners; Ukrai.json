Well, candidates across the United States are gearing up to make their final pitch to voters with just one day to go before the critical midterm elections. And the stakes could not be higher. On the ballot, all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. The outcome of this vote will determine who controls Congress.In the House, race ratings by inside elections shows Republicans appear to have the advantage heading into Tuesday, a party needs 218 seats to control the chamber. And with 20 seats rated as a tossup, Republicans would only need to win a few of those to take back control. In the Senate, control still appears up for grabs of the 35 seats on the ballot. Three are considered a tossup. And those key Senate races may end up determining which party will lead the Senate. They are playing out now in Nevada, Georgia, and in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. And that's where the race remains tight between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz. President Joe Biden, and former President Barack Obama traveled to the state to campaign for Fetterman while former President Donald Trump attended a rally for Oz. And CNN's Athena Jones joins us now live from Pennsylvania. So, talk to us about what's at stake here, how close this race is and what people are saying about the likely outcome here.",

We know that polls suggests that John Fetterman is still ahead of Dr. Oz in this race, but it's really going to come down to Tuesday night.Because it's a close race, and so these last several days, bringing out those big guns like former President Barack Obama, former President Donald Trump and Biden are meant to try to drive turnout here in the state of New Hampshire. Of course, this is a challenging environment -- to the state of Pennsylvania, I should say. This is a challenging environment here and across the country because the peoples worry about the economy, about rising inflation, about the impact on their pocketbooks, and concerns about the country not going in the right direction. Also, a lot of voters disapproving of the job that President Biden is doing. But when it comes to turnout, you've seen already in this state of Pennsylvania about a million, more than a million people cast their votes early. That is a pretty large number. That's about 20 percent of the total votes cast in the 2018 midterm. So, it gives you a sense of the kind of enthusiasm we're seeing already on the ground with voters wanting to have their voices heard. But it also adds another potential wrinkle because Pennsylvania is one of the states where election officials cannot begin opening and looking at those early voted -- voting ballots until election day so that with at least a million votes to count, we don't know how quickly we're going to get results here, especially if the race is close. Bottom line here, it's going to come down to turnout and you have each side hoping to urge their voters and their base to make it to the polls.",

I've never seen a midterm where we're literally fighting to maintain U.S. democracy. You have not just people running in the House and the Senate, but you also have these other races that are going on. The governor, the state attorney general, the secretary of state. And they're going to play a really important role in what happens inthe 2024 presidential and congressional election because the governors are there to ratify the election rules. You have secretaries of state that oversee voting in ballot counting. You have attorney generals that are handling all the litigation of the election results. And it's scary because you have Republican candidates and according to the Washington Post, there have been 291 Republicans that are election deniers. You have some candidates in the case of Pennsylvania and Arizona that are claiming that if they win that they're just not going to accept the election, that if they don't win, I should say, that they're just not going to accept the election result. And that if they were in power, like for example, Doug Mastriano in who's running for governor in Pennsylvania, he's basically saying that if a Democrat wins, he's just not going to accept it. And so, he's going to be there if Trump decides to run, which I know he says he's going to anyways. And if Trump loses, he will refuse to accept that result. So, this could tilt the balance of our election results, and that really goes to the heart of the integrity of our democracy.",

If you don't vote, you get fined which I'm sure would be interesting to a lot of those voters here in the United States. Why is it that so few really turn out when you look at the population it's quite shocking, isn't it?

Now they do have a chance of maybe winning the state, the Senate seat in Pennsylvania. Maybe they could overturn Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But again, these are a lot of unknowns and everything will have to line up perfectly for the Democrats on election night if they're able to maintain the Senate. But as I mentioned, some of these other races for governor are much more important in some ways, if you think about the state of democracy. And at the moment these races are incredibly tight. And so, everything would have to align for the Democrats.

They're basically describing these demonstrators as ISIS fighters and calling on the judiciary to issue speedy verdicts and real severe sentences to deter others.Now this is shocking, but not really surprising. These are hardliners who are repeating what we have been hearing from this hardliner government for weeks now dismissing the protest movement as riots, as some sort of a foreign plot to destabilize the Islamic republic. But Rosemary, when you hear these sort of statements, the concern is that this could be an indication of what might be coming soon. There are more than 14,000 men, women, and children who have been arrested since the protest began in September. More than a thousand have been indicted in Iran alone. Many of them facing charges that carry the death penalty in the Islamic republic. So human rights groups are very concerned that we soon will be seeing authorities handing these protesters death sentences in what they're describing as this sham and show trials to try and contain this national uprising that nearly two months into it the authorities haven't been able to suppress so far. But despite the violence, Rosemary, despite the threat of the death penalty, we're still seeing protests continuing on Sunday across different parts of the country. According to the Kurdish human rights group Hengaw, protesters in the Kurdish city of Marivan were met with gunfire. Security Forces opening fire, injuring 35 people according to Hengaw. They say that these protests erupted after the death of a Kurdish Iranian woman, Nasrin Ghaderi, who they say was killed by the security forces. They say she was hit on the head with batons in Tehran and that she died on Saturday. And this caused these protests in her hometown. Now, authorities are saying that she died of poisoning and that she had a preexisting medical condition. Her father telling state media that she died of the flu. But according to the human rights group Hengaw, they say that she was active in the protest movement and that she was active on social media as well. Unfortunately, this is something that we have been seeing time and time again over the past couple of months where authorities are blaming the deaths of female protestors, young protestors on natural causes, on suicides. And according to human rights groups and the United Nations, Rosemary, many of the families of the victims are under immense pressure. They're constantly harassed by authorities to hide the truth.",

Ninety percent chance of warming has what it takes to become Tropical Storm Nicole, if it forms in the next couple of days here, and it will begin to kind of approach portions of the Bahamas and eventually parts of Florida as we go in from Tuesday into Wednesday.So, we pause for you early Tuesday morning, election day. Notice, the system sits about 500 miles away from the east coast of Florida. Certainly, some clouds, maybe a few showers could push in towards the eastern most regions of Florida. But we think really later on Tuesday night, maybe early Wednesday morning, we'd begin to see more cloud cover, and then by possibly Wednesday night into Thursday the system works its way on shore here. Possibly again, a tropical depression or a tropical storm at this point does not look like to be a major weather maker, but going to bring in quite a bit of rainfall towards the latter portion of the week around the eastern part of Florida and possibly portions of northern Florida, eastern Georgia as well. Now when it comes to this afternoon's forecast a few scattered showers across portions of the southern United States, while areas of the Northeast also could see a few pockets of showers. But generally speaking, for election day it looks very quiet across a large area of the eastern U.S. The temps are going to be running above average for a lot of these region. Well into the 70s across the south, while climbing up into the 70s on Monday in Philadelphia, but dropping sharply down to 58 degrees. Again, sunny skies don't see much in the way of wet weather across the eastern United States. The Western us, a different story here. Multiple systems working their way across portions of Nevada, California certainly as well. You'll notice the wet weather translates to high elevation, snow showers, some very heavy rainfall possible even into Southern California as we go in from Monday into Tuesday. And parts of Nevada will tap into some moisture as well. So, when you look at some of these studies that have actually analyzed how weather plays a role when it comes to election day, we do know Republicans typically tend to turn out in higher numbers than Democrats when it comes to wet weather days. That has historically been the case. And voter participation, Rosemary, typically does drop about a percent for every inch of rainfall. Now, parts of California maybe tap into about an inch or so, maybe two inches at the most. So maybe a negligible difference, but sometimes in these close races even a small nun makes a big difference.",

And officials yesterday initially claimed that they were in contact with the pilots. But at night when they finally released the names of the 19 people who were killed, the pilot, the captain, and the first officer were among the dead. It's a really tragic situation. This aircraft had only been in operation for about 12 years. This airline, Precision Air, which flies regionally East Africa has a decent safety record. So, this is one of the worst accidents in its entire history. And now an investigation begins as to how something this tragic could have happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

All 435 House seats, 35 Senate seats and 36 governor's officers are up the grabs.Stay with CNN as we track the latest developments and results on election. An Israeli election rule has given Benjamin Netanyahu an even bigger majority in the Knesset than his popular vote. Netanyahu won his most recent bid to take back the office of prime minister from Yair Lapid in an election that saw Israel's highest voter turnout since 2015. CNN's Hadas Gold joins me now live from Jerusalem with more. Good to see you, Hadas. So, what are you learning about this threshold rule that has given Netanyahu a boost? [03:54:53]",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Rosemary, Netanyahu will have 64 seats, him and his -- him and his block will have 64 seats in the next parliament. But when you look into the math, when you look into the numbers, when you look at the popular vote, he actually should not have had that big of a majority or even possibly a majority in the parliament at all.Some pollsters say that he should have had about 60 seats if they just do a popular vote, but that's not how it works in Israel. Israeli voters vote for a specific party and then the party has a list of candidates who take up the seats. But there is a rule that the party has to pass a threshold of the popular vote of 3.25 percent before they can be considered for the parliament. Otherwise, Rosemary, those votes just get thrown away. And we look at the parties that didn't pass a threshold, that was some almost 300,000 votes that essentially got thrown away. And so therefore they were not counted. They most of those votes were on the sort of anti-Netanyahu block. So, when you look at the actual numbers, less than 40,000 votes separate the pro-Benjamin Netanyahu block and the anti-Benjamin Netanyahu block. So, Benjamin Netanyahu would've gotten about 49.6. percent of the popular vote and the anti-Netanyahu block would've had 48.9 percent. So, it's really interesting when you look at just how, you know, these sort of electoral rules work. And it's very similar in the United States with the electoral college that sometimes the popular vote, but then what actually happens doesn't end up being the same thing. Rosemary?",
