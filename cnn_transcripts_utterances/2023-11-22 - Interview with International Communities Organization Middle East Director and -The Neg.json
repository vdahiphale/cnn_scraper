Israel and Hamas agree on a four-day truce to exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Veteran negotiator Gershon Baskin joins me next. Fairness and justice in war. I speak to founding international criminal court prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, and I get his take on Argentina's controversial president-elect. Then, stamped from the beginning, Michel Martin asked director Roger Ross Williams about his new documentary exploring the roots of racism in America. And finally, the music and life lessons of the legendary Yusuf/Cat Stevens. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, now that both Israel and Hamas signed off on a hostage deal, we are learning more about the details. An Israeli official tells us the fighting is set to pause beginning 10:00 a.m. local time, 3:00 in the morning New York time Thursday. Now, if all goes according to plan, at least 50 hostages held by Hamas will be released in exchange for some 150 Palestinian prisoners currently in Israeli jails. Much needed humanitarian relief will come to Gaza. The pause could potentially last longer, with an extra day added for each additional 10 Israeli captives released. The hostages' families face an excruciating week, not knowing whether their loved ones will be among those released. Here's Abby On, who has three family members held by Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Gershon Baskin is a veteran hostagenegotiator familiar with all of the players in this breakthrough deal. He played a prominent role in the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. And he joins us now. Gershon, welcome to the program. You've become a regular now, it gives us a sense of the crisis at hand. But, breakthrough, finally. First, your reaction to this deal. GERSHON BASKIN, MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATION AND AUTHOR, \"THE NEGOTIATOR: FREEING SCHALIT FROM HAMAS\": Well, this was the first good day we've had since the beginning of the war on October 7th. And all things considered, I think it's a pretty good deal. It's one that I proposed on the second or third day of the war and passed it over to the Israelis and Hamas people, the Qatari and the Egyptians. I talked about a bigger deal, in fact, of all the women and all the children in exchange for the women and minor prisoners in Israel. But this is a good start. 50 is a good number to begin with. It'll happen in four days. And as you said, it can be extended to five days or six or seven or eight. I think our goal should be to get all the civilian hostages out of Gaza. The people of Palestine and Gaza are getting the deserved break from the bombing that they need so badly. Humanitarian aid will be entering at a much bigger quantity. I think even the Israeli soldiers can use a break. They've been more than a month in the field and not the best conditions that anyone would want to be in. So, all around, even though there are risks and there are dangers, a pause in the fighting makes the Israeli soldiers exposed to danger and it gives Hamas time to rearm and regroup and replan their strategy for the next phase of the war. But the most important thing is bringing these children and women home to their families.",

They have supported Hamas for years. They host their leadership. They have funded Hamas with more than a billion dollars over the years. Their Al Jazeera Arabic speaking station, as opposed to Al Jazeera English is a mouthpiece for the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. So, they have their own way of working. They have played roles in negotiations between the U.S. And Taliban. They played roles in negotiating with Iraqi insurgents at the time. It's a very bizarre country with a very bizarre set of interest. No one can really put that much pressure on them. The United States, it's largest military base in the region is in Qatar, and then Europeans desperately need the Qatari gas to keep warm in the winter. So, no one is going to put Qatar on the list of nations that support terrorism, which would cut their ability to invest in the world, which they're doing. And they want to appear in the favor of the West because they are busy buying companies on NASDAQ and in Silicon Valley and properties in London and Qatar Airlines flies all over the world.",

There willbe a six-hour pause in Israeli flying drones over the Gaza Strip in order to enable Hamas to organize the hostages. I assume that what they will do is use several different convoys of identical vehicles leaving from different locations in order to prevent the Israelis from actually identifying where the hostages are coming from. They will arrive to the border crossing with Egypt and the International Red Cross will receive them and check them, verify their identities, and turn them over to the Egyptian side of the border, where they'll be transported to the Israeli side. On the Israeli side, they'll be taken immediately to hospital in Israel for medical checkups. I assume that their families will be waiting for them at the hospitals where they will be taken. Shortly after they're all checked medically and if they don't need medical treatment, they will certainly need psychological treatment. But I imagine that the Israeli intelligence people will want to talk to them as much as possible, as gently as possible, in order to gather from them intelligence information about what they went through over the last 47 days.",

I think it's very unlikely to happen, but I would be pleasantly surprised if it does. I think this was actually an announcement that came out of Washington and not from Qatar from someplace else. The Red Cross should have access. According to international law, they should. They are not a party to the conflict. This is what they do. They will certainly be on the ground in Gaza to receive the hostages. They will also verify the identity of the Palestinian prisoners that are released by Israel and will supervise that release as well because they are a trusted third-party. But there's a limit to what they're allowed to do by Hamas, and this has been the case with Hamas since its formation. They never gave access to the Red Cross before a deal was made.",

And when they go into a war zone, they're taking great personal risk to themselves. I know how much they wanted to visit the hostages, how much they want to fulfill their mandate. It's not a matter of pressure. I don't think Hamas could be pressured into it unless the United States was willing to use the ultimate a weapon against the ultimate stick against Qatar, and that's the threat to put them on a terrorist state that supports terrorist list, but the United States is not willing to do that.

But there's -- more peace is not also just the physical, you know, peace. I mean, there's a saying, Jesus, I think we should all know it, you know, that man does not live by bread alone, you know. So, we are spirits. And for that reason, also, our spirits need some kind of peace. We need to find out. We need to feel comfortable with who we are and comfortable with their neighbors too. I mean, there's so much that can create peace but seems to be working against it.",

And it was fantastic because you know, for me, The Beatles personified, you know, the way forward, the way in which we could define a new world, even if it was only through music, lyrics, for that time. And -- but we believed in it. But there was more to George than just, you know, the songs. And, you know, he was actually looking and he helped us to turn east. So, therefore, he was really an inspired person for me. And especially at the time when I was sick and I was I was in bed with tuberculosis. I had my first exposure to fame and everything that came along with it was, again, part of the nightmares, which I was referring to you before. And then, if I needed something, while I'm lying on the bed, you know, where am I going to end up when all this disappears? You know, when I dropped off the planet, and that's where George was already, you know, experimenting, or, you know, seeking ways to find the light through the maharishi and all that. But that was inspiring for me.",

It was a brave thing to do, and against all establishment rules. I'm happy to sing one of his songs, especially as it represents the return of light and hope to a seriously dark and broken world. We'll get to the song that you recorded in honor of his 80th birthday.

And now, I felt, well, that's one -- that's the one song that I really think personifies, you know, the optimism that we need right now. Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter. Little darling, it feels like it since it's been here. Here comes the sun. Here comes the sun and I say, it's all right. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
