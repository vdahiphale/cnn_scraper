Plus, there are dire humanitarian warnings, coming out of Gaza, tonight, as Israel is vowing to continue blocking food and water, until the hostages are freed, by Hamas. And with aid to Israel, on the line, House Republicans have devolved into complete chaos, tonight. The Republican nominee for Speaker has just dropped out of the race. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, an unrelenting series, of Israeli fire, is raining down, on Gaza. Explosions could be heard, until just a short time ago. We're live, in a moment, with Anderson Cooper, on the ground, in Tel Aviv. As there's also an ongoing buildup of IDF troops, and tanks, at the border, and a resounding message from the United States, which was personally delivered, by Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, today, who forcefully said, and I'm quoting him now, \"Israel will never be alone.\" Standing alongside him, you could see him there, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who called this a, quote, time to stand united against evil, and to show the world what that evil looks like. Netanyahu released three graphic images, today. They are three horrific pictures of babies, who were slaughtered, by Hamas. Secretary Blinken, whose stepfather, I should note, survived the Holocaust, struggled to even talk about those images, after he saw them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: A baby, an infant riddled with bullets. Soldiers beheaded. Young people burned alive in their cars. There is revulsion, disgust and a determination, a determination not to allow this to go forward. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel has vowed no power, no water, no fuel, no other supplies, until the hostages are returned. I want to get straight to CNN's Anderson Cooper, who has been live, in Tel Aviv, all day.

But he says things, this one is different, this has to change, they have to change the paradigm, on the ground, in Gaza, that they cannot allow Hamas any longer, to operate and to train up again, and to do this again, in the future. Whether that's going to be possible or not, remains to be seen.

Obviously, can we just start with you walking me through, what happened, on Saturday? I know, obviously, it was a Jewish holiday. How did it go from slowly -- how did you go from slowly figuring out what was going on, and then realizing that Israel was under attack? SGT. MAJOR DAVID CITRON, IDF RESERVIST SINCE 2012: Sure. Thank you so much for having me. So, like you said, it was Saturday. It was a Jewish holiday. I'm an observant Jew. So, we don't really touch our phones or electronics. Started off the morning, with a rocket siren, which was abnormal, for the location that I was in, with my family. First one goes off. You think it's just a coincidence. Then the second, and then third, you realize that something's wrong. So, the first instinct is to go and check your phone. So, you turn on your phone. And your second instinct is to touch base with your unit commander, and reserves, just to understand what's going on. The first message I received from my commander was \"Nothing's happening for now. There's an incident in the south. Stay put.\" And then that quickly escalated, within an hour, to \"Get to base as soon as you can.\" So, the escalation, at least from our perspective, and being out of the loop, to being completely in the loop and understanding what's going on, was relatively quickly.",

But what we've seen here, on the ground, what I personally witnessed, what my friends have witnessed, just images that are, ISIS. We're dealing with ISIS. We're dealing with full-blown terrorism. We're dealing with modern-day Nazism. I've lost friends, friends of mine, who lost friends. Friends of mine have lost brothers and sisters, whether they were in active duty, or they just went to help, knowing what was going on.

There are majority of House Republicans, majority of House Democrats, majority of Senate Republicans, they want to support Ukraine. They want to stand by our ally, Israel.

Because, although we are impartial, we're humanitarians, with principles of neutrality, guiding us, we do focus on areas, where there are gaps.Gaza has been what we would call a humanitarian chronic crisis, for so many years. And that's why we were there. And now, it's a full-blown catastrophe. What we're hearing from the hospitals that we support, is that it's very difficult, for patients, to even reach the hospital. Everyone's terrified just to move. It's impossible for staff, sometimes, medical staff, to be able to go to work. And if they do go to work, they don't know if they'll ever see their families again, at night. For the medical supplies, we moved around three weeks' worth of supplies, to Al-Nuseirat (ph) hospital, which use them up, in three days, because of the influx of injured people. And so, the situation, in the hospitals, is absolutely overwhelming. And this looming crisis, as a result of the siege, of not being able to, bring in more supplies, bring in more staff, bring in the fuel, for the generators, bring in water? I do agree with the analysis, and the commentary, from the International Committee of the Red Cross that the hospitals will become morgues.",

And because of all of those signs, a series of high-level consultations took place, some of it, on Friday night, several hours, four or five hours, before the Hamas attack.

I mean, the IDF Chief of Staff, General Halevi was on the consultation, the head of the Military intelligence, the head of the Southern Command, the head of the Shin Bet security agency. So, all the top security officials, in the country, were on those conference calls. And the dilemma was whether this is a real preparation, for an attack, or an exercise.

Because, you had the reporting, when Trump accused Netanyahu, of disloyalty, he was mad that he had acknowledged President Biden's win, and he's been criticizing him publicly. He's praising Hezbollah as very smart. He's been going off and criticizing, really, the missed intelligence, and that Netanyahu was caught off-guard, and saying that he was ill-prepared, to handle this, essentially. RAVID: Yes, I think that if anybody was still wondering whether Donald Trump cooled down, from the fact that Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden, after he won the elections? He had no other choice. He need to congratulate the new president. So, Donald Trump did not cool down. Not only did he not cool down, it seems that he's even more angry at Netanyahu, and it makes him say, really weird stuff.

Ahead of possible protests, the New York Police Department is stepping up its security, at synagogues, and other sensitive targets, across New York. But the Governor said, tonight, there is no credible threat. That is just a precaution. Joining me now, is CNN's John Miller, our Chief Law Enforcement Analyst and the former Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence &amp; Counterterrorism for the NYPD. I mean, it is very important that DHS officials have said repeatedly, there is no credible threat. But what are they doing, to make sure that they're prepared for it, in case there is one? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, FORMER NYPD DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF INTELLIGENCE &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM: So, what they understand is even if there's no specific, credible threat, that's on the radar, there might be one that's not on the radar. Their main concern is the propaganda, the chat rooms, the dark corners of the internet, and that lone wolf who decides that they are going to rewrite their life story, by taking some kind of stand, and committing a violent act. So, that means things you'll see. You'll see the Hercules teams, the heavily-armed teams with the explosive-detection dogs, and rifles, at key Jewish locations. You'll see the Stryker teams, moving from location to location. There's a lot of fluidity and unpredictability to it. So, if you're looking at a target, you don't know, when it's going to be secured heavily, or not, to keep people off balance. And the other thing is the Intelligence Division, their human sources, beyond their surveillance of known gathering places, on the internet, of violent extremists. And they have help. They have help from the Community Security Initiative. They have help from the ADL, and others, who do the same thing. So, there's a lot of conversations going on. But the key is?",
