And so, we can expect, for example, that, regardless of what happens in November, Trump will again claim that he won, and people will follow along with that. That's absolutely predictable, given the framework that we're in. Another thing which I'm afraid is also very likely is violence. When you live inside a big lie, ultimately, the only way you can \"prove,\" quote, unquote, that it's true is by carrying out an act of violence. And the third thing one can be sure about is that, given that this is a leader cult which has been -- which has been instigated by a person who regards himself not really as a democratically elected representative, but as a leader of a people, it will -- it will seem clear to a lot of people that he should be in charge, regardless of the legal or the electoral niceties, as they will see it. These are all predictable things. Another thing which is predictable is that, as you say, fascism is a thing in the world, which means that Mr. Trump has allies who like his form of government around the world. So, it's pretty predictable that the first half of November, people who support Trump, for example, the regime in Russia, will try to take advantage of whatever he's doing to make matters worse in the U.S.",

That's where it's focusing most of its operations at the moment. Hamas has been reconstituting itself, according to the Israeli military, and rebuilding its capabilities and infrastructure there. So that campaign will continue. But I think we have to look at the bigger picture. And the bigger picture here is that Israel's accomplishments on the ground in degrading Hamas's capabilities are significant; in taking out their leadership, are significant. The question is, how do you translate that from military accomplishments into what you need to end this war, which is going to have to be a political resolution that also includes a return of at least those hostages who are alive out of the 101 who are still being held by Hamas. And it ends the war, which is now entering its, what, 14th month almost since it began on October 7th, so -- of last year. So, Israel needs to try to find a way to get out of this.

You need to have a process at the end that is going to end that war. We've seen it countless times, tragically, throughout all the wars throughout history. You need to have something that is going to be that -- that end game. And Israel's not articulating it, I think, mostly out of political consideration. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, understands that he needs this, but his hands are a bit tied, because his coalition is made up of at least two parties on the farther right, who are opposed to any resolution that would see anyone from the Palestinian Authority, any other force that is not Israel, retaking the reins over Gaza, now that Hamas has been removed, essentially, from power, definitely with the elimination of Yahya Sinwar, the leader who was killed. So, there's an opportunity here, but Israel needs to help outline and articulate what that's going to be. Of course, it needs to work with its allies, whether it's the Saudis, or the Emiratis, or the Egyptians. And of course, the Americans. And Tony Blinken's visit here, the secretary of state, just a couple of days ago, is meant to try to move that forward. That's why he went from Israel to Riyadh. That's why he's now meeting with leaders and the foreign ministers of Jordan and the emirates. And he went to Doha. All of this is aimed at trying to get that process moving forward, but Israel has to realize that it has to play a role here. And unfortunately, it's not doing that at the moment.",

The suit comes a day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a food safety alert. The plaintiff's lawyers say the man ate at a McDonald's before experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms and tested positive for E. coli a few days later. Regulators say the onions or beef on the sandwich are likely the culprits. McDonald's has taken Quarter Pounders off the menu in about a fifth of its U.S. stores. Some other major fast-food chains have proactively removed fresh onions from their menus. That's in response to the McDonald's outbreak. Burger King, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC say they've pulled fresh onions from select restaurants, quote, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" Also, the distributor, U.S. Foods, has recalled four onion products due to potential contamination. And a supplier to McDonald's and Burger King followed suit, despite finding no traces of E. coli in tests of its onions.
