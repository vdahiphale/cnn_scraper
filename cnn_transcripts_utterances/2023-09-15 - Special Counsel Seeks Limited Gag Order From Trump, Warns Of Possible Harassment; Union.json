      "sentences": "Well, good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates. Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.We've got some breaking news, everyone. Jack Smith, the special counsel, wants a gag order on one, Donald Trump. He's asking the judge, Tanya Chutkan, for what he's calling a narrowly-tailored order, stop the former president from making statements that could, well, intimidate witnesses or jurors or even lead to harassment. And how do you think Trump is responding? I'll give you a cliffhanger and tell you about that in just a moment. Plus, it's day one of the autoworkers' strike, the first in history against all of the big three automakers, and the union is now warning that more workers will go on strike if they don't get the better pay and the benefits they're demanding. They're walking the picket lines as we speak right now, but in a matter of hours, they will be back at the bargaining table. Meanwhile, the companies are fighting back. Ford laying off 600 workers. Tonight, I'll talk to one striking worker. She is a mom of seven, who works up to six days per week and is barely making enough to survive, she says. I want to begin with the latest in the filing from the new special counsel, of course, Jack Smith. Joining me tonight, Washington correspondent for the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\" Tia Mitchell, associate professor of law at Georgetown University, Vida Johnson, and former associate White House counsel to President George W. Bush, Jamil Jaffer. So glad that you're all here right now. First of all, perhaps it's no surprise there's been a request for a gag order of Donald Trump. We saw this coming in many respects, right? The real issue here, though, is how do you have a gag order in place in a way that actually makes sense for somebody who needs to still be vocal? I mean, he's running for office, number one. He's also, Vida, a criminal defendant who, if he were in a courtroom, could attack through counsel the credibility of those who are accusing him of something. How do you balance that? VIDA JOHNSON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Well, that's a great question. You know, most people who are accused of crimes who are at liberty have some limitations placed on their conduct. Most of my clients might have some, you know, reporting conditions, and he hasn't had very many conditions imposed on him. And he was warned and his lawyers were warned not to say anything that could affect the integrity of the case. Unfortunately, some of the things he has been saying on social media seems to have gotten under Jack Smith's skin. And so, I think that the judge will admonish him --",

What do you say to that argument? Because, obviously, he is trying to put out there, they're trying to shut me down, it's a First Amendment issue.JAMIL JAFFER, FORMER ASSOCIATE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO GEORGE W. BUSH, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTE AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY:  Yeah. Well, look, I mean, Vida is exactly right, that most defendants, this isn't a big deal, this is what's supposed to be done in a case to ensure that it's handled properly. The problem is, as Vida points out, he's running for office. And one of the key issues at issue in this campaign is, did he win the last election? Was he trying to influence the vice president to engage in illegal activity? Did he cause an insurrection? Those are all issues at stake in this election. And so, he's not got a crazy point, but he can't intimidate witnesses because he's a presidential candidate. Doesn't give him the right to intimidate witnesses in an ongoing proceeding against him. So, the judge is going to have to find someone to restrict him. The problem is, what's going to happen when he violates the order, which he's going to? Is she really going to impose sanctions? Is she going to put him in jail? I mean, that seems highly unlikely, and all that does play right into his hands politically.",

This is just a couple things. And I should mention a couple things just this last month, by the way.One of the difficulties, Vida, I'm sure you're seeing is all the different types of indictments facing this president. One is, of course, in Manhattan. One is, of course, in Georgia. You've got Mar-a- Lago. You've got Washington, D.C. So, him making a statement, you're going to have to be, as a prosecutor, trying to figure out, are you talking about me? It's like a Robert De Niro tactic. Are you talking about me? I don't seem well standing here. There are actually three other indictments happening right now. How, as defense counsel, do you help your client? That was a damn good impersonation. You're laughing but, I mean, I just -- it was DeNiro on a Friday night. Thank you very much.

So, there are tons of things that he's just not allowed to do, and he can face criminal prosecution.I think one thing that's really interesting here, too, is that his words have already led to this particular judge getting threats and racial slurs. We've seen that there was already a person arrested for doing those things. And we can just look at January 6th and see that his words really have a lot of consequences.

You also are a mother of seven and you are working 60 hours a week as a supplemental worker. Many people who are across the country looking at what's happening and within the UAW, how are you going to make ends meet if this strike does not end soon? LETICIA LOPEZ, MEMBER, UNITED AUTO WORKERS:  Thank you, Laura, for having me. Unfortunately, for me, from day one, I came in as a supplementary employee, and there was no guarantee whether I was going to work six days or three days a week. So, surviving on anywhere from 200 to 300 to 500 has kind of been my way of life for the last four years. For me, knowing that I'm going to have a steady paycheck of 500 a week, is more stability for me of strike pay than the hours that I am guaranteed in the facility. Some weeks, I'm guaranteed 60 hours, and some weeks, I'm guaranteed none. So, it seems like 500 a week through strike pay is scary, but as a supplemented employee, that's stability.",

They forced us to work in the pandemic because they chose to make us essential. We went in. Supplemental employees, we have very little rights. We were only meant to be used for a certain amount of time, and then we end up being forced full time. We were forced to be in there during the pandemic with the possibility of killing our family. We didn't get a thank you. We do not receive profit sharing. We do not receive the full benefits.

We know all the reasons why. But the process of this investigation is one that you are intimately aware of. I mean, it wasn't even until two years after the bombing that the FBI even identified four Klansmen as primary suspects. And you helped successfully prosecute two of them, not two years after this attack, but in 2001 and in 2002. And I am wondering for so many people out there, what was it like to prosecute a case 40 years after the crime, especially one where it involves the terror of the Klan?",

And we built on what was done in the 1960s. You know, the FBI took a lot of grief in the 1960s because they didn't solve this case. But it was not one that could easily be solved, and the Klan really clammed up and they didn't talk, and evidence was hard to come by.In 1977, the first of the cases was tried. Former Attorney General Bill Baxley, who was also in the audience today, tried the first case and was successful doing that. So, we built on the 1960s investigation, the 1970s investigation that Baxley did, and then we did our own to try to fill in the gaps. And fortunately, times changed, attitudes changed, people changed, and the evidence just fit together so much easier and so much better. But it was still a race against time. Witnesses were gone. Witnesses were dying. Witnesses were old and infirm. And we really had to work hard to pull these pieces together. And interestingly, what would certainly appreciate, we found an old tape recording, a tape recording of one of the defendants talking to his wife and another person, in which he admitted being part of the group that was planning the bomb and making the bomb. And it was a stunning discovery for us. Took a lot of interesting legal work to get it into evidence, but it was upheld by the courts of appeal. And that was a real key, I think, to this. But the real basis for this prosecution was the dedication of the team, who just never gave up, and the families, who just patiently waited for the wills of justice to turn.",
