The suspect in the case, 19-year-old Keith Moses had a lengthy juvenile record -- given it's a juvenile record, of course, it was sealed -- as well as one arrest as an adult. Now, the governor is pointing the finger at the state attorney, Monique Worrell, for not prosecuting that specific case.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): You have to hold people accountable. This idea, and I know the district attorney, state attorney in Orlando thinks that you don't prosecute people and that's the way that you somehow have better communities, that does not work.

Good to have you with us this morning.I know you did speak with the families prior to them speaking out with some members of the media. There's a lot of back and forth about what could and could not have been done, so I'm hoping you can also help us clear up just a few questions that we have. So, specifically, when it deals with the record of the suspect, juvenile issues are one thing in terms of what's been sealed, but there was this 2021 arrest, a marijuana arrest. He was an adult. You were in office. Those were misdemeanor charges that were dropped because, as I understand it, there wasn't enough there to test to determine whether or not it was actually marijuana. But there was a gun that was also a part of that stop and \"The Tampa Bay Times\" is reporting the sheriff's office didn't test that gun for DNA. A lot of questions about why, a lot of questions about what that would have changed had it been tested if his DNA was on it. Do you know - do you have an answer at this point from the sheriff's office as to why that gun was not tested for DNA?",

And prosecuting cases is a very complex matter, and there's a lot of assessment that goes into that.In that assessment is, how can we define whether or not an individual is a future danger to the community. And there's really no way for us to tell that. We don't have any tools, we don't receive mental health assessments. We are prosecutors. We're lawyers. We don't have any way of truly assessing future dangerousness but by looking at an individual's record. Now, it's come out that this individual was previously arrested for a robbery with a firearm as a juvenile, when he was just 14 years old. Now, I'll tell you that I can't discuss the disposition of the case. I can't tell you how that case was resolved because Florida statutes prohibits me from discussing the resolution of a juvenile case. But I will tell you that I did review that case in detail and there was nothing wrong done by my office. I stand behind the decision that was made, even though it was made prior to me taking office.",

So for someone sitting in Tallahassee to politicize a tragedy that my community is still mourning is absolutely shameful. But one of the things that I've been working on is changing the juvenile justice system so that we can have more accountability, longer time periods that individuals are kept in the juvenile justice system. And something like that could help preventing another tragedy like this. And that is within the governor's power to do and to effect. And he needs to do that instead of trying to gain a political moment by coming after me for something that I did nothing wrong in. If he really wants to see that this never happens again, then he should make every effort to make the changes that I've been recommending since I've become state attorney.",

Donald Trump's got two big problems with his executive privilege argument here. The first one is that this is a criminal grand jury subpoena and courts tend to honor and uphold grand jury subpoenas, not automatically, but typically a grand jury subpoena will overcome a claim of executive privilege.The second problem is, Donald Trump is not president anymore. He's a former president. Again, it's possible that a former president can bring an executive privilege claim, but it's much more difficult than if he were still the sitting president. So, I think this one's a long shot. But, as you said, Jim, this is a pattern for Donald Trump.",

Or do we just move ahead without Mike Pence's testimony?But here's the risk, you need to know what Mike Pence says if you're a prosecutor. A, it could be helpful to your case. There were certain one-on-one conversations you would want to know about. B, it might be harmful. What if Mike Pence went in there and said things that were all favorable to Donald Trump. What if Mike Pence said, he never pressured me. He told me to just do the right thing. You need to do know that either way as a prosecutor.",

I'm supposed to quit my job and then she brings it up, I shut it down. I made some jokes. He said also that his joke last year at the Oscars about Jada's haircut was not so much about upsetting them, it was a lightweight joke, but Will's response was more about their relationship. And he went into the fact that, as we know, the Smith's made a whole public display of the fact that Jada Pinkett Smith said she had an entanglement with one of her son's friends and then Will Smith was on the show to talk about it.
