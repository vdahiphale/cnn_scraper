He is now back in U.S. custody.North Korea announced just this morning that it was expelling, those are the words they used, Army Private Travis King. And this whole thing, all the circumstances around this are quite extraordinary. Starting with, the U.S. government believes that he intentionally crossed into North Korea during a civilian tour of the demilitarized zone. CNN's Alex Marquardt is at the State Department.

      "sentences": "Yes. We're starting to see a fuller picture of what happened not just today but in the course of the past few months. Kate, you're absolutely right. The U.S. has said that Private Travis King had crossed into North Korea willfully and without authorization back in July.Everything we had heard until just moments ago had come from the North Korean side and specifically from North Korean state T.V. We are now getting a little bit more from the Biden administration, a U.S. official saying that Private King is now in U.S. custody. That means that he would then be on his way home after more than two months, just shy of two and a half months of being in custody in North Korea. And, Kate, just moments ago, I spoke with the Swedish embassy here in Washington, D.C., that confirmed that Sweden did indeed play a role in the release of Private King. Now, that's important because the U.S., of course, does not have an embassy in Pyongyang. Sweden represents U.S. interest there, as what's called a protected power. So, there was some speculation about the role of Sweden. It is not clear at this point what exactly that role was in terms of negotiations to get Private King out. We're also trying to figure out how it is that Private King got out of the country. Did he cross back over the DMZ that he had crossed over back on July 18th earlier this year into South Korea? Did China play a role? There's a very good chance that China did indeed play a role. Of course, the U.S. has an embassy in Beijing that would monitor and be on top of all kinds of North Korean issues, North Korean and China being, of course, very close allies. So, these are the kinds of details that we are trying to figure out, Kate. What is clear is that this is still an extraordinary story that we will want to be hearing from Private King directly about why he crossed into North Korea back in July, why he fled the airport when he was being sent home, and what drove him to go to that border. And, of course, his family is going to be very happy to see him, Kate, but there are going to be a lot of questions about the condition that he's in. So, there is good news for the King family today that their son, their grandson, is on his way home, but, certainly, he's going to be facing a lot of questions in the coming days and months, Kate.",

The Senate has not done one thing when it comes to appropriation. Is that different than we have in the past? No. Normally, the Senate doesn't even bring them up in committee. So, the Senate has done nothing.The House is working on passing 73 percent of all the appropriation bills of the job we're supposed to do by Thursday. We're bringing up on Friday ability to fund the government, but at the same time secure our border. So, yes, we're doing our job. So, what does the president have to do with that? If he wants to sit and hide in the White House and put government into a shutdown, that's on him, but that's the wrong thing to do. I like to see anything out there. If it's a challenge, I want to solve the problem. If you look at when you're sitting with the Senate doing too, we have the FAA to deal with. That goes away on September 30th. Has the Senate passed an FAA bill? No, they have not. When we look at a challenge on the border, have they passed any bill themselves? They're a different body on something to deal with the border, even though the leader from the Senate comes from New York, and his governor and mayor are crying for something to be done. No, they've done nothing on it because had they passed the bill, the House has passed the bill, we could go to conference and solve that. So, why am I asked the president to sit down? Because the Senate has not done their job, the Senate has not taken up the House work. So, no, the president should step in and do something about it. Otherwise, government will shut down just like we're having strikes in Michigan, just like we had a five-month strike in California, just like we have embassies that are having to be evacuated around the world. That's a lack of leadership. So, show some leadership. This is your policies. This wasn't a policy that was passed from the House and Senate that opened up this border. It was simply your decision and you could do something to change it. It would keep government open while we finish the job and hopefully the Senate can get around to an appropriation bill.

I mean, whether or not he is convicted of anything, we do know that since the last debate, one thing happened actually right directly the next day, which was Donald Trump had a mug shot taken, the mug shot. That has obviously the mug shot seen around the world, the mug shot that served as a wonderful fundraising effort, though, for Donald Trump himself. Ron DeSantis, Terry, his campaign manager put out a memo to donors and supporters ahead of this debate, saying a lot, and this included. DeSantis is the only candidate that can beat both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and we are the only campaign built for the long haul in terms of resources and organization.Can he make headway in this debate, or do you think, to use an overused phrase, the cake is baked when it comes to DeSantis?",

He's the one who has the best shot right now, the best organization. They've still got more money, and for some reason, haven't spent it, which is a little bit shocking. They've got the best shot to actually give Trump a run for his money in this nomination process. It's not overly likely, but it's a real shot.And the best position he's in is that there's no expectations now. I mean, he's managed, through no fault of his own, or maybe through fault of his own, managed to lower his expectations so much. As long as he doesn't fall off the debate stage, it's a win for him tonight. But he needs to do more than that. He needs to go out there and actually show that he's a leader who could take on Trump.",

I forgot about him. And this is, I think, the story of the DeSantis campaign.And I've said for a while he seems a bit like a Manchurian candidate. Like the donor class loved him. They really propped him up to be the savior of the Republican Party and he hasn't really delivered. And I'm not sure that there's a lot of there there. He's made the culture wars his entire personality. He's failed at some of that, taking on Disney and losing. And it really hasn't solidified a lane for him. And I think, you know, even Kellyanne Conway was saying like the culture wars are no competition for like a sound economic plan. And he's really not talking enough about real stuff. So, I think he could probably get elected president of Florida but I don't think he could -- I don't think he's going to show Donald Trump a run for his money.",

That's grown since June. On the question of Trump was a good president But it's time to consider other leaders, 19 percent, that's down from June. Republican Party needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach, down since June as well. I'm trying if there -- if these candidates are, I don't know, fighting over 19 to 22 percent of Republican voters, what does that look like?
