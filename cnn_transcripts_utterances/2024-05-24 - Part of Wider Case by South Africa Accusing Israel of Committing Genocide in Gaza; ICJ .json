It is 3 pm in the Netherlands. It's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. For a -- good afternoon to you from here at least this is \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next hour the Head of Hezbollah will deliver a speech in tribute to the late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi after he was buried in his hometown on Thursday. And CNN is following news of a devastating landslide in a remote village in Papua New Guinea, where more than 100 people are feared dead. And it is 9 am in New York and the stock market there we'll open in about 30 minutes from now after the DOW Jones suffered its worst day of 2024. So far on Thursday, the futures markets, certainly indicating a higher open this Friday. Let's see where those go 30 minutes from now. Well, we begin this hour in The Hague, where any minute now, we are set to hear a ruling on Israel's invasion of Rafah by the International Court of Justice. It follows an emergency request by South Africa, a couple of weeks to go for Israel to hold its offensive in Gaza's southern-most city. South Africa says Israel is quote, trapping, besieging and bombarding an overcrowded Rafah exacerbating the security and the safety of 1.5 million highly vulnerable Palestinians. Well, this is part of a wider case by South Africa in which it accuses Israel of genocide in the Enclave, where we are following developments closely for you. Let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson and Jeremy Diamond. Nic, let's start with you. This ICJ ruling is binding can't be appealed. But the court of course also has no way of enforcing it. So where are we at? What can we expect at this point? And what impact might this ruling have?",

And the interim ruling didn't say that Israel is committing genocide. However, it did say that Palestinians have a right to be protected from it and said that Israel should improve the humanitarian situation avoid -- and avoid the killings of civilians. So what South Africa is asking for here is the raise that -- language, preventative measures, they call it they've said that the IDF operation going into Rafah. There is no safe place for people to go in is just as dangerous or even more dangerous --",

This is the court's ruling an urgent request to order Israel to hold its invasion of Rafah, and indeed, withdrawal from Gaza. But this is a very specifically on Rafah and the court has concluded that Israel must hold its offensive immediately. Well, we have a legal analyst to help us understand what we have heard. Dr. Rosa Freedman joins us now live. She is Professor of Law Conflict and Global Development at the University of Reading. And I'm delighted to have you with me today. And you've been listening in to this ruling. What does today mean to you just explain? DR. ROSA FREEDMAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW CONFLICT AT UNIVERSITY OF READING: Well what we've heard in the ruling so far today, is that the court considers that the situation has changed so significantly since its last hearing, and his last ruling in March. And they used words like grave destruction, displacement. They've taken on board the evidence that South Africa has provided they seem to fully agree with that evidence. And they specifically focused in on Rafah and on the evacuation orders and the movement up until the 18th of May was the last date with 800,000 Palestinians. And they've said that, as a result of all of this evidence, they're going to modify the provisional measures. And we can come back to what provisional measures even means. That they're going to modify them and immediately order Israel to force any sort of military activities or other activities that may bring about the destruction of the Palestinian people in whole or in part. Now that phrase is talking about genocide. Genocide is a destruction of a people and hold on caught. They've also continued to order Israel to provide humanitarian access and assistance, which goes hand in hand with preventing this humanitarian catastrophe. This is a really pivotal moment for the International Court of Justice. They are essentially saying that Israel's right of self-defense can be modified by this provisional measure to prevent it going into Rafah militarily.",

And because this, of course, ispart of the wider case that South Africa has bought against Israel, on the question of genocide, and we should talk about how this fits into that wider case. But let's be very specific here. So this court has just delivered its verdict, it has concluded that Israel must hold its offensive on Rafah immediately, as you said, it sees the situation in Gaza, deteriorating since its order in January and as described the situation there not least as disastrous. The court is not convinced they said that Israel has taken sufficient measures to alleviate the immense risk to which the Palestinian population is exposed as a result of the military offensive in Rafah. The ICJ is calling for an immediate halt to operations in Rafah. This is a binding, ruling and cannot be appealed. The ICJ of course does not have an enforcement mechanism. So what are the likely consequences of this in the first instance?",

      "sentences": "South Africa alleges that Israel is perpetrating of genocide in Gaza against the Palestinians. And that case will take many years to beheard. A report can be asked to rule on provisional measures in the time between the case being brought and the court making its ruling. So someone alleges that money has been stolen from them. And they point to a specific bank account, the court might rule to freeze the money in that bank account so that it's not spent in the time between the allegation and the court making a ruling. The courts original provisional measures will be the kind of provisional measures that it's always put out in a genocide case. It's not ruling on whether or not there is genocide. It's simply said to Israel, make sure that there's humanitarian access, try and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, ensure that evidence is not destroyed that investigators and independent impartial observers are allowed into Gaza. In order to make sure that the case can't be heard one day that the evidence is there and that the Palestinian civilians are protected as best as possible within the laws of war. Well, the court said today goes further. It's saying that the situation in the humanitarian zone and Rafah is so dire and that the situation for the 800,000 or more Palestinians, first of all, were displaced into Rafah as a humanitarian zone and now have had these evacuation orders and really have nowhere to go, because Egypt's not opening its borders. And Gaza is a very small place. And they're still fighting Khan Yunis and in Gaza City. What its saying is that if Israel were to go into Rafah militarily, that would be going too far, and could very well implant the hearing of the case, eventually the hearing of the case, and as I say, it takes many years at the International Court of Justice. So it's not saying that this doesn't have a right of self-defense, but it is certainly saying that Israel does not -- is not allowed to militarily go into an area that -- previously designated a humanitarian zone.",

Let's bring back our CNN's Nic Robertson and with us today, Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem. Nic, let's start with you the International Court of Justice as instructed Israel to hold its offensive in Rafah and its ruling the world court said it was and I quote them here not convinced that the evacuation of some 800,000 people from Rafah and other measures by Israel are sufficient to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians, your thoughts?",

You know, as he went through that whole process of legal process of reading everything that had come before, he very clearly was laying out a situation here where Israel has failed to measure up and is now being told to stop now Israel, as we know, rejects the allegations of genocide. But this is, if you will, an alarm bell being rung about what's happening in Rafah from the highest tallest legal building, if you will, for one of the metaphor in the world. This is a warning to Israel that you have been warned about what you're doing. And we are now saying this has gone beyond and the case of you must prevent, or we must help prevent genocide happening in Gaza, has now taken a more serious and consequential term.",
