We'll have that in a moment. But first an update on our breaking news from Lewiston, Maine.Local police have now identified a person of interest in a mass shooting, Robert Card, a certified firearms instructor and member of the U.S. Army Reserves based in Maine. Authorities say Card is armed and dangerous, and a manhunt is now underway with residents in Lewiston being told to shelter in place after at least 22 people were shot dead, as many as 60 others wounded, a toll which has left many residents stunned and in disbelief.

He gave no details about timing, but added, the decision on when to begin the offensive would be his along with his war cabinet and the Israel Defense Forces. Netanyahu promised a crushing victory over Hamas, declaring all Hamas fighters to be dead men walking above ground, below ground, and outside Gaza. And he says already thousands of terrorists have been eliminated. He made no mention of growing international concern over the civilian death toll in Gaza, but says Israel is recruiting support of world leaders because Hamas is ISIS, and ISIS is Hamas. And for the first time since the deadly Hamas attack on October 7, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke about his own role in the security breakdown which failed to prevent the worst terror attack in Israeli history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Citizens of Israel, the 7th of October is a dark day in our history. We will fully clarify what happened on the southern border and in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. This failure will be investigated thoroughly.

But as you mentioned, John, not good enough for Israel. The foreign minister was in that meeting. He asked Guterres, in what world do you live? He said he would not meet with Guterres. And he said, look, when it comes to Hamas, after these attacks, there is no room for balance.As you said, the ambassador said that Israel would cut off visas for U.N. officials. And despite the secretary-general trying to set the record straight in that clip that you played earlier, Israel is not buying it. In fact, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations called it a disgrace that Guterres didn't apologize for his comments and retract them. And then he said this, \"He clearly said yesterday that the massacre by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. Every person understands very well that the meaning of his words is that Israel has guilt for the actions of Hamas, or at the very least, it shows his understanding for the background leading up to the massacre that Hamas perpetrated.\" He also called for Guterres to resign. That's not going to happen. But look, the reality is that this diplomatic spat between Israel and the United Nations also did not happen in a vacuum. Israel has been critical of the United Nations for decades. It thinks that the organization is biased against it. And for instance, if you look at the results of the U.N. Human Rights Council, it has passed more resolutions about Israel than it has about some of the world's most authoritarian and, you know, human rights abusing governments of the world. Obviously, none of this helps the current situation. You have the U.N. in Gaza saying that they're going to run out of fuel in a matter of hours, that it's going to. mean that hospitals will be left without fuel. You also have the U.N. Security Council unable to come up with a resolution for the whole situation. Right now, they seem to be squabbling about some pretty minor language around whether to call for a humanitarian pause or a ceasefire and how much, if at all, to criticize Israel -- the Israelis and Hamas in all of this.

These new videos the IDF is sharing appear to show a progression in sophistication, and therefore, an increase in potential danger to troops in the event of a ground incursion into Gaza. Like a 21st Century equivalent of World War I trenches, these deep burrows have dug-outs for storing weapons and safe rooms for fighters to plan and gather. Small trap doors in the desert let militants evade advancing troops, even sneak up behind them. And the danger down here, not just to the troops above, but to Israeli civilians, too. Long-range rockets stored on wall brackets can be rushed forward to be fired towards Tel Aviv and other cities from hidden gun pits connected directly to the tunnels, making the launch sites even harder for the IDF to strike back at. Only an incursion can Israel expect to fully destroy the terror tunnels. Absent that, the so-called Gaza Metro will outfox and endanger Israeli soldiers and civilians alike.

Israel Defense Forces say they're trading fire with Hezbollah militants who are targeting them from Southern Lebanon. The fighting has triggered painful flashbacks for many civilians in Lebanon on the other side of the border with Israel. Jomana Karadsheh has more now on how they're coping. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In these tranquil lands not far from Lebanon's volatile border with Israel, it feels like war is creeping closer by the day. Many have abandoned the olive harvest they wait for every year. There are those who have remained, out picking the olives for a few dollars a day to feed their families. Across the Southern frontier with Israel, more and more villages appear deserted. In the town of Marjeyoun (ph) a few miles from the border, the streets are quiet, many shops now shuttered. About half half of its residents have packed up and left. They've heard the fighting. It hasn't hit their town yet, but people here have seen it all before. Memories of the last big war with Israel in 2006 still raw. Nazira lived through that, Lebanon's civil war, Israel's decades-long occupation of Southern Lebanon, and the country's economic collapse. This little bakery is all she and her family have to survive. \"We've been through enough. We've had enough. We're old people. Where do we go?,\" she says. \"We brought up our families in poverty, and look at what we have to do now to live. We can't take any more.\" For the past two weeks, it's been a daily exchange of deadly fire between the Iranian-backed Lebanese paramilitary group Hezbollah and Israel. Attack and counterattack, mostly contained to a three-mile area on both sides of the border. But the threat of an all-out war, calculated or inadvertent, is real. So real, it's already driven nearly 20,000 people out of their homes, according to the U.N. In the Southern city of Tyre, the disaster center is back up and running. They've had to deal with more than 6,000 who fled here.
