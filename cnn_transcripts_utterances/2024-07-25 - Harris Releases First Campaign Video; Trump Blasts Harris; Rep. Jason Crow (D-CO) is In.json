Of course, the vice president intends to prosecute the case against the former president as she hits the trail, while also articulating what exactly the stakes are in this election.Now, it is notable where she has been this week. She was in battleground Wisconsin. That was where some of the images were taken in that video. She also was in Indianapolis yesterday, speaking to a black sorority. And today she is here, in Houston, where she is talking to the second largest teachers' union. I've been talking to some of the folks here who said, after this conference some of them canceled their flights just so that they could attend this event with the vice president. So, certainly it has been a momentous week for the vice president. She - there was a massive fundraising haul. She has gotten endorsements from the Democratic Party after what has been a divisive several few weeks. And now she'll be talking here, as she wraps up a week, and before she heads to Washington, where she'll have that critical meeting with the Israeli prime minister. Sara.",
