All right, 5Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. There are just 22 days until election day. New polling shows Kamala Harris and Donald Trump nearly tied. A new \"ABC News\"-IPSOS survey of likely voters shows Harris at 50 percent with Donald Trump at 48 percent. But let's compare that to the same poll from last month in September, Harris was ahead by 6 points among likely voters in this survey. And there's a new \"NBC\" poll that paints a similar picture, Harris and Trump deadlocked at 48 percent among registered voters. Last month, that same poll showed Harris with a 5-point lead. Now in these final weeks, both camps heavily investing in a handful of battleground states from spending -- sending out top supporters to stump on their behalf, pouring millions of dollars into targeted ads. Neither candidate can seem to get a solid edge over the other. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Trump's rhetoric has been getting darker.

In fact, just yesterday, the Iranian Foreign Minister who was on a visit to Iraq, he said that right now, Iran is ready for war as he put it, but also ready for peace.The Iranians have over the past couple of days really been warning about all this escalating into a possible full-on war, that of course, could engulf the entire region, and in the end, of course, also could pit the United States and Iran directly against one another. Is one of the other things that top government officials here have said is that there are no red lines as they put it in the defense of their citizens as they say, but also in the defense of their interests. And specifically, what the Iranians keep saying is that they say that any attack coming from Israel, any strike from Israel will be met by Iranian retaliation. So, they are vowing to strike back. They have not yet said what exactly it's going to look like. But one of the things that we have heard is the deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guard coming out and saying that if for instance, the Israelis strike Iranian oil and gas facilities, that the Iranians could then also strike Israel's energy sector. One of the other things that we also are picking up on is that the Iranians are saying that they are going to continue to support Hezbollah. [05:15:00] We of course, saw that drone attack that happened over the night, the Iranians are saying a lot more of that is going to come if Israel continues to attack Hezbollah's leadership. In fact, the speaker of Iranian parliament was in Beirut this weekend, and he also warned countries of the region not to allow Israel to use their airspace to attack Iran, that, that could have serious repercussions for them. And then finally, you had the commander of the Revolutionary Guard Aerospace Forces, which is the force here in Iran that's responsible for their ballistic missile program, so, for that strike on Israel, but for their air defenses as well.

Two federal officials tell CNN, on Saturday, police arrested a man who allegedly had a shotgun, a hand-gun, a high- capacity magazine, and multiple passports in his car.The Secret Service says that Trump was never in any danger, and that the FBI is now investigating the incident for potential federal charges. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich, who spent more than a year in a Russian prison will detail his time behind bars in a book expected out in 2026. Gershkovich was detained in 2023 while on a reporting trip and later convicted of spying by the Russians. He was freed in August as part of a prisoner swap that involved at least seven countries. Twenty three people are confirmed dead after Hurricane Milton ripped through Florida last week. Residents are left cleaning up from two hurricanes, Milton and Hurricane Helene, but are facing fuel and electricity shortages. Over the weekend, President Biden visited Florida to survey the damage and vowed that federal assistance will be available to those who were impacted.

Low temperatures are actually going to drop below that 32 degree mark, and it's all thanks to this cold front.

So, let's talk about the change in our temperatures, we're talking about a 15 to 25 degree temperature-drop compared to this time yesterday. Look at yesterday's high in Atlanta, 84, it will be 70 today, more dramatic temperature swings for places like Little Rock, look at St. Louis for instance, 88 on Saturday, today's high temperature is 62, so, we're topping a 26-degree temperature spread here, Washington D.C., where Kasie is located, a big temperature drop coming tomorrow. So, you've got a little bit more of a delayed cool weather-start for you even though temperatures here today will be considerably cooler than yesterday, but it really drops out tomorrow. Look at the temperatures as far south as Orlando, dropping into the lower 70. So, we'll welcome the change and enjoy the Autumn weather for, again, the eastern half of the country.
