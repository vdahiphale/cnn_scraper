And 7.1 percent, that's the slowest price gain since 2021. And when you look at the trend, you can see, after challenging inflation near 40- year highs, this chart I'm showing you here goes all the way back to the 80s, which was a terrible time for inflation, you can see, we got up to 9 percent and now 7.1 percent is that number.So, look, it's still -- you can feel it, especially feel it, especially when you're comparing it to last year, November 2021, for example. Compared to last year you got food prices up 10.6 percent. You have gasoline prices up more than 10 percent compared with a year ago. Shelter up 7.1 percent. And we just looked at airfares. Airfares are up 36 percent from a year ago. But think where we were a year ago. You didn't have the exploding consumer demand for services like you do right now. So, you're seeing consumer behavior start to change. You're probably still going to see some inflation in these services sectors. But in the goods producing side of the economy, you're seeing some signs of relief. I think, you guys, this shows that the Fed's medicine is beginning to work. There is a long way to go. It's too soon to declare victory over inflation. I want to be very clear about that. But the Fed has been jacking up interest rates to try to cool these prices. And 7.1 percent is definitely what Fed watchers wanted to see here today, guys.",

Of course, his imminent arrest and these new charges from the SEC means that he's not going to appear today according from Representative Waters who put out a statement last night.But what they were looking to hear is real, concrete proof that this was not a deliberate fraud. Now Sam Bankman-Fried says that he has, you know, had some judgment errors, but he says that it was not intentional that money was funneled from his crypto trading platform FTX into his research and venture firm Alameda Research. And to Christine's point, the reason that matters is that billions of dollars of customer funds have been misused for research and even lavish personal expenses, like apartments in the Bahamas from Alameda. That's what the SEC is going to be looking into.

There was reports of damage in Decatur, Texas, which is just to the north and west of Dallas-Fort Worth. And then let me take you to Wayne, Oklahoma. This is just south of Oklahoma City. And you'll see what happened overnight. Some of the damage from a tornado, unconfirmed tornado, out of that particular region, but buildings wiped off of their foundation, trees snapped over like twigs. This is what we are bracing ourselves across the northern Louisiana area because it is trekking eastward. All the ingredients are coming together. You see mother nature doesn't care that it's the middle of December or that it's approaching the first days of winter. It's like she's baking a cake. If the ingredients are there, the cake will rise. And all night the winds have been coming out of the southeast, our temperatures are warming up significantly and very quickly, the humidity is here from the Gulf of Mexico and the wind is picking up as well. So, basically, the ingredients are there, now all we need is a cold front to slice the cake and we will get our thunderstorms and our tornadoes. The threat here is a level three of five. That's been enhancement from the Storm Prediction Center. They've been tracking this for six days out. Well advertised.

He had essentially been telling people around him that he'd been struggling to fit in, to make friends. That he was planning to travel to Marseille.And then, of course, there is that CCTV footage that places Kenny on the 3rd of December, so several days after he stopped giving any contact to his parents, at a sports store just to the south of that city where he was studying, looking well, under no apparent duress.
