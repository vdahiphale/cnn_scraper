There's nothing in Article Five that says every country has to leap to military action in order to defend an ally that's attacked.However, the expectation of NATO is that if a country is attacked, there will be a concerted and collective military response. And we don't want to create a precedent where a country's attacked and people feel free to say Yes, but in this case I don't want to use military action, that would be very damaging for NATO. [01:10:09] So we do want to have the understanding that if a country is attacked, there is a collective military response. And that's why allies are hesitant about bringing in NATO on this day, because Ukraine is being attacked on this day. But that is different. That's a different question about NATO membership today, from the commitment to NATO membership in the future, where it is absolutely clear, this is what NATO is going to do.

Mass demonstrations of again paralyzed parts of Israel with tens of thousands on the streets, protesting the government's plans for judicial overhaul, a plan which they say threatens Israeli democracy. They declared Tuesday a Day of Resistance blocking major highways and intersections in Tel Aviv. They marched on Parliament and the Supreme Court in Jerusalem held a noisy protest at Ben Gurion Airport as well the main airport for Israel. The protests were mostly nonviolent, but dozens were arrested. And a photographer from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz was shoved to the ground, repeatedly manhandled by police. Water cannons were used to break up protests in Tel Aviv as well. CNN's Hadas Gold has more now from Ben Gurion Airport. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Here at Ben Gurion Airport, this is Israel's main airport just outside of Tel Aviv, thousands of protesters have essentially taken over we're here at the arrivals level. As you can see, no cars are passing there to be able to pick up passengers. And this is part of the protesters national day of disruption. Protests have been going on all day from the morning through the evening, all across the country. Now courts (ph) have been going on here for months against the government's plan to completely overhaul the judiciary. But the reason that they've been particularly amped up now is because of legislation that was passed Monday night, it's the first of three readings on just one aspect of this massive judicial overhaul. This particular legislation has to do with stripping the Supreme Court's ability of declaring government actions unreasonable, but it almost doesn't matter what the legislative steps were. It's just the fact that the legislation is back on the table because they had actually been frozen for several months after those massive general strikes and protests and the defense minister coming out against the overhaul back in March. There were some attempts at compromise negotiations with the opposition, but those have clearly gone nowhere are the coalition government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are now pushing forward once again, with this legislation. It's going to be done in a slower, more piecemeal fashion. But more these protesters they essentially don't believe anything that comes out of Benjamin Netanyahu or the coalition government's mouth when they say we should be a slower process, when they say that even parts of legislation have been soft and watered down. These protesters on the opposition wants to see a show overhaul essentially completely off the table. They say they will continue coming out to the streets and continue protesting. Now, the government and Benjamin Netanyahu say that judiciary desperately needs some sort of reform. They say they've won the election. They have the votes in Parliament to make this happen. But the protesters here at the opposition and even some of Israel's biggest allies like the United States have expressed grave concern about what exactly this reform will do. [01:15:07] And these protests -- these protesters, they say they will continue coming out. Some would even say that they plan to pitch tents in downtown Tel Aviv to make their purchase even more permanent. Hadas Gold, CNN, Ben Gurion Airport. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He ran on another agenda items like cost of living and security. And instead, once the government was established, from the first week, it's focusing for the past half a year, only on this one agenda item, a constitutional overhaul in democracy that is on the one hand, as you've seen in the pictures, very vibrant, very strong, but does not have sufficient institutional stability, because we do not have a constitution. And this is the main point. If you want to initiate constitutional, fundamental and constitutional changes, you need to do it with -- in a broad consensus. This is what the prime minister promised President Herzog.
