Palestinian officials say entire families are still buried in the sand and debris.Witnesses report at least five missiles struck the area at night, hitting a tent encampment and a humanitarian zone west of the city of Khan Younis, the territory's second biggest city and home to tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians. Israel says a senior Hamas terrorist operating command center was embedded in that humanitarian zone and attempts were made to mitigate civilian harm. Hamas denies any fighters were in the area. A Palestinian official says there was no advance warning of the Israeli strike. For more let's head to CNN's Paula Hancocks live in Abu Dhabi at this hour.

What we know, though, is that this particular area, Al-Mawasi, is designated a humanitarian zone by the Israeli military. We know thousands of Palestinians had fled to this area, many of them following evacuation orders. And what has happened in the early hours of today is we understand that there were Israeli airstrikes on this particular area.Now, Israel, for its part, says that it was, quote, \"It struck significant Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control center embedded inside the humanitarian area.\" So they say that they were targeting Hamas operatives, saying that they had taken steps to mitigate civilian harm using precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional measures. What we're seeing from the images, though, on the ground is the Gaza Civil Defense and others in the area trying to retrieve bodies, trying to see if there are survivors with their bare hands. They are digging in the sandy areas of the Al-Mawasi. And we can see from those images, clothes, personal belongings strewn across the area. So what we're hearing from the Gaza Civil Defense they say that there were more than 200 tents in this area. They believe some 20 to 40, according to them, have now disappeared. They fear that there are entire families that are buried beneath the sand. Now they say they have eyewitnesses who say there were five airstrikes. This is from the Gaza Civil Defense. We haven't heard specifics from the Israeli side at this point, but there are at least three large craters in this area. They say they don't have the equipment suitable to try and to find more survivors or to dig those out that have been buried because they simply don't have that. You can see people using their bare hands. So this is a situation that has just emerged in the recent hours. It's now daylight in Gaza. They were trying to find survivors in the dark. The daylight has come, and we should get more information in the coming hours -- John.",

It was a planned abdominal surgery she had, John, in January, and then during that they found obviously at some point that needed cancer treatment. She started it in late February.

We were told -- told anything else about the princess' illness, about what was happening, and so into that vacuum rushed all these really very upsetting and distressing conspiracy theories and all kinds of words on the internet. And that really is why Kate had to give that statement in early March where she -- on Friday night when she came out and she said, I have cancer, she sat on the bench on her own in Windsor and it was such a sad video. And this is a total contrast. She's with the family. She's full of hope. She's full of joy, but in the same way I think that the Wales have now decided that the way to speak directly, the way to stop all this speculation, the way to stop people from saying, oh, what's really happening, is to have this direct message in this very beautiful video. And I think they feel that if they put out a statement of Kate saying I finished chemotherapy, I'm still healing, you might not see me for, you know, a couple of months because I'm still working on my health, people might not have received it in the same way.
