Still don't know why 9We're going to into a second -- a third day tomorrow about this very issue. Of course, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, he has been enduring a series of stinging defeats, now losing a total of six rounds of voting in his attempt to become speaker of the House. He is saying tonight that there -- that while there's no deal yet -- emphasis on yet -- he says there's a lot of progress that has been made in talks with some of the holdouts to end the ongoing impasse. This possibly now paves the way for him to become the speaker. But, of course, it seems to be far from certain knowing that there seems to be at least 20 who have not budged in many a vote at this point. Now, some of his most strident opponents are vowing again tonight that they are going to block his bid. I want to go right now to CNN's Melanie Zanona who's on Capitol Hill tonight. Melanie, where did these negotiations stand tonight? Is McCarthy right to be optimistic?",

However, we did see some signs that the talks from earlier tonight are progressing, and that is that Kevin McCarthy has made an offer to some of the critics. This is something that came after he was huddled in his office with some of the holdouts, some of his allies were there. It's unclear whether that's going to be enough to get him the votes.Sources were telling me that perhaps it could move maybe 10 votes or so, which would not be enough to get him to 218. But it is a sign that Kevin McCarthy is ready to give concessions, that he is prepared to do everything it takes in these final moments to try to get him the speakership.",

It is why John Boehner is no longest speaker of the House. It's why Paul Ryan is no longer speaker of the House. It's why Kevin McCarthy failed in his first effort to be speaker of the House. And what's different now from then is that the core group of kind of -- you put them insurgents or radicals, however you want to frame them, I don't necessarily mean in pejorative sense, they have grown, they have more power. Leadership has gotten weaker. And step by step by step as leadership in the party, in the House conference has gotten weaker, they have kind of moved their way into this position where their weakness is exacerbated every single day.

And the people in foreign countries that are watching the United States go through this kind of very unsettled period of the last several years, perhaps they can feel more comfortable about the direction of things. The interesting kind of contrast, look, this was set up, this event today was set up as a figurative split screen, Tuesday to Wednesday. It became a very little one because they could not get a speaker of the House. We've talked to White House officials. They are thrilled with the image of that split screen. And yet, the president less so, because he knows what this means in the near term, whether it's funding the government, whether it's raising the debt ceiling, and longer term, what this means for the institution. One official told me today, the president is an institutionalist at his core, 36 years in the Senate, believes deeply about institutions.

That's the document which gives the indication of how we're justified, we being the police, not me the police, to arrest him.So, what's there? Is there DNA? If there's DNA, you're going to determine what is the connection of that DNA. Where was it and how did it get there? That's something the defense will certainly have to overcome. In the event his DNA is there, what, if any, innocent explanation is for that? Number two, this Elantra. We've heard a lot of speaking, Laura, about the Elantra and the tracking of it. What was the basis for it being there? Is there an innocent explanation as to it being there? Number three, are there any surveillance that would have him, the defendant in this case, in or around that general area? Was he tracking them? Number four, is there any particular alibi that he has that can demonstrate that he did not do this? Number five, were there any witnesses that could establish him there? There's so much that goes into this, not the least of which whether or not this is going to be a death penalty prosecution. We don't know that it is. But I think those are the things that are going to be very significant as the case unfolds and he goes to court, answers his plea of not guilty, et cetera, and the matter begins.
