And just hours ago, Israel unleashed a wave of deadly airstrikes as part of an operation that freed two Israeli hostages in Rafah.Senior administration officials say the White House is deeply concerned about the reported death toll.

The special forces trained for it. And then overnight, they carried out this dramatic raid which rescued these two hostages, 70-year-old Luis Har and 60- year-old, Fernando Marman. At 1.49 a.m., we're told that Israeli special forces breached a residential building in the heart of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city. They had intelligence that these two hostages were on the second floor. They went there, they grabbed them, and then they escaped under fire, we're told. A minute after that happened, we understand that the Israeli Air Force began bombarding targets in that area to try, they say, to prevent Hamas fighters in the area from intercepting this rescue operation.But we are also now getting a picture of the results of that bombardment. At least 94 people were killed in these overnight strikes in Rafah, and not just Hamas fighters. Women and children, clearly among the dead and the injured from these strikes. But we did see the images today as well of the reunification of these two men with their families at this hospital. An emotional moment coming 128 days after they were taken hostage from their kibbutz near the Gaza border.",

We want to prevent war, and that's what NATO is all about is preventing war. So, it's a very irresponsible thing to say.

CNN's Kristen Holmes is near Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, a crucial week here in court for the former president. He's trying to get her out of the election.

And this is, again, notable given the fact that he has routinely used all of these various courtroom stops as campaign events. I will remind you, the last time he was in federal court in Washington, D.C., again, same setting, no cameras, no media availability. His team reminded him over and over again, you're not going to be seen. He said it was fine. And then the day of, they all scrambled to get him in front of a camera because that is exactly what he wants to do. He wants to send his message.Now, I will note, in this case in particular, he actually is very interested in what they are discussing today because what it comes down to is access to evidence. Remember, the core of this case is classified documents. This hearing today is a conversation between Donald Trump, his lawyers, and a judge over what he has access to. They want access to all of the classified evidence, evidence that the prosecution, as well as some intelligence agencies, don't want them to have. So, this is something he clearly has his own vested interest in. He wants to see what evidence he himself will have access to. And as you mentioned, this is just one of many legal cases that are in the spotlight today, that other big one being the Supreme Court. We are expecting that they will appeal, that they will go to the Supreme Court and file a motion to essentially block the ruling from the D.C. Appeals Court that said that Donald Trump is not immune from persecution from any alleged crimes he committed while president. This is something that they have told us they are likely to do. Again, another part of this is that tactic we have seen from Trump time and time again. Once they push that forward, this delay, if it does go into motion, would then stop this case from going straight to trial, something we know Trump's team does not want to do.",

However, this issue, because they are dealing with highly classified information in these documents, this has really slowed down the prosecution of this case. Many of these documents can only be viewed if the person has a security clearance.We do know apparently that former president Trump has viewed some of these documents in Florida in a skiff.

You can't have sort of duelling states in one state where he's on the ballot, one state where he isn't. In this case, if the Supreme Court denies cert, basically the appeals court ruling would stand. President Trump would be denied that sort of sweeping executive criminal immunity that he was arguing for. And the case could proceed. However, the issue here, obviously, is the timing. The way the appeals court rule did sort of force Trump's hand to speedily file this appeal and made it so that he didn't file for an appeal en banc. He instead is going straight to the Supreme Court. And then the other issue is whether or not the Supreme Court, if they do take it, whether or not they would stay the case, meaning basically put a hold on the case moving forward, because they could potentially take it, but have the case move forward as well.",

In this affidavit, it also points out that Moreno had a yellow cord that is consistent with a detonation device for an explosive device, as well as other substances that are connected to explosive devices as well.  However, investigators have said they have not found any evidence of bombs or explosive devices here at the church or in the car that she drove here. But they continue to search her home for any of that kind of material. Investigators also say in those documents that Moreno at one point pointed the weapon that she brought, which has been just told by us by a law enforcement source, was an AR-15 style weapon, and that pointed it at the two off-duty officers that responded to the gunfire. And they shot her in self-defense, according to this court document.
