More than 24 hours after the storm made landfall, Milton has led to an infrastructure crisis in the state with some areas lacking clean water and electricity while extensive flooding damaged roads and buildings. So many people have lost everything.Milton unleashed an extraordinary storm surge and torrential rain and spawned a swarm of tornadoes before moving offshore over the Atlantic. More than two and a half million homes and businesses are still without power. Roughly a thousand people have been rescued so far. And in one remarkable rescue, the Coast Guard found a man Thursday clinging to a soft drink cooler approximately 30 miles or 50 kilometers off the coast after the storm disabled his fishing boat the day before. Milton hit Florida as residents were still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which made landfall less than two weeks ago. CNN's Isabel Rosales is on the scene in Florida with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He vowed for the first time to have interest payments on car loans be tax deductible. That is the latest in a series of costly tax cuts that he has been offering, but he argued and suggested really that it would help car makers as well as consumers dealing with high prices. He also said that he wants to revisit his own 2020 trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and said that he wants to renegotiate it so that Mexico has more Tariffs imposed on it for any cars that they are making in their country. But to get back to his criticism of Detroit at one point he argued that Detroit is a developing city He said quote \"it is more developing than most places in China calling it a once great city.\" And then he also used the city to characterize what he argued would happen to the rest of the country should Kamala Harris win in November. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on her list. I mean, the whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president.

The deadline for nominations was January 31st. The Nobel committee doesn't provide names of nominees, but this year there are 286 candidates, 89 of which are organizations, 197 of them are individuals, and one of them will be named as the new Nobel Peace Prize Laureate in just over an hour from now. And we will bring that to you live here on CNN. Now, Henrik Urdal is the Director of Peace Research Institute Oslo, which studies conflict and resolution, and he put out his own short list of potential winners. I spoke with him earlier about his thoughts on who should receive the prize in a year of so many elections and so much conflict. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
