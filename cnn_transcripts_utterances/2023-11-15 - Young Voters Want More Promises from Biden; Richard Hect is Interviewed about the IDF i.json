We, last night, launched a very, very precise and targeted operation. I heard before in your comments that there's tanks inside the hospital. That's not the case. It was special forces that went in based on intelligence to search for certain things. It's happening as we speak. As you mention, we also have medical teams. We had Arabic speakers.

Again, the way we'd like it to end would be to a see a competent, capable, reliable, honest Palestinian entity come over from the West Bank and impose itself or establish itself in Gaza, noting that, of course, they were run out of Gaza by Hamas back in 2007 after an election it in 2006. That's what you'd like to see. And you'd like to see all the structures and that they could oversee the humanitarian assistance, reconstruction of basic services, reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and resettlement of all these people that have been moved around in Gaza. I just don't see that happening. To be truthful, you don't have a competent, capable, completely trustworthy Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. So, that's the big question.But even beyond that, even if you could find an organization that could do that, who is actually going to keep an eye on Hamas and keep them from reconstituting? We've learned the hard way, if you take your eye off an extremist organization, the Islamic state, after we left and the Israelis took their eye off it, two years later there was a caliphate. And, again, this is akin to the Islamic state, Hamas is. This is an extremist army, if you will. It does have to be destroyed. But then there has to be an eye and pressure on that. That's the real question. But I -- what I look forward to is hearing what the vision is for the Palestinians in Gaza. Even as you work out who is going to administer the restoration of basic services, are you going to make life better for them? Can you separate the Palestinians from the extremists?
