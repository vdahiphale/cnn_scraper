At the same time, the White House is expected to announce the shipment of about 30 M1 Abrams tanks. The German news outlet Der Spiegel is reporting that Germany will send 14 Leopard 2 tanks and drop export restrictions to allow NATO allies to transfer their Leopard tanks to Kyiv as well.The tank debate is expected to begin in the German parliament in the coming hours. The news comes as the U.S. finalizes plans to send the Abrams tank to Ukraine with an announcement expected possibly as soon as today. Just days earlier, German officials indicated they would send tanks to Ukraine only after the U.S. made a similar commitment. But there is still no word on how many tanks will ultimately be sent, where they will come from or where they -- when they will actually arrive. And after meeting with the Finnish President, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the need was urgent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): t is not about five or 10 or 15 tanks, the need is greater. We are doing what is necessary every day to fill the deficit. And I thank everyone who supports us in this, however, discussions must end with decisions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In the case of Germany, though, you have a couple of political problems, number one, you have a brand new defense minister, you also have some extreme views on both the left and the right side of the German chancellery on why they should or should not give tanks.

And in fact, contributing the Abrams will drive other systemicimprovements in the Ukrainian military, like an establishment of a very viable logistics system, which I think if Ukrainian officers were being honest right now, they have a lot of work to do in their sustainment area. So, this might help them do that, to get the kind of maintainers and spare parts and resupply and lines of communications ready, but that's going to come toward the end of this. And I -- you know, I predict John that you may see a couple of Leopard tanks on the battlefield by March. And when I say a couple, maybe a company or battalions worth that will eventually grow. But the Abrams probably won't get there for, in my view between six and eight months because it takes a lot of work to set that sustainment base and to train the people that are maintaining that tank.",

And it's just too difficult to control. There are federal agencies and no doubt other countries as well, that are looking into having A.I. join this effort to try and minimize classification and declassify certain information. But clearly, something needs to be done and maybe if they can step away from the partisan nature of these attacks on both parties with respect to these incidents, actually, somebody could focus on trying to fix it so that we could protect national security.",

And that means Ukraine's needs on the battlefield continue to grow.CNN's Fred Pleitgen has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Even as fighting rages in Eastern Ukraine, Russian forces are making little headway. Vladimir Putin recently appointed his military chief, Valery Gerasimov, to lead the war in Ukraine, yet another reshuffle in the hierarchy. The deputy head of Ukraine's defense intelligence tells me he believes Putin realizes his entire command structure is in disarray. VADYM SKIBITSKIY, UKRAINIAN DEPUTY HEAD OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE (through translator): He really does have problems with the command, both at the top level, the generals, and at the bottom level of platoon or company commander. That issue is generally very problematic. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Another problem: those marginal gains Russia is making come mostly from mercenaries of the Wagner private military company around Bakhmut, where Wagner has been gaining ground while suffering severe losses themselves. Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has been highly critical of Russia's military leadership, calling them all but incompetent. The Ukrainians say he's made plenty of enemies among the elites. SKIBITSKIY (through translator): The leadership of the Russian armed forces are going to try to belittle Prigozhin's role and place however they can, so he cannot strengthen his positions in the Kremlin hierarchy. PLEITGEN (voice-over): While the Ukrainians try to hold on in Bakhmut, they say they urgently need Western-made battle tanks to take back more territory.",

SKIBITSKIY (through translator): Right now, they have moved their logistics and control, but mainly logistic systems, further away from the front line, and that's 80 to 100 to 120 kilometers away. And to strike them, you need longer-range strike systems. PLEITGEN (voice-over): That would include targets on Russian territory to choke off any future offensive by Moscow forces. SKIBITSKIY (through translator): There are strong logistics hubs in the Rostov region. It is these very hubs, and they need to be struck in order to disrupt the supply systems of all kinds.",

Notice that area highlighted in fuchsia. That's the tornado warning again for another ten minutes. A few notches in the line itself indicate little bits of rotation, but the system itself slowly weakening as we've lost the heat of the day, and much colder air sliding in behind it. So we'll get that rain- cooled air. And notice another warning in place. This is a severe thunderstorm warning, for orange. That slides up North of New Orleans, where areas will be dealing with strong winds. Tornado watches still in effect for New Orleans, now stretching back into the Florida Panhandle until 5 a.m. Central Time. And that system itself takes its track Eastward. So that severe weather threat will continue through the overnight. Notice areas highlighted in orange, more of that damaging wind threat and isolated tornado threat. But again, pushing Eastward over the next 24 hours, still holding that severe weather threat. So we'll be dealing with that same threat -- winds and tornadoes -- although it will start to weaken a bit. On the back end, we're dealing with the colder air and we're dealing with snowfall. We have winter storm warnings in effect from Oklahoma City back into the Ohio Valley, now stretching up into New England.
