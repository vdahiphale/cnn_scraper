Four in theafternoon here this hour Ukraine orders thousands of civilians to evacuate from a city on the Eastern Front Lines amid intense Russian attacks. We're also watching the southern front and we have a CNN exclusive report from there you won't want to miss that. At least 36 people are dead on the Hawaiian Island of Maui after devastating wildfires local officials worry that number could grow. An outspoken presidential candidate in Ecuador is assassinated days before the vote their official say the August 20th election will still go ahead as planned. And we'll take a look at how Israel's controversial judicial overhaul is having a chilling effect on the country's vital tech startup sector. That's coming up this hour. Well, first up in this 18th month of Russia's war on Ukraine another stark example today of the impact on ordinary civilians. More than 10,000 of the men Kupyansk answered in the Kharkiv region have been ordered to leave their homes this area around Kupyansk now described by Ukraine as the epicenter of hostilities. Now that city, you may remember was liberated almost a year ago. Officials say it has endured intense Russian shelling since late July and a similar narrative in Southern Ukraine with both sides reporting intense fighting but little change in territory. Well, our Chief International Security Editor, Nick Paton Walsh got exclusive up close access to Ukrainian troops fighting along the southern front lines and the daily struggles and the traumas that they face. No reporters witnessed scenes like this until now and I must warn you that Nick's report contains some graphic images. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice over): The brutal work here the world hasn't seen but once its results from the West, they have words and weapons of support. But out here it's them alone in searing heat, cloaked in dust in the southern counter offensive near Kharkiv, Ukraine has the initiative. Yet they have to shoot their way forward round by round.

And I think for Poland, it really has been on the part of the entire Poland society that they have been aiding Ukraine. You know, there have been drives for donations for Ukrainians, millions of Ukrainians who have found refuge inside of Poland who have found work there extremely quickly and who quite frankly, have been accepted with open arms by the Poles. We know that in general, over the years, there have been great relations between those two countries between Ukraine and Poland in 2012, for instance, the Euro was held in both Poland and in Ukraine. But the Poles also saying look, this is also a burden on them; the weapons aid that they've been giving has been substantial. Certainly also, if you look at the size of the Polish Military, they were also some of the first countries to come out and say yes, they want to give, for instance Leopard main battle tanks to the Ukrainian, so they really have been a driving factor. And quite frankly, also Becky, they are the main logistical hub as well for Western military gear to go into Ukraine. And that itself, of course, is a security risk for Poland as well. So it certainly is a country. I would say Poland that almost like none other in Europe has become a focal point has gained in importance within the NATO alliance, and certainly has done an extreme amount to help the Ukrainians in this fight against Russia, Becky.",

Well, for quite some time there have been murmurs about Israel normalizing relations with arguably the most important Arab State, Saudi Arabia. You'll remember the Israelis reached deals with several Arab nations in the Trump brokered Abraham accords back in 2020. But a Saudi deal could, would be a massive game changer and the region's biggest diplomatic agreement in a generation. Now, the U.S. and Riyadh have agreed on the broad contours of a prospective deal, or at least that is according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal. In response to a question about that report, the state department spokesperson told CNN while discussions have been productive; they are not quite there not yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: I will say that we've had productive conversations; there are a number of issues that we have discussed both with the Israeli government and with the Saudi government. Those conversations continue I expect there will be more happening in coming weeks; we've made progress on a number of issues. I'm not going to get into what the progress is.

He was no better person to break all of this down with then our very own International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson, he joins me now in the studio. So we know in this sort of triangulation that's going on that each side actually, you know, all sources tell us certainly the U.S. and Israel are very keen on normalization, we know that.

But that's also something that seems to have a level of traction. And certainly the Saudis have bought a huge amount of armaments from the United States in the past. Interestingly, one of the other part that that is sort of out there circulating around that we hear about is, is Saudi wanting sort of, in a way, the old paradigm, the old security for energy paradigm, but I think their own paradigm has also moved so that's context.
