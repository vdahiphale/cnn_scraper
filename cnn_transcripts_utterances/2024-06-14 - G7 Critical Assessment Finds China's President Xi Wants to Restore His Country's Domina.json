There's a level of confidence that you have to have not only in the offensive use of that weapon system, but what are the defensive measures, what are the indicators that an opponent, that an enemy chooses to use a hypersonic.And to your point about Cuba, the United States Navy and our allies have a very long history of working in very close proximity, formerly with the former Soviet Union and with the Russians moving forward and with other nations. The fact that the Russians are in Cuba certainly is disturbing, but they've done this before. I mean, they were there in 08, they were there in 13, 18, and 19. So clearly where we are now with the war in Ukraine, provocations by Russia, and with Russia dealing with a whole host of internal challenges. You know, their economy is shattered. Putin has no opposition. But he's dealing with a ton of pressure right now. This is an opportunity to do a head fake, to get everybody to notice something other than the real challenges he's dealing with.",

So I think I might want to step back from that in that he's establishing a strategic engagement context.But he's only achieving tactical advantages at this point. Look at what he's trying to do in Kharkiv. He's trying to complete what he has described as a strategic objective to establish a buffer zone between Russia and the West. And he's done that quite effectively. He's got Crimea, he's got the land bridge, he's got the Donbas. Now he wants to fight in Kharkiv. But look what's happening in Kharkiv. His military continues to demonstrate that it's feckless, that it's incompetent. There's little that he can achieve there without, over time, putting good money after bad, young men in to be slaughtered. How long he can do that is only a matter of an estimate on intelligence community experts. How long is Russia going to be able to do that? But bear in mind there is no other pressure that he feels to stop that. There's got to be an internal mechanism, and there may be an opportunity when he realizes that he's not going to be able to achieve anything other than this buffer zone that that is where he takes a pause. That gives the Ukrainians an opportunity, with the largesse and the support that they have from NATO and the U.S., to take advantage of that.",

They're also warning that potentially if patients then seek treatment outside the regulated health care system, essentially turning to the illicit drug market, that that could put them at high risk of injury and overdose because a lot of these pills, they say, in the illicit drug market are adulterated with substances like fentanyl. So they are putting out this warning so that health care providers, the public health community, and patients are aware of this situation. They say they don't know exactly how many people this could affect, but potentially 30,000 to 50,000, they say, adults could be affected because of these indictments affecting this telehealth company -- guys.",

They say they did things like putting monthly auto refills in place and paying prescribers not for the time spent caring for patients after the initial consultation, but instead solely based on the number of patients who got prescriptions, guys.CNN has reached out to the parties involved.

It's always been this sort of one element of exclusivity that you would have to honor. And that's been the way it has been for the last 20 years that Joey's been there.

There were folks that are opposed to eating meat, and this was, I think, during the most recent contest. He knocks away this protester that's, like, trying to grab him and interrupt the contest.
