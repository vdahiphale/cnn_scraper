I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, where the nation is reeling from yet another catastrophic Russian attack. As of now, more than 50 people are dead in a ballistic missile strike on a military educational facility and a hospital in the central Ukrainian City of Poltava, and there's much more than a hundred injured. The Ukrainian defense ministry said that the time between the air raid alarm and the strike was so short that it caught people as they were trying to get to shelter. It's one of the deadliest single attacks since Russia invaded February 2022. That's 30 months ago. And the Ukrainian government said tonight that both civilians and servicemen were among the casualties. President Zelenskyy has responded to this attack with a plea for more support, saying, quote, \"We continue to urge everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror. Ukraine needs air defense systems and missiles now, not sitting in storage. Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives.\" Now, Dmytro Kuleba is Ukraine's foreign minister, and we spoke right after news of the mass killing in Poltava broke. At the time, the numbers were coming in, and the numbers he gave were still being counted. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Hundreds of thousands of Israelis flooded the streets this week to protest the government's failure to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. And in Washington, President Biden says flat out that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure a deal. The prime minister, meantime, is defiant, saying any concessions by Israel now would empower Hamas to, quote, \"kill more hostages.\" Critics of the prime minister accuse him of sentencing the remaining hostages to death, while a source close to negotiations told CNN, quote, \"This guy torpedoed everything in one speech.\" Now, this comes as the British government is now suspending some arms exports to Israel to prevent their possible use in violence of international humanitarian law. Joining me now is Journalist Ronen Bergman, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine who's been closely following this story for us. Ronen, welcome back to the program. It's good to see you. So, in his speech yesterday, the prime minister made clear that he would not compromise on the Philadelphi Corridor, and that clearly is a nonstarter for any serious negotiations and agreement regarding a hostage deal. And Israeli media claims that he hasn't mentioned the Philadelphi Corridor for 15 years. It wasn't in the initial May proposal that the prime minister and President Biden agreed to.

Byall intents and purposes, it's three of them, if not five of them were expected to have been part of the initial phase of a deal to come home. This comes just days, hours, perhaps, after a contentious meeting was leaked at a cabinet meeting in which the prime minister seemed to blindside his cabinet by ordering that there be a vote on the Philadelphi Corridor. You and I've discussed the increased daylight now between the defense establishment in particular, the defense minister, Gallant, who has said, now is time for a deal. We do not need to maintain IDF troops at that Philadelphi Corridor in exchange for what could happen to these hostages. It is pertinent to bring them home. And their strategy is strategic argument to be made to pause the war as well. If that's not enough to convince the prime minister, in addition to some of the largest rallies we've seen in years, what is going to be the turning point? Is it defections, resignations from his coalition from his cabinet, or will it likely be more increased pressure from the outside, in particular, the Biden administration?",

You've seen what is mostly described as a symbolic move, not necessarily related to the past four or five days or Netanyahu's speech from the United Kingdom, but could it be threats along those lines from America's -- from Israel's top ally that could finally light a fire under Netanyahu, or will it only increase his popularity at home?",

And I don't think that the administration will walk away from. But, you know, Israel is so dependent in the U.S. And so, I would say entangled into the U.S. support. The U.S. I think will have, if needed, the means to show Mr. Netanyahu the discomfort if the existing situation will continue to endanger the hostages. What they will do, I don't know. As I said, Israeli officials are looking with concern at the administration for what they believe to be standing down and deciding not to have a public quarrel, a public fight with the Israeli prime minister.",

They believe that the anger, the frustration of the population for what has been going on since the Netanyahu government was sworn in, on the background, of course, of many, many years of occupation, and especially on what happened in the West Bank since October 7th by police and The New York Times, Natan Odenheimer and Mark Mazzetti, we described how the police is now standing down and not helping many, many Palestinians who are being attacked and compromised by extreme settlers. And this is just one part of actions taken or not taken by this government. That at least some of its ministers seem to be thriving, not concerned looking at the situation, but while the people who are in charge of the safety of the citizens of Israel, the military, the intelligence are so concerned, they are sending letters and they are asking the prime minister to intervene, some ministers are seeing this as the chance. They want founder (ph), they want havoc, they want up uprising that will force the Israeli military to go in and take down the Palestinian Authority, leading to an annexation of the West Bank.

This is conspiracy theory. What makes this not a conspiracy in your mind? DAVID DALEY, AUTHOR, \"ANTIDEMOCRATIC\":  This has been a very strategic effort at the heart of the Republican Party over the last 50 years. They've understood, I think more effectively than the Democrats have, that there are pressure points within our democracy. And that if you can put your finger on them, if you can control these little levers that sort of fly under the radar, whether we're talking about gerrymandered state legislatures or whether we're talking in many -- about the constitution of the U.S. Supreme Court, that you are able to have outsized influence and to win victories that you never could have won otherwise. In many ways, Chief Justice John Roberts is the most effective Republican politician of his generation, because by controlling the Supreme Court as Republicans have, they've been able, over the last 20 years, to win victories, on guns on voting rights, on the environment, on the regulatory state that would simply not have been possible through the electoral process of outlooks (ph).",

None of them really worked. It took too long to catch these that these efforts and all this skullduggery. And so, when Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and when it reauthorized it again in 1982 in 2006, it insisted on preclearance that told these localities and states that had the worst history, you're not going to be able to get away with this anymore. You're going to have to run any change you want to make pass the Department of Justice or a court in Washington, D.C. first.

The trouble with that is that the attack on the vote began that very morning, that states across the south and elsewhere were waiting for this decision and immediately began implementing things like voter ID pushes and voter roll purges and precinct closures that they could not have gotten away with prior to the court's decision. So, when Robert says that things have changed in the south, all he had to do was open his eyes to what was happening before the court's decision. And immediately afterwards, very little had actually changed in the south, except now, thanks to the court, these dark forces that the decision and Shelby County unleashed we're able to get away with it again.",

And this court ensured that that verdict would not come until after this presidential election, which I think is very dangerous. What this does is when you add this case to the larger picture of what this court has done on questions of democracy, campaign finance, and voting rights over the last 15 years, the Roberts court continuously puts its thumb on the scale to the advantage of the Republican politicians who placed them there. Now, the court looks at the kinds of reforms that many have offered and they say that, well, those reforms would threaten the court's judicial independence, which to, I think, many of us feels a little bit rich that the court has brought on this crisis of credibility itself through decision after decision that harm voters and advantage their own ideological side.",

Who is sending them on super yachts? Who is responsible for their lavish lifestyles? And do they have interests before the court? Those seem to me to be entirely fair questions. But I do think we also are going to have to get to the point of talking about a larger court, about expanding the numbers, and about shrinking its jurisdiction and the number of and the areas in which it is able to rule. When you have an unelected court that is repudiating the elected branches, the elected branches has the responsibility to reign it in, and to not do so would be allowing the court to put itself above all the other branches.",
