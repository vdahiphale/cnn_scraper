Under Title 42, migrants could try entering the country over and over and over and over and there was no legal consequence. They could try again and try again. And now, under Title 8, if they cross illegally, there are legal consequences.

Matthew Davis, the employee at the store, sees the suspect in this, Angel Gomez, 20 years old. Police say that Gomez is acting in disorderly fashion in the parking lot. That leads to a confrontation between Davis and Gomez. Gomez had shown up at that Sonic drive-through with a 12-year-old juvenile. That confrontation turns into a physical altercation. And at that point, police in Keene says that the 12-year-old returned to their car and came back with an A.R.-15 assault-style rifle and shot at Davis six times. Davis was airlifted from the shooting scene, flown to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead. We don't know who the firearm legally is registered to or those kinds of details. What we do know, Jim, is this shooting comes at a time when the victims' families of the Uvalde school shooting have been pushing Texas lawmakers to raise the legal age limit to own and purchase an assault-style weapon from 18 to 21. That appears to be going nowhere in the Texas legislature. But the details of this shooting is staggering.

The suit claims the bank, JPMorgan Chase, benefitted financially from Epstein's operation and failed to report suspicious financial activities. Prosecutors believe that Musk was a high-net-worth individual whom Epstein may have introduced to JPMorgan executives. Musk tweeted, quote, \"This is idiotic on so many levels.\" Also American shoppers are still fueling the economy. The Department of Commerce reported retail sales actually rebounded last month following two months of declines. The increase was driven by sales at car dealerships, restaurants, specialty stores and online shopping. And call it the taco wars. Fast-food chain Taco Bell is going to battle over the popular phrase \"Taco Tuesday.\" The company wants to use it in branding and advertising, but can't because, did you know this, it is trademarked. The smaller rival chain, Taco John's, has owned the rights for the past 34 years. So Taco Bell is petitioning the U.S. Patent Office saying that the phrase should not be exclusive, and should be freely available to all who make, sell, eat and celebrate tacos. I use that phrase, Boris so I guess I might be in violation.",
