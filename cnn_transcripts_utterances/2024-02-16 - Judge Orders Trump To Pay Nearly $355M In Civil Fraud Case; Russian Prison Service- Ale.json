Coming up, reaction to it all from Trevor Reed, the U.S. Marine who also spent some time in a Russian prison.Plus, comments you may have missed this week from Donald Trump's son- in-law, Jared Kushner. The cozy relationship he wants to keep up with a world leader who also is responsible for brutal human rights violations. And leading this hour, a major court ruling against Donald Trump. He's been ordered to pay nearly $355 million in a civil fraud case. He's been banned from doing business in the state of New York for three years. And the codefendants in this case include his adult sons, Donnie and Eric. Let's go straight to CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, what did the judge say in his ruling about Trump and his businesses?",

      "sentences": "Well, here, Jake, Trump's combative and defiant legal strategy has yielded yet another massive loss in New York state court. Now, in addition to those hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties, the judge has also barred Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years. He also cannot apply for loans from banks registered in New York for three years. Now, the only good news, and it's a small g, is that he was not issued the corporate death penalty.Here, the judge backtracked and is not going to dissolve Trump's business certificates for the Trump Organization. Some people might wonder, well, why not? This is a very rare penalty in the state of New York. And in the few instances where it has been implemented, there has been a clear victim. And one of the key lines of the Trump defense here is that there was no victim, no one was harmed. Everyone made money, everyone went home happy. So that is likely part of why he did not issue the corporate death penalty. But instead, the judge is installing some serious monitoring inside the Trump Organization. He installed a monitor back in 2022. This is an independent monitor who just monitors the organization to make sure that they're complying with laws and regulations. That monitor, according to today's opinion, will continue for another three years. And then the Trump Organization has to pay for what is described as a new compliance officer. And, of course, Jake, one of the things that makes this case so personal for the former president is not only that it strikes the heart of his identity as a businessman, but it's also about his family. And when it comes to his two adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. And Eric, the judge found them both liable for fraud, ordered them each to pay $4 million, and has barred them from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for two years. Now, it's also interesting, the judge also talked about Ivanka Trump, who testified in this case. He described her testimony as thoughtful and articulate, but said that her repeated memory lapses about details of deals that she worked on were, quote, \"suspect.\" Now, throughout this case, Trump and his lawyers and some of his children, at least two of his children, took a very combative, defiant, remorseless approach to this case. And we can see now this -- the result, it has yielded a verdict that will likely drain his coffers. It's not even clear that he can actually pay these penalties, even if his business technically survives.",

The second book is the one you give to tax authorities where you try to deflate your assets and increase your losses. And then there's that third beautiful book. That's the book that has the real data. And he's talking about that in all his description of the witnesses. But that's the punchline at the end. They had three sets of books over many years, and they defrauded everything. And I want to add one thing, he calls their defense that no one got harmed. He says they crowed that the borrowers did not hurt the bank, that they did not hurt the banks. He's rejecting that argument that there was no harm. TAPPER: Very, very interesting.

They say Navalny collapsed in prison after a walk. There is video of Navalny appearing in court and looking well. This is from just yesterday. CNN's Matthew Chance takes a look now at what we know and the reaction from around the world.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his last appearance, just a day before he died, Alexey Navalny seemed in good spirits, even teasing the judge at the court hearing where he appeared by video conference. Your honor, I will give you my personal account number so that you can send me money from your huge salary, he said. I'm running out, thanks to your decisions, he joked. Prison authorities say he collapsed on Friday after his daily walk. State media says emergency teams called to his penal colony tried to revive him for more than half an hour. Still, Navalny's family are waiting for confirmation of his death. YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S WIFE (through translator): If it is true, I want Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done to our country, to my family, and to my husband. CHANCE (voice-over): But Navalny's demise sends yet another chilling message to the Russian opposition. A few braving restrictions to lay flowers amid widespread shock, the country's most prominent opposition figure has been silenced. What calms me is that if he really died, his death will make his supporters a bit stronger, says this woman in St. Petersburg. When I learned about it, I was horrified and cried, says another. Now I just want to scream, she adds. But with Russian presidential elections just weeks away, Vladimir Putin seems unfazed by the death of another prominent critic. He's visiting an industrial facility in the city of Chelyabinsk, leaving his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, to field the awkward question. According to the rules, all necessary investigations are underway, he told reporters. Later, suggesting that much international reaction to the death is unjustified. But for many, blame is already being laid at the Kremlin's door. Pro Navalny protests are banned in Russia, but in neighboring Georgia and elsewhere, mourners are turning out to pay their respects and to voice their anger. Putin die, they're chanting. But it is his critics, it seems, whose lives are snatched away. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera): Well, Jake, tonight the Russian authorities are actually moving to arrest lots of those people who have been laying flowers out of respect for that opposition figure, Alexey Navalny. OVN, which is a group that monitors Russian repression says at least 73 people have been arrested in cities from Moscow to St. Petersburg to Murmansk in the north and Lisjin Ovograd (ph) elsewhere, which gives you an indication of just how widespread support and sympathy is for this figure.
