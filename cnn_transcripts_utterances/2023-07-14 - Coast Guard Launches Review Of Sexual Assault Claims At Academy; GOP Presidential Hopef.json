Ramaswamy -- my bad.They, of course, also have to hit at least one percent in three national polls or a combination of national and state polls. And sign a pledge to support the eventual nominee. Governor Asa Hutchinson is among those who has notched one percent in one national poll but, so far, he has not reached the donor threshold. This photo of an event he held on Tuesday in Iowa has some suggesting that he has a tough road ahead of him. The picture has gone viral because it appears to show just six people in attendance. And joining us now is former Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson. Thank you so much for coming on, Governor. So, did that photo accurately depict how many people showed up, and what do you say to those who see that as a sign that your campaign just isn't catching on? ASA HUTCHINSON, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, whenever you look at my campaign in Iowa, where I am today, we've had large crowds, we've had small crowds. And, you know, there's some benefit to meeting with a small group of people where they get to ask questions. So let's not diminish the small things in a campaign -- they add up -- and I enjoy that question and answer. So the small crowd that's depicted there actually was in a restaurant where I was shaking hands. And I enjoy that kind of engagement here in Iowa. Our campaign is moving forward every day. I'm so delighted that we did meet the threshold for the polling requirement and now we've got to meet the donor threshold.

And so, we're going to have to do what we need to do to get there.But I'm just pleased with the response that we get. People want the candidates on the debate stage. And I've never seen an issue about the criteria for the debate being so well-known among the public. You can go to any restaurant and they've heard about the 40,000 criteria.

The Iowa legislature has passed that six-week bill twice now. It's a heartbeat bill that says if the unborn child has a -- has a detectable heartbeat then abortion is not permissible under those circumstances. And so, I support what Iowa has done and today we'll be talking about that. Also, I would just say that Gov.

And to the extent possible, governments should stay out. But certainly, whenever you're looking at protection of life, whenever you're talking about inalterable decisions for the future, then there's a role for the state to come in and say that goes too far.
