First outfit you ever endorsed me as a 29-year-old kid when I was running for the United States Senate and with me my whole career. You know, the fact is, it starts at the top, though, with Shawn Fain. Sean, you've done one hell of a job, pal.When I called Shawn to congratulate him on his historic deals with the big 3 automakers, he said, the credit goes to all of you, all of you out there. And it does. And it may be true, but it doesn't hurt to have a leader with a backbone like a ramrod. You know, he and the entire UAW prove what I've always believed. Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class-built America. And unions built the middle class. That was true in the 20th century. It's still true today. And Americans know it. That's why unions are more popular today than they've been in decades. About six weeks ago, I went to Belvidere, Michigan-- excuse me, Belleville, Michigan to join your brothers and sisters in the picket line. I brought back a lot of memories of my marching on picket lines as a United States senator. But what I didn't realize was the first time a president ever did that. It was second nature. No, I'm serious. I didn't know that. Well, I'll tell you, I've worn this shirt a lot, man. You have no idea. I've been involved with the UAW longer than you were alive, man. Look, that day in Michigan, I said the auto strike was about a simple proposition. You guys sacrificed to save the automobile industry from a fight in the middle of a fight. No, you -- that's a fact. You did. Some of you weren't around. You were too young. But you-- I mean it. But the financial crisis is more than a decade ago. And now, the auto companies are doing incredibly well. So, auto workers should be doing incredibly well as well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel is formalizing a pattern of pausing its attacks against Hamas for hours at a time. It is described as daily 4-hour holds to allow critical humanitarian aid to reach Gaza and also to give Palestinian civilians time to flee south. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stresses that this is not a ceasefire. He is being very clear about that. He's insisting there won't be one until Hamas releases all hostages.I want to bring in CNN's Nada Bashir, who is in Jerusalem, with more on what this means for the people of Gaza. Important to note, Nada, there have been these pauses actually for days, but this is a process, it appears, of formalizing them. Is that right?",

      "sentences": "Essentially, yes, but we have heard now from a senior Israeli official who has characterized these pauses as tactical localized pauses. They won't be an overarching pause across northern Gaza but affect -- will focus on specific areas on different days. We are told this will be essentially given notice to residents in northern Gaza, potentially hours beforehand, telling them whether or not those areas are safe. And of course, as you mentioned, the key focus here will be, A, to allow for humanitarian relief to get into these areas, but crucially, to allow for the evacuation of Palestinian civilians from northern Gaza southwards.Now, there are, of course, a number of issues with this proposal, as we have seen, and as you mentioned, we have seen similar pauses being put in place, but of course, as we know, a number of those key evacuation routes from northern Gaza towards the south have been heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes over the last 4 weeks. That means it is very difficult for civilians to get out by car. Many of them are walking on foot, including the elderly, including children. This is not a small distance, so this is a very difficult task, of course, for many. And as we know, there are many who simply cannot leave their homes, their communities in northern Gaza, despite the continued airstrikes. And of course, the situation in northern Gaza is dire, to say the least. The majority of Gaza's hospitals now are out of service, and what we have seen is tens of thousands of Palestinians flocking to these so-called safe zones, hoping that this will be a sanctuary for them, for their families, amid these continued airstrikes. And of course, as we have heard from US officials, we've heard from the US National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, saying that the US has received assurances from Israeli officials that military operations will not be ongoing during these pauses. But of course, Israel has called on citizens to move southwards, and as we have seen for the last couple of weeks, Brianna, those airstrikes have continued in central and southern Gaza. They have edged closer and closer towards civilian areas, from refugee camps to U.N.-run schools to hospital facilities. [14:05:09] And the concern here is that, while these pauses are, of course, being questioned and debated about, while this is beginning to look like more of a formal expression of a pause, not necessarily a cease-fire, but a localized pause, as we have heard from that senior Israeli official, the concern is that we could still see civilians attempting to flee into southern Gaza, but, of course, still facing airstrikes and, of course, military activity on the ground. And, of course, as we know, we are seeing aid getting into Gaza, but it is a small amount of aid. It certainly isn't as much as is needed. We have heard from U.N. officials telling us that some 1.5 million Palestinians inside Gaza are now displaced. That is a huge concern. And, of course, as we are hearing more people fleeing south, that number is only growing, but so is the death toll, more than 10,000 people killed, including more than 4,000 children, more than 25,000 Palestinians inside Gaza have been injured. And the humanitarian situation is deteriorating by the hour. So, while these 4-hour pauses may provide some respite, there is certainly a lot more to be done. Brianna.",

Now, we are told that those resulted in 3 minor injuries and all of the U.S. troops who were injured have since returned to duty. But what this really emphasizes is the question of whether the airstrikes against these Iran-backed groups and these Iranian targets inside Syria are actually working, because the attacks have continued.The U.S. conducted these airstrikes yesterday for the second time in 2 weeks against these Iran-backed targets. --  And the attacks against the U.S. coalition-- U.S and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria have continued. And so, the question for the Pentagon that they have gotten repeatedly over the last several days is, is this a sustainable approach for the U.S. to continue these retaliatory strikes if these Iran-backed groups are going to continue attacking regardless? It clearly seems like they are not deterred. But the U.S. saying that they do believe that these limited self- defense strikes against these Iran-backed groups are having the desired effect in terms of keeping the conflict at bay. They say that the strikes that they are launching against these U.S. forces are very small. They are conducted with drones and rockets, not resulting in a lot of damage or many casualties. And so their approach right now is just to continue to put military hardware, put troops in the region, create that deterrent effect, and hope that this really does not continue to escalate any further, Brianna. But, obviously, questions will be raised as these attacks continue as they have.",

That's top of the U.S. priority, especially if they're the U.S. Americans that are held. On the other hand, it is a bargaining tactic, a strategy by Hamas to drag this out, to seek a ceasefire so that they can re-strengthen, re-improve their positions inside Hamas and hang on longer and prolong the crisis.So, it cuts both ways. It's hard to predict at this point, but I suspect that the Israelis will continue to grind forward this military offensive.

So, if they strike us, we strike back harder. There's no question that the United States has the preponderance of power, the ability to strike, to take out these forces.I understand we don't want to escalate, but on the other hand, we don't want them to escalate and end up with serious casualties among our own forces.

The $35 insulin cap, for example, the negotiating subscription drugs down with Medicare. And yes, the focusing on making sure that working- class, middle-class families are the focus of his priorities, building that economic middle class from the bottom up and the middle out, as opposed to the top down, which is what Republicans always love to do.And so, there is time to do that.

We need to stop the judging and we need to recognize, look, this is in the hands of the-- of the states. Let the people decide. And I think there should be reasonable limits.
