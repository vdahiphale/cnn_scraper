I have been fascinated by this story, so are you, and we're going to go in depth to the dramatic capture of Danelo Cavalcante from the moment that he broke out of prison almost two weeks ago until this very morning when police crept up on him and surrounded him in the woods. I'm right here in Pennsylvania where it all went down at the location. It's a few hundred yards behind me where the escape murderer was captured just after 8:00 a.m. Now, tonight, he is back behind bars for the first time, I might add, since August 31st in the Pennsylvania State Prison in a different county, this time Montgomery County. But now, he's got another charge, this time felony escape, that adds on to the life in prison sentence for the heinous murder of his former girlfriend in front of her two young children. Now, you see him in the video shot by CNN affiliate, CBS News Philadelphia. Well, today, I'm going to talk to the chief county detective of Chester County and the chair of the prison board. Now, the story of how they got him is like something out of a Hollywood movie. They used heat-seeking technology to find him. And, oh, there's a four-year-old canine named Yoda who ultimately subdued what's called a defiant convict here. Now, police explained how it all went down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He did have some experience hiding in the jungle. That's what we learned earlier from detect -- from Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens.

The whole -- the two biggest terrifying factors that police had was that he'd get a weapon and that he'd get a car.

We got him in certain areas and we came close a couple of times, but he was able to elude us.And you're right, that murder was horrific. What he did showed no emotion. I watched that trial. I was in that trial. I watched it. He showed no emotion, didn't apologize. The jury came back in 15 minutes after hearing that case, in 15 minutes, and convicted him of first- degree murder. And that's how horrific this crime was. And to see a week later him escape the way he did was shocking, shocking to me. And, you know, we gathered our support, called all our agencies, and we put a plan together and didn't stop working 24 hours a day. And I have to tell you, the level of dedication of the men and women of every agency, particularly the tactical operators, it's hard to describe here in words what they did. You know, 12-hour shifts in the woods with all their tactical gear. Didn't want to -- never once did they complain ever about anything. They had a mission, they were focused, and they wanted to capture him safely and make sure that none of the citizens were injured or put in jeopardy. And the county, it was unnerving for a lot of people, you know, not only in the concentration areas --",

More cameras, more lighting. This prison has been around for decades, has not had those security investments, and folks maybe didn't feel the need for it to have that. We're going to make those investments now. And we're going to include the community with town halls next week, present those to the community, get their feedback, start regaining their trust week after week, month after month, and hopefully, 10 years from now, we can say confidently there's been no more escapes and these security measures worked.",

They know that he's armed. He's got the weapon right there near his body within reach. They send in the dog instead in a final effort to resolve this, uh, as bloodlessly and peacefully as possible.
