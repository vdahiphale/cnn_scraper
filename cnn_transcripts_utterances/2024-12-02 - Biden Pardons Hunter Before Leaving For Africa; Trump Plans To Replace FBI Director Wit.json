      "sentences": "I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington. Thanks so much for joining me today on CNN NEWSROOM.And let's get right to the news. President Joe Biden touched down in Angola today, fulfilling in the 11th hour his promise to be the first American president in more than a decade to visit the continent of Africa. But right before he left this country, he dropped a political bomb in Washington, wielding one of the offices most awesome powers, the pardon to shield his own son, Hunter, from legal liability. And, of course, Hunter did have lots of liability. He was convicted of lying about his drug use in order to buy a gun and pleaded guilty to evading taxes, pardoning him is a major reversal for the president, who had repeatedly and emphatically said he would not take this step on the campaign trail. He is catching political fire for it from all sides. Democrats critical of the president and the message and sense and precedent it sets. Republicans accusing Biden of hypocrisy. The special counsel weighed in just moments ago in a court filing denying that the charges against Hunter Biden were politically motivated this, as the president had claimed in a statement, and opposing the pardon. Senior White House correspondent M.J. Lee joins me now. And, M.J., as we understand it, CNN reporting is that he did not run this through the DOJ's pardon office, did it himself. In effect, do we know why the president changed his mind here for this? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is something that White House officials are now saying was a decision that he only came to over the weekend after he had spent a couple of days in Nantucket, gathered with his family for Thanksgiving. You know, I will tell you, you're talking about some of the backlash that the White House and the president are getting for this reversal. They are fully aware of how bad this looks. They are fully aware that this marks a total reversal and a total about face for the president and a White House that repeatedly said and unequivocally had said that he had no interest in pardoning his son, Hunter. You know, we've actually yet to hear directly from the president himself, other than that written statement that we got from him late last night as he is now traveling in Angola for a couple of days. But we did hear the first lady earlier today telling reporters, of course, she supports this decision. As for the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre who herself had said repeatedly over the course of months when asked about this issue that the president was not going to pardon Hunter Biden she is now getting pressed with a number of questions on this reversal and the decision to change his mind, or either the president having been dishonest about this being his intention, and she interestingly and notably acknowledged that the results of the presidential election last month was a factor in the presidents decision. This is what she said. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

I think there was a growing concern and sort of an acknowledgment, even though even among those in Biden's circle and allies around him that this was going to be a totally different situation than had there been a President Kamala Harris.And one thing I will tell you, you know, I've been speaking to former White House and administration officials, everyone I've spoken to so far, to a person, they've told me, Jim that they never believed it when the president in months prior had said, I would never pardon my son Hunter, they just felt like, why wouldn't he? He is his father. He has this power to do so. We never believed it when he said it but the thing that they are angry about right now is why did he then insist over and over again -- again, unequivocally, that he wouldn't do this, if they all felt like this was obviously going to be the outcome and the decision that he would ultimately make?",

The president said he would not do this. He has now done this. Now, we should note that presidents have used the pardon power to help their families before Bill Clinton issued clemency, I should say in his case for his brother Rogers 1985 drug conviction. Trump, of course, pardoned his son in law's father, Charles Kushner, who he has now appointed as his ambassador to France. That said, though this is a son who has been convicted. Has Biden stained the pardon power as a result? STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, as you point out, there have been some pretty egregious abuses of the pardon power, not just in recent decades, but throughout us history. I think the problem here is not so much, you know clearly, there's humanity in this situation. Obviously, there's a concern that the Trump people, by virtue of their own words, will come after Hunter Biden, perhaps unfairly but there is a great deal of cynicism in the United States outside Washington about the justice system. President Biden came to office vowing to depoliticize the justice system and to ensure the rule of law. To an outsider this looks a lot like a powerful man, a president protecting his own son who was convicted through the due process of law. And I don't see how it can be any other way than it spreads even greater cynicism about the justice system and the idea that powerful people can get away with things that other people can't.",

      "sentences": "Well, one factor that could have impacted Biden's thinking on that pardon is President-elect Donald Trump's pick for FBI director. That is Kash Patel. We learned this Saturday night. A fierce MAGA loyalist, former terrorism prosecutor who worked in national security in Trump's first term, though at a lower level.You'll remember the current director, Christopher Wray, was nominated by Trump himself and has three years left on his term. Those terms are ten years. They are by design -- they transcend presidential terms because they want to depoliticize the FBI. CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez joins me now. So, Evan, a lot of unusual going around as you know, and you've covered a lot of it. But how unusual is it for a president elect to announce he's going to fire or force out the FBI director midterm before he even takes office? And I wonder, do we know if Christopher Wray might resign or wait to be fired?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think, Jake -- I'm sorry, Jim. One of the big unusual things about this is that, you know, traditionally we believe that we have one president at a time. And right now, Donald Trump is certainly making it seem like he's already president. He doesn't have the power to fire Chris Wray right now.And one of the things that has been going on behind the scenes at the FBI has been because Trump made clear that he wanted to get rid of Wray would be would what would Wray do? And does he resign before Trump gets in on January 20th, or does he wait. And I think one of a lot of the advice that the director of the FBI has been getting has been to for the protection of the institution for -- to sort of underscore what you just said, which is that this is a ten year term, and there's a reason why it exists that because of that, Wray should not go anywhere. And so, the first statement you saw from the FBI over the weekend reaffirmed that Wray intends to stay put, at least for now. We don't know whether he will accede to the -- to the incoming president's requests and just hand in his resignation on January 20th. But for now, he is remaining on the job. And the big question also is how easy of a time does Kash Patel have in the next few weeks to get those votes? To get this nomination approved? We don't know whether the Senate is going to go along with this especially given the fact that the history for Kash Patel tells us that that he's a firebrand, that he is a bomb thrower, and its not clear whether that's what you want in an FBI director, Jim.",

You cant just you would have to spend years just changing the structure of the FBI before you could start going after people like that and, you know, I get that there needs to be changed. I think a lot of agents and ex-agents believe that the FBI has been politicized, but it doesn't mean that this is the answer.",

And then at that point, a lot of agents question whether January sixth was -- was -- where the FBI went, maybe too hard on that.And there are, you know again, these are perceptions of agents, and that's where they stand. But the deal is that average FBI agent never even put a campaign sign in their yard for fear of violating the Hatch Act. So, for people to come down and make public political statements and all this, this is not the bureau culture and while the agents want change I think what they're looking for is somebody who is loyal to America first, and the FBI second, and to the public -- to the president, third, because the FBI is responsible for investigating everything in the government. And we just saw recently where a sitting president put family before the country and that's going to write a lot of copy for the Trump people. But the FBI is averse to getting involved in politics.",

That's an open question, isn't it?Or do you believe that the history of the building there can withstand that sort of pressure if the commander in chief is saying, I want these guys out or I want to prosecute these guys, or I want to take away their security clearances, that's another thing he's saying about some former intelligence officials.",

But you're exactly right, Jim, this all stemmed from the Georgian dreams idea that it wanted to pause its negotiations on joining the European Union. Georgia has an 80 percent support for joining -- Georgians have 80 percent support for joining the European Union, so supportive of it, it's actually enshrined in Georgia's constitution that eventually it will ascend to become one of the E.U. members. I mean, it has also aspirations to join NATO, but these protests are focused specifically on the on the on joining the European Union. The prime minister, for his part has said that, look, were no -- we're not negotiating with anybody. We're going to continue with this path and we're going to delay for four years. The president, which is creating a antagonism now at the top of the Georgian political spectrum, has said that she's not going to step down at the end of her term, which is in December, and ends in December. And she's going to remain in power. What this is fomenting is more antagonism and more strife for the Georgian people as it starts to look very, very unclear what's going to happen. Georgians, for their part, though, have seen the Georgian dream. Who were the elected party before -- before these elections go on, a series of more draconian, more draconian anti-E.U., pro-Russian laws, including a foreign agents law which has very similar messaging to the one published and enacted by the Kremlin. There has also been sweeping changes to social issues as well, things like LGBTQ+ rights have been severely curtailed. So this really is a groundswell grassroots movement of the large majority of Georgians protesting against the government and trying to express the will of the people. And at the moment, the government is just simply not listening, burying its head in the sand, and has no intention to listen by the sound of it, Jim.",
