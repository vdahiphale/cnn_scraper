They responded saying that she will not be commenting further beyond what she already has shared on social media earlier this morning when she wrote on Twitter that the bureau had, quote, \"informed,\" at least confirmed, \"I was a target of a heavily armed defendant in this matter.\"The attorney general then writes, \"It is my sincere hope that the federal authorities take this offense just as seriously as my hate crimes and domestic terrorism unit takes plots to murder elected officials. AG Nessel referring to Jack Eugene Carpenter, a Tipton, Michigan, man who federal agents say took to Twitter on February 17th to issue a death threat to Jewish officials or rather to Michigan state officials, and specifically writing that he was, quote, \"heading back to Michigan now,\" threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan government if they don't leave or confess. Now we should mention that the next day the FBI working with Michigan state police then were able to track him down to Michigan. His mother telling investigators that he potentially had possession of three handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, and at least two hunting rifles. His mother also providing Carpenter's cell phone. And with that is how investigators were able to track him down to the Fort Worth, Texas, area. Carpenter is still scheduled for an upcoming hearing. We are still trying to reach out to investigators to try to find out if he actually had possession of these weapons. But certainly extremely concerning for officials there in Michigan in light of the kidnapping attempt that was foiled against Michigan's own governor.",

But I'll tell you a little bit about what we do know about Marc Muffley, as you mentioned. 40 years old, he's from Lansford, Pennsylvania. That's about an hour northwest of here, give or take or so from where we are here at the Lehigh Valley International Airport.And the FBI says of course as you mentioned that he was the one who had those explosives allegedly in his suitcase and he tried to check them into the airport right here to board a flight to Orlando back on Monday. But as you know, that suitcase did not get very far. I'm going to tell you specifically what the TSA and an FBI bomb technician found inside there. They've found not only powder, consistent with, quote, \"commercial grade\" fireworks. They found a can of butane, a lighter, a pipe with some white residue on it, a wireless drill, and two outlets taped together. And at that point federal agents said that this was a significant risk to the aircraft and to passengers. Now once the TSA found this bag, they looked at the luggage and the luggage had a luggage tag on it with Mr. Muffley's name. They then paged for him over the airport PA system. At that point Mr. Muffley was seen on security camera turning around and leaving the airport. But later that evening the FBI was able to track him down to his home in Lansford and arrest him without incident is what we're told. Now he is currently facing two federal charges first for possessing an explosive in an airport and then for attempting to place an explosive on a plane. We've reached out to his public defender who we've not yet heard back but he is due in court this afternoon at 1:30, in Allentown, at that federal district court, and hopefully we'll get some more answers to some of those questions they were asking initially -- Jim, Erica. HILL: All right. Danny, appreciate it, thank you. More trouble in the skies to tell you about. A scary moment aboard a Spirit Airlines flight. A battery caught fire in an overhead bin. Passengers telling CNN, when they opened that bin, the entire backpack was on fire. You can see here. Smoke in the cabin as they'd actually filled the cabin pretty quickly.",

It injured several people, forced the plane to land at Dulles Airport in Virginia. This video shows the aftermath. Goodness. It happened about 90 minutes after takeoff. One passenger told CNN, quote, \"It was like unexpectedly free falling for five seconds off the top of the roller coaster, plates and glass were at the ceiling.\" CNN's Pete Muntean joins us now. Pete, at least seven people have been taken to the hospital. I mean, we should note that these incidents are rare on airlines.

There is a host of evidence, we're talking data, video, testimony, that they have all heard. But there's a lot they don't have as well.
