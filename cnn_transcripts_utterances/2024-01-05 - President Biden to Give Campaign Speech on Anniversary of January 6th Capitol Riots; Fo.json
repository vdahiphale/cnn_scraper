When you talk about closing message, he is actually making the point that Bob Vanderplaats just made. He is not rally talking about his other GOP rivals. Of course, he is going to throw in those insults, but he wants to ask Iowans and he's stressing to Iowans, are you happier now particularly when it comes to the economy than you were four years ago, or were you better off four years ago? And if the answer is you were better off four years ago, ignore all of this noise, put me back in. I will do it for you again, and I will do it for you again.Again, we are going to hear those sideswipes at those other candidates, but that is the message that he really wants to hammer home. As for whether or not he can balance all of the legal and all of the political, look just what we have seen in the month of January. And by the way, this is only going to get more full. The second they filed their appeal in the Maine 14th Amendment case, the 3rd of January they filed their appeal in the Colorado 14th Amendment case, 5th through 6th he is in Iowa campaigning. The 9th, Trump's legal team is going to make their arguments in the immunity claim in D.C. I reported earlier this week that Trump's team is making plans for him to actually attend that. And the 11th, final arguments in the New York civil fraud case. We do not know yet if Trump is going to attend that, but we know he has gone multiple times, and that is a case that is very close to him. After that, 12th through the Iowa caucuses, he's back in Iowa campaigning. This is a very hard schedule to juggle, and one thing to keep in mind here, none of the court appearances that he's made up to now, except for maybe one, I believe, was testimony in New York were mandatory. These are choices he is making. So we haven't even gotten to the point where he is required to sit through some of those trials.",

If you look at the breakdown of states in our electoral college outlook today, what you see here is Donald Trump with 272 electoral votes based on the states that are either solidly in his corner or leaning in his direction, Joe Biden down to 225 electoral votes with the blue states that are either deep blue, solid lean in his direction, or the light blue, leaning his way, and you've got these yellow states that are true toss-ups in this race right now, Phil. Again, I think that shows three things. One, this is going to be an extraordinarily close presidential race again. Joe Biden is struggling at this start of the year to recreate his victorious coalition on the electoral map from 2020, and that Donald Trump is indeed as a potential Republican nominee, very much in the hunt for a return to the White House.",

So it is not impossible to imagine that Joe Biden will have some of these states that he won last time come back into more competitive territory.

I think it has the opposite impact with Republican primary voters because they're just not listening to that message, but I think it does.This is a message, I think that could be a winning message. I think it's smart for the Biden campaign to focus on that, on January 6th. Look, I was the next door governor getting the desperate calls from leaders of Congress to come save the Capitol from the insurrection and send in the Maryland National Guard, and the Maryland State Police first ones to arrive and I said something very similar to that the day after January 6th. So I think that there are plenty of people in the middle, Republican, Democrat, and independent, who do believe this was an assault on our democracy, one of the worst days in American history, and I think reminding people of what that was like, but we're not -- you're not going to swing the Trump voters. They just are not. I don't know how it happens, but they just believe it was, you know, friendly tourists at the Capitol and nothing bad happened and Trump didn't incite a riot. But I think -- and when you get to the general election, it has complete opposite effect in a primary. It pumps them up. In a general election, I think that's going to be a very winning message.",
