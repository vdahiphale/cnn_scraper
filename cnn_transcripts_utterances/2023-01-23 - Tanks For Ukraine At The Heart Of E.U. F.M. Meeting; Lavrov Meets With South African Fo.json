We are live in Monterey Park. And as China rings in the Lunar New Year, the government reports thousands more COVID-related deaths. We have a live report. I'm Eleni Giokos. Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. A furious war saw has some strong words for Berlin and what looks like an action plan to try to end the holdup in sending modern battle tanks to Ukraine after telling Germany it's wasting time. Poland is indicating it plans to send German- made Leopard 2 tanks to the battlefield. If it can build what it calls a small coalition of countries willing to do the same. Berlin remains hesitant to supply the tanks from its own arsenal, and has not given explicit consent for other countries to export them. The news comes as E.U. foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels today to discuss their support for Ukraine. Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen is standing by live in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Fred Germany has alluded to the fact that it won't stop other countries from sending those Leopard 2 tanks, but it also won't sign off on countries doing so. Could Poland's plan to build this coalition shift Germany stance?",

And the question is really whether or notthe poles are actually going to be able to put together a coalition like that that would essentially send main battle tanks to Ukraine without the consent of the country that manufacture those main battle tanks. That usually isn't the way things work when you look at the way that arms are provided to countries that are manufactured in other countries. Nevertheless, the Germans also saying that they're working to get out of this impasse. It was quite interesting I was messaging with a senior member inside the German government a little earlier. And they're saying they want a broader coalition in all of this. They want more consensus and they want more close international cooperation, especially with the United States. Now, essentially what that means is that the Germans still want the U.S. to send American-made Abrams main battle tanks to Ukraine if the Germans are going to sign off on the Leopard 2 being sent to Ukraine and possibly sending leper to themselves. Now Eleni we know that the U.S. has said they are not going to be sending those Abram tanks, they don't believe that they're suited for the battlefields here in Ukraine, because they take a lot of fuel. They're also very difficult to maintain because they have a turbine engine, which is obviously a lot more complicated than the diesel engine that the Leopards would use. However, they seem to be trying to work out an impasse with Berlin to try and make it happen somehow in the not-too-distant future. Nevertheless, as you said, the poled absolutely ripping into the Germans throughout the better part of the day. There were some quotes from the Polish Prime Minister where he said that Poland would not allow Ukraine to bleed to death essentially, while the Germans are still holding things up. I want to listen to part of Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish Prime Minister had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, PRIME MINISTER OF POLAND (through translator):  We will apply for such consent. But this is a secondary topic. Even if we did not get this consent in the end as part of a small coalition. If the Germans were not in this coalition, we will still hand over our tanks together with others to Ukraine. The condition for us at the moment is to build at least such a small coalition of states. And on this issue, together with Mr. President Duda. Mr. Deputy Prime Minister Blaszczak, we're contacting our partners in Western Europe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That interview coming up in the next hour. So, Russia's Foreign Minister says his country's so-called special military operation was discussed today. When he met his South-African counterparts in Pretoria, Sergei Lavrov's visit to South Africa is sparking criticism. South Africa has not condemned Russia's war in Ukraine, and has officially taken a neutral stance. This visit comes days after South Africa announced it will host joint maritime military drills with Russia and China in February. The foundation of late South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu calls the planned exercises disgraceful. We've got CNN's David McKenzie joining us from Johannesburg. David, good to see you. Look, this visit underscores the strength of political and economic relations between these two countries. Why is South Africa taking this stance?",

And prior to that, the Soviet Union and the foreign minister of South Africa calling the meetings \"wonderful.\" Sergey Lavrov was here at the invitation of the South Africans. And well, as you say, South Africa says that they keep a neutral stance on this conflict. And the official line is that they want negotiations between the two sides at the U.N. or a similar multilateral institution to solve this conflict. There is deep criticism, both from opposition leaders here from the Tutu Foundation, as you mentioned, and others that by just having Sergey Lavrov here and having these substantive talks, South Africa is in the words of one critic siding with the Russians. But repeatedly, the South African leadership says they can talk to whoever they want, and they shouldn't be pressured in not having the stance and not specifically criticizing the Russians. You had the Russian Foreign Minister repeating exaggerated and one might say completely unfounded claims that the Russians are not targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. And just this platform for Sergey Lavrov does make an impact on the what the President Biden and others wants to be a united front criticizing Russia. So, it is important, this meeting.",

This is a situation we have not seen before in this country. And they found even more classified records than President Biden's own staff had found this winter when they look. So, six more items and surrounding materials from both Joe Biden's tenure as a senator as well as his vice presidency which ended in 2017. These items are in addition to classified records that were being kept in his garage in Delaware after the vice presidency and in an office he kept in Washington, all of which had been given back to the government in the past few months. The White House now is repeatedly emphasizing how cooperative Joe Biden has been toward investigators in this situation. This search on Friday, it was voluntary, it was not under a court order. And a spokesperson from the White House was saying this weekend that the President and his lawyers offered up unprecedented access to every room of Biden's personal home so that documents will go back into the hands of the federal government. Now, that situation means that Biden's legal risk going forward may be minimal because of the level of cooperation he's giving. And it certainly is different than the much more standoffish approach from former President Donald Trump toward federal investigators wanting to secure records he had in Florida, at his beach club. But this situation is certainly prompting political criticism of Biden across Washington from Democrats as well as Republicans. A lot of concern from lawmakers over how national security records are handled and kept.

He says that makes the possibility of a big wave of COVID cases in the coming months small. Let's bring in Marc Stewart who is live for us in Hong Kong.

But for this moment, during this Lunar New Year holiday, people seem to be on the move. They are going to big cities such as Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou. And in those big cities, as far as resources, an important point that you brought up, there seems to be medical treatment and personnel there to take care of people. The question is, when they leave these big metropolitan areas and go into more remote areas, will they get the same kind of care they need? If indeed, so many people are sick with COVID or have been dealing with COVID. Also, along the resource question, pharmaceuticals, are people able to get drugs? About 10 days ago, we did some reporting. And we found out that in many parts of China, there are some struggles. People are looking to legitimate sources such as E-commerce sites, many drug makers, pharmaceutical makers said they are ramping up production. But there's also still a black-market element to all of this as well.
