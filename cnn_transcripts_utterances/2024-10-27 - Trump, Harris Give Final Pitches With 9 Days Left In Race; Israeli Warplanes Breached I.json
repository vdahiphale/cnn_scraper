Soon Trump will speak at a rally in his hometown as he campaigns in the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York City. Meantime, his political rival, Vice President Kamala Harris is campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania. That's where she will speak at a campaign event any moment as well. And instead of holding a big rally in an arena, she's making several stops in Philly's black and Latino neighborhoods and targeting male voters. We have a team of correspondents covering today's election developments. Priscilla Alvarez is with the Harris campaign. She is in Philly. But let's begin with Kristen Holmes. She's at that Trump rally in Madison Square Garden. So, Kristen, talk to us a bit about what's it like there, set the stage. What are you seeing? And what can we expect?",

Since then he has had his own decline and legal issues, most recently, that he was ordered to give overall valuables and his penthouse apartment to some of the Georgia election workers that he had defamed.But what we're seeing really at this rally overall is that they're treating this like a second RNC. Like a Donald Trump homecoming. They have filled almost every seat here. It's about 20,000 seats at Madison Square Garden. Then they are treating this as a celebration, really a kickoff of the last week of campaigning ahead of the election. Keep in mind, New York is a solid blue state. If you talk to any of Trump's senior advisers or Republicans, they don't believe Donald Trump is going to win this state. So that's not why he's here, although the former president himself has said he thinks he has a chance of winning. They're here instead to kind of mark the end of this campaign. Now we have been told that Donald Trump is going to make part of his closing pitch here, that he is looking forward, that Kamala Harris is looking backward, but it's also so Donald Trump. So we take a lot of that with a grain of salt. We'll wait and see what he actually says when he takes the stage. The other big part of this to know is that this is going to serve as one of the largest fundraisers for the former president that we've seen yet. They have been selling packages for the last several weeks that include VIP suites, meeting with Donald Trump, a roundtable, photo opportunity for him, and they are planning on raising quite a bit money from this. So overall, that's what they'll get out of it. But for the former president himself, it's something that he has wanted to do for a long time. It serves as sort of a homecoming. Even the people closest to him, they were working on this for months. They did not think it was going to happen, particularly given the politics of New York City. They just thought there were going to be too much of a hurdle to climb. But here we are today. And of course well keep an ear to the ground listening to Donald Trump to see what he says and what he really remarks on, what he focuses on, as we head into this final week before election day.",

She then went to a barbershop for a moderated conversation followed by a bookstore. And then here at this community center, she met with young basketball players and this was their message to her.

Margaret, good to see you again. So we're less than about an hour from Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden. What's your sense of this? I mean, do you think this is just an opportunity for Trump to create buzz in his hometown, a bucket list as it's been called, the bucket list item, or is this an effective way to reach voters in swing states who may just tune in to see what will happen?",

But as the availability of local news has declined, increasingly people get their information about presidential elections, even in their own hometown from national media, whether it's on social media, whether it's cable TV or a digital news organization.And so the reality is, if you can pack 20,000 people into an arena, he will try to do or if you can put 20,000 people on the Ellipse as we're going to see Vice President Harris do in a few days, that is going to become a big story. It's going to generate a lot of headlines and people in other states in Florida and North Carolina and, you know, Arizona will also be seeing that coverage. And I think a huge part of former president Trump's strategy is not just in the culture wars space, but is in the pop culture space. His ability to do kind of TV scale events, \"Apprentice\" like productions, he thinks really speaks to his base and people think, well, anyone who could pack Madison Square Garden, you know, must have a big following.

But also this is very different than what you would see from Joe Biden, who really has always sort of suggested, he's going to go old school and take the high road and believes in diplomacy and outreach across the aisle. She's saying, you know what, I'm going to meet Trump where he is andI'm going for it. I'm going to proverbially (INAUDIBLE) him with voters. And so we'll see if it works.

This is certainly a hat tip to that. It's going to be a reminder to people of that and to say if you elect him again, all of that could happen again.But it's also, the Ellipse is right behind the White House and it's her way of saying, look, I'm here, I am presidential metal. I am already governing. We'll see if people respond on both fronts. I think a lot of people want to hear about her and about what she's going to do about inflation. But this will hit a certain audience and for both candidates there are so much culture war campaigning right now, whether it's president -- former president Trump's anti-transgender ads on football games, or Vice President Harris, you know, going to the Ellipse to make the January 6th argument. Everyone -- voters say they want to hear about the economy. We're going to see a lot of culture wars and cultural kind of stoking to turn out the final votes.",

Sources tell me that as part of this elaborate and quite largescale attack by Israel on Iran involving some 100 warplanes, that some of those Israeli jets breached Iranian airspace to carry out these attacks. Not all of them, many fired from a distance, but some breached the airspace.We already knew that it was a multi-level of attack that included taking out air defenses, not just in Iran but also in Iraq and Syria, and then striking multiple targets inside Iran, including around the Iranian capital Tehran. So it's a long-range attack. It's an elaborate attack. It required refueling in the air given the distances from Israel to Iran, and that shows you Israel's capabilities, which, by the way, might very well be part of the messaging here, right, from Israel to Iran to say, here's what we struck for now, largely military targets, but we have the capability of striking more, even potentially nuclear sites or oil facilities. And a short time ago I spoke to a former spokesperson for the IDF who said that that was quite explicitly part of the message here, to show, one, that Israel is capable of these strikes and that it took out defensive positions, that it could take advantage of in the future. And that is, it just shows you, Rahel, that while this phase of this war may have passed for now, it's certainly hasn't closed off the possibilities of further strikes that would expand the direct confrontation between Israel and Iran.",

They also announced today that five more Israeli soldiers died in fighting in southern Lebanon.So this operation in Lebanon, which you'll remember began a number of weeks ago, described as limited, has proven to be not quite so limited in recent weeks. You have a significant number of Israeli ground forces in southern Lebanon moving forward and encountering serious resistance. And that's of course in addition to the air campaign that's still underway in Lebanon, striking targets across the country. This is a multifront war, Rahel, in Gaza, in Lebanon, in Iran, strikes in Syria and Iraq as well, and there was even a strike a number of weeks ago by Israel inside Yemen.

But I'll tell you. This is my fourth time in Israel since the October 7th attacks. And one thing I've noticed is that attacks inside Israel have been increasing.When I was here last time, you may remember there was that shooting by the tram station, killed half a dozen people. On my previous trip, there was a suicide bomber in Tel Aviv whose explosive blew up before he was apparently able to reach his target. You have this attack using a vehicle and you had the stabbing attack as well as others. It shows that terror attacks inside this country, perhaps in response to the military activity we've seen in Gaza and elsewhere, are increasing in number, that the threat here is one that had been forgotten gotten for some time. Those attacks have been fewer and further between. But again, I think you could reasonably describe that as another front in this war, right?
