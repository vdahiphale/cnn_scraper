And once again, the man the candidates are all trying to beat isn't there. Donald Trump planning his own campaign event in Iowa as he does like to do. A recent poll had Trump with 43 percent of Iowa caucus goers. We have CNN's Alayna Treene following the action in Iowa. Are you getting any early reaction to his no show?",

All right, so Joe, I'm going to start with you. You've run for president before, including in the Iowa caucuses. So you have interesting perspective. First of all, what is the significance of today's family forum in Des Moines, the one that Trump is skipping.JOE WALSH, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (R-IL): Well, it's a huge deal because as Alice knows, it is in evangelical state. That is predominantly what the Republican vote is in that state. But I'm struck, Pamela, by Trump's not there again, and it doesn't matter. Republican voters are still with him. It's his party. He hasn't been at a debate, and here we are, two to three months later, that strategy of Trump's -- if he does strategy -- has worked.",

And as Joe knows, this is not a debate. This is a conversation with the candidates. And the thing about people in Iowa, they want to talk with these candidates one-on-one once or twice in their living rooms, in their coffee shops. And many of these candidates are trying to do so. They're doing the full Grassley. Visiting all 99 counties. But what tonight is about, it's not as much about policy. It's about finding out what's in their hearts. And nothing will help a voter connect with someone more than finding about their character. So this is going to be -- the temperature is going to be much lower at this event. But it's a good way for them to show where they stand personally on a lot of these issues. Bob Vander Plaats, who is hosting this event, has supported all the caucus winners for as far back as I can remember. And everyone that I won. And he says this is about showing what's inside the character of these people. But it's also an opportunity to show a stark contrast with Donald Trump. He doesn't think Donald Trump is the candidate for the Republican Party in the general, so he wants to show a contrast so people can look at, here's the alternative and time to turn the page.",

Telling a podcast that she did it because the coach wouldn't come out at halftime or it was too late and she didn't want to screw up her report.Well, now Thompson is apologizing in a post on Instagram today and trying to walk back the admission. She says: I have never lied about anything or been unethical during my time as a sports broadcaster. In the absence of a coach providing any information that could further my report I would use information that I learned and saw during the first half to create my report. And she goes on to say, quote: In these instances I never attributed anything I said to a player or coach. Joining us now we have Christine Brennan. She is a CNN sports analyst and a sports columnist for USA TODAY. What do you make of her admission and then this attempt for clarification?",

They're great reporters. They do everything right. And she has discredited them.And yes, she has apologized. But the fact that last night she was the host of the Amazon Prime broadcast and had that national forum to at that point, knowing this thing is just exploding, to say, hey, I blew it. I'm sorry. And say what, what you just read that she said. Instead she waits 12 more hours. I think that's unconscionable. And it's just a shame. Because instead of talking about all the great things about women in sports media, breaking barriers, ceilings, et cetera. Something I've cared about very much and worked very hard for, for years. We're now talking about this. Which is not reflective of the wonderful women and men in sports media who I know and work with.",

It wasn't if I did something. She did do a full apology. The story that she says is very different from what she said on podcast when she was just, you know, yucking it up and having a great time and telling these stories. The damage that she has done is for her -- to herself and her reputation. I mean, who can believe anything she says?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The RSF said leave these ones. We will find better ones to sell. These ones, let's rape them. ELBAGIR (voice-over): Textbook ethnic cleansing. These are the hallmarks of genocide. We interviewed over a dozen survivors and eyewitnesses who witnessed the abduction of at least 200 other girls. Through their testimony, we were able to pinpoint key neighborhoods in Al Geneina where civilians were targeted and where women were being sold from slave houses. Places like al-Jabal, and Hala and Al-Zahra dormitory where survivors say they counted 75 girls abducted in one fell swoop. There is nowhere safe in Al Geneina. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

How does this compare?ELBAGIR (on camera): It is so much worse because the lesson that has been learned by these forces, whose leadership were involved in a previous genocide on the same people in the same region, is that they were not held accountable. And so this time they are unleashed. The idea that one region, in one country, could see two genocides potentially within the same century, within just two decades.
