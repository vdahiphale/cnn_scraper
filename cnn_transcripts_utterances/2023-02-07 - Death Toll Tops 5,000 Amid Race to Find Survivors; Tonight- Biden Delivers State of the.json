I'm Christine Romans.We begin with the race to find survivors in Turkey and Syria, more than 24 hours after an earthquake that has killed more than 5,000 people in the two countries. The 7.8 magnitude quake and its powerful aftershocks collapsing more than 5,000 buildings. The structure falling tragically faster than people can escape. Aftershocks were still creating treacherous conditions for rescuers, who are trying to reach victims, trapped in all of that rubble. A massive international rescue effort is now underway. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is live for us in Istanbul. Salma, unfortunately, that death toll is expected to rise.",

You have these rolling pictures right now on Turkish television, 24 hours of the search and rescue operations. As you see, people are trying to dig through the rubble, families are standing by, listing member after member that is missing. It is those families the Turkish authorities are desperate to bring answers to.Absolutely, this is the critical window right now, Christine. This is the 24 to 48 hours after the earthquake, where there is still a glimmer of hope, that there might be survivors, trapped under their homes. But the search and rescue operations face major challenges. You mentioned those aftershocks. There has been at least 100 of them so far, in this particular area of southern Turkey, some of the buildings are not stable. That means even after the aftershocks, there are concerns that these buildings could collapse, this means people, many of them have spent the night on the streets, in the freezing cold with no food, no water, no aid and no shelter. And in the early hours, we started to see dozens of rescue workers, these promised search teams coming from countries around the world, coming with that specialist equipment that Turkey so desperately needs, and does not have enough of. Yet, another challenge is the weather. We have had these huge storms, snow, rain, sleet, sweeping through the region, making it difficult to access roads, difficult to get equipment into those affected areas. Still, the search and rescue operations are working around the clock. Just for context, the last time Turkey had an earthquake of this magnitude, it was 1939, when some 30,000 people died. So, absolutely a critical moment here. You can feel the country holding its breath, waiting to find out more about the missing. Further south of course, in Syria, the situation there is even more dire. It is hard to imagine a more vulnerable population being struck by yet another catastrophe. Northwestern Syria, of course, where infrastructure is largely damaged and destroyed. Absolutely tragic to think how those search and rescue operations will continue, when that part of the world is so cut off from the aid we see from the international community pouring here into Turkey, over here.",

He told reporters yesterday he had not amended his speech after that Chinese spy balloon really traverse the U.S. But, of course, China is a big topic for the president. Not only does it structure its foreign policy, but also some of his domestic policies. We are likely to hear about that.

The last thing I will say on this is that the difference over here, that he will face this year, not last year, is who will be seated behind him? House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be in Nancy Pelosi's place, really, as a symbol to the fact that he will now have to deal with a divided Congress.

It was used for spy craft.According to the White House, they said that on this Chinese balloon, they were able to find propellers as well as an aerial rudder that gave it limited maneuverability. Now, earlier, China condemned the U.S. for shooting its balloon down, calling it an overreaction. China also said it reserves the right to deal with similar situations, but earlier today at a briefing of the ministry for foreign affairs, we have most folks woman who said that the debris from the balloon that was shot down belongs to China. Bring up the court for you, according to the spokeswoman, she said the airship is China's, not the U.S.'s. She goes on to say the United States should have handled it properly in a calm, professional, non- forceful manner. But it's insistence on using force is a clear overreaction, unquote. Now, the Chinese balloon, it caused a political uproar in the United States, it prompted the U.S. secretary of state to cancel his planned February visit.
