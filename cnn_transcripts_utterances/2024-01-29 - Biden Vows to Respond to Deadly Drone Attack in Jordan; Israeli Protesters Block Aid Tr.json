President Biden was on the road in South Carolina as this was all unfolding, briefed by his national security team, including the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. And you can imagine in those discussions, a talk about how to respond in a way that would deter these attacks from happening again. But also the imperative to prevent this conflict from spreading even further. And at the end of the day, President Biden does have quite a consequential choice to make here. He is coming under pressure from some Republicans to respond directly in Iran to some of these attacks. But certainly, the imperative inside the White House has been to prevent this conflict from broadening. And the fear among American officials as these attacks had proceeded on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, is that it would eventually result in fatalities. Now that that fear has been realized, the decision President Biden has is how to respond so that it doesn't happen again. And certainly, he will be making that decision over the coming days. But in a statement, President Biden saying that \"The three American service members we lost her patriots in the highest sense. And their ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten by our nation. Together, we will keep the sacred obligation we bear to their families.\" Now at the same time, the president is dispatching his top intelligence official, Bill Burns, to France for talks with his counterparts from Egypt and Israel on these hostage negotiations. Certainly, the hope among American officials is that these will be fruitful in securing the release of all of the remaining hostages in Gaza, paired with a prolonged cessation of hostilities. And really, the hope had been that this pause in the fighting could cause some space for American officials and Israeli officials, along with their counterparts in the region, to come up with a plan to end this conflict permanently.

You've got the war in Gaza, which many in the region see the U.S. as a partner in with Israel.They got clashes on the Lebanese border. The Houthi missiles are flying; these clashes in Syria and Iraq. There's talk of the risk of a regional war but is a low-level regional war already underway. No, I don't think so, Michael. And I'm going to revert back to what you've experienced. I mean, you've been in this region multiple times. Everyone's counting the 160 strikes or so that have happened since October the seventh, when Hamas invaded or, you know, conducted terrorist attacks inside of Israel. What we have to remember is this has been going on for a lot longer than that. Years of popular mobilization forces, the -- the proxies of the Iranian government had been conducting multiple strikes against not only the U.S. but also the Iraqi government. They have been fighting hard, not just against ISIS in Syria, but also against the curves the United States and anyone else is trying to tamp down ISIS. So this is an opportunity for Iran to use their proxy forces. And by the way, let me state for the record, Iran could care less about the -- any casualties that occur with the Houthis or the PMFs, or Hezbollah, or Hamas. They just know this is an opportunity to continue to conduct strikes against the West, against the United States, because they don't want the U.S. forces in any of these Middle Eastern countries. So this has been going on for a long time. You know that. Yes, President Biden said a couple of weeks ago before all of this, that after one of the -- one of the sites, he said that he delivered a message to Iran. And he said, quote, they know not to do anything. Well, here we are.

The only thing that might cause a shift if the United States released pretty decisive intelligence, saying this is what we have. We have communication between the Iranian government and these forces. We have some type of action where we detected the supply of weapons or the Quds Force from Iran, actually leading some of these forces. If there was solid proof that could be made available to the Middle East. First of all, it may change things, but truthfully, as you know, it may not either. I mean, there's so much of a misinformation, misdirection campaign going on with these forces than it may be difficult, even if the truth is released with hardcore intelligence to sway some of the voices in the Middle East that are supporting these forces.

It's all for shock value: a tactic used by climate or anti-oil groups to get attention. But to many people, it's a baffling, if not infuriating disruption. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I really don't see the link. I'm not shocked for the Mona Lisa. I'm not worried for her, because she's ultra protected. But then I don't see the link with food, other than the fact that the Mona Lisa is internationally recognized. So we'll definitely hear about this. HOLMES (voice-over): The Mona Lisa has survived the centuries. It's been stolen, attacked with acid, had objects thrown at it. So a dowsing of soup and a canned message by activists only puts the spotlight back on it. A masterclass in capturing the public's attention, something with which no gimmick or cheap trick can compare. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
