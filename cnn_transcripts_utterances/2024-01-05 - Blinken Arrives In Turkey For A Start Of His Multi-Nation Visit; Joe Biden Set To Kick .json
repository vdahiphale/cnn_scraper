      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, high stakes diplomacy in the Middle Eastas the U.S. Secretary of State arrives in Turkey for the start of his multi-nation visit. Tonight, I speak to the French Foreign Minister on fears of a wider regional war. Then, in the next hour, U.S. President Joe Biden expected to make a major speech, unofficially kicking off his 2024 presidential campaign. We'll have much more on that, of course. Plus, former Olympic sprinter and convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius has been released on parole from prison in South Africa. We take a look back at the case that drew global attention. But this evening, we begin with two high stakes trips aimed at keeping the Israel-Hamas conflict from spiraling into an all-out regional war. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Turkey a few hours ago. The first stop on a week-long tour that would also take him to Israel, the West Bank, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and more. The State Department says it doesn't expect every conversation to be easy, but quote, \"it's no one's interest for the war in Gaza to spread. Also today on the diplomacy front, the EU Foreign Policy chief is due in Lebanon to discuss the extremely tense situation along the Israeli border. The EU says Josep Borrell would meet with government as well as military officials, stressing the need to avoid any regional escalation. Well, meantime, there is no end to the war in Gaza, but heated discussions already underway in Israel about the day after. Two far-right ministers are openly calling for Palestinians to leave Gaza, drawing accusations they are encouraging ethnic cleansing. They are at odds with Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who has unveiled plans for a post-war administration of the Palestinian territory. But the disagreements don't stop there. Today, we are learning about more internal divisions within Israel's security cabinet after reports of a verbal fight were leaked. Let's get more on all these trends that we've been following. Alex Marquardt is in Washington for us, and Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. Good evening to you both. Alex, let me start with you, this visit, of course, by Secretary Blinken, clearly he's walking into an atmosphere as we just outlined there, Alex, of heightened tensions and concern that this conflict could expand. That of course, let's not forget about the continuing dire situation in Gaza. What will the secretary want to walk away with here, Alex?",

Continuation of U.S. pressure for Israel. I think it's really quite telling, Isa, that the State Department has not said what they hope to accomplish, what their concrete goals may be, and it is probably because of what you said. Those tough conversations, it's unclear whether they will be able to come away with what diplomats call deliverables. But no doubt, the centerpiece of this trip, which is nine stops, is going to be those conversations with Israeli leaders, and there will be a continuation of what the U.S. has been pushing for, more of a focus on civilian casualties, which of course are mounting in Gaza by the hour. More of -- more humanitarian aid getting in, and being able to be distributed across the Gaza Strip, which of course is extremely difficult because of the war that Israel is fighting against Hamas, and then it is going to be questions that the U.S. will be posing --",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think there are sort of two divisions, if you will, that came into focus today. There isthe one that you are speaking about, the Defense Minister put forward a three-page document and he talked about the phase 3 in Gaza in the north and the south and different military operations. And then a phase 4, the sort of day after where there would be no terror threats from Hamas, that there would be some kind of unnamed, un-described, un-detailed Palestinian governments, but actually, there would be effectively an Israeli military presence and an ability to carry out military operations, you know, Israeli civilian presence inside Gaza, and the main humanitarian rebuilding effort would be coordinated through the United States regional allies and European partners. His critics, the Defense Minister's critics in the right wing are saying that actually, this is just like the day before, it's not the day after, and they're calling for more out-of-the-box thinking, voluntary relocation of some people from Gaza, some Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. That's something that's been heavily-criticized by the United States. But it does show an emerging fault line in the government and emerging tensions, and that raises the questions about how long will this unity government last. And I think that's where another one of the fault lines come into view here. There was a heated debate last night in the Knesset when the -- there was discussion over the military army chief of staff laying out a plan to examine the mistakes that led up to October 7th. A military assessment so that they get operational information that would be useful now. But there were politicians that criticize that, because of course, there's this military political tension over should the military get ahead of it? Should the -- should the politicians be leading the way on a review of everything that went wrong, because there will be political blame to come. And it took the defense ministers to come to the support now of the army chief of staff saying its supporters need to be strong. But the member of the opposition, Benny Gantz who had come into this unity government, and here's the key piece here and come into the unity war cabinet, said, look, Prime Minister Netanyahu needs to get a grip, he's either going to be involved in politicking, which is essentially how he described this criticism of the investigation, et cetera, or we're going to have unity and security. So, you can see these fissures, and there are several of them, and they're all just below the surface, emerging, which brings into question how long will this government unity hold together.",

So the -- it is a very desperate humanitarian picture. The United States point is that not enough aid is getting in, it's not getting in a coordinated-enough way, it's not getting around the country. We've had the Palestinian Red Crescent there saying today that their medical facility -- there was Israeli artillery strikes close to that, today, the Israelis say they've hit a 100 targets. They've been targeted in some places by Hamas.

We have -- we have been very preoccupied with it. We are thinking about taking measures. France has deployed a frigate in the region, and we must intervene against the Houthi drones. We must gain responsibility of the situation, and our objective is to safeguard liberty of circulation, Maritime liberty of circulation. But since the beginning, France has said it wants to have its own autonomy in terms of decision-making, but we work in perfect coordination with our partners. There is also the situation in Iraq where militias -- pro Iranian militias are fighting against American soldiers. Therefore, we must respond to these attacks, and there is the situation north of Israel and the south of Lebanon. I have been four times to the region since October, two times in Israel, and two times in Lebanon, to say to both Hezbollah through official channels, and also in Israel with our colleagues there. Everybody must refrain from all actions that will escalate the situation, and nobody will benefit from this, so it's better to hold back. I say one more thing, we must abstain, which will escalate, but we must also try and find every solution.

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden's advisors tell me that they really view this speech as setting thefoundational argument for the president's re-election campaign. The president is set to warn that democracy is under threat, and that former President Donald Trump is the major reason why. They've picked the anniversary of the January 6th insurrection, because they believe that this is an issue that still resonates with voters. And they believe that it also will be a moment of reckoning heading into the 2024 election. The president is expected to speak in very stark terms about January 6th. The political violence that surrounded it, as well as what he sees as the former president's role in that event. But the president is also giving the speech here against the backdrop of a very historical site in American history. We are just a few miles away from Valley Forge. That is where George Washington commanded his troops during a very long Winter as they prepared for fighting for this democracy. And in his remarks, the president is going to really draw from Washington's words and the symbolism of the site. The president is currently there, touring Valley Forge, taking a look at George Washington's headquarters. And according to some excerpts from the campaign, the president is really going to draw on a very specific phrase that Washington used to describe the resolve and mission of his troops. That is describing the pursuit of democracy as a, quote, \"sacred cause\". Now, President Biden in his remarks is expected to say, quote, \"today, we are here to answer the most important of questions. Is -- apologies -- is democracy still America's sacred cause? This isn't rhetorical, academic or hypothetical. Whether democracy is still America's secret cause is the most urgent question of our time. It is what the 2024 election is all about. The Biden campaign really views this issue of democracy as not   being a sideline issue, but the central issue of this campaign. They have been quite eager to start ramping up their attacks, to contrast with the former president at a time when the Republican primary is about to kick off in just less than two weeks. And the campaign believes that this is a time when voters will start to be paying a bit more attention. They want to really emphasize this democracy threat that they see as this campaign is unfolding. And they're really treating this speech today as the opening salvo of that moment.",

We've heard almost every day since January 6th that the FBI had a role in this, and that the CIA was involved, and the military was helping the insurgents who really weren't Trump people. Everyone who was there, everyone, everyone who was watching on television knows that's not true.

The third round of documents has just beenunsealed in the 2015 civil lawsuit connected to Jeffrey Epstein. He is, of course, the convicted pedophiles who died in jail before he could face trial on federal sex trafficking charges. CNN is right now digging through the documents and, of course, will report on what they can contain. Among the developments from documents released on Thursday, an accuse they're alleging former U.S. President Bill Clinton pressured Vanity Fair magazine not to write sex trafficking stories about Epstein. The magazine's former editor said that, \"categorically did not happen.\" Of course, we'll have much more on that as we keep -- as we go through all those documents. Meantime, tensions are heightened on the Korean peninsula after North Korea fired roughly 200 artillery shells into a maritime buffer zone early on Friday. The South Korean military called it provocative act and responded with its own exercise of naval fire. People on South Korea's northwestern islands were asked to shelter while that took place. China is calling for calm, asking both parties to exercise restraint. And now to our Think Big series, figuring out what you have to have for dinner used to feel like a chore, that still is for me. But the era of smartphones and food delivery apps made the process a lot more convenient. And now, one company in Dubai is taking things a step further, exploring innovative ways to shift towards a cleaner future. Look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
