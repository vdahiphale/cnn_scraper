Aunt Nora, a passionate prize-winning pickleball playing prodigy giving us some tips on how to dominate in the fastest growing sport in America via her niece, CNN senior producer Janelle Davis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JANELLE DAVIS, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER (voice-over):  Pickleball is the fastest growing U.S. sport with about 5 million players. This addicting game is a mashup of tennis, ping pong and badminton. I even got hooked and I`m lucky to take my game to the next level. Lucky for me, I have a national competitor in my family.

DAVIS:  She lives in Washington state, the birthplace of pickleball and here are her three tips to take your game to the next level. Number one: add spin to your dink. Okay let`s back up for the newbies watching. This part of the court is the non-volley zone, known as the kitchen. Experienced players keep the ball low and get in an offensive position near the kitchen, giving your opponent less time to react. Shots for this is called the dink, a short soft hit into your opponent`s kitchen. Here`s how it`s done -- N. DAVIS:  You`re going to get low and then you`re going to come up and lift it like you would. But instead of stopping right there, you`re going to roll your hand forward. J. DAVIS:  That spin makes your shots lethal. To practice, play a game starting near the kitchen hitting dinks back and forth, keep it low and slow. You`ll learn accuracy and patience. N. DAVIS:  You need to have a lot of patience with your dink shots. Your opponent will make a mistake before you do if you have patience. J. DAVIS:  Number two, master the drop shot, one of the hardest shots. The drop is a soft hit from deep in the court that drops into your opponent`s kitchen, allowing you to explode towards the net and go on the attack. N. DAVIS:  To do the drop shot, you want to get low and lift just to your chest. J. DAVIS:  You`ll need a loose grip, control swing and to get low, being short like my eye helps too. Number three, time your split step. That`s the ready position. You don`t want to be moving as you hit the ball. You want to be stabilized. The best players can predict where the ball is going and quickly position themselves for the return. Now, you`re ready to play. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
