After the video went public, the sheriff here in the Shelby County put out a statement, saying he learned two of his deputies were on scene that night.And as a result of that, because of this video becoming public, he's placed those deputies on leave. So it's two sheriff's deputies that are now on leave. And of course, you know, we're learning more about this SCORPION unit, the team that these officers were part of. The family calling for them to be disbanded. Well, the mayor and police department here saying that that unit for right now is not operating in this city. They have sort of suspended their operations while they continue their investigation. But they're not outright going to say at this point that they're going to disband this unit. They're blaming the problems on these officers and not the unit. The other thing throughout this and, of course, watching this video, Laura, are the EMTs, the medics on scene, how long it took for them to offer Tyre Nichols any kind of help. For minutes and minutes he laid there, bleeding after being brutally beaten. The questions, of course, about those EMTs and the other officers who were on scene and the continued investigation, where it appears so much more to come.",

There has been peaceful protests and calm in the city of Memphis tonight, which is in line with the wishes of Tyre Nichols' mother. Can you tell us what the community is feeling and what you're seeing this evening? MICHALYN EASTER-THOMAS, MEMPHIS CITY COUNCIL: Yes, Laura. As you say, the world is watching and everything tonight has been, in my eyes, beautiful, not only because it was peaceful but because it was direct. It was focused. It was bringing Memphis together as we always do and it's calling for accountability for local leaders such as myself and those who we send to the state legislature to really have an impact on how we treat our accountability and efficiency of our law enforcement.

What is the community's and your reaction to seeing a greater police presence than initially thought? EASTER-THOMAS:  It's disheartening on two ends. One, that many more people decided not to help Mr. Nichols. That many more people decided to on look and not offer any aid or stop what was going on. And that many more people were (INAUDIBLE) in the murder and the killing of Mr. Tyre Nichols. And so I think that that causes further investigation from the city side of why this information was not made known public before the release of video. And so I, along with other community members and leaders and activists, are wondering what's currently happening? I counted nine individuals in the video. I might be off but, if at one point in the second elongated video, I counted nine individuals. And so we want to know the names and roles of those nine and what's happening with them as well.",

This is your hometown community as well. When you're watching it, based on -- you train officers well and your work as a sociologist, what was your impression, now that you have seen this video and the presence of more than five officers on that scene? DR. RASHAWN RAY, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND:  Well, yes, I'm a native Tennessean. I went to the University of Memphis, training police officers, working with hundreds of them, the big thing that stood out to me is, I'm wondering is culture is actually reformable. We're talking about policy change. I think that's a big movement we're seeing in Memphis, people are protesting, saying, look, we're holding our legislators accountable, which is different from saying we're just going to hold law enforcement accountable. People are recognizing that lawmakers actually make the laws but we need culture to change. And policy can do a lot but culture is something different. When I watched that video and saw the lack of duty to intervene, it highlighted what I always say about how bad apples come from rotten trees. They were focusing on these five individuals but it's very clear that there is a structural link (ph) at play, not just in the Memphis Police Department but in other police departments around the country.",

What I see play out time and time and time again in these types of situations -- and, you know, some of them I'm sure there's a racial component there.

What happens is you get these individuals that come in, who are highly problematic, who people know are problematic. In this case, people who might have came (sic) from corrections to police departments or from other units to this unit and they get passed by, the buck just gets passed around until these particular incidents happen. So it is a lack of humanity but it is also a lack of a structural issue at play within police departments. So when I hear Chief Davis make statement like, essentially that we have a leadership problem, that suggests to me not only is it about humanity but it's about the fact we have a leaky pipeline that allowed unqualified individuals, morally, from a humanity standpoint, to even be police officers in the first place.",

We don't know exactly what happened because it's a bit of a mess. What we do know is we have video. What I can say with certainty -- to me -- I've been saying this a long time -- there's probably no greater reform and frankly simpler reform that law enforcement can pursue than putting body cams on every officer and making those videos available. And for two big reasons. It's not just for locking up dirty cops or bad cops; it's for exonerating people, who have not done anything wrong. So everybody, whether it's the public, whether it's people accused of crimes or whether it's cops accused of brutality, everybody benefits from having like a camera on. Because if you haven't done anything wrong, you have an incontrovertible piece of evidence that shows what happened in real time. But there's a lot of resistance. Increasingly you're seeing more body cameras. But let's go back to George Floyd, two or three years ago. You know, it's a cell phone camera. Now there was body camera footage there.

So the problem that I see in all of this is you have a unit of liars. You have officers who lied about the detention. You have officers who followed that lie up by going to the parents' house and alleging their son had been charged with a DUI. So the problem this department has with that SCORPION unit and every officer on scene is, every arrest report that they've been involved in is now tainted. And anybody who has an arrest report with the name of any of those officers needs to get a good attorney.",

Case in point, take a look at this statement everyone from the Memphis PD released on January 8th, saying, quote, \"While attempting to take the suspect into custody, another confrontation occurred. However, the suspect was ultimately apprehended. \"Afterward, the suspect complained of having a shortness of breath, at which time an ambulance was called to the scene.\" How does this statement square with what you saw this evening, Juliette?",

I agree with Cheryl, it's not clear to me that the leadership of the Memphis Police Department, who I complimented in a lot of their straightforwardness, it is not at all clear how this ends for them.Remember, we're a few weeks now out from the murder and so a lot was going on in that two-week period before they fired the police officers, before we got the videos, before they disbanded or put on hiatus the SCORPION unit. So I think it's clear that at least some part of the police department either was told something to protect the unit or lied themselves to protect the unit. And I think this will be the ongoing investigation that we see. I am not at all surprised; many will remember the George Floyd, the first police report was that he had choked or -- couldn't catch his breath. It was perverse in many ways. And it was only because of an outside video that we began to see the -- what had happened. So this is not uncommon and part of, I think, a larger reckoning that will happen in the Memphis Police Department, even if some of their activities now are more transparent than we've seen in the past.",
