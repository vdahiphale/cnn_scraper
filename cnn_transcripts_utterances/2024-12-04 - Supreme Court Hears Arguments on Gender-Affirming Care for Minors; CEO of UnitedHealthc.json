Joining me now is Minnesota State Representative Leigh Finke, who is the first transgender member of the state's legislature there. Lee, what does this day mean for you?STATE REP. LEIGH FINKE (D-MN), FIRST TRANSGENDER LAWMAKER ELECTED TO MN LEGISLATURE:  Thank you so much for having me on, first. It's very important to have a trans person here to talk about what this case means, because as we heard, this is the most important case in the history of my community in this country, and we have heard, there's too much emotion involved, and those two things, they can't go together. What this case -- the stakes of this case are, does the United States government want to prevent children to -- from becoming a person like me? Right? There is no way to separate emotion from this argument. There's no way for us to pretend like what we are saying is that a certain class, a certain demographic of Americans should not have access to the health care that they need because of who they are. I am incredibly moved to hear the stories like we just did from young people and I hope that people will understand that, that gender- affirming care is healthcare. Healthcare decisions belong in the home, in the doctor's office, not in the courts, not with politicians. We do not do this for other forms of healthcare. We are doing it because trans people are trans and that should be illegal. And I hope that the court will find it so.",

Of course, we're in the theater district of New York City on a bicycle. And then, sources telling me that's led through into New York City. So, you can imagine -- or rather Central Park.

I mean, we're talking about the middle of Manhattan. This is a very busy area, as you can tell, I can't even get there because of all the traffic. This is at about 6:45 this morning. It's the height of rush hour. It's also an area where not too far away is the Rockefeller Tree. That tree lighting expected to happen tonight. So, heavily trafficked by tourists at this point. So, still incredibly alarming.

She is headed back to where it all started, here to New York's JFK Airport eight days ago when she managed to bypass not one but two layers of security meant to confirm who she was and if she had a boarding pass. We know now, thanks to a CNN presence on that flight, that that plane took off here about an hour and a half ago from Paris and it's now headed here to JFK.Things so far so good. So far, incident free, that she is currently with two security officials. And things have been calm here. You see that video that it's been sent in where you see her sitting in the center seat towards the rear of the aircraft, that flight expected to touch down later this afternoon, where federal officials are expected to speak to the 57-year-old U.S. Green card holders. So, that answers the question of why she's being sent back to the United States in the first place. And you recall that this is actually the third attempt to send her back to the U.S. The first happening on Saturday before the plane even pushed back, that's when there was a disturbance that was caused by her and she was escorted off the flight. And then, yesterday, she was again escorted back onto a Delta flight, but that's when the airline said, no, we will not be transporting her back to the United States. Obviously, a lot of preparations have happened in the last 24 hours. And now, under some highly secure conditions here, she was escorted back onto this flight. Currently, essentially, over the Atlantic and headed here to New York's JFK where investigators are waiting to speak to her.",

There will be federal agents that will be speaking to her to try to find out a little bit more about how she was able to do this. Now, we do have reporting from our colleagues Pete Muntean and John Miller that really paint a clearer picture apparently, courtesy of some of the surveillance footage that she was able to essentially go around the TSA officer that checks the boarding pass on your I.D. before she then proceeded to actually be screened, not only her baggage, but she was screened, and then made her way into the terminal. And that's where then she was able to blend in with a group, past a Delta gate agent and then onto that flight. So, clearly, there are many unanswered questions about what has to be done to prevent this kind of security breach from happening. Not only the TSA, Delta Airlines, but also even airport personnel as well to try to keep this from happening again.",
