And I'm bringing you over here because you can see this collection of classic cars over here.And the reason this is all significant, John, the reason that we're talking about this, that we're showing you this is because really, this is indicative of the deep, deep corruption of the Assad regime, which is a big part of why this whole uprising started in the first place back in 2011. Bashar al-Assad had been ruling for some years. His father, for many decades before. And the levels of corruption and greed, the opulence and the lavish lifestyle, when so many Syrians were struggling to put food on the table. You imagine, John, the last 14 years Syrians have been under bombardment. They've been tortured, maimed, kidnaped, killed. And meanwhile, Bashar al Assad was living literally like a king, with garages full of cars, with palaces, with incredible mosaics and marble. And we actually watched in the presidential palace some ordinary people, who managed to sneak in, walking around with their jaws dropped. They could not believe how he was living at a time when Syria was suffering so acutely. And so this really is a metaphor for the root of the rot for where it all started and what it really means. The spirit of this Syrian uprising. Obviously, we're not going to sugarcoat it. There is a lot of anxiety in this moment. There is a lot of anxiety about the makeup of rebel forces, about whether there will be chaos, whether there will be strict Islamic law. And so it's not that everybody is out in the streets celebrating. But most Syrians are united in finding these displays of wealth and opulence truly sickening and indicative of the sickness of the Assad regime. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We are always reviewing our sanctions posture with entities based on their actions. So, when entities take different actions, of course, there can be a change in our sanctions.\"What he's basically saying is, if HTS changes the way it operates, they're at least open to that question right? Making no promises here. And we should note that HTS has at least been trying to do just that, right, as it's taken over areas in Syria with, for instance, religious minorities, including Christians. It has deliberately said, you can live your lives the way you want to. We're not going to force you to do anything. To say, in effect, that we're not the group we used to be. Now, the proof will be in the pudding going forward, whether they can demonstrate that that is real and lasting change. That's another tall order. But the U.S. at least leaving the door open there.",

Now, the government plans to test unpasteurized milk across the country to get a better sense of how the virus is circulating. CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, he's on call and joins us this morning. You know, you hear something like this and the obvious question is, you know, how concerned should people be about getting sick from drinking this milk? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I - so, the good news is, I don't think most people should be concerned at all because 99 percent of our milk supply is pasteurized. So, you know, we're really talking about raw milk here in particular, which has becoming increasingly a thing. When you pasteurize milk, it basically means you're heating it up to at least 161 degrees for at least 15 seconds. That's sort of the standard protocol. If you don't do that, there's all sorts of different pathogens that could be in the milk. E coli, salmonella listeria, and now H5N1. Just to give you a little context, John, about 1 percent of the country drinks raw milk at least once a week. There is some, you know, kind - evidence that maybe it provides bioactive ingredients, although the scientific evidence around that is not really clear. And you can get a lot of those bioactive ingredients in other ways without subjecting yourself to unpasteurized milk. What we do know is that there's been a lot of outbreaks associated with raw milk over the last 20 years. Some 200 some outbreaks, 2,600 illnesses, 228 hospitalizations. So, we do know that. And that is why, as you said, given the concern about H5N1 in particular, there is going to be this new testing. It's going to start next week. It's going to be at dairy farms across the country, John.",

      "sentences": "But, you know, one thing - the reason people get sort of very concerned about H5N1 is because, let me show you this graph. So, I was in Indonesia back in 2006. This was in the midst of a significant bird flu outbreak. And there have been bird flu outbreaks over time. There's the one from 2006. So, that was 2003 to 2009.You know, John, the orange is the number of cases. Red is the number of deaths. So, if you add up all of that, since 2003, over the last 20 years, mortality around this virus is around 50 percent. The numbers are small, but the mortality overall is high. Now, if you look at that graph even more closely, you can see that over time the number of cases has come down and the mortality risk has come down as well. So that's good news. But this is still, you know, one of those viruses that people - epidemiologists certainly pay a lot of attention to all over the world. In the United States, what we've really been talking about is since March, I think that's when this really hit peoples radar screen here. You had it detected in dairy farms in Texas. And then you sort of look at these points in time. There was the first case of a human becoming sick. The first case of a human becoming sick with no known exposure. And then detected in pigs just about a month and a half ago. So, these are the points in time that epidemiologists are paying attention to. Again, the good news is, most milk is pasteurized. So, it's not going to be a concern for most people. And, importantly, there's been no evidence of human to human transmission. You remember when we were talking about Covid, John, those points in time, is this transmitting human to human, that's a big concern. We're not seeing that, thankfully, with H5N1.",
