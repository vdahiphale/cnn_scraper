I mean, yesterday was such an incredible confluence of events for House Republicans when it comes to this issue of border security.They started out the day announcing that they were going to move forward with the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, starting those first hearings next week. Then they were on the border. And you saw for many of them, including the House Speaker, that they are starting to draw this line that they are not going to accept anything even if Senate negotiators could come up with a bipartisan agreement, which they still remain far away from, that is short of their House-passed immigration bill that they moved through their chamber last May. Now, we should note that even if they were trying to move that bill again, if it included funding for Ukraine and funding for Israel, it's really unclear where the votes would come from to actually get that across the finish line. Because many of these conservatives who like that bipartisan Ukraine funding -- they wouldn't necessarily be supportive of HR2 and people who are supportive of this House-passed immigration bill would not necessarily support more money for Ukraine. So it's a really interesting position but it shows you that Mike Johnson, the newly-minted speaker -- he's really starting to stick with these conservatives, making it clear that HR2 is the position for him as well. Here's what they said yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  The reason that we've insisted on the provisions of HR2, which is the bill that we passed seven months ago that's been sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk collecting dust -- the reason we've insisted upon that is because each of those provisions work together to secure the border. And what we see here is absolute mayhem. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  The only way we're going to get any of this done is in a bipartisan way. When the House clings to HR2 as the only solution, we're not going to get a deal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The response on genocide at the House hearing was bad. And yet, the credit and I think banging of the drum and declaring of war that some conservatives are pursuing right now is also not exactly great.SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I quibble with the phrase \"war on higher education.\" I think it's a war to reform higher education. I think what you see is that conservatives have long had concerns about the way these institutions are being run. Are we actually having academics on these college campuses or is it more about other things? In the case of Claudine Gay, she happened to become a focal point not because of anything that conservatives did to her but because of what she did to herself. Conservatives didn't invent time travel -- go back in time and make up these plagiarism instances. And conservatives certainly didn't cause her to sit in front of the American people and the U.S. States Congress and fail to unequivocally condemn genocide against the Jewish people. That's not anybody's fault but her own. I would say in the case of Harvard, this is our national flagship university with all due respect to all the other great universities, including my alma mater, the University of Louisville. But Harvard is our national flagship university. The president of that university has to be held to the highest standards in terms of both morals and values. In terms of condemning antisemitism. But also on academic rigor. She had a thin academic record to begin with and then when the plagiarism issues popped up I just don't see how it was tenable --",

I cannot sit here on national TV and allow individuals to attack the credentials, and the academic record, and the professionalism of Claudine Gay to get the position because that's what that -- that's what this conversation has delved into. That this Black woman didn't deserve it in the first place. And so, I -- when we go down this path of saying that she had a thin academic record to begin with, she was overly qualified. She was just as qualified as the 30 people who came before her who just all happened to be white. And so, that is the -- when we begin to talk about the racial animus that creeps into this conversation it's yes, you have the hearing and her poor answers -- below poor answers. And yes, you have the issues of citations which were ginned up by the right wing. We can deal with that. But now we're at this point where they're saying that this Black woman didn't deserve this job in the first place. That DEI is bad. I saw this missive by -- I believe his name is Bill Atkin (PH), which was just full of just -- I can't use the word because it's too early in the morning on live TV but it was full of that. And when you have people questioning DEI -- when you have people questioning diversity, equity, and inclusion and then question the record of this Black woman, we have to draw the line and say -- see, that is the game that we're talking about being played.

These things are just expensive. Lack of awareness, and that means people not realizing they have hearing loss. Not getting their hearing actually tested. And then finally, stigma around wearing hearing aids. And I'll tell you, back in 2022, the FDA approved hearing aids to go over the counter and that might help address the first and third causes there -- cost and stigma. Costs come down as a result of seeing all of these new hearing aids out there on the market. But also, if you look at the hearing aids out there, they're sleeker, they're cooler, they're less obtrusive than they used to be. That might decrease stigma. The bottom line, get your hearing tested. And this isn't just older people. This is people 20 and older in these studies -- all adults, but 20 and older, and many of them had undiagnosed hearing loss.",
