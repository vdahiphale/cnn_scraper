Obama headlining his first campaign event for Kamala Harris and not holding back one bit, it seems, with such little time left in the election, slamming Donald Trump on everything from his tax plan to the recent conspiracy theories that he's been pushing about FEMA to Trump's claim that his -- claim of his economy been so good.Obama's message also was directed very clearly at men. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior of bullying and of putting people down is a sign of strength. Real strength is about working hard and carrying a heavy load without complaining. Real strength is about taking responsibility for your actions and telling the truth even when its inconvenient.

You heard it there, former President Barack Obama ripping into Donald Trump while also making the case for Vice President Kamala Harris, drawing the stark contrast on policies but also on character. That was a big focus of his remarks last night there in Pittsburgh.Now, the former president also kept the focus on Pennsylvania. Of course, his remarks were in Pennsylvania, crucial state for the Harris campaign. And it was also where he sort of targeted his messaging over the course of his remarks. Take a listen to what he said here about Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president. Do you think he cares about you?",

But he also offered up that there has to be something better and sort of questioning that foreign President Donald Trump could do that, and making the case then that Vice President Kamala Harris is ready to take the job.But as you pointed out there in the beginning, the big focus of this, too, is men. When you look at the polling, this is where the Harris campaign has been struggling to gain ground, especially with black men. So he also made a campaign stop yesterday where he spoke to that, providing some stern words about making sure that black men are turning out for the vice president and that if they do not, or what their reasonings are, if they're not appear to be based in sexism. So certainly a remarkable moment to see the former president out on the campaign trail, but also offering some stern and sobering words in what is the final stretch of this election cycle. Now, he is going to make more of these stops. This is the beginning of a blitz. Two battleground states. Meanwhile, the vice president was in Arizona on their side of the country where she was appealing to Latino voters. So taken together, this is an effort to build their coalition knowing that Latino voters, black voters, among many others, are going to be crucial, and they're trying to shore up that support as best they can in this moment, Kate.",

It shows that this race is incredibly close, and this messaging is not actually stopping voters in any way from coming to Donald Trump's rallies, from supporting the former president.

And we've heard him roll out a bunch of tax cuts over the past few months. But Detroit is going to be incredibly important for whoever wins Michigan. And one of my colleagues at \"Politico\" has reported that the Harris campaign has seen some issues with black voters, especially black men in the Detroit area. And so Trump going to Detroit is, of course, to gin up support in that area. But his comments about Detroit and admonishing the city has already made headlines locally, and certainly doesn't help, and just give some political fuel to people like Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who said that voters aren't going to forget those comments come November.",

Black men clearly the focus for Barack Obama at his event yesterday in Pittsburgh, and then his stop by a Pittsburgh campaign office there. You really felt like it was it was sort of laser-focus. He went in with a purpose. Why? [08:10:07] MCGRAW:  Well, look, we're going to see historic gender divides in this election. We've seen that play out in a lot of the recent polling. And for Harris, it's going to be incredibly important that she keeps high margins with Latino and black voters, in particular Latino and black men. And we've seen the Donald Trump has made inroads with both of those constituencies. And Barack Obama, who remains one of the most popular people in the Democratic Party, had some harsh words for black men, saying, as Priscilla mentioned, that there could be some sexist undertones to why they're not rallying around Kamala Harris.

And like I said, just the cultural impact that Elon Musk has, but also the financial. Elon Musk is pouring millions of dollars into this race. He has his own super PAC. And the Trump campaign has really been leaning on outside super PACs to do things like get out the vote efforts in states like Pennsylvania, where Musk has a personal connection and has really been using that state as an H.Q.

So this would make sense from all of the rainfall that we saw, the torrential rainfall from Milton.

Of course, we were out here all day yesterday with HCSO and Fire and Rescue as they zeroed in on an assisted living facility. Water rushing in overnight, these are people on medication, on oxygen, people who can't walk, and they were forced to stay in waist deep cold flash waters for hours until it was safe enough for deputies to get out to them and bring them to safety.
