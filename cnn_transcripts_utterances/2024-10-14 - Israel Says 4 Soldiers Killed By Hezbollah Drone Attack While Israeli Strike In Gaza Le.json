All of the soldiers at the base were instructed to call home and update their families that they are OK. We are managing the incident.

They say that any attack by Israel will be met with an Iranian retaliation. The Iranians, of course, in the past, have said that if, for instance, Israel decides to attack Iran's oil and gas infrastructure, that then Iran could, in turn, also attack Israel's energy infrastructure as well. At the same time, you have the speaker of Iranian parliament, who was in Beirut, and there, he not only pledged Iran's support for Lebanon and for Hezbollah. He also warned the countries of this region not to allow Israel to use their airspace for a possible attack on Iran. He said that could have serious repercussions for those countries. At the same time, you also have the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Forces, which is an extremely important group in all of this, because they are responsible for the ballistic missile program and also for air defense.

Cedric Leighton is a CNN military analyst and retired Air Force colonel. Always good to see you. Still want to talk about this missile defense system in a minute, but let's start with Hezbollah striking deep into Israel and succeeding in hitting a military facility and causing casualties. It's a new development in terms of Hezbollah penetration into Israel. How significant Do you think?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think it's pretty significant, Michael. One of the things about this is, you know, what were the tactics and techniques that Hezbollah used to carry out this attack? And it seems as if they may have, first of all, overwhelmed the Israeli missile defense systems, and they were also able to perhaps evade detection with the drone that was used that actually carried out this attack, that was actually the lethal weapon in this particular case. They probably were able to navigate the area close to the surface of the earth. In other words, they didn't have the earth navigation, and that kind of navigation is extremely hard to detect when it comes to drones or airplanes, and if they did that, then they're certainly really figuring out what the vulnerabilities of the Israeli missile and air defenses are, plus what the vulnerabilities of Israeli radar are.",

And these are the classes of missiles that the Iranians use for many of their attacks against Israel or any of the other areas that they're targeting.So it's significant in the sense that when it, when it is put in place, it will actually add layer to the Israeli air and missile defenses and will augment the Iron Dome David sling and the arrow systems.",

And either side, of course, wants to back down. So that's going to be the significant issue in the coming weeks, probably.

His own party had to check him on that because they're worried about the damage that he's doing. So yes, this is Trump a little unhinged in this last month. HOLMES: I mean, it really is. It is dark doomsday stuff. I mean, given that rhetoric, and quite apart from the immigration stuff, there were 100 economists from all political persuasions who wrote in The Wall Street Journal that his economic policies would damage to the economy.

So as that number has whittled down, it seems to have broken evenly for the candidates. And you're right, the polls are eerily stable. They are not shifting, you know, when the Fed cuts the interest rate, when you get a great jobs report, even with two assassinations, they're just not moving.

Gaza officials say this was the seventh time that the camp inside the hospital grounds has been struck. Hospital officials say about 5,000 people had been sheltering on the grounds. The Israeli military says it conducted what it calls a precise strike on a Hamas command center inside the compound. Now, airstrikes in other parts of Gaza killed more than 40 people Sunday at least 13 of them children according to hospital officials. And a warning, what follows is disturbing video. At least 22 of the dead were killed when the Al-Mufti school located in the Nuseirat refugee camp was hit. More than 5,000 displaced people are sheltering there according to Gaza's civil defense. A paramedic who spoke to CNN said the Israeli military itself classifies the area as a safe zone. One Palestinian wounded in a different incident voicing his despair over the conditions in Gaza.

Now 99 American doctors who have volunteered in Gaza have written an open letter to U.S. President Joe Biden, describing the horrors of what they witnessed there. With foreign journalists banned from reporting freely in Gaza or reporting at all, the physicians say they are the only acting independent monitors on the ground in many ways. I want to read from just part of that letter, quote, \"We wish you could see the nightmares that plagues so many of us since we have returned. Dreams of children maimed and mutilated by our weapons and the inconsolable mothers, begging us to save them. We wish you could hear the cries and screams our consciences will not let us forget. We cannot fathom why you continue arming the country that is deliberately killing these children en masse.\" Now one of the contributors to that letter, Dr. Feroze Sidhwa is a trauma surgeon who volunteered at the European Hospital in Khan Younis in Gaza. He joins me now from New York and thanks for doing so. An article you co-authored for \"Common Dreams\" was headlined this. \"As surgeons, we have never seen cruelty like Israel's genocide in Gaza.\" It's a powerful article. You've had a lot of experience treating trauma injuries. How bad was it for you and your colleagues. DR. FARRO SINWAR, TRAUMA SURGEON: I think before the commercial you described it as hell on earth. and that's -- that's pretty accurate. when I was there from March 25 to April 8th, I was in Khan Younis at the European Hospital and at the time that was probably the best resource city block in all of Gaza. And despite that, it was exactly that, it was hell on earth. Massive, overwhelming, the hospital is just massively overwhelmed with the wounded. The hospital, just like every hospital in Gaza was itself a displaced persons' camp. There were about 10,000 to 15,000 people sheltering on the grounds. There were four toilets available for them. There was no way for them to consistently get food or electricity. It was an absolute nightmare.",

In fact, we have a map just to show you what China's military claims to be doing right now.Basically, you can see these six red blocks that are supposed to be possible locations of a potential blockade of Taiwan. They also were doing coast guard patrols around Taiwan's outlying Matsu Islands. The blockade, of course, could be a precursor to a full-scale invasion. It could be an attempt just to choke off, you know, commerce and all the supplies that this island needs. Basically to survive a blockade could very quickly make daily life here pretty miserable. Although these are just military drills. And we checked with Taiwan's transport ministry, everything's going ok as far as flights and shipments into Taiwan and shipments through the Taiwan Strait. So I guess the message that they're trying to try to send with these drills is yes, we're practicing now, but this could become the real deal at any moment. At least that's what China tries to project here. And it's interesting, Michael, how much money they spend to do these drills. We actually had a briefing with Taiwan's defense ministry. The drills earlier this year in May, right around the time of Taiwan's presidential inauguration. You know, they had 91 warship sailings, more than 110 flights, costing $13 million for China's navy, $48 million for the air force. And if you add up all of the cost of the drills last year, 2023, all the drills combined. That's 71,000 or so warship sailings, 9,200 plus flights. You're looking at a $13 billion bill almost for China's navy and more than $3.5 billion for China's air force. So clearly, they're not spending this kind of money just for propaganda value, Michael. They're also rehearsing and practicing real life skills that could be used militarily down the road and that's why the government here in Taipei obviously says the world needs to be on alert and be on guard for this. They put out their own propaganda video in response showing the Taiwanese military deploying its own resources. But you know, because China does this so frequently, it's easy to kind of fall into the trap. And even here in the Taiwanese capital, most people just going about their day-to-day lives not too perturbed about this. But normalizing these drills is exactly some say what Beijing wants Michael. They want people to kind of just forget that this is happening. But then of course someday it could be the real thing.",
