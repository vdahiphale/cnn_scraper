Here is what we are watching for you.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BLACKWELL (voice-over): An Israeli missile strike has reportedly killed several people including Iranian military leaders in Damascus. Our team is live in the region with the latest. SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): We need Donald Trump. WALKER (voice-over): Donald Trump secures another endorsement, this one from rival Nikki Haley's home state. Plus, how Nikki Haley is trying to close the gap with Trump in these final days ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primaries? BLACKWELL (voice-over): Texas mayors say they're fed up with the partisan response to dealing with the migrant surge at the border. A group of them met with President Biden to share their concerns. And we're joined live by one of the mayors who was in that meeting. WALKER (voice-over): Actor Alec Baldwin has been charged again in connection with that fatal shooting on the \"Rust\" movie set. The charges he's facing and how his attorneys are responding. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALKER (on camera): We begin with breaking news out of Syria. Several people are reportedly dead after an Israeli missile struck a multi- story building in Damascus. BLACKWELL (on camera): CNN's Ben Wedeman is following this story and joins us from Beirut. What more have you learned, Ben? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we noticed about just over four hours ago, Victor and Amara, there was a massive explosion in the Mazzeh, suburb of Damascus. A suburb a high -- sort of a high-end suburb where there are UN offices, embassies, as well. There was a massive blast there. What we saw on social media as well as Syrian T.V. was a man -- a large column of smoke rising from the area. Apparently, a three-story residential building was hit in this strike. Now, Syrian media is saying it was an Israeli airstrike. The Syrian Ministry of Defense says that Israeli planes came up through the -- from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights toward Damascus before firing missiles toward the Syrian capital. Now, CNN has reached out to the Israeli military who says that they do not comment on foreign reports. And in fact, they rarely claim responsibility for fairly frequent strikes, apparently, from Syria -- or either, apparently from Israel on Syria. Now, the Tasnim, a semi- official Iranian news agency is reporting that eight bodies have been removed from this now completely destroyed building. Now, the same news agency has quoted the Iran -- the Iran -- the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. That's the Islamic -- the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, saying that among the dead are four military advisors belonging to them. Now, this obviously is not the first time that there has been strike -- there have been strikes in the Syrian Capital. Everyone assumes -- takes it for granted these are Israeli strikes. On the 25th of December, there was a similar strike on a suburb of Damascus, again, killing a senior adviser from the IRGC. So, this really fits the pattern. Now, it's not clear why the Israelis struck these particular Iranian military advisors. But it's within the context of what we're seeing with the war in Gaza, with Hezbollah striking Israeli targets, and Israel striking back. We have seen these strikes on in Iraq and in Syria as well. So, it really does -- it's all within the broader context of this slowly spreading -- war spreading from Gaza to throughout the Middle East, Amara, and Victor.",

But that's not where I am right now.We're obviously talking about the primary coming up in a few days. And yes, President Trump got a pretty major endorsement from a former presidential candidate in South Carolina, Senator Tim Scott. And as campaigns sort of look for ways to inject energy into a voting population days before a primary like this, the Trump campaign is hoping this is one of those moments. And as you mentioned, Trump does believe that a big win here in New Hampshire after that landslide victory in Iowa could effectively lock up the nomination for him. That said, he told his supporters last night at a rally that they shouldn't pay attention to the polls. They need to show up almost as if acting like he is down in this particular race. Now, for --- as for the endorsement itself, when Trump introduced Tim Scott to the stage, Trump actually said that this endorsement happened days ago. So, what's clear about this is that they really wanted to play up this endorsement. Doing it the way that they did. Take a listen to some of what we heard last night at the rally.

But choosing to do it now clearly means that they are trying to make a statement before the primary. And it lines up with some of our reporting that a source familiar with the planning says that there were talks of this endorsement, but the acceleration or the endorsed -- the timeline, I should say it was accelerated once they saw Nikki Haley's positioning in the polls. So, it's a question of how much competition Nikki Haley will be able to give the former president. But very clearly, they're paying close attention to what could happen here. WALKER: All right.

JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Victor and Amara, actor Alec Baldwin, once again criminally charged. That according to an indictment issued Friday by a grand jury in New Mexico. The actor's new indictment for involuntary manslaughter pertains to his alleged role in the fatal shooting on the set of the movie, \"Rust\" in 2021, in which a gun that Baldwin was holding discharged, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin has long proclaimed his innocence, insisting he never pulled the trigger on the gun before it fired. His attorneys issued a brief statement after Friday's indictment was announced, indicating, \"we look forward to our day in court.\" Baldwin had been previously charged with involuntary manslaughter, the lead prosecutor at the time described for CNN, a culture of alleged negligence on the movie set. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, SANTA FE DISTRICT, NEW MEXICO: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set. That there were live rounds on set. They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those or at least they weren't checking them consistently. And then, they somehow got loaded into a gun handed off to Alec Baldwin. He didn't check it. He didn't do any of the things that he was supposed to do to make sure that he was safe or that anyone around him was safe. And then, he pointed the gun at Alyna Hutchins, and he pulled the trigger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In October, a prosecutor said, \"additional facts have come to light that we believe show, Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins.\" And signaled a grand jury would be deciding on recharging the actor.

So, again, his defense that, look, I was told by the armorer that the gun was safe to use, that there wasn't any live ammunition is going to be a juxtapose with his obligations, which are more responsibilities that you have in terms of safety, when you are a producer on a set. But the big question in this case, that's still remains to be unanswered is how did that live ammunition get on the set in the first place? We know the armorer has been charged, her trial is set to begin this February. But we still have not heard these prosecutors state how that ammunition got on that set, how it got mixed in with the dummy ammunition, and how that ammunition that design ammunition was in a gun, loaded, that Alec Baldwin was using in that particular scene? I think that's the unanswered question We all can agree that no one should die on a movie set. And this was a horrible tragedy. And of course, someone should be held accountable.
