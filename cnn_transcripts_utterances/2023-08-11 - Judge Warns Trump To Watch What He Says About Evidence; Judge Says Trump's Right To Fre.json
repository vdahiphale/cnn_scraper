Hecklers turn up the heat and grill Mike Pence serving up a side of gears with their deep-fried Oreos and calling the former vice president a trader for doing his job, and smoke is enough. A powerful Republican says, he doesn't need to wait for direct evidence that Joe Biden reaped rewards from his son's business dealings before sending subpoenas to the president's family. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, a win kind of coupled with a warning. The federal judge presiding over the Trump 2020 election trial sides with the defense and rules against, an attempt to totally restrict what their client can do or say with evidence. But that judge did establish clear limits to how Trump can use what he learns from the lawyers in public and this is important. She issued a stern warning to the former president. One, that everything he says is now under scrutiny. Another was that the campaign will take a backseat to what happens inside her courtroom. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the federal courthouse. Katelyn, wow, it sounds like that judge is trying to make very clear, she is in charge at as is, she believes the rule of law.",

That is the thing to underline from this hearing that she reiterated over and over again to the lawyers on both sides here.Some of the quotes today really were astonishing with how much Judge Tanya Chutkan was emphasizing that bigger picture idea that justice comes first. This isn't about politics, and there can be limits on a person's speech, even if they are running for president and especially, when they are a criminal defendant so that they may have a fair trial. One of the things Judge Tanya Chutkan, said in court today, Dana, was the fact that he is running a political campaign currently has to yield to the administration of justice. And if that means, he can't exactly say what he wants to say in a political speech, that is just how it's going to have to be. She's saying that that is not just about how much Donald Trump will be able to disclose evidence in this case that he's learning from the Justice Department. One of the decisions she made today was, yes, she can tailor things in the way that Trump's team wants. The only sensitive evidence that they get will be protected and have a specific set of rules around how they can be handled and spoken about. But also, she is saying that anything that Trump is learning that is sensitive, especially what he's learning from witness interviews, he's not going to be able to share more broadly. And on top of that, the other important thing is that he's under bail conditions, and he's not going to be able to speak in a way that intimidates witnesses, period. Dana?",

I mean, in some senses, the whole defense is on the First Amendment, even though this is limited to what he can say, a free trial. So, it's kind of an interesting situation for her.The limitations that she's imposing here, I think it's mostly, I think agreeing what the Trump team wants some. She is causing a fight over the definition of what will be sensitive and the obvious solution. She says, no big blanket order, only what sensitive would be protected. The obvious solution to that for the prosecution is just to designate very broadly, what's sensitive. The downside for that is you're going to get a lot of litigation over that definition. And you could end up going batch-by-batch over what is sensitive, which could cause more delay as well. So, it's all sort of a double-edged sword here. I'm here to statement about the aspect of this is not going to be political, I find really intriguing because obviously, it has political consequences. Garland has made such a big effort never even mentioned the word politics. In some senses, I think now what's going to happen is Trump's team is going to seize on that and say, yes, now you're finally acknowledging that politics is part of all of this.",

And one thing I actually found very interesting from what the judge said today was that if Donald Trump or anyone and his team makes inflammatory statements that will want -- that will give her the motivation to want to have a trial even sooner. And so, of course, though, Donald Trump and his team want to delay this as much as possible, as they've done with the other with the classified documents case and other legal battles that he's facing. They want to try to delay any sort of trial until after the 2024 election. Of course, that's not what special prosecutors want. They want it to be very speedy.

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. I mean an unexpected announcement today by the Attorney General Merrick Garland, appointing David Weiss, who has been overseeing this investigation as a special counsel.So, as Garland said that will allow David Weiss the ability to investigate this independently. It will allow him to investigate anywhere he needs to. There had been questions about venue in this case, because he is the U.S. attorney for Delaware, and some of the conduct or alleged conduct had taken place in other jurisdictions. It's also a bit of a reversal because both Garland and David Weiss had previously said, he didn't ask for special counsel status and all the authority that he needed in this case. But now, according to Garland, Weiss asked for that status on Tuesday, and he was granted that. So, as Garland said, it will also mean that David Weiss will be providing a report with any prosecution decisions or declination at the end of this. And this is something that the House Republicans had been raising as a question here because there were IRS whistleblowers who come forward saying, that some of their investigative efforts were stymied during this multi-year investigation. So, it is something that House Republicans have been scrutinizing and appointing a special counsel could alleviate some of that scrutiny, but it raises a lot of questions about just what else they might be investigating. And I noticed that Garland had said that they will be able to investigate criminal conduct by Hunter Biden, among others. That is a question here of who else they might be looking into. And remember, this investigation had spanned some five years and had looked abroad conduct including, foreign lobbying, including potential money laundering, and it had narrowed into the guilty plea that they had reached last month that fell apart in the court hearing. And just now, Dana, we're getting word. I'm looking at a court filing, where prosecutors asked the judge to vacate the court order, asking them to come back and work out their guilty plea, because as they write that this is the prosecutors' writing in this motion to the judge, that, you know, that order was set in place as they were continuing to work toward a guilty plea. They write, but that is no longer the case, following additional negotiations after the hearing held on July 26, 2023. The parties are at an impasse and are not in agreement on either a plea agreement or a diversion agreement. Therefore, the government believes the court's briefing orders should be vacated. So, you know, that shows us that this deal that they were working toward on tax misdemeanor charges and a diversion on a gun possession is now being torn up.
