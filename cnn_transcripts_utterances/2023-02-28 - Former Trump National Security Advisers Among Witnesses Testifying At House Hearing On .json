A new House panel convening as global tensions are rising amid the war in Ukraine and fears that China will provide lethal support to Russian forces.Also this hour debt relief for millions of Americans with student loans is on the line at the U.S. Supreme Court. We're following the protests and the stakes as the nine justices weigh challenges to President Biden's loan forgiveness program. And Fox News is facing even more scrutiny and questions tonight after the Chairman Rupert Murdoch admitted under oath that some of the network's hosts endorsed lies about the 2020 presidential election. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, Congress is putting the spotlight on deteriorating U.S. relations with China and the growing threat that the communist regime poses to the United States. The first hearing of the new House select committee on China begins in the next hour. Let's bring in CNN's Jessica Dean. She's up on Capitol Hill for us. Also let's bring in CNN's David Culver who has reported from China for years. Jessica, I'll start with you. Tell us what to expect at tonight's hearing.",

And it's worth noting this is a very bipartisan committee and enjoys a tremendous amount of bipartisan support. So that's kind of the tone and tenor as we head into this evening's primetime hearing.We're expecting them to tackle four key issues. Among them, the spy balloon, the Chinese spy balloon, COVID-19, China's support of Russia in its fight against Ukraine, and then also the future of TikTok. There's also going to be a host of witnesses that will be testifying in tonight's hearing, and among those will Matthew Pottinger, he's the former deputy national security adviser and also widely renowned Chinese expert. We're told that he's going to play a video that is aimed at dispelling any questions about the ambitions of the Chinese government. We're also expected to hear from former National Security Adviser under former President Donald Trump H.R. McMaster on this issue as well. And both of these men widely respected across the aisle. So, we will anticipate they will walk people through and walk the members of Congress through what threats America faces right now. And, Wolf, one more thing that worth nothing today, just to kind of set the stage is that the Biden administration warned today that anyone, any Chinese firm or person that provides lethal aid to Russia in its fight against Ukraine will be targeted by the U.S. government.

And we've actually traveled to Xinjiang. We've reported on that first- hand. The party also faces criticism for its harsh crackdown on dissent, including any pro-democracy movements. We saw that with Hong Kong. Now the Chinese government will fire back at that criticism. They point to issues with race or police brutality in the U.S. and they tell American politicians, hey, mind your business. But it's precisely because of that business that we need to care about this. The U.S. companies with either a supply chain or a massive consumer base in China have and they're going to continue to be challenged with having to place these moral decisions above profits. It is a really tricky balance. And you anger China, you risk financial loss. You go against the U.S., you face potentially being alienated here at home. Wolf, this committee is going to no doubt be focused on any alleged atrocity committed by the party and put that pressure on American companies doing business in China.

Wolf, CNN did reach out and speak with a soldier, a Ukrainian soldier in Bakhmut, earlier today who said that the situation is so tough that it is 100 percent more difficult than Ukrainian officials are willing to admit. But the same soldier saying that they're not going to surrender, they're not going to give up this city without a fight. In the meantime, Russia appears to be making some gains. The Russian force has been primarily made up in and around Bakhmut with those mercenaries and convicts from the Wagner Group. They have been backed up by the Russian regular military. They do appear to have taken some territory north of Bakhmut as they try to encircle the city. Ukraine does appear to be on its heels but resisting those intense assaults by the Russians. This fight has been in such close quarters in and around the city, in the tranches, street to street, house to house. Russian forces pounding Ukrainian defensive positions not only with artillery but at night with combat jets -- combat aircraft to the point where one Ukrainian commander says that the Russians are trying to pound the city of Bakhmut into molecules.

Only a proportion of it was in the public sphere, the rest was behind closed doors.And, basically, this was Vladimir Putin, essentially instructing the FSB, the main security service inside Russia, to up its game when it comes to counterintelligence inside Russia in the face of what he said was increased Ukrainian and western, including the United States, efforts to carry out espionage and sabotage activities inside the country. Putin talking about the need for secrecy around particular areas, like the defense industry, like personal data, like the command control systems of the Russian military. He didn't point to any particular intelligence failures, but the fact that he was talking about these things sort of, you know, point to a certain concern about vulnerabilities inside the country. Now, since Russia invaded Ukraine over a year ago now, it has been subject, remember, to numerous attacks inside the country. There has been, you know, drone attacks, attacks on railway infrastructure, recruitment offices for the military have been burned down, there have been cyber attacks as well. So, it may be a reference to that sort of thing.

It's even one thing if he gave it to Fox News writ large. He gave it to Tucker Carlson, who had recently aired, I think it was last year, put out a video basically saying that the government did this and all these rioters are heroes. But Kevin McCarthy has confused me probably more than anybody I've known in my life. He used to be somebody I thought was very much committed to what his truth was, what he believed.

But I think it's the basis of all the testimony.And if you evaluate the case, Wolf, I think you'd do it in three ways. The first is motivation. They're really trying to get the ground of whether there was motivation to do this or not. What am I speaking about? The prosecution is suggesting that Alex Murdaugh had the motivation because of his financial crimes, because they look closing in upon him, because he feared there would be this revelation. Defense saying, it makes no sense as to that motive. He's a loving husband and father who would never do this. Number two, timeline, the prosecution saying in the short timeline that it took, he certainly was at the scene, they demonstrated that, used cellphone footage, they demonstrated that through the card data, they demonstrated that to a video that he was speaking on. He, of course, denied initially he was at the scene. But the timeline is critical, defense trying to expand the timeline. And then finally, to your point, you have this notion from the defense that it could have been two shooters. The shooter could have been 5'2\". It could have an issue with respect of people not liking Murdaugh because of his pill addiction and him being involved in unsavory characters, his son and the boating accident and threats against his son, it could have been someone else, and, of course, the defense saying that, of course, is not true, that it was him and the evidence points with only being him. So, it's not only the experts in evaluating, a lot of times they cancel each other out, it's about the collective weight to the evidence, but those are the three pillars I think the jury will -- and finally rendering a conclusion.",

But he was talking about that law he signed about the Disney Corporation.And it's been really interesting. We are seeing the early stages here of a dividing line inside this Republican primary campaign about the role of government, the role of business, and of course on funding for Ukraine and other matters. But on this in particular, this is something that, of course, the governor has been coming under significant criticism from potential rivals like New Hampshire Governor John Sununu, former Vice President Mike Pence talking about limited government and is it really conservative for a governor to sign a law directed specifically at a corporation like Disney. So these are many things that will be litigated throughout the course of this Republican primary. Governor DeSantis is on his book tour today. I'm told that he'll be going to Iowa to campaign at some point in March. So he is in his soft-launch period. But there are certainly going to be some tough moments for him trying to explain really the evolution of this Republican Party in the Trump era.

And while that seems both obvious and somewhat simplistic, I think it underscores the view that Ron DeSantis, despite his very clear statewide success in Florida, has not been on the national stage, and has not faced the type of attack, the type of intensity of a primary challenge.And the president seemed to allude to that late last year when he was asked about DeSantis and a potential challenge, and he said it would be fun watching DeSantis and Trump go at one another. He has attacked DeSantis in the past, calling him a Trump incarnate making clear that in his view Trump and DeSantis are mostly interchangeable, which is a not so subtle effort on the political side of things. But I think the biggest way that you will see the president target DeSantis, the governor of Florida, is in the policy space. He was down in Florida a couple weeks ago and was talking about Medicaid expansion. Those are the elements, whether it's Medicaid expansion, Medicare and Social Security, places where they feel like on the policy side of things, they have very clear benefits in terms of a contrast, in terms of a debate. But, more broadly, I think, to some degree, he talked to Biden advisers and other Democrats. They'll not sure he'll get out of a primary. We think he's a glass jaw, Wolf.",

That is very, very close. Worse yet, the FAA says that private Learjet did not have clearance to take off. The FAA saying in a statement, quote, the Learjet pilot read back the instructions clearly but began a takeoff role instead. That plane was supposed to wait on the runway for that other airplane to land. The FAA says the pilot of the jet blue aircraft took evasive action and initiated a climb-out as the Learjet crossed the intersection. This is a huge deal, Wolf, because like you mentioned, this is happening time and time again this year, five times in 2023. The FAA is investigating here, it says it will determine, finally, how close these airplanes came.
