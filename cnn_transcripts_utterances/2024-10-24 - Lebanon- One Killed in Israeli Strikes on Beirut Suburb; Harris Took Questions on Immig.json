We understand from an IDF spokesperson that civilians were only given a warning minutes before the strikes happened. What more are we learning about those attacks overnight and the state of civilians? HANCOCKS; Well, that's right. It doesn't seem a very long warning, does it? But the IDF says it does give warnings before it does carry out these airstrikes.So this particular one, according to state media, NNA, they say that it was the most violent airstrikes to hit the Beirut suburbs since the air campaign began. The IDF says that they struck more than 160 Hezbollah targets. They say whether it were rocket launches or infrastructure, not just in southern Beirut, but also in southern Lebanon. But we are still seeing the rockets come the other way as well, saying that on Wednesday, there were more than 130 projectiles. In fact, Hezbollah claims that it did hit a military manufacturing firm in Tel Aviv. We did see sirens in Tel Aviv, shrapnel falling in that city as well, which actually delayed the departure somewhat of the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.",
