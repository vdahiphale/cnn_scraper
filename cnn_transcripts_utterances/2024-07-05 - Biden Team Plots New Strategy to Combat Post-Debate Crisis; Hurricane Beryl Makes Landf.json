A brand new memo released by the White House lays out an aggressive July schedule for Biden starting today in the key battleground state of Wisconsin. And tonight, Biden faces a pivotal moment that could make or break his campaign. The president will sit down for his first television interview since the debate with ABC's George Stephanopoulos.While Biden tries to save his campaign, Donald Trump is ranting on social media, railing against Biden and Stephanopoulos. Trump is also calling for a second debate against Biden to be, quote, no holds barred. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is live for us at the White House with the very latest. Good to see you, Priscilla. All right, so what's the latest? What's the strategy? How are they going to put things forward?",

Of course, after that debate, campaign officials and White House officials have tried to reassure allies by saying they will see the president more. They will see that vigor and aggressiveness that they talk about or describe the president as being behind closed doors. And, of course, over the last week, we have heard from allies who said they do want to see the president get out on the campaign trail and have these unscripted moments.So, in a new campaign memo, they're laying out exactly that. In the month of July, a couple things, the president, the vice president, the first lady, and the second gentleman are all going to visit -- are all together going to visit every battleground state. The president is also going to deliver remarks at two conferences in Nevada, focused specifically on Latino and black voters. He's also, according to this memo, going to engage in more off-the- cuff moments and interviews, and they're going to launch a $50 million paid media blitz. Now, of course, we did see the president yesterday at the July 4th celebration here at the White House, and when he was talking to military families, someone shouted, we need you. And this was his response to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  You got me, man. I'm not going anywhere. All right. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But there are still a lot of questions, particularly over how the next few days unfold. Of course, tonight there is that primetime interview with ABC, an opportunity again for advisers to show, for the president to show that, that energetic self that comes out during some rallies is not just a fluke, that that is who the president is and that he is a viable candidate going into November. He's also going to visit today the battleground state of Wisconsin, and later over the course of the weekend going to Pennsylvania.So, the campaign is trying to chart a new course here. They want to show again that the president is the candidate and the nominee for the Democrats come November, but they haven't calmed all nerves yet. Allies are still very much scrutinizing, very much watching what happens over the next few days. The president himself has acknowledged to a key ally that the next few days are crucial. So, we clearly are very much at a critical juncture here, Fred.",

But what I've been hearing from people, even people who are close allies of Joe Biden, who stood by him for years, and want to stand by him now, is that they are skeptical of whether he's up to it. And they are saying to him and people close to him that they need to see something different out of him. And if they don't see it, then I think you will see over the course of the next few days into next week a continuing shift away from him. If they do, then he may be able to turn this around.",

You could see how symmetrical it was in the water, starting to lose a little bit of its shape as it gets on land, but still expecting dangerous storm surge of four to six feet in the area. When we're talking about rain, we're talking about four to six inches of rain across the Yucatan Peninsula, could find some totals up to 10 inches, which would cause some flash flooding.After this, by tonight, we're looking at it getting back into the Gulf of Mexico here, where it could re-intensify? We do have some very warm waters here, warm for this time of year. So, it could get its act together a little bit more before it looks at another landfall somewhere in Northern Mexico or even South Texas. We're finding this dome of heat and humidity, this area of high pressure, continuing to weaken some and move out of the way. So, that's allowing barrel to kind of make this turn to the north and start impacting Texas later on this weekend. We're talking about Sunday. We could even start to see some impacts. We could have some watches issued later on today. So, there's that track you can see possibly another hurricane landfall as it gets into Texas. Either way, rip currents the entire holiday weekend. Fred? WHITFIELD:  All right. And, Elisa, an extremely dangerous heat wave is intensifying on the West Coast. Here we go again. How long is this going to go on?",

All of this happening in the waters off South Padre Island yesterday. Authorities say two people were bitten, a third person was injured, though not bitten, and a fourth person felt a shark brush against them.Meantime, in Florida, a shark bit a man on the foot, this happening in knee deep water, according to CNN-affiliate WKMG.

Let me start with the heroic acts by the U.S. Border Patrol, and we have some pictures that you can take a look at.This is according to the CBP official, they say that two off-duty Border Patrol agents from the elite Border Star unit. Now, these men and women do this for a living, and they just happen to be at the right time at the right place. They ran into the water, according to this official, pulled the victim out of the water, and immediately started rendering medical aid. Now, that included a tourniquet, and if you know anything about first response, if an individual needs a tourniquet, they could bleed out in a matter of minutes. Well, we don't know of any fatalities, and we don't know specifically the condition of this individual, but we do know that the life saving measures by these off-duty agents probably saved this person's life. Now, the response was not just by land. It was also by air. Take a look at this video. This is from the Texas Department of Public Safety from Lieutenant Chris Olivares. He shared this video with us. The response by air was by a helicopter that was flying very low and also practicing some deterrence maneuvers to try to keep that shark away from shore, away from people and about the people that were there about those beachgoers and their fears related to this shark. Our CNN Producer Amanda Jackson talked to a mother from Harlingen, Texas, this is in the Rio Grande Valley, two of her daughters were in the water when the shark was there. She says that, all of a sudden, she heard that her daughters were screaming, they ran out of the water, and she started seeing some blood running one of her daughter's legs. That's the 18-year-old that has the gauze around her leg. The good news is that these were just scrapes. She is okay. But just imagine the scare of this mother who is seeing her daughter scream that there's a shark in the water and that they're running out of the water. Again, she's okay. Now, there's another incident. CNN-affiliate KRGV also talked to the father-in-law of a man who was also a shark victim. He says that they were swimming in the water and all of a sudden his son-in-law went under. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAYNER CARDENAS, SON-IN-LAW WAS BITTEN BY A SHARK:  I turned around, he wasn't there anymore. I started swimming towards him and then he jumped up out of the water saying, shark, shark, shark. And that's when adrenaline kicked in and I went right after him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I can attest to that. I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley. I grew up going to this particular beach. I can tell you that I never saw sharks growing up.So, this is very notable. And, again, the good news here is that there were no fatalities. Of course, we don't know the conditions of all the individuals who either had an encounter or were bitten by the shark, but, again, officials there in South Padre Island said that nobody has died.",

He wants to improve the national health care system. He wants to improve crime and justice. He wants to develop a whole new job sector, grow a job sector in the green energy area. There's a lot he wants to achieve. But the real work is when he gets here. He'll have several meetings. He's expected to appoint all his ministers, we understand, which is quite a rarity.

He has dragged it from the left to center left. He has vowed to work with whoever is in the White House, whoever becomes president later this year, vowed to work with them.
