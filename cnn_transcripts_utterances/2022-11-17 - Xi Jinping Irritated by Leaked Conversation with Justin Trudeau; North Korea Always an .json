There were two Canadian citizens, you know, who were held and then they were released. So, this has been a pretty contentious relationship and the lack of face-to-face interactions certainly hadn't helped the situation with Xi Jinping hunkering down for only virtual interactions with world leaders during much of the COVID pandemic, which is why it's so striking to see him now out on a global stage interacting without a mask, shaking hands. Even as China remains very much, you know, gripped by this zero COVID draconian lockdowns and quarantine policies. And yet, Xi Jinping now at back out interacting with the leaders of the west. And you mentioned, Prime Minister Trudeau bringing up those discussions about election interference. Xi Jinping during his meeting on Monday with the U.S. President Joe Biden said that it is Chinese style democracy. That is how he would describe his system. Certainly, an interesting take, and perhaps a signal to U.S. allies that China doesn't want ideological barriers to stand in the way of negotiations. Prime Minister Trudeau for his part, just hours after that exchange brushed off the significance of it saying that's just a part of candid conversations between world leaders.
