Those are the markets and these are the main events: The Bank of England forecasts a long recession lasting until halfway through 2024. Tech companies, Lyft and Stripe announce major layoffs. And it is CNN's Call to Earth Day. We will bring you the story of one man's quest to remove trash from the world's oceans. Live from New York, it is Thursday, November 3rd. I'm Rahel Solomon, and I too, mean business. Good evening. Tonight, the Bank of England has taken its most aggressive policy action in 33 years, as it warns the UK economy is already shrinking. It raised interest rates 75 basis points bringing its benchmark rate to three percent. Governor Andrew Bailey also issued a stark warning. He said the recession could last two years and that unemployment can almost double from its current rate. Bailey's comments sending the pound lower is now down almost two percent. The Bank of England is facing difficult conditions as it tries to fight rising prices and the UK, of course, especially vulnerable to higher energy prices, which had been worsened from Russia's war in Ukraine. That's helped fuel inflation of more than 10 percent, the highest in the G7. The country has also experienced significant political instability in the past several years. Current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is the third Prime Minister this year alone. Marc Stewart is with me now. Marc, good to have you. Thank you. So, what is driving this new, darker forecast from the Bank of England?",

So, what's at play here? Well, one, we just had general economic uncertainty as we have seen around the world, much of it prompted by the pandemic, but there is also the war in Ukraine. That is particularly troublesome, as you have mentioned across Europe, including in the United Kingdom, and it makes the future extremely murky. I want you to take a listen to a news conference from earlier today with the head of the European Central Bank -- Andrew -- I'm sorry, the Bank of England, let me clarify that -- Bank of England's Governor Andrew Bailey.

So many of these tech companies do a significant portion of their business overseas, and the strength of the US dollar not only makes, you know, their products and services seem more expensive to foreign consumers, but also when they have to translate all of those foreign profits back into the US dollar, that sort of translation rate can really take a hit to their bottom line.",

So while Russia is creating this impression that they are no longer present in the center of the city, and they intend to pull the military out, there is a different picture on the edge of the city and this is what Ukrainian officials worry about. Is this just an elaborate trap they could be pulled into here? You know, there's a lot of psychological warfare that goes on within the warfare of war. We've seen it already. When the Ukrainians had a lightning advance a couple of months ago here in the north of the country, guess what, they made it very clear in the previous month or so that they were going to have a major advance in the south and Russia had moved a huge number of military personnel down there to counter that, and the Ukrainians were able to have an easier time of it in the north. So both sides try mind games over each other, and this is one where the Ukrainians are intent on taking Kherson, and I think it's important to the Russians, if they're going to lose it, which is what it seems it's how they lose it, that it's not a catastrophe, that it seems to be on their terms and they score some military points and victories in the process and the Ukrainians know all of that, too.",

So there were two reasons right there that there wasn't a big draw in the electricity supply, but now, there is, and the power cuts that the governments had to institute have been longer, their blackouts have been longer, because people are at home consuming more electricity to try to stay warm. So these are the problems. And you know, in this city, for example, we were today at a plant that makes -- that makes heating logs and the officials there were taking them out to pensioners.

Marine life dies in these zones, since decomposed algae consume the oxygen in the area. More than 1100 manatees died in Florida in 2021, the most deaths in decades. About two thirds of the deaths were on Florida's east coast. Scientists largely blamed the increase of a lack of sea grass on the east coast, much of it killed by pollution and coastal development.
