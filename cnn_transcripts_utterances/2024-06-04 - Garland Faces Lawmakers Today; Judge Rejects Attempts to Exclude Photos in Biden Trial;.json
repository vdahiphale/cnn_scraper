We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"And it gets pretty specific about some of the conspiracy theories that have been floated by Republicans. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is with us now.

That investigation resulted in no charges. And the Department of Justice let her testify to Congress, turned over his report and gave Congress a transcript of Biden's interview, but no audio tape. And Merrick Garland, attorney general, says, yes, you guys are not getting it. We're not giving that to you. He says, \"certain members of this committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining - for no legitimate purpose - sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations. So, Merrick Garland wanting to keep private that to protect witnesses, future investigations, other proceedings. But Merrick Garland, John, is also saying to House Republicans, likely to say to them, based on remarks we've obtained, there's a bigger beef here between Republicans and the Justice Department. You guys want to defund offices we have. You want to attack the people in the Justice Department, law enforcement. That's why Merrick Garland is saying that other quote, \"I will not be intimidated.\" We're going to be hearing from him in person at 10:00 a.m. And we'll see exactly where the hearing goes from there. But this really is uncharacteristic in a lot of ways of Merrick Garland, someone who tends to not put himself in the middle of the political maelstrom. John.",

And if you're wondering why I'm holding a sort of crumpled piece of spiral bound notebook paper, it is because, of course, there are no cameras allowed inside federal courts. So, we are relying on our colleagues inside to take notes and then run them out to us.And the most recent update we got is, we were expecting opening statements to begin by now, but they're a little bit delayed because they were still, at the time of this note, waiting for some jurors to show up. So while they were waiting for these additional jurors to arrive at court, they handled some of these outstanding questions about evidence. And here the judge said that she would allow in this photo that Hunter's defense attorneys were trying to keep out. And this photos, she says, includes, quote, \"circumstantial evidence of his drug use,\" which is, of course, at the center of this case. But this is an image where he is naked. Now, the judge said that it will be shown from the chest up. The rest will be redacted. But this is another blow to the defense. The judge has already prevented them from bringing in an expert witness and blocked another piece of evidence that they wanted to bring in. Now, the first lady, Jill Biden, she is here today for these opening statements. Notable because, as you know, she and her husband are traveling to France later today. But she is here to show support for her stepson as this trial gets underway. Another interesting thing, Kate, is just a short time ago, Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in on these two federal trials that Hunter Biden is facing. Of course, this is the first trial. In September he is expected to face trial in Los Angeles on tax charges. And the senator said that he believed that if any other American had, quote, prepared their taxes like Hunter Biden, they too would face a federal prosecution. But he was very dismissive of this case and said, quote, I don't think anything good can come of that. So, that's a notable Republican criticism of this case today. Kate.",

Caitlin Clark is a superstar. She plays like Steph Curry, meaning she is everybody's game. She makes it - basketball look feasible for everyone because of the way in which she plays. So, this is why there's such this fascination with her.However, we're forgetting that she probably had a month or a little more than a month to go from college to the draft and to the WNBA. And there's this learning period, a huge learning curve, that people talked about. Now, how it's being covered really disappoints me because the people who have really large platforms in our business, such as a Pat McAfee, are elevating a jealousy story when, in fact, all athletes are jealous in some capacity, right?",

There's an - there's an element of that because Caitlin Clark is getting all the attention and she makes all the money. Of course there's an element. But that's not necessarily the story here.We're talking about the WNBA at 10:00 in the morning on CNN. You know what I mean? This is a big thing and it's a good thing for the sport. Let's not cover it like we are archaic and we don't understand that these women are just athletes as well. BERMAN: And, look, and I mean this, at least they're play right now.
