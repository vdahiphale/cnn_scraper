No matter how they try to spin it, it's interesting even listening to the language now, Sergey Lavrov seemingly now saying that Russia may be able to work with HTS going forward, even though they've given safe harbor and refuge to Bashar Assad and his family in Moscow. I'm just wondering, the ripple effects of this are rather significant. Russia has military bases in Syria.

It's a tremendous humiliation for Putin intervention in this horrible civil war on the side of Bashar Assad, theSyrian dictator, and bringing this war to a de facto conclusion victory for Assad with rebels being stuck in a little pocket on the Turkish border was celebrated and presented by the Kremlin as its major foreign policy achievement that Moscow is back in great power game and that it's happening at the expense of the United States. It's able to provide security and protection to its friends and allies. And now the regime collapsing in Moscow being unable to protect it is really a big blow to Russia's reputation and to its standing in the Middle East. The big question is, what will happen to the Russian military presence? It has an air base in Khmeimim. It has a naval presence that goes back to the early '70s in Tartus, in Lattakia province. All of this is now up in the air. The Russians claim that they want to negotiate with the new government. But given the role that the Russian military played in brutalizing the Syrian population over the last decade, it's very questionable that this basis will be able to stay. However, I don't see a direct positive impact on the battlefield in Ukraine. The Russian forces are not living through Ukrainian defenses. Russia has an advantage on the battlefield. And with its resources being pulled back into Russia, most likely all of the focus will be on bringing Russia into the best possible position on the negotiation table.",

It was unhappily living with the devil that they know being the Assad family and the Ba'ath Party regime in Syria,rather than the devil they don't know, which is possibly chaos. So the first move is to destroy everything what can be potentially dangerous to security of Israel. And that's being not the small arms, but the long range missiles, planes, all of the hardware that the Syrian army has abandoned and stashed. So all of the depots that Israel has knocked out could end up in the arms of -- like in the hands of a really dangerous groups or in the black market and ultimately go to Gaza and go to various places and be turned against Israel. So they knocked that out as well as the fleet. I think the two moves that you need to watch is how much Israel will try to fortify the land that they have taken from Syria and how durable will be Israeli presence there.

It is an extraordinary moment not only for the history that is being made as the Israeli prime minister walked into this courthouse and then began testifying in his own defense, but also because of the moment at which it comes with Israel facing a multi-front war. That was part of the reason why the Israeli prime minister sought to delay this very moment of testifying in this case, unsuccessfully, though, as the judges ultimately ruled that he would have to show up to testify in his own defense, a process that could take several weeks. We expect that the prime minister will testify as many as three times a week for as long as six hours per day, initially beginning with questions from his own defense attorneys, who have been giving him a lot of running room here to make comments about foreign policy, accusations against the media, as he really tries to make his own case. But then the more serious cross-examination will come from the prosecution. And there are three cases that are involved in the trial that the prime minister has been facing for four years now. They are Case 1,000, Case 2,000, and Case 4,000, all of them effectively boiling down to allegations of corruption, that the Israeli prime minister offered favors to wealthy businessmen in exchange for more favorable media coverage or in exchange for lavish gifts, some several hundred thousand dollars in champagne bottles, in jewelry, and other gifts that these businessmen allegedly provided. Now, the prime minister and his attorneys, of course, maintain that he is innocent.

Donald Trump is, of course, essentiallythreatening to fire the existing FBI director, Christopher Wray, even though Wray is serving for a 10-year term. He has three years left on that term and is starting to push him out with someone who's been very loyal to him and his agenda, Kash Patel. Despite that controversial move, Republicans, in a lot of ways, are falling in line behind what Donald Trump wants to do with the FBI. Also with Tulsi Gabbard. She is someone who has been picked by Donald Trump to be the director of National Intelligence. But even her views on Syria and on Russia have caused a lot of concerns within the ranks, the moment no Republicans are coming out and opposing her, which is why the Trump team and Republican supporters of Trump believe that ultimately he will get most, if not all, of these nominations ultimately confirmed.

In 2011, people took to the streets in peaceful protests. They were met with violent repression. That turned into an armed rebellion and that civil war. The regime used some of its most horrific tactics in Darayya. It was besieging, bombing and starving the civilian population and the people of Darayya into surrender. And you see the scale of destruction here. And it's just so hard to imagine what people went through. And speaking to residents of Darayya, people who had to leave their homes years ago, they say that most of the destruction we're seeing was caused by barrel bombs. This was used a lot by the regime in different areas. These are crude, unguided munitions where they pack explosives into barrels and just drop them from the skies. And you can see what this has caused. And you can think back and imagine that there were civilians, that there were women and children here. And speaking to people, they say that their sacrifice, all that they went through, is worth it. Because they say now they finally have the chance at handing over a different, and you in a free Syria, they say to their children.

PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia's air force played a major role in helping Bashar al-Assad turn the tide at the height of Syria's civil war and push rebel forces out of much of the country. Also making Vladimir Putin one of the most influential players in the Middle East. And Moscow maintains not just a major air base in Syria, but also its only port in the Mediterranean Sea, where Putin's navy conducted large-scale exercises just last week. But the Russians acknowledge the future of their military presence in Syria is now uncertain. And their capacity to influence Syria's future appears limited, Putin's foreign spy chief seemingly acknowledging. The situation is obviously complicated, he says. The thing is, Syria is a country composed of many diverse parts, and whether various factions represented in the opposition are able to reach an accord will, in many ways, define the fate of the Syrian people and Syria as a state. The Russians say they are in touch with the armed groups now controlling Syria, and while Moscow says it currently does not see the security of its bases here threatened, its forces have been placed on alert.

Netanyahu said he was astonished by the absurdity and the injustice of being brought to trial, but vowed to puncture what he called fabrications and baseless accusations. The court says he has to show up to give evidence three days a week. Time now for The Exchange. We want to bring in an expert in Middle Eastern affairs and a former member of the Israeli Parliament, Ksenia Svetlova, is the executive director of ROPES, a Regional Organization for Peace, Economics and Security. And a non-resident senior research fellow at the Atlantic Council. Ksenia, it is really good to see you. So former prime ministers, former presidents have been prosecuted, they have been convicted, they have even served jail time, but this is the first time that a sitting prime minister is facing trial right now and taking the stand, the prosecution rest of the case over the summer. A reminder, this case began four years ago and ultimately culminating with something that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been delaying, delaying, delaying for many, many years. And his critics would say that he's weakened and really tested the judicial system in Israel along the way here. But you view this as a rather optimistic moment for the judicial system to hold, to show that everyone is to be held accountable under law. Walk us through why.",

But, obviously, as you point out as well, time has caught up with him. Here he is having to testify. When you think about what the next few months and years hold, if he is convicted, he will of course have to resign. He may even end up going to jail. When you think about the Israelis having to go through yet another election, I mean, Bianna and I were just talking about how many elections Israelis have gone through over the past four or five years. I believe it's at least five, if not more. What does that mean for political instability in the country at a time when you're juggling not just the war in Gaza, you've also got instability in Syria that, of course, Israel shares the border with? And then you've also got what's happening in Lebanon. Yes, there is a ceasefire happening right now, but it is extremely fragile.

And this is what I need to do in the midst of all of this drama? Well, his opponents say to him a simple thing. If you're able to fire Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, in the middle of the war and to replace him with another Minister of Defense, who has less experience, who has actually zero military experience, then you can also do the trial and you can also do the elections. Now, I'm afraid that it will not be happening so fast for the simple reason the testimony of Netanyahu, the cross examination, all of these processes might take a lot of time. How much time? We are talking about years here. We are talking at least about a couple of years ahead of us of the continuation of the trial. And then there will be, of course, you know, a possibility for appeal and the sentencing. So this whole process might take three to four years. This is according to Israel top legal experts. So we are not looking today at any quick, you know, reelection or resigning from the prime minister. Theoretically, yes, this is what might happen. But since the trial might be dragged for quite some time, I think that we will go to the election before any of this will happen. And then Netanyahu will also have to leave the results.

You can also talk to us as a Russia expert and as somebody who actually foresaw the fall of the Assad regime, whereas many others, many other experts around the world were blindsided by the lightning pace that we saw Assad flee the country.
