And some communities that are along that area remain uninhabitable to this day as a result of the nuclear meltdown -- the leaking from the reactor. And so, that triggered a lot of fears here in Japan. Now, in the end, the tsunami -- the major tsunami warning that was issued -- the first one, by the way, since that disaster well over a decade ago -- it turned out to be much smaller waves. And yet, still, this is an extraordinarily devastating quake for Japan, which has some of the most stringent building codes in the world. And the pictures that we're seeing of roads caving, houses flipped over, and dozens of people killed, it just speaks to the fact that this first -- these first couple of days of 2024 are very trying, indeed, for the people of Japan. A very resilient people though, Kasie. They've been through a lot of disasters in the past and they know how to get through this.

The crash took place outside the Kodak Center in Rochester where about 1,000 people were attending a concert. As people were crossing the street, one car hit another car sending both into a group of pedestrians and two other vehicles. First responders found at least a dozen gasoline canisters inside the car that caused the crash. Let's bring in CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem on this. Juliette, good morning to you. What do you make of this? We don't have a lot of details about it but there were at least a dozen gas canisters in his car.

So, the hard -- the concert hall -- presumably, it's a sophisticated one like this -- is going to have extensive security in terms of cameras. In terms of how you enter -- the kind of security you have when you enter. Lots of law enforcement presence depending on the nature of the concert.But a concert is one you, in preparedness efforts, you kind of don't worry about because you know how to fortify it. This is on the outside where things become softer so to speak. That there is fewer law enforcement. There is probably not much in terms of investigations of the car. Some concert facilities may look into cars before they can get close to the facility. We don't know what their security posture is. So that's the kind of thing that also they're going to learn in Rochester -- sort of how close could it get and why. But the Kodak Center is in -- I know the center. It is in sort of an area that has public commerce as well as public streets. It's not one of these isolated facilities where you have a half-mile drive, say, to get to the stadium. So it would be hard to fully fortify. So those are all the aspects that they're looking at now. I have to say I've been doing this a long time. I'm not the first -- you know, I don't -- I don't scream terrorism but the combination of the amount of explosives he had with the rental aspect, which we know from previous terror incidents is a tactic used if the person thinks they can try to get away, is suspicious.

There's two brigades of reservists who have been stationed in the north and central part of Gaza -- they are being withdrawn and demobilized. And then another three brigades of regular army who are also being withdrawn.It should be said one of the things that -- one of the pressures on the Israeli government is the pressure of the economy. Because when you take this many troops -- and each brigade represents about 4,000 troops. When you take this many troops out of the Israeli economy and commit them into the war that means that the Israeli economy suffers, especially in a country the size of Israel. So they will be returning home. Another thing that will be happening later on this week is that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to stop in Israel on a Middle East tour and probably reinstate the U.S. position that Israel should shift the phase of this war away from the massive bombing campaign that we've seen and more towards targeted operations -- Kasie.",
