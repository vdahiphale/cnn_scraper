      "sentences": "Well, Phil, Poppy, a lot of different tactics being used on the ground and, frankly, in the air. One of the ones that we have been speaking about all morning is that police are now using a broadcast message that was recorded by Danelo Cavalcante's mother. It's in Portuguese, and they are playing that message from helicopters and from vehicles on the road in the search area. And it's really a plea from his mother to say surrender, turn yourself in. That's just one of the tactics.But we've also seen a lot of Pennsylvania state police troopers with their long guns out, standing guard in a lot of different areas just south of the prison where we are and where that escape happened six days ago. And I just want to note, Phil, like you said, we just got that update from the district attorney's office that this manhunt for this inmate, this escaped inmate, Cavalcante, has expanded. And there are biproducts that have happened because of that. Two school districts, like you said, have closed. The Kennett Consolidated School District, the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District as well. Both of those school districts citing that the search situation has evolved. Now, after we heard that announcement from these school districts, we heard from the D.A.'s office. They are going to have a press conference at 8:30, so really just the next 30 minutes or so, to give an update on this situation. And I just want to emphasize why this expanding search radius is important, Phil and Poppy, because really throughout the weekend, law enforcement officials have been emphatic that Cavalcante has been near the prison in this area, has not gotten that farther, and they've been focused on a two-mile stretch. If this is true that this manhunt is expanding, that will be the first time since this all started that this search will take place further than really this two-mile radius around the area. And I just want to drill down and really emphasize to viewers, this area around the prison here in Chester County, it's very diverse when it comes to the terrain. There are a lot of wooded areas. There are a lot of creeks, there are even cornfields. And police have said that has made this search incredibly difficult because there are just a lot of places for this escaped inmate and this convicted murderer to hide. Phil, Poppy?",

But in the ties that it will help increase between North Korea and Russia, it's mutually beneficial to both in Russia getting weapons and ammunition. It opens the possibility of a kind of conveyor belt. If China doesn't want to supply weapons directly, it can supply them to North Korea and then, lo and behold, they could, in turn, be supplied to Russia.But from Kim Jong Un's point of view, for years and year of being dependent on China, for example, people estimate North Korea gets 90 percent of its oil from China, now he has got a real possibility to open up oil and gas coming from Russia. And in this complex relationship between Russia and China, while they are growing closer and closer, Russia is worried about China's aspirations in the region. For example, the critical naval base and port city of Vladivostok right to the east of North Korea was ruled by China as recently as the mid-19th century. So Putin gains by tightening the relationship between North Korea and Russia. Kim Jong Un gains now by being able to play the two off against each other as his grandfather used to do back in the days of the cold war. And overall, I think it's another example of the U.S. being asleep while significant geopolitical developments are underway.",

I guess my question is, how does that happen, right? If you look at allies in the region, while many people look at the current administration's policy as being -- the Indo-Pacific policy as being entirely China-based, when you look at the relationship between Japan and South Korea that has formed and evolved over the course of the last couple of years, you could say that that also has to do with North Korea as well.

And if he supports the International Criminal Court, as he appeared to do in that statement, I hope he reaffirms that and makes clear why he thinks the ICC is a such a good something. This is something that ultimately is going to have to be resolved either by the Russians themselves or by the Ukrainians, and the main point is that Ramaswamy has made other statements about this war and about what he is going to do to try and solve it. Like Trump said, he would put Zelenskyy and Putin in a room, and he'd have it solved in 24 hours. Ramaswamy is going to go to Moscow, convince Putin to break the alliance with China and end the war that way. I mean, they might as well be in kindergarten talking about a very complex situation.
