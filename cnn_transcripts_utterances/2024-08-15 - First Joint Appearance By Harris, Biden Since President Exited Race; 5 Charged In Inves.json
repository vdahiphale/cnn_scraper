The fact that the majority of Americans see former President Trump as better equipped to handle the economy than they did President Biden. That they don't think the economy is working for them.And so they're obviously trying to keep that narrative in play and bolster it while they're trying, as we've noted, she's trying to separate where she can, but we're going to keep seeing them together like this. ERIN PERRINE, FORMER PRESS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Yes, it's Joe Biden kind of begins this legacy tour towards the end of this presidency. I'm curious how often they're going to put them on stage because the visual of the two of them together is going to be good for Republicans who are trying to say, you remember that time that groceries went up and that everything became more expensive and life was a little bit harder because these two were at the helm? They're still standing together hand in hand. Give them that visual of the two of them together and Republicans can run with that. Donald Trump has an opportunity to talk about the economy here. Because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is set to expire, some of it to expire and sunset in 2025. There was going to be tax policy coming up in this -- after this election cycle, no matter what.",

You remember when the government said you keep more of your own paycheck? Do you remember when we lowered taxes for the American people so that you could afford more groceries and chips didn't feel like the luxury item that you feel like now? He can talk about that and he can say, I did it before and in 2025 we can do it again and we can add to it by putting on no tip on tax or no tax on tips and no tax on Social Security benefits, right? He has that message right there and it's tangible. Hit them with it and use the visual of the two of them together. Tie this all economically together.",

They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking great danger to Mr. Perry but they did it anyways. In the end, these defendants were more interested in profiting off Mr. Perry than caring for his wellbeing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We also learned that Matthew Perry as we have all heard about, he struggled with drug addiction, but he relapsed in September of 2023, the U.S. Attorney said.And at that point was actually getting treated for depression, that led to him relapsing. And then when the doctors wouldn't get it more, he went to the street. And that is what led to these five people being charged. And just to give you an idea of how close these people were to Matthew Perry. One of them was his live in assistant. I just want you to listen to the names of the people here. We're talking about Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who at one point, according to the U.S. attorney, actually shared a text message with another doctor saying, quote, \"I wonder how much this moron will pay\" and went on to charge him at one point $55,000 in cash for 20 vials of ketamine. Also the other lead defendant here, Jasveen Sangha, who is the ketamine queen that you were talking about, she's also charged for running paraphernalia, selling other drugs out of her location in the valley as well. And also Dr. Mark Chavez, who used to actually own an ketamine clinic. He is also part of this, as well as Eric Fleming, who is a street broker, and then that live in assistant Kenneth Iwamasa. All of them were playing a part. In fact, Iwamasa, they say, actually injected ketamine into Matthew Perry the day that he died. Just really looking at some details here of the people who were involved, how close they were, and they're saying they took a long time to take down this whole cycle of people who were involved here because this, if you remember, Matthew Perry died in October of last year. We do know that three of these people have plea agreements and two of them were arrested this morning and are -- will be arraigned later on today. But just to get an idea of what they're saying, they were looking at why this was so important and why they're going after these people. Take a listen to U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada here.

And then there is also a bunch of railroads that run along approximately like this. And there's several others right here.But if the Ukrainians cut off the railroads, that will prevent a lot of logistical support for the Russian forces in all of these areas right here. If they cut the gas pipeline, that also prevents about 50 percent of Russia's gas exports from reaching customers in Europe. So there are economic reasons as well as military reasons to go into this area and to actually make something out of it. Because if they do that, then it gives the Ukrainians more leverage. The more territory they get, the more leverage they have for any potential peace negotiations or some kind of armistice of that type.",

He was not only on Trump's cabinet, but was also in charge of the GOP policy platform released at last month's Republican National Convention.Now, I want you to take a look at this video. Vought thought he was talking to the relatives of a wealthy investor, but it turns out the meeting was set up and recorded by an undercover journalist and an actor for the Center for Climate Reporting, a British organization. Now, he says Trump's rejection of Project 2025, it's just politics and Vought explained he's creating a so-called shadow agency, multiple shadow agencies, getting regulations, memos and executive orders ready for action on the first day of a Trump presidency. He also believes in expanding presidential powers and that the president has the authority to use the military to maintain law and order. Take a listen to how he talks about why Trump is publicly trying to separate himself from Project 2025.
