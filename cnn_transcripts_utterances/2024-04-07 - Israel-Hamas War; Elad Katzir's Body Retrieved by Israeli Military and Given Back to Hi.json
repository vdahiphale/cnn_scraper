For six months of war in Gaza and calls are growing for the ouster of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Details of the latest protests and whether more aid could soon reach the people of Gaza. Meanwhile, survivors of the October 7th massacre in Israel are reuniting and revisiting their shared experience. What they say about their healing journey and what lies ahead. And the U.S. is on high alert, anticipating an attack on U.S. or Israeli assets. The latest threat from Iran's top general after a deadly strike in Syria. The Israeli military says, it recovered the body of hostage Elad Katzir in Gaza and returned it to his family. Katzir's family says he was alive and seen in photos after he was kidnapped. Now, they're demanding that Israel do more to bring home all of the hostages, so too are the families of a number of other hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHARON KALDERON, SISTER-IN-LAW OF ISRAEL HOSTAGE OFER KALDERON: Today, we got a very bad message about Elad Katzir. He was in -- he was hostage for three months. He could handle three months, and then they killed him. We don't know what about all the rest. This is the time, not a day more, this is the time to bring them back. All of them as soon as possible. We have to bring them back home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It does appear that there's a chance for some sort of progress, but of course, the devil is in the details. Now, we've seen, as you mentioned at the top of the show, there is mounting pressure on the Israeli prime minister from the Israeli public to make progress on a hostage deal. Keeping in -- in the position of the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu until now has been that basically military pressure will make Hamas give up the hostages. But clearly as a tactic, that has not worked. The only time a significant amount of hostages in Gaza have been released is as a result of negotiations. So, perhaps I think with the world community's patience quickly running out with Israel's campaign in Gaza that perhaps this pressure will result in some sort of progress. Anna.",

In fact, they released a fairly clear picture, hoping to generate some leads. Police say that their suspect entered the Burlington, Vermont building on Friday morning. They say that he allegedly sprayed some sort of accelerant at the entrance to Senator Sanders' office and then lit the fire with staffers inside.Now, fortunately, the building's fire suppression system, mainly the sprinklers, were able to kick in and extinguished most of those flames. Fortunately, no injuries reported. Damage reportedly fairly minimal. And also, Senator Sanders was not in the office at the time. The senator's office is actually located a multi-story, multi-office building. The Burlington Fire Department battalion chief telling my colleague Maria Campanelli (ph) that they're still unsure how the suspect was actually able to access that space. The battalion chief adding that the building is supposed to be secured, not generally open to the public. So, there's still some questions about that. The United States Capitol Police along with the Senate sergeant at arms working with local authorities as they investigate, though they still have not been able to determine a motive. It's important to point out that the U.S. Capitol Police investigated more than 8,000 threats against lawmakers in 2023, and that is a figure that is up from the previous year. So, no threats against lawmakers are certainly not new. It is certainly an alarming incident. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
