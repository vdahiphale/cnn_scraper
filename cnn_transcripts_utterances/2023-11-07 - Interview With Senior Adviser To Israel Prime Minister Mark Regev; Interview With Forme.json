      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up.Since the October 7th massacres in Israel and over 240 hostages held by Hamas, I'm joined by Sharone Lifshitz, whose mother was released, but whose father remains in captivity. Then, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will control Gaza's security for the foreseeable future. I ask his adviser, Mark Regev, how? Why? Plus, Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children, that warning from the U.N. chief. Former Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad joins me. And, as the Trump trials continue, Colorado's secretary of state debriefs Hari Sreenivasan on the state's attempt to disqualify Trump from running again. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. One month ago today, just as the sun rose on October 7th, Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel. The government says 1,400 people were killed, mostly civilians. The worst massacre in the country's 75-year history. And it launched its most aggressive operation yet in Gaza. With now over 10,000 killed there, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. It's a death toll that even the U.S., Israel's biggest supporter, is finding harder to explain. These are pictures of memorials tonight in Tel Aviv, marking a month since the attacks. And last night, the faces of hostages kidnapped by Hamas were projected on the outer wall of Jerusalem's old city. To this day, 240 people remain in captivity. 86-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz is one of just four hostages who's been released so far. But her husband, Oded, is still being held. And I've been speaking to their daughter, Sharone, about the family's ordeal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

My father always was against that. He thought that we shouldn't do it, but we did it because the first contract that a country has with its citizens is to protect them. We have 240 hostages, civilians, babies, children, mothers, elderly people like my father in their 80s. This is not an acceptable thing to just let them be collateral damage. (END VIDEO CLIP) It's a powerful message, and we'll bring you my full interview with Sharone Lifshitz later this week. But next, the U.N. secretary general says that Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children. Israel's incursion has already left more than 4,000 children dead, according to the health authorities in Ramallah. In his first interview since October 7th, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells ABC that his government is considering \"tactical little pauses to enable humanitarian goods into Gaza, but no ceasefire.\" He also revealed plans to control the enclave security indefinitely.

That doesn't mean that Israel is there to govern the Gazans.

But if you bring up the Palestinian Authority, I want to say what needs to be said, we're a month today since those terrible October 7th massacres and the Palestinian Authority has still refused to condemn them. And I'm sorry, their silence speaks volumes. And for them to say that they're a peace partner, and at the same time refusing to condemn the sort of atrocious violence.

But let's be clear, for the last three and a half weeks, Israel has been calling on Gaza civilians to relocate from the north to move to the south. Gazans have voted with their feet. Over 800,000 people have taken our advice and moved to the south out of harm's way. We're establishing together with the Americans and others this safe zone in the southern part of the Gaza Strip close to the Mediterranean coast in the west there. It's in proximity to the Rafah Crossing. We are making no limitations on the water, food and medicine coming in for these people. We're trying to keep them out of harm's way. But what has to be said, Christiane, is that if Israel is making a maximum effort to keep civilians out of harm's way, the Hamas authorities are doing the opposite. Hamas is telling people not to leave. They're ordering people not to leave. They're actually putting up physical barriers to prevent people from leaving. And why? Because Hamas doesn't give a hoot about the civilian population of Gaza. Hamas wants to fight to the very last Gazan civilian, that's why they built their military infrastructure under hospitals, under urban areas.

Let's all say enough death, enough killing and really come together and see what -- how -- what is the path that we make sure that none of us have to go through this again. That path is peace. We're ready to engage with all our partners to start immediately on that path. But Israel is not there yet. It has to be there. Otherwise, it's hurting itself as much as it's hurting everybody else.

Any harm that went to civilians, that targets civilians, putting civiliansin harm's way knowingly is a crime under international law. And to the extent that happened, what happened of it, what may have happened is to be squarely condemned without any hesitation or equivocation whatsoever. That's our position. I'll go further. The -- whenever we get to the day after, and I hope we get there sooner than later. Obviously, with all that's going on, it is very important for there to be an international commission of inquiry, to really look into all of the crimes that have been committed. And anyone who's found to really have put any civilian's life at risk, harm the civilian in any way, manner, shape or form, or put the life of civilians and harm's way knowingly is a criminal under international law. We should be very clear on this. And by that same ruler and standard, what has been going on since October 7 against our people in Gaza falls very much into that category. War crimes are being committed. I've heard a lot to respond to in what your guests had to say, including casting doubt on the numbers and saying that 10,000, they are not all civilians because we killed so many Hamas, et cetera. But let's just agree, settle one thing. 4,000 children who are killed and buried alive cannot possibly have been combatants. Not to mention, of course, other segments of populations. So, to try to really mitigate or make it look like not a whole lot has happened by way of harming civilians in Gaza, all one has to do is look at the sheer numbers and travesty with all in terms of how devastating this has been, by any standard, by any historical standard, a cabinet official. I mean, he's talking about what the P.A. said or didn't say, but a cabinet officer of the current government of Israel spoke of the need, maybe for Israel to use even nuclear bombs against Gaza. Well, let me just say that hides the fact that so far, more Palestinians have perished or were injured in the course of what has happened over the course of past month, that many times over the number of fatalities and those injured in the nuclear bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in August of 1945. That's what we're looking at. That's the scale of devastation and aggression that Israel has been committing. So, yes, to investigating all of the crimes, definitely. And no one should be held immune. And I think a lot of what is going on -- key reason why it has been happening repeatedly is because there was very little effort made to really bring those who are responsible for crimes to account.",

As a matter of fact, in a way to respond to something that was said by yourguest about the impossibility of envisioning a political process that might include Hamas. I remind everybody that for the past three decades, exactly, Israel has been pursuing or in a process, supposedly, that was launched in September 1993, to get to a peaceful resolution of this conflict with the PLO, once held as the absolute enemy, the party that would never sit together with, would not shake hands with, et cetera, et cetera. So, we have seen this before. Now, if they're saying now that they cannot envision a situation where Hamas can be a part of an overall Palestinian political polity, if you will, that could negotiate a resolution with them, well, what have they done exactly with a Palestinian counterpart who had taken on very serious commitments in 1993, A, recognizing the right of the State of Israel to exist and in peace and security. And B, to renounce violence. What they have done really actually to make it possible for that counterpart, which then described as a partner in peace at the time over three decades. What do we have to show for this exactly? People look at Hamas now and say, well, they are strong. You're right. The one -- the national elections in 2006 by an outright majority. They have since then continue to enjoy sizable support because they are aligned in terms of what they say, their positions are with the overall sentiments of the Palestinian public, not only in Palestine, but throughout the world. And that is at least in part due to the fact that that project, which your guest was talking about, two-state solution, pursuit of that in the way it has been pursued for three decades failed miserably. The idea that the commitments taken by the PLO, including commitment to renounce violence really fell flat on its face. That's why Palestinians looking at what's going on came to the conclusion that it's not only Hamas. That's just a real mistake to think that way. And it's not only Islamic jihad. It's not only the factions that up until now are not a part of the Palestine Liberation Organization, but it's many, many independents. It's the youth in Palestine. Talk to them and see how many of them still really believe or harbor any thought of the possibility of their emerging from this process that has been modeled for a very long time, more than online support a state that they can live in with dignity. I mean, that's just really nonsense. And so, to now say that things cannot happen so long as Hamas is there when what that really means, hundreds of civilians, yes, getting killed every day, not to mention the massive destruction that has taken place and will take place. And I do not know -- for (INAUDIBLE), I don't know what will remain of Gaza after all is said and done if Israel is going to be -- is to continue to be allowed to persecute this campaign in the manner that just been described the way it has been.",

Youknow, when there are questions about the law or the U.S. constitution, then it's appropriate for a judge to weigh in and the legal process play out. You know, supporters, but more pointily, the former president, as soon as this lawsuit was filed, started to shout anywhere he could, oh, this is election interference. What was election interference was the January 6th insurrection, his team's attempts to interfere with the electoral process, the fake electoral scheme, his conversations about seizing voting equipment. That's what election interference truly is. Determining whether someone is disqualified by a clear provision in the U.S. constitution is how a constitutional republic should work.",

And lawyers for the petitioners actually said in an interview that one of the reasons it was filed here in the State of Colorado is because we have that law in place, allowing voters to challenge certification and having that challenge go to a court of law. So, I would say that's one of the big reasons our laws allow an easier challenge to qualification than in other states.",

You know, this provision is in the U.S. constitution for a reason.

The lawsuit is filed under the premise to bar me as secretary of state in my official capacity from putting Donald Trump on the ballot. And when it comes down to the politics, when we have questions of how our elections work, how the U.S. constitution functions, how our laws work, again, my job is to follow the law, uphold the constitution, and listen to a court. I do believe Donald Trump is dangerous to our democracy. His lies and misinformation about the elections have fueled voter suppression laws across this nation, has incited attacks on election infrastructure, including three here in the State of Colorado. Has led to an unprecedented level of vitriol and threats to election officials, which has caused election officials across the nation to step down. I do believe he's a threat to democracy. I also believe, in this case, whether he has disqualified himself from taking office. Given how Colorado law works, it's in the hands of a court. And honestly, I think that's good. A court should be holding an investigation and determining what she thinks. That's a necessary step in the climate we see ourselves in today.",

That's why I say the president is dangerous to democracy. The fact that his rhetoric and actions incite violence against election workers is troubling. That's not how American elections can work. In those words, they can lead to violence. We saw the attempted kidnapping of the governor of Michigan. The attack against Paul Pelosi, the attack on the U.S. Capitol. So, this isn't a joke. What's happening on this attack against democracy is real. For me, personally, I take the threat seriously and take precautions, but I won't be intimidated and I won't be stopped. And the last thing I would say on this, all those threats that I've received since the filing of this lawsuit is from me being a defendant. I actually haven't even taken any action. And that really shows how volatile the national dangerous rhetoric is against election workers and often at a heightened degree against women elected officials.",
