You are watching former President Trump's motorcade as he makes his way from his Bedminster Golf Estate to the Newark Airport where he will ultimately then head to Miami to face charges tomorrow and arraign that. I want to bring in now CNN Correspondent Carlos Suarez.He is actually outside of the court in Miami. Carlos, as we know, security, they're already taking precautions to try to make sure that this all goes off very safely. We know that barricades have already been put up. What else are you seeing?",

      "sentences": "Yes. That's exactly right, Rahel. So, we are on the west side of the federal courthouse where it's become quite clear in the last couple of hours that law enforcement is starting to make the necessary preparations ahead of the former president's appearance in federal court here on Tuesday. The Federal Protective Service out here, they are among the group that is really in charge of making sure that this courthouse remains safe.Earlier today, we saw them put out some yellow tape. Trying to close off a part of this courthouse. They've also put up these barricades around the perimeter of the building. Now, the city of Miami, the Miami Police Department is expected to detail their safety and security plan at a news conference here in downtown Miami at two o'clock this afternoon. We're told that the chief of police for the city of Miami is going to give us a better sense of just how many officers they plan on having out here. The mayor of Miami is also expected to talk about just some of the preparations that they're going to have for any of these supporters of the president -- of the former president who might show up to this location. It is still unclear at this hour exactly where all of these people might be put ahead of the president's arrival here later today. We have seen some Trump supporters out here walking around this property. They're holding up signs. They've got their Make America Great Again hats on. The rain out here though, has pushed some of these folks out. There's not a whole lot of coverings out here. This part of downtown Miami, I will say is quite known for its security because there are a number of federal buildings here. You've got the brand-new federal courthouse building. Across the street is the old federal courthouse. The State Attorney's Office is over there as well. And then you've got the detention center here. And so, a lot of the security that we saw going into the weekend and into today was something that you would expect considering just the number of federal buildings in this area, though it is becoming quite clear at least from what we're seeing right here on the ground, that a lot of law enforcement personnel are moving things into place. They're starting to get a lot more folks out here in anticipation of some of the crowds that we may see tomorrow, guys.",

He used to run the Special Operations Division crime suppression. So, he's not just the chief. He's a -- he's a hands-on leader. He said it's all hands on deck for the Miami PD. They have about 1400 cops. Everybody who's working today and tomorrow will have some role in this, whether it's answering calls for the rest of the city or the large group that they're going to dedicate to this. But he said they're ready to surge. They have the help from Miami-Dade County. They also have 34 towns in that area where they have MO use with that where they can get them to contribute cops. What he's talking about is you know they're prepared for a crowd. And he said you know it could be a few thousand maybe up to 5000. And he said --",

So, they're very confident about, you know, getting him motorcaded from one end to the other, into the building out of the building. And when he leaves, they expect him to go back to the airport.

These conversations that would have occurred between -- that we know occurred because they have phone records between Trump and Nauta in terms of this whole conspiracy around hiding evidence, right, moving boxes of documents, having the former president review them and pull out what he wants, and then put them in the storage room before the lawyers going to go see what's there pursuant to the subpoena. They want that testimony.And not only that. We have to remember. Walt Nauta is the body man. He's around the president for the past however many years. So, if you get him on board, he's not just going to the witnessed number one in this documents case, he can tell you all about what happened after the election leading up to January 6, and a whole lot more. So, he is someone they really, really want. They took a shot at him before and I think they'll take another shot at him again, for sure.",
