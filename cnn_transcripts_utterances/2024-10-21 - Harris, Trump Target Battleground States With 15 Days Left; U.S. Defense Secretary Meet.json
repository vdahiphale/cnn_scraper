U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump only have 15 days left until Election Day. Any moment now, Trump will speak at a rally in Greenville, North Carolina. The Republican nominee has spent the day campaigning in the key southern battleground state there. Earlier, Trump spoke with victims of Hurricane Helene near the city of Asheville. Many families are still recovering from the devastation left behind from the storm. Outside of North Carolina, Trump's rhetoric over the weekend reached a new extreme. Topics ranged from, we'll call them comments, about the late golfer Arnold Palmer, to profanity at Harris and doubling down about Democrats and being, quote, the enemy from within. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  So you'd have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough, that you just can't take it anymore. We can't stand you. You're a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) vice president. Arnold Palmer was all man. He took showers with the other pros. They came out of there. They said, oh my god. But when you look at shifty Schiff and some of the others -- yeah, they are to me the enemy from within. (END VIDEO CLIPS)",

Certainly in these closing days, expect Donald Trump to really double down on what has been his message. I know people don't like to think this far back, but it has really been his message since 2016. He goes out there, says what he wants to say. He goes out there, he tries to tear down his opponents, tries to really push them into the ground with the idea that he can get his supporters behind them, and that he can win.However, it is a very risky strategy specifically with some of the things that he's saying right now. And those few voters that we believe that are left, that could tip this election, those voters, of course, living in Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina -- North Carolina, as you said today, he will also be in Georgia and in Las Vegas later this week, Donald Trump will, but we really are in these closing moments here, Omar.",

That's what Donald Trump is doing.Meanwhile, Kamala Harris is doing a little bit differently. She's trying to pick off Republicans in trying to pull them into -- into the fold at the same time, trying to shore up some of her own vulnerabilities, but Donald Trump right now, it looks like, Omar, is, in some ways given up on the women vote. That Republican women vote that Nikki Haley vote that we talked a lot about this past year in place of really just doubling down and trying to get his MAGA supporters to the polls.",

She's holding a series of moderated conversations across blue wall states today by her side, as I was just talking about former House Republican Liz Cheney. And earlier today, Harris made a vow to Pennsylvania voters that her administration will, quote, not be a continuation of President Biden's.Up next on the campaign swing or the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin. CNN's Eva McKend is tracking Harris's campaign stops, joins us live from Washington, D.C. So, what more can you tell us about Harris's discussion with Liz Cheney, but also about the strategy around it? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  So, Omar, if you listen to them, this is heavy on country over party. They are essentially arguing that the former president lacks the temperament to return to the White House, that you can't trust him with your family's most sensitive matters, so with the nuclear codes, that he is its fundamentally unfit for the job. And, Omar, this is a very different argument then debating specific policy matters because there are going to be Republicans like in that audience in Pennsylvania who may not agree with Vice President Harris's tax policy, with where she stands on immigration, a whole host of issues but if the election is instead about the fundamentals, about democracy, about the existential threat. They think that they have a clear case there. And, you know, there is disagreement in Democratic corners about this. Some Democrats will argue the campaign instead would just two weeks to go should make this about a base election and using all of their resources to juice up Black voters, to make sure that there is just record number of Black turnout in places like North Carolina and Georgia. But the campaign will tell you that its a both/and strategy, that they're doing that. She did souls to the polls events for faith-based voters in Georgia over the weekend. But they also think there is a lot of value in doing Republican for Harris events as well, that there are Nikki Haley voters out there that would otherwise just stay home.",

I want to expand this conversation with our political panel today. Joining me now is \"Axios\" political reporter Stef Kight. I also want to welcome \"Semafor\" reporter Shelby Talcott, both -- I mean, great to see you both. Thanks for being here. Shelby, I want to start with you because I know you recently spoke with some of Trump's senior communications advisors and I read through some of that conversation. I thought it was really interesting hearing how they look at sort of Trump's image and getting it out to the general public and various forms. And I wonder how you look at Trump's campaign stops in North Carolina today, for example, or recent campaign stops within the framework of some of what you talked about with his team. SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, \"SEMAFOR\":  Yeah. So his team's big thing when were talking about Donald Trump doing some of these podcasts and sort of new age immediate platforms is that they're trying to humanize him and they feel like these are areas where he can sit down and he can talk for an hour and he can show voters that he is a normal human being. He can push back on that narrative that we've heard so often from Kamala Harris and Democrats, which is, of course, that he is a threat to democracy. And so similarly, we've seen him do some of these campaign stops, like the McDonald's stop over the weekend that add to that narrative. So I think that's pretty clear that some of Donald Trump's campaign stops even in North Carolina, touring some of the hurricane damage it at the McDonald's stop, that is an effort to sort of humanize him to those voters.",

It's very clear that Harris and her campaign feel that it is imperative that she reach out to independent and potentially more conservative leaning voters, both in the kind of policies that she's been embracing this time around compared to where she was in 2019 and also when you look at where she's campaigning, the tone of her campaign, the fact that she's sitting down with Liz Cheney trying to convince voters that she is a real alternative option to the former president. And, you know, she has certainly tried to distance herself from someof her more progressive stances in the past, and that was really something that Republicans, when it first became clear that Harris was going to be at the top of the ticket. Republicans were very eager to tag her with that, too progressive, too extreme kind of attack and she has really been trying to avoid that getting stuck. She has been trying to move towards the middle, and appeal to those independent voters that she's going to need to convince in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin, I think it's notable that, you know, Harris and Trump are both spending time in states today that they really need to win if they're going to have a real path to victory.",

And those three things are things that his surrogates are often really good at talking about.Donald Trump talks about it as well. But then he gets off script and he makes these remarks like we were just discussing over the weekend. And that's sort of where his campaign struggles and he doesn't necessarily make it easy for his campaign. So when I talked to advisers, that's what they want to focus on.

A couple of times, she didn't really have a good answer and you've seen her -- her campaign, tried to clean up from that more recently. I think it's very notable though that we're looking at thesepresidential battleground states and seeing incumbent Democratic senators running away from their own party's presidential candidate and instead, even almost embracing Donald Trump. Both Senator Baldwin and Senator Casey include mentions of how they worked with Trump in recent ads. Some very interesting move to make this close to the election and it goes to show just how much Democrats feel like they need to show bipartisanship. They need to show that they are moderate senators in order to hold on to not only the red states, like Montana and Ohio, where incumbents are at risk, but also even in these battleground states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",

I mean, he recently talking about given away million dollars each day to registered voters in battleground states. There are legal experts that argue it could be illegal.

And so, when they hear Elon Musk, who oftentimes has similar rhetoric to Donald Trump, they might be put off.But then you have some of his hardcore voters, which is a really big base that Donald Trump is trying to make sure that they actually come out and vote it helps him in that sense.

So that's key here.But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also made it clear in a social media post afterwards what he was looking for once again, bringing up this idea that Ukraine is trying to convince the U.S. to allow it to use us made long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russia. That's been a longstanding campaign that they've had. That's become more and more public as they've tried to pressure the Biden administration to allow them to carry out those types of strikes? Unlikely they'll make any headway right now, especially with only 15 days until an election, but that remains a goal of Ukraine's. Austin was also there to get a better sense on the ground of what U.S. aid has done over the course of the past two-and-a-half years, and what Ukraine is looking for right now, what weapons it needs, and what helped the U.S. can give.

And then once again, trying to convince the U.S. to let them use -- to let Ukraine use that is U.S. made long-range weapons to strike deeper inside Russia.They've been trying to sort of beat down that door for quite some time now. It hasn't worked. We haven't seen the administration shift its position. But another key here is how the aid will continue even if the mechanism or the nature of U.S. aid changes. And to that effect, the U.S. has effectively tried to change the aid mechanism from a U.S.- centric one to more of a multinational NATO-based aid to Ukraine mechanisms, such that no matter who wins the election in just a few weeks, there will still be aid flowing to Ukraine as it fights back against Russia -- now, for nearly three years.",

He's a professor of military history at Ohio State University and a former aide to General David Petraeus. Thanks for being here. Look as Oren noted, Defense Secretary Austin has announced another $400 in aid for Ukraine, money for armored vehicles, air support, munitions. But the U.S. and other allies still aren't giving Ukraine the green light to use, you know, the U.S. provided long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. From your perspective, how important is that capability to Ukraine's war effort? COL. PETER MANSOOR, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Well, like it's key if we want this war to end with a Ukrainian victory rather than just a long, slogging stalemate, then Ukraine needs the ability to strike inside Russia where their supply bases are, where their air bases are, where their factories are. And so far, Putin's saber rattling of the nuclear card has worked. United States has, you know, said, don't use those weapons inside Russia.

And the election experts that we spoke to said that federal law makes it a crime to pay people to register to vote. You can't give the money. You can't give them a chance to win money through a lottery. Here's what the law says. We can look at it together, okay? Federal law, quote, whoever knowingly or willfully pays or offers to pay or accepts payment, either for registration to vote or to vote can face up to five years in prison. That's the law. Legal experts said that musk could be crossing the line, especially for people who heard about the cash prize, and then registered to vote that could be the most legally perilous part of this. We reached out to Elon Musk's super PAC for comment. They did not respond. And like I said, this doesn't mean he's getting indicted. If the Justice Department has a problem with what's going on. The logical next step would be for them to send something like a cease-and-desist letter. But, look, there is at least one former prosecutor who is calling this out and that's Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. He's a Democrat and he was the attorney general of Pennsylvania. Here's what he had to say yesterday about this situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Everyone, maybe you've noticed that the X platform and other social media companies aren't really doing nearly as much as they used to cut through election misinformation, safeguards that were there back in 2021, or they were there, I should say they back in 2021 when crowds stormed the U.S. Capitol. Platform suspended thousands of accounts and posts for spreading lies. Today, that's not happening and its got a lot to do with politics. CNN technology reporter Brian Fung joins me from Washington, D.C. So, Brian, experts who study election misinformation say their jobs have gotten harder since 2020. Why?",

I want to shift topics a bit here back to the Middle East to bring you some updates, including Israel saying it has killed a top Hezbollah member in Syria. The IDF says a strike took out the head of the militant groups money transfer unit in Damascus. Now, Syria says two people were killed in an attack on a vehicle, some of the aftermath there. The news comes after Israeli airstrikes hit more than 15 buildings in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, targeting what Israel says is a Hezbollah-linked financial network. And this was the scene in southern Beirut, just moments ago. We've -- we saw a large explosion. You see some of the smoke plume there rising over the city. For more, I want to bring in Jerusalem correspondent Jeremy Diamond, who is live in Tel Aviv for us. Jeremy, so what do we know about this Hezbollah-linked financial network Israel is targeting here?",

      "sentences": "Well, this marks a significant escalation in Israel's war in Gaza. We are seeing, of course, that for the first time, they are not going after just military targets, but instead this financial institution inside of Lebanon, which the Israeli government says is Hezbollah-linked and helps finance Hezbollah's activities.But we also know that it serves hundreds of thousands of civilians inside of Lebanon as well. And so, last night, the Israeli military went after several branches of this financial institution, targeting it in different parts of Lebanon. And what this is aimed at this is not just going after Hezbollah, but also doing what these really government has been doing in a variety of ways over the course of this campaign. And that is to try and bring the military pressure to bear on Hezbollah, but in a way that will actually put internal pressure on Hezbollah within Lebanese society. And in this case, it is going after Hezbollah's connections to the Shia community in Lebanon, which relies on this financial institution, which is provided with services linked to Hezbollah. [15:40:06] And so, the goal here, according to an Israeli intelligence official, is to shake the Shia community's trust in Hezbollah, just another effort by the Israeli military to try and bring more pressure to bear on Hezbollah in an effort to get them to agree to a ceasefire that would be more favorable to Israel's terms, not only agreeing to stop the fighting, to stop firing rockets into Israel, but also to move Hezbollah forces far north of the Israel-Lebanon border, something, of course, that Hezbollah has been unwilling to do so far.",

Today, we are hearing from multiple members of Netanyahu's governing coalition, including several ministers, as well as members of his own party who are not calling for an end to the war in Gaza, were not sensing an opportunity, but rather are calling for the continuation of fighting in Gaza and also calling to establish Israeli settlements inside of the Gaza Strip.Now, these really the prime minister himself has said that he -- there are no plans for Israel to establish Israeli settlements in Gaza, which there have not been since Israel remove those settlements back in 2005 under what was known as the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. But nonetheless, we are hearing from multiple members of his party, of his governing coalition, people who hold the keys to power in many ways, were keeping the Israeli prime minister in power, calling for these settlements at a time when the United States is trying to push for something very, very different. And so, obviously, it is quite a significant split-screen that we are seeing. And you couple that with the fact that we are seeing continued fighting in Gaza, Israel conducting a series of deadly airstrikes in northern Gaza yesterday that killed at least 87 people. The fighting continuing in Lebanon, it really doesn't seem like were heading I did for the kind of de-escalation that the United States is pushing for -- Omar.",
