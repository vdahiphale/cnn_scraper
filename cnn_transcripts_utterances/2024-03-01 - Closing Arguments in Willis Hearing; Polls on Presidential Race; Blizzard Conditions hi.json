The judge overseeing the Georgia election subversion case will then, after this, make a ruling that could significantly shake up proceedings moving forward against Donald Trump.CNN legal analyst, and former U.S. attorney, Michael Moore joins us now for more on this. What do you -- do you think, after all of this, and we'll listen for closing arguments today, Michael, that Fani Willis is in a better or worse position now than when this hearing -- when this whole thing began?",

And that is they've drawn some of the aspects of the investigation and the prosecution case into question. It doesn't have any bearing on whether or not the indictment is solid at this point, whether or not there will be motions that the judge will deny later on about dismissing, or at least the judge will consider them later on certain parts of the indictment. He's ruled on certain things like that.But this has cast the investigation and the prosecution itself into a little bit of a negative light. And so the question will be, was that financial benefit obtained? And some may argue that if the judge believes that the relationship between Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis began before his appointment, that the appointment and the subsequent length of the prosecution and the monies that - the significant amount of money, almost a million dollars between him and his law firm, that was paid for his work on the investigation was actually a benefit by allowing the DA to pay, you know, at the time her - her social acquaintance to send money to him and his law firm. And that may be an argument we hear today. I just don't -- I don't know how far they will go. But the crux of it will be, was there an actual conflict or has there been the appearance of a conflict or some impropriety that may call into question both the investigation and if there is a conviction at some point down the road, and I don't think it ever happens now before the election, but if there is a conviction at some point down the road, does the integrity of that conviction now be called into question?",

Do you see this as the giant deal that some do? HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: I do not, Mr. Berman, I do not. All right, this is the uncommitted vote in Michigan primaries with an incumbent Democratic president on the ballot. Look, uncommitted got 13 percent. That's not nothing. But in 2012, where there was no big uncommitted campaign against that incumbent president, Barack Obama, uncommitted got 11 percent. Now, I'm not a big mathematician, but 11 percent and 13 percent are pretty close together. Yes, there was high turnout for uncommitted this time around, but there was also high turnout for the incumbent president, Joe Biden, in what was really a primary in which we all knew he was going to win.

Well, it's a little bit among those somewhat liberals at 87 points. But really where it is, it's among moderate Democrats. Look at this. This margin right here, 73 points. I look back in the polls back in 2020, those exit polls, a Pew research validated survey, and that margin was closer to 85. So, we've seen a double-digit decline among moderate Democrats.

You even have African Americans coming towards Donald Trump. So, I think both parties, actually, John, are dealing with -- I don't know if unwieldy is the right word, but certainly shifting and drifting coalitions that's different than what we have been sort of analyzing for the last, you know, 20 or 30 years as it relates to presidential campaigns.If I may respond to Bakari. Joe Biden has some problems. I don't know if he has problems on the left. Thats Bakari's department. But in the middle, he has problems. Immigration is a problem. Inflation is a problem. Just general economic anxiety is a problem. And Bakari knows it.

These two candidates are so entrenched, people have their opinions about Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Not much is going to move. And so when you ask a question like, does he have problems with the left or the center, I don't really think that matters because this is not a persuasion election. This is purely a geo (ph) TV race. It's whether or not individuals will be motivated to come out and vote for their respective candidates, or they'll vote for the couch. So, whether or not he has a problem in the middle or the left may be squishy, I think it's decently moot.
