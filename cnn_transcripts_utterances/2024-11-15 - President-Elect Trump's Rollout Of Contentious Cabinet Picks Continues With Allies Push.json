      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Isa Soares. Tonight, President-electTrump's rollout of contentious cabinet picks continues with allies pushing for controversial Republican Kash Patel to head the FBI. Plus, Trump picks vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services as the Trump team braces for confirmation fights over some cabinet picks. And heavy strikes continue in Lebanon as diplomatic efforts to end the Israel-Hezbollah war intensify. We'll have the latest. With the author of a book Donald Trump called a \"Roadmap to End the Deep States Reign\" is reportedly being considered to lead the FBI. CNN has learned that the President-elect is weighing whether to fire FBI chief Christopher Wray and replace him with fierce loyalist Kash Patel. Right wing allies are reportedly making a push for Patel, who is a former Defense Department official. Patel has long repeated baseless claims about Intelligence agencies unlawfully targeting Donald Trump. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he wants to make America healthy again. But critics say Donald Trump's choice for Health and Human Services Secretary could be a prescription for disaster. Kennedy has a history of being an anti-vaxxer, falsely claiming, for example, that vaccines cause cancer. If confirmed, he would oversee the agencies that regulate food and medicine here in the U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson says he will strongly suggest that an Ethics Committee report on Trump's pick for Attorney General not be released. Gaetz resigned his seat just before the committee was due to unveil its findings over allegations of sex trafficking against him. He denies any wrongdoing. Well, let's take a closer look at some of Donald Trump's selections with CNN's Tom Foreman. Good to see you, Tom. So, let's start with Gaetz. So, the House Ethics Committee was meant to meet today about Matt Gaetz, who is, of course, accused of sex trafficking and sex with a minor. Of course, he denies those. But the Ethics Committee canceled that after he was named or picked to be Donald Trump's Attorney General to lead the Justice Department. What is the Ethics Committee saying about why they canceled that meeting?",

The minute he resigns, he's no longer a member of Congress, he's on his way. Well, that's enough for the speaker of the House, apparently who says, well, you know, we're not going to break that precedent. It would be a terrible precedent to break that. Members of the Senate, both Republican and Democrat are saying, no, this is much too important of a decision for us to not have the information from this report. We should be able to see it in some fashion. Now, could there be some kind of release that was done privately, not made generally available to the public? I suppose, although it's my belief that this report will wind up in public and somehow or another anyway. But we'll find out if that's the case. But that's the rationale for all of this.

The \"New York Times\" is reporting that Musk met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the U.N. The papers report cited two Iranian officials who said that the discussion was focused on ways to try to ease the decades long tensions between the two nations. A U.S. official telling CNN that the Biden administration was not made aware of that meeting. And Jared Kushner is once again expected to play an important role in the Middle East policy for the Trump administration. Some regional diplomats and Trump allies tell CNN that Trump's son-in-law is not likely to take on a formal position, but will probably serve as an outsider Middle East adviser. An Israeli source says Kushner developed and maintained friendships with leaders throughout the region, areas where he has significant financial interests. He played a major role in forging the Abraham Accords which normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Well, diplomatic efforts to end the Israel-Hezbollah war are intensifying today. Sources telling CNN that Hezbollah is considering a joint U.S.-Israeli ceasefire proposal that was relayed to the Lebanese government. But even amid those efforts, Israel is keeping up airstrikes on Lebanon, targeting southern Beirut for the fourth straight day. A state-run media -- state-run media in Syria also reports that new Israeli attacks are happening in Damascus, a day after an Israeli strike reportedly killed 15 people in the capital including women and children. Well, a special U.N. committee has found that Israel's warfare in Gaza is consistent with the characteristics of genocide. It accuses Israel of intentionally causing mass civilian casualties and using starvation as a weapon of war. The committee is expected to present the report to the U.N. General Assembly on Monday. CNN is reaching out to Israel for comment. The U.S. State Department says unequivocally, it disagrees with the report. Our Melissa Bell is following all these developments and joins us tonight from Paris. Good to have you with us, Melissa. So, let's start with those airstrikes in Lebanon for the fourth day in a row. It's not only costing lives, but of course, livelihoods. We did hear from the World Bank today estimating that the war there has cost Lebanon $8.5 billion. What more can you tell us?",

Mr. Scholz held his first phone call with Vladimir Putin since 2022. This amid fears that the U.S. will pull its support for Ukraine under a new Trump White House. Scholz, who initiated the call, condemned Russian aggression towards Ukraine and urged for peace talks. The Kremlin says any agreement would have to recognize what it calls new territorial realities. Well, \"Reuters\" reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Scholz about speaking with Mr. Putin, saying it would help the Russian President by reducing his isolation. Well, let's talk more about how U.S. foreign policy might change under Trump's upcoming administration.

The fate of Ukraine, peace in the Middle East, competition with China and the broader question of America's role in the world. When we look at the people that Trump has selected or picked so far for his cabinet, overall, what does that selection tell you?",

      "sentences": "Well, that -- I mean, there are a range of interesting characters that we're learning about. Some of the selections are China hawks. So, youlook at Marco Rubio for Secretary of State, Mike Waltz for national security adviser. They are demonstrated China hawks who have a long history of, you know, a tough rhetoric on China wanting to re-orient U.S. foreign policy to be tougher on China. Now, the question is how much leeway will they actually have from Trump to exercise that agenda versus, you know, Trump's other priorities, whether it is more tariffs on China, whether it is -- you know, maybe even striking some sort of a deal with China. Remember, one thing that's very interesting to look out for with Trump 2.0 is that we have someone who is not an appointee in Elon Musk, who has immense sway. Who's been on phone calls with Zelenskyy in Ukraine. He met the Iranians in New York. He's showing up with Trump to lots of meetings, has significant interests in China. So, there's a lot that we don't know. Where I'm more comfortable going is what we do know. We do know that Trump, unlike Biden is much more transactional. He doesn't care so much about multilateralism. He cares about bilateral relationships. He cares about explaining what's in it for me in every single deal. He is certainly going to increase tariffs in a way that could be very disruptive for the economy. He is going to deport some number of illegal immigrants in the United States, which again, could have immense economic implications. And then with the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, I actually think there won't be as much difference as people are imagining. But Ukraine, of course, is an area that Europe is worried about because they really want and need American support.",

This is the person whohas zero experience in Intelligence and hasn't served on any sort of Intelligence committee. She has, though, been accused of parroting Russian propaganda.

That is the most important trait they have in common, and that means that Trump actually has a lot more power than you would imagine. A lot of these agencies are meant to be nonpartisan. I mean, especially the CIA or the DNI, for example, not Defense Secretary. But these are roles that are meant to often rise above politics. In this case, the very clear signal is that, that won't be the case. These are loyalists who will report to Trump and will put Trump's interests above all else. We know that much. In Hegseth's case, again, in a very sort of classic Trump way, this is someone who is very televisual, knows how to speak directly to a camera, you know looks the part in Trump world in terms of, you know what he expects or wants a Defense Secretary to look like. I think for the rest of the world, these things aren't going to be too much of a concern in part because many leaders around the world have figured out how to deal with Trump. They know him from the previous term. They understand that he's transactional. They also understand how to game that system a little bit.",

He tends to, if presented with a scenario in which he can sell a clear win, if he can put his name on a new project or a new plan, he's more likely to say, yes. I think there is now so much evidence from his four years in power and so many books that have now been written about Trump that, you know, all of these leaders around the world and their policy makers and their teams, they've been poring over it for a long time. So, in some senses, we shouldn't underestimate how prepared the rest of the world is for another Trump term. And also in some cases, you know, Europe for example, is terrified of the idea of a world without American support as a guarantee. Many parts of the world are not terrified. If you're in the global south, if you're in India, if you're in Nigeria, if you're in Kenya, you actually want a transactional American President who is not going to lecture you about democracy and human rights and is going to sit down and be willing to make a deal.

Well, turning to South Africa now, where illegal miners are in the middle of a standoff with police. The miners are underground inside an abandoned gold mine and are believed to be running out of food and water after police closed off the entrances which were used to deliver supplies. Their families left in limbo not knowing if they are alive. CNN's Victoria Rubadiri has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VICTORIA RUBADIRI, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (voice-over): Exhausted, but finally above ground. An illegal miner in South Africa forced to return to the surface and into the hands of police. At the bottom of this mine shaft, hundreds of others like him holed up without food or water. A bid by South African authorities to cut off and flush out workers illegally operating in a disused gold mine. Any miner who leaves is searched for gold dust as the government continues its crackdown on illegal activity in the industry. Nearby friends and relatives left to wait anxiously to see if their loved ones resurface alive. \"One worker has a wife here\", this family member says. \"She's just crying. We don't know how to help her. Her husband went underground in April and has been down there until now.\" Many clearly angry with the ANC-led government's hard line approach. One decomposed body was brought to the surface on Thursday. It's not clear how many others may have already died. \"We are asking for help from the government\", this woman says, \"so our children can come out of the mine. All we are asking is for their remains to come out.\" This is one of several abandoned mines where illegal workers, many from neighboring countries like Zimbabwe can travel up to 4 kilometers underground and sometimes spend months beneath the surface. Authorities are physically blocking any supplies from going into the mine shafts and detaining anyone who comes out. A mining community group told CNN, food replenishments had been halted for as long as three months, with supplies now running dangerously low.",

And that could lead to the measles and polio and other diseases we have eliminated coming back and putting people's lives at risk. In terms of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, the link to autism has been debunked in multiple studies between autism and vaccines. But in terms of just we often hear him talk about trying to get into these secret troves of data on vaccine safety that the FDA or CDC are keeping hidden, those agencies go through very public review processes. They post data as they're going through those reviews with outside advisors. You can watch the whole meeting of these outside advisors on vaccines both before they're approved at the FDA and afterwards with the CDC. And then as vaccines are on the market, they are continuously monitored for safety signals even then. And so, experts are sort of scratching their heads wondering what he's talking about, while at the same time very, very worried that what we have sometimes seen in other places like in Samoa in 2019, he's been linked to a measles outbreak there for spreading vaccine skepticism which he denies that he did.

It was a vote against our future, and it was a vote for likely their retirement packages and for their personal vested interest in that which you can't undervalue that but there are times when the larger picture really you have to focus on.

These terrifying storms that were fueled 100 percent by excess heat in the oceans. And we are suffering from this geophysical fallout of the climate crisis while oil and gas executives sow just a little seam of doubt in the science, enough for people to avoid their conscience and vote for someone who is going to go against most of our best interests in terms of climate change and environmental progress.",
