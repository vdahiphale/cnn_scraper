There had been much debate about whether Donald Trump would be able to be tried for actions he took after the 2020 vote, where he allegedly tried to obstruct Congress by using private lawyers, others to spread the lie of election fraud. That case is now paused. There's no work to be done on it. It is not moving forward toward trial. The judge did agree very soon after the special counsel made this ask. And we're going to be getting an update from the Justice Department at the beginning of December. So, about a month and a half before Trump's inauguration at the end of January as president again, where the Justice Department will be updating the court about what they want to do. They say they need to have deliberations. We know that they have a policy on the books already not to prosecute a sitting president for any criminal charges because he has to be serving in the presidency at that time.

      "sentences": "Victor and Amara, Pentagon officials are beginning to have informal discussions on how to respond and how DOD would respond if President Donald Trump tried to use the active-duty military domestically and what would happen if he tried to reinstitute an executive order called Schedule F that would allow him to more easily fire apolitical civilian employees across not only the federal government but also specifically the Pentagon and the Department of Defense.In terms of the question of how to handle the attempted deployment of active-duty military troops domestically or the issuing of an unlawful order, Defense officials we have spoken with say that largely relies on the chain of command. And that chain of command specifically following lawful orders and abiding by the laws that determine how they can be deployed. But it is a question of whether they would choose to resign or refuse to obey that order and how that would happen. Crucially again, it relies specifically on the chain of command following the law, knowing the law, and handling it properly. But the Insurrection Act, which Trump threatened to invoke during his first term as president, still gives the president a large amount of leeway into how and why he would try to deploy the active-duty military domestically. It has happened in the past, but it was used for enforcing desegregation or for the handling of, for example, the Rodney King riots. Trump has threatened to use those active-duty troops in his first term to handle large-scale protests. Again, recently he has threatened to use troops to carry out mass deportations. Should he choose to do that and use active-duty military troops in a domestic law enforcement capacity, that in and of itself would be quite unprecedented for that use. So that's something the Pentagon is beginning to game out essentially to look at the possibilities. There is also the possibility that he reinstitutes Schedule F, and that would reclassify a number of apolitical civilian employees in a way that would make them more easily fireable. Crucially that could also disrupt the day-to-day operations of the building. The Pentagon is of course a very large organization that relies on that apolitical civilian population and the number of employees simply to function on a day-to-day basis. So, the Pentagon having those conversations about the questions and crucially the concerns. Victor and Amara?",

So, Democrats are hopeful that Republicans will not try to claw that back because some of those programs are popular, but of course, they can hold those things up.Shifting to Ukraine, of course, the U.S. has provided tens of billions of dollars for the war-torn country, and there is a race right now to get as much funding and weaponry into Kyiv as possible before January 20th as the future of support for Ukraine is uncertain in a Trump term. Now, there is also an effort to shift some of that aid away and to alliances like the G7 and NATO. On the topic of environmental and climate regulations, the White House has taken steps to make those rules more legally durable. Of course, they can be rolled back in a Trump term, but there will be a lengthy rulemaking process to really slow that down.

I mean, Donald Trump has been reelected, he's President-Elect Trump now. And the task for the Democrats is really not going to be decided, I think, long term in the future by President Biden or by former Speaker Pelosi or by most of the Democratic politicians who are in the -- in the late years of their career. They're going to be decided by the next generation of Democratic leaders. And the big question is, who is at the top of the pyramid of the next generation of Democratic leaders?

I mean, he is just turned them into an offensive Juggernaut.The Cavs, hosted Steph Curry in the 7-1 Warriors last night, and they just pounced on them from the get go. They started the game on a 20 to 2 run. Cleveland was up by 17 after the first, up 41 at halftime. The Cavs, they are now the first team in NBA history to start 10-0, scoring at least 110 points in every single one of those games. They just wall up the Warriors. 136 to 117 to remain NBA's only undefeated team. Kevin Durant, the Suns, they only have one loss this season, and it remained that way last night in Dallas, tied at 113 in the closing seconds. The Suns, they miss here, but Jusuf Nurkic is going to end up getting the rebound, and he gets fouled with less than a second left on the clock. He hits one free throw to give him the lead. Then, Luka Doncic, he throws up a prayer at the buzzer, but it was not answered. Suns win, 114-113, it was their seventh win in a row. LeBron, meanwhile, recording the 114th triple double of his career last night against the Sixers. The 39-year-old, 21 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds in the 116-106 win. Bronny James, he played one minute in this one, and he is now heading to play for the Lakers G League team, the South Bay Lakers who start play today. A rough times continuing Philly though. There, without Joel Embiid, who suspended and Tyrese Maxey, who is now injured, they are one in seven on the season. All right. Some college hoops, huge matchup. Top rank Kansas and ninth-rank, UNC met for just the 13th-time in history. Last night, Jayhawks jumped out to a 20-point first half lead. But the Tar Heels, they came all the way back, actually led by three with under four to go in this one. But then, Kansas' big man, Hunter Dickinson, comes through with the big-time bucket here. Put the Jayhawks back up to with a little over a minute left. North Carolina now down three in the final seconds, going for the tie here. Their shot, though, no good. Kansas survives winning 92 to 89. Given Bill Self his 590th win, tied for the most in program history. And finally, 11th-ranked Auburn, well, they jumped in a plane last night to head to their big game against fourth ranked Houston today. But get this. According to multiple reports, the plane had to turn around and go back because the players were fighting each other. What? Per ESPN, the apparent scuffle was over before it became a serious situation, but the flight personnel still decided to divert the plane back to Auburn. They then did take a replacement flight late Friday. But Amara, I'm not sure I've ever heard of a plane having to go back around because the players were fighting each other.",
