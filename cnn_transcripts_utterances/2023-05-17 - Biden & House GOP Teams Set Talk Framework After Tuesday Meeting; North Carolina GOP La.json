Talk about a potential spending caps, and other areas of agreement between Democrats and Republicans.But make no mistake, there are still huge gaps between the two sides, and some major sticking points, including for example, on the notion of work requirements for some of these safety net programs, a disagreement between the two sides on that.

He spent two years in the active duty army, followed by 18 years in the National Guard. He had gone to Ukraine last spring, according to his uncles, speaking to the Idaho state minister in his home state, he felt a calling to do humanitarian work.CNN also spoke to a friend of his in Ukraine, another American who runs a nonprofit there. He linked up with him, or is doing humanitarian work and was also doing some training for Ukrainian troops, drawing on his own army experience. It is not exactly clear how we ended up in Bakhmut, perhaps as part of that training. We just don't know. But we know a little bit about how exactly he was killed, according to his friend, who ran the nonprofit. Speaking to the Ukrainians he was with, they were in a building which was hit by really heavy Russian artillery barrage. The building then started to collapse, and some of those he was with got out, some Americans included, according to his friend, he of course did not. We don't know whether he was killed by the artillery itself or the building collapsing, but that gives you a sense of the type of battle we continue to see in Bakhmut, intense, chaotic, street by street, buildings collapsing. Of course, you see this in the destruction in Bakhmut, Ukraine, the deputy defense minister says that they have taken around 20 square kilometers in the suburbs to the north and south of Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Russia continues to bring in new paratroopers, according to Ukraine, they are making some gains within the town itself. So this is far from over. And I think that in this context, a challenge now for the family of this American retired soldier is to bring his body back home for a proper burial.",

As Albert Einstein famously remarked, if you had one hour to solve a problem, he would spend the first 55 minutes just thinking about the problem and then, five minutes thinking about solutions. And at yesterday's Senate hearing on a high, they really highlighted the diverse array about the concerns of, what is the optimal framework for regulation as well as the impact of generative A.I. tools, whether it be copyright infringement, disinformation campaigns or the hyper targeting of consumers with apps-based business models of A.I.

SMITH:  For me, it was the question of, what might be safety standards for what A.I. models look like? Also, is a reasonable care standard a proper and fitting standard to impose here for online platforms? Essentially, what are the trade-offs that we are navigating here to not inhibit the growth of open sourced platforms, at the same time, protecting users rights, privacy and other community interests? And A.I. tools are often described as being both a sword and a shield. And I think that is a very fitting framework to apply here when we look at the discussion yesterday on Capitol Hill, that this technology could be yielded for both offensive purposes, you mentioned the military component of this, but also in the private sector, there are offensive purposes, defensive purposes as well.
