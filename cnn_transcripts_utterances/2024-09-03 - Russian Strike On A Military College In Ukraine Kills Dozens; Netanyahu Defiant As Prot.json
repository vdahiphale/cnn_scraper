      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we're following two major stories.First, a Russian strike on a military college in Ukraine, killing dozens of people in one of the deadliest attacks since the start of the war. We are live in Kyiv with the very latest this hour. Plus, doubling down Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, defends his strategy in Gaza despite days of protests, these are live pictures to you coming to us from Tel Aviv. This hour, I'll be speaking with the hostage family member about what he thinks the government needs to do to reach a deal. But first, this evening, we begin with scenes of devastation and desperation in Ukraine where the death toll is rising, following one of the deadliest attacks since Russia's full-scale invasion two-and-a-half years ago. This video about to show you from the central city of Poltava gives us a glimpse of the devastation, destruction really left behind. At least, 51 people were killed and more than 200 wounded in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling a ballistic missile strike on a military training institute in a nearby hospital. Rescue crews are still digging through the rubble, searching for survivors. President Zelenskyy is once again making an urgent plea for western allies to supply Kyiv with more air defenses. He's also vowing to hold Russia accountable for the deadly strike. Well, our Fred Pleitgen is in Ukraine tracking the aftermath from this deadly strike, and he filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Parts of this military educational facility in the central Ukrainian city of Poltava, almost completely destroyed, more than a dozen people killed here. The Ukrainians say when two Russian ballistic missiles struck, leaving those on the ground with no time to get to bomb shelters. Hundreds were also wounded, and a nearby hospital damaged. Ukraine's President irate. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator): The Russian scum will undoubtedly be held accountable for this strike. And once again, we urge everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror. Air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not in a warehouse somewhere. Long-range strikes that can defend against Russian terror are needed now, not sometime later. (EXPLOSION)",

While Ukraine's air defenses often take down Russian missiles, the consequences can be devastating when they don't. The strikes on Poltava were one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of the war. We were on hand when a ballistic missile annihilated a funeral wake in eastern Ukraine in October of last year, killing 59 people. And 46 were killed in Dnipro in January 2023, when a heavy cruise missile blew a giant hole into an apartment block. (on camera): The Ukrainians say the reason why the damage here is so extensive is that this building was hit with a cruise missile called the KH-22. That's designed to destroy aircraft carrier strike groups. And obviously, when it hit the building, it completely annihilated it, burying dozens of people underneath. (voice-over): Now, yet another mass casualty strike, leaving Ukraine's leadership angry and vowing revenge. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They're not usingballistic missiles to go into Russia, but what they are doing is from the President on down and including obviously to the Foreign Minister who I talked to, is pleading to their NATO allies, to the United States to give them the Patriot Air Defense systems that they've been promised, and that they need to give them the kind of weapons they need to fend off what's rapidly become the weapon of choice by Russia. These ballistic missiles to conduct the war on the cities. And that is really terribly dangerous because, they are so fast and it takes very little time between the air raid siren and their ability to get to shelter.

Can be used to fire, for instance, deep inside Russian territory on military targets that directly threaten Ukraine. So, what we're being told is that it's the United States and, you know, France, the U.K., the big donors, Germany who are much more reluctant to allow Ukraine to use the weaponry outside of their own borders. But as the Foreign Minister said, look, you know, we're not talking about targeting Russian civilians. We're not talking about, you know, having these weapons attack Russians. What we're doing is trying to have the means to attack what he called these killing machines, these pieces of steel or aluminum that come in the form of missiles. We want to intercept them to save our people. So, that's what they're trying to get through to their allies.

It certainly has reached a fever pitch in the last week or so. But beyond that, you know, look at last -- late last week, there was a cabinet meeting in Israel, the Prime Minister decided to bring to a vote this notion that Israel must retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor as a condition for any hostage deal. And every other minister in his cabinet voted in favor. It was only the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant who voted against it. And so, you can see that Netanyahu's hold on power in his right-wing governing coalition is as solid as it ever has been. And that is despite the fact that we are seeing these enormous numbers of people coming out into the streets of Tel Aviv and in the streets of other major cities in Israel. And it is despite the fact that a majority of Israelis say that they would like to see a hostage deal now over the other aims of the war. For now, the political math just isn't there for Netanyahu to have to be forced to change the political calculus that he clearly has made to this point. Isa.",

I buried four, old men from my Kibbutz last week, that they were alive in captivity and being murdered. I have here on my back still 29 hostages only from my Kibbutz, Kibbutz Nir Oz. We just suffer.

Washington is calling theattack a horrific reminder of the extent of Mr. Putin's brutality and pledged continue U.S. support for the war-torn country, including more aid in the coming weeks. Ukraine says the strike killed at least 51 people, more than 200 are injured, and as many as 18 more may be under the rubble. Meantime, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to hold Russia accountable and once again issued an urgent plea for western air defenses. Joining us now is retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He's the former director for European Affairs with the National Security Council. Colonel, welcome to the show. We have just heard in the last hour or so, I'll just say 36 minutes or so, from the U.S. National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, who said that more military assistance will be coming to Ukraine in the coming weeks. How crucial is the support? And do you think that air defense systems will be part of that, which is crucially what Ukraine has been asking for for some time? LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET.), FORMER DIRECTOR OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Well, air defense systems are absolutely essential to Ukraine's survival with regards to at least one area, which is the electrical infrastructure, the energy infrastructure. It's been a badly bruised over the course of the entire war, the Russians have engaged in a concerted campaign to drive Ukraine into kind of the stone ages with regards to power generation. It's had significant impacts on the power grid and let's say places like the capital of the -- Kyiv with rolling blackouts. So, that's -- the country writ large is kind of in a fragile place with regards to energy and being a modern society. And then, of course, there's the point defenses around critical targets around Kyiv with regards to military headquarters, political leadership headquarters, and then in the regional -- regions then to be end up being kind of a, you know, second priority because the air defenses are spread so thin and they have to focus on select areas. This end up being spread pretty thin in places like Poltava, which is not that far away from the border. And therefore, subject to potentially more regular attacks with different kinds of weapon systems. So, yes, they need air defense systems. They also are looking for, right now, the ability to strike out at some of these launch areas, including with long-range munitions, these ATACMS that could reach out hundreds and hundreds of kilometers and potentially strike the firing points that the Russians are playing. Those are probably some of the most urgent needs. Additional weapons and the rights to be able to use those.",

It bolsters the morale of notjust the Ukrainian military and the population at large, but it might not be entirely helpful in terms of the military objectives of the Ukrainian armed forces. They have a small bargaining chip, potentially, if they choose to hang on to that territory. But the question -- the real question for many military analysts is, would these troops better be used in defending the Ukrainian territory in the areas where the Russians are advancing, down in the southeast? And that's not entirely clear. One of the critical objectives, I think, of conceiving of this operation, it was to mess with the fact that this isn't a frozen conflict, that the Ukrainians still have offensive capability, but I think the military imperative was to somehow drain forces from the places where Russia is making gains. And so, far, that hasn't borne out. The Russians have maintained pressure, continue to gain ground in fairly significant areas in the southeast. So, this is a very localized activity. The truth will be, you know -- or the final kind of result will be how this plays out in the long run. Does it actually advance Ukraine's war efforts? And that's not entirely clear at the moment that it does.",

And I think that we have -- unfortunately, in the U.S., we have an election coming up, where we'll have a choice between somebody that is going to about face and, frankly, completely turn on support Ukraine and cater to Russia or we have a very good potential for the Harris-Walz ticket to come in, do a policy review, understand where they've fallen short, where we've historically fallen short in countering Russian aggression and maybe do more. So, that's the stark difference. One choice is just dropping Ukraine entirely and abandoning Europe, and the other choice is looking at an opportunity to do better.

So, this is an arrest warrant, not against Edmundo Gonzalez, whose only crime was to challenge Maduro with a ballot box, with a vote, with the hopes of the people. It is a warrant of arrest for the Venezuelan people, for the will of the people to change through democracy. Maduro lost the election and the only thing is keeping him in power is repression. He has detained, imprisoned over 3,000 people, around 30 people have been killed, shot by the authorities in Venezuela. He has shut down media. He has created a state of terror. And that's the only thing that is keeping him in power. So, this is an escalation, yes, but it's also a show of weakness of Maduro because this is the only thing he has left, which is power of the military.",

It's important to put into context that many of the leadership that led to this election are in prison now. Members of parliament, leaders of political parties, activists, even just grassroots observers of the election have been detained. So, this is all in the same direction to create fear. But there is an important date coming up, which is the 10th of January, which is the constitutional date for the swearing in. And what we believe is that there needs to be not just the pressure of the Venezuelan people that showed massively in the vote of 28th of July, but there's also a great need of the international support, of the democratic international support. Because autocratic countries have been quick to support Maduro. Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, North Korea have already supported Maduro.

They have the signatures of the witnesses of Maduro and of Edmundo Gonzalez. They have the signature of the members of the electoral board and also of the military. So, it's impossible for maduro to show any proof. He has decided not to show anything. So, of course diplomacy, we hope it plays an important role. So far, the efforts have led nowhere Maduro remains where he is. And what we believe is now -- it's very important to increase the levels of pressure. And we believe that there needs to be an orchestrated and coordinated effort by the United States, Europe, and the democratic countries of Latin America to show that they are willing to support the will of the Venezuelan people. And this means important decisions that the U.S. government will need to make around sanctions. The U.S. government gave license to Maduro to produce and export the oil through Chevron. This is something that the U.S. should reconsider and also, personal sanctions against those who have committed the fraud and have done the repression.",
